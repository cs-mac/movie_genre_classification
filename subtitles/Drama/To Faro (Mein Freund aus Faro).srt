1
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,043
Who is it?

2
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:31,086
It's Ripley.

3
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:33,897
The door's open.

4
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,139
- Believe it or not.
- I've been waiting for you for 2 months.

5
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,641
How are you doing, man...

6
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,353
Mastertition?

7
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,326
You son of a bitch, my name is Pogosh.

8
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:52,932
When did you leave Hamburg?

9
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,045
This morning.

10
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,211
- How's your wife?
- What wife?

11
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:04,903
- When do you go back?
- Today.

12
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,532
Let's get on to a very serious matter.

13
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,715
I think this is serious.

14
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,483
I sold one painting,
I'm ready to sell another one.

15
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,326
- How much?
- That's $2000 for you.

16
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:20,205
I told you I have a good eye.

17
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,926
Take care of it.
A new one is hard to find.

18
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:26,843
Don't you think I know this?

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,920
Now this...

20
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,531
I think I can get even more for this one.

21
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,006
I can use 2 of these in 6 months.

22
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,945
In 6 months I can paint 5.

23
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:50,218
Try to sell 5.

24
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,556
Two.

25
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,626
Don't be too busy for a dead painter.

26
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,797
You'll wear that hat in Hamburg?

27
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,940
What's wrong with a cowboy in Hamburg?

28
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,777
It's December 6

29
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,529
in 1976

30
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,462
There's nothing to fear.

31
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,640
But fear itself.

32
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,342
I know less and less about...

33
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,649
who I am...

34
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,426
or who anybody else is.

35
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,289
Even this river...

36
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,538
This river reminds me of another river.

37
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,781
<i>And... that river flows...</i>

38
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,433
<i>it flows to the sea...</i>

39
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,792
<i>where ever that river goes...</i>

40
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:59,390
<i>God knows...</i>

41
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:02,540
<i>that's where I want to be...</i>

42
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:58,678
Ladies and gentlemen, we come to
the high spot of the auction.

43
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,682
A particularly fine, later Derwatt.

44
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,181
May we see the painting once more?

45
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:05,225
Thank you.

46
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:11,106
There are few Derwatts left on the
market; this may be your last chance.

47
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,866
Lot 132.

48
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,720
I have several written bids.

49
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:22,266
I'll start at... 17,500 marks.

50
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:23,398
17,500 marks.

51
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,919
30,000 Mark.

52
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,437
I wouldn't bid so high.

53
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,481
Why not?

54
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:55,776
I'm doubtful of it.

55
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,247
What's wrong with it?

56
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,247
I had that painting for three days.

57
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,824
Look at the colors.

58
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,919
The blue's not right...

59
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,246
compared with other Derwatts.

60
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,836
It'll be a sure-fire proposition
in America.

61
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,864
"proposition" in America.

62
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:16,075
In Texas they'll be grabbing for it.

63
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,259
In Texas.

64
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,511
Yes, in Texas.

65
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,129
54,000 DM

66
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:56,964
We are still bidding.

67
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,305
58,000

68
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:06,509
Are you still bidding?

69
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,373
60,000 Marks

70
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,426
Are you still bidding?

71
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,475
62,000 Marks

72
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,268
Are you still bidding?

73
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:49,195
Sixty-two thousand marks, Mr. Winter.

74
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,587
- Satisfied?
- Yup.

75
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,238
- Congratulations, Mr. Winter.
- Thank you.

76
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,317
- How's Daniel?
- He's fine.

77
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,234
Are you taking the painting with you?

78
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,098
No, send it to New York.

79
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,164
I won't be back until after Christmas.

80
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,292
I'm going to the wilderness in Canada

81
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,120
No telephones, no anything.

82
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:41,409
This didn't reach our reserve price.

83
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,658
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

84
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,102
- Mr. Winter, are you satisfied?
- As always.

85
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:52,521
Although Johnathan doesn't like the blues.

86
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:55,818
May I introduce...
Mr. Ripley, this is Mr. Winter.

87
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,107
Pleasure.

88
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,567
Mr. Zimmermann

89
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,859
Oh ya? I've heard of you.

90
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,831
Let's go out.

91
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,504
You'll miss your plane.

92
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,665
You mustn't take that seriously.

93
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,132
Mr. Zimmermann's...

94
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,801
under a lot of pressure.

95
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,719
He's a good picture-framer...

96
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:28,844
but no longer a competent restorer.

97
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,312
Reason?

98
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,307
He's ill.

99
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,857
A blood disease.

100
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:42,365
Little hope of recovery.

101
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,617
Hopeless.

102
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,551
Maybe.

103
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,000
The treatment's expensive, too.

104
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:54,590
His wife has to help support them.

105
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,637
You should be asleep.

106
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,513
Where were you?

107
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,891
- What woke you up?
- The noisy trucks.

108
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,975
We're staying home now.

109
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:29,455
Goodnight.

110
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,901
Sleep well.

111
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:36,286
May I leave the light on?

112
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,677
Stop this drama, Tom.

113
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,196
- I've been waiting for 2 hours.
- To breaking into my house?

114
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:41,426
I aught to blow you away.

115
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,271
Do you know...
I gotta tell you the truth.

116
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:48,859
The only reason that I don't
is because someone might hear me.

117
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,133
I sent you telegram, Tommy.

118
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:52,648
A telegram, huh?

119
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,972
Now get your ass inside, you hear!

120
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:59,159
Someone who would look absolutely
incapable of doing such a thing.

121
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,803
Listen.

122
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:05,719
I know rock musicians.
I know lawyers...

123
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,295
I know art dealers, pimps,
politicians.

124
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,463
But murder...

125
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:13,885
I don't want to be involved.

126
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:14,970
Period.

127
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,111
It's not that easy, Tom.

128
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,275
You owe me something.
Don't forget.

129
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:29,973
All right.

130
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:33,726
This is crazy man.

131
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:38,361
Sixty marks, wasn't it?

132
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,729
It's a bit more, I'm afraid.

133
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:45,075
Mother left it to me; my brother
has no eye for art.

134
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,819
It's another twenty marks.

135
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,785
It will go into my bag.

136
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,034
Eighty marks.

137
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,961
I'm very pleased with it.

138
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:56,963
You're a sly one.

139
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,669
I'll put it up in its old place.

140
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,059
Thank you very much.

141
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,852
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

142
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,401
Eighty marks!

143
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:43,112
My German is terrible.

144
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:48,830
Make me a frame.

145
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,606
Frame?

146
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,048
You can speak in English.

147
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:00,592
That is good.

148
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:02,723
Well... I suggest...

149
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,567
This one. Yes?

150
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:16,231
Uh-huh.

151
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:20,964
Yes.

152
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:25,960
Compliments the picture.

153
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:27,745
How long is it going to take?

154
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,748
Two, three days, yes?

155
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,273
That's fast.

156
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,031
Gantner told me you were a good craftsman.

157
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:39,806
I admire that.

158
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:44,214
I've always wanted to be able to
make something with my hands.

159
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,905
But... well...

160
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,577
some people have it
and some people don't.

161
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:53,778
May I show you something?

162
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:57,362
You have to move it. See?

163
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,209
You like it?

164
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,675
Well, I give it to you.

165
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:08,408
Really?

166
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,120
Why?

167
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,215
You see the last time we met...

168
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,210
my behavior...

169
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,111
well I wasn't polite and...
I don't know...

170
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:22,975
Please...

171
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,332
forget it.

172
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:27,423
I don't like people who

173
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:30,038
buy paintings

174
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,065
as an investment.

175
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,109
Wow.

176
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:36,970
You count me out.

177
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:38,745
No...

178
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,234
I count you in.

179
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,850
I'll be back one of these days.

180
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:52,723
Not with the left hand! Daniel, no!

181
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,591
Jonathan.

182
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,338
...with the left hand!

183
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,328
Jonathan.

184
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,609
You were dreaming.

185
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,479
I was shocked...

186
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:14,137
"I was shocked to hear that
your illness is worse.

187
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,265
"I was embarrassed to speak to you
about it.

188
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:24,240
"Let me know if money is a problem.
I'll be in New York for three weeks."

189
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,822
That's right, he's in Canada.

190
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,408
Don't let him down...

191
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:36,122
"What are friends for?
You must not give up. Yours. Allan."

192
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,959
Written at the airport.
"...your illness is worse."

193
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:47,275
Why didn't he speak before? Who told
him? I should be the first to know.

194
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,275
BACK SHORTLY

195
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,485
My most interesting patient...

196
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,696
but I've no time to see you now.

197
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,366
I just need a minute.

198
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:50,538
At my last examination,
were the results really unfavorable?

199
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:53,410
You saw the test reports...

200
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:56,087
and we discussed them.

201
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:59,407
There are no alarming developments.

202
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:04,260
- Do you feel worse?
- Not at all.

203
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:17,193
It's just that a friend of mine has
heard somewhere that I...

204
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,192
haven't much longer to live.

205
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:28,167
Where did this friend hear such
nonsense? Not from me.

206
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,835
Your condition remains unchanged.

207
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:35,294
It's rumor-mongering.

208
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,835
Marianne?

209
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:43,267
Your wife's gone to the post office.

210
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:59,016
You spoke to Allan Winter before
yesterday's auction, Herr Gantner.

211
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:09,619
- Did you talk about me?
- No. Why?

212
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:16,549
- You know about my illness.
- But I'd never discuss it.

213
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:24,400
Someone's been spreading an idiotic
story about me.

214
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:27,779
It can't have been done maliciously.

215
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,563
Mr. Zimmermann?

216
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:10,176
Good day Mr. Zimmermann.

217
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,237
My name is Raoul Duplat.

218
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,527
You don't know me.
Do you speak French?

219
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:17,740
No.

220
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:19,090
- English?
- Yes.

221
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:23,502
You don't know me
but I know you very well.

222
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:26,958
I want to talk with you about a business.

223
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:29,821
Are you an art dealer?

224
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:32,485
In a certain way.

225
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:36,798
Let's go.

226
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:39,728
I want to show you something.

227
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:41,656
We take the Metro.

228
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,522
I lived in Paris, briefly.

229
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:50,449
I need one person eliminated...

230
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:52,282
possibly two.

231
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,408
What?

232
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,288
Now my cards are on the table.

233
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,179
You must be joking.

234
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,765
Not at all.

235
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,741
Where did you get my name?

236
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:10,481
Never mind.

237
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:16,084
Are you interested in 250,000 Mark
for shooting one man, maybe two?

238
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,422
It's certainly easy.

239
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:22,757
I don't know where you might
have heard that I am a gun man.

240
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:27,051
You must take me for somebody else.

241
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,883
No Mr. Zimmermann.

242
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,469
Listen...

243
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:39,550
We know that you are not
going to live very much longer.

244
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:42,838
- You've got a wife...
- Who told you all that?

245
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:44,295
You've got a little boy...

246
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,303
Don't you like to leave them some money?
When you'll die?

247
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:48,678
This is nonsense.

248
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:50,556
In fact, it's not.

249
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,042
Maybe your doctor didn't tell you the truth.

250
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:56,189
But you know, the truth?

251
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,755
Listen...

252
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:04,897
I'm completely informed about my sickness.
I know I have a blood disease.

253
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:08,957
I'm sorry, Mr. Zimmermann...

254
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:11,621
you are not completely informed.

255
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:18,534
But at least it seems you know
what I'm talking about.

256
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,977
It's your own free choice.

257
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,457
But it's a lot of money.

258
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,623
You could stop working
and enjoy the rest of your life.

259
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,336
I'm not a killer, mister.

260
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,665
Good.

261
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:33,580
That's just what we need.

262
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:36,288
Someone who is not connected to us.

263
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:41,444
The man I want you to shoot,
Mr. Zimmermann,

264
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:42,706
is a criminal.

265
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:48,632
- Belongs to the mafia.
- I'll stop here.

266
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:50,037
You're out of your minds.

267
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,815
You think about it.

268
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,787
I'm staying all day,
at the Pacific Hotel.

269
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,975
You're out of breath...

270
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:17,818
you know you shouldn't
over-exert yourself.

271
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:19,576
So you noticed.

272
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,199
What?

273
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,239
You left your scarf and cap here.

274
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:28,286
I wanted to ask you to take
the next sample now.

275
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:30,283
I was just going home.

276
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:34,209
Please, I'd feel easier in my mind.

277
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:57,779
Herr Zimmermann,
I wanted to tell you earlier.

278
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:02,784
In your situation there is no certainty.
No doctor in the world...

279
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,282
could guarantee you five years,
one year, a month.

280
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:25,974
Where could he have heard?

281
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,655
The doctor says it's all nonsense.

282
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:34,877
He says I shouldn't worry;
my condition is unchanged.

283
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,424
It's only a rumor.

284
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:40,880
Gantner...

285
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,253
knows nothing about it,
or so he says.

286
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:02,142
Daniel, my son.

287
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,195
Will he remember me?

288
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,601
"My father had a moustache."

289
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:13,274
"We lived in a house near the harbor."

290
00:33:06,056 --> 00:33:09,837
It's starting all over again.
The last time was three months ago.

291
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,439
Now it's starting again.

292
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:13,435
<i>There is too much on my mind and...</i>

293
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:17,195
<i>there is nothing I can say...</i>

294
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:22,077
<i>There is too much on my mind and...</i>

295
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:26,450
<i>there is nothing I can do.</i>

296
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:44,294
Good morning Mr. Zimmermann,
I was expecting your call.

297
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,866
Don't say anything.

298
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:49,620
Listen, I have a proposition for you...

299
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:54,913
Come to Paris and see a doctor
to get a new opinion about your...

300
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,806
state of health.

301
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,986
I already made a date for you...

302
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:01,081
with a hemotologist.

303
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,888
There is no obligation for you.

304
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:07,262
Take the first flight tomorrow
morning at 7 o'clock.

305
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,962
That's why I sent you the money.

306
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:17,317
I was on my way to you.
How were the tests?

307
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,941
The results can't be ready yet.

308
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:24,491
We only sent the samples to
the laboratory this morning.

309
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:31,285
- Perhaps they're ready.
- Check with me in two days.

310
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,223
Two days.

311
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,586
You could telephone now.

312
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:43,476
It's pointless... there are no results yet.
Sometimes I can't make you out.

313
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,684
Anyway, the results will be
the same as the last.

314
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,859
What if they're worse?

315
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,525
Sometimes I think you'd like that.

316
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,108
I'm going to Paris.

317
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:36,405
Why?

318
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:40,861
A client has got me an appointment
at the American Hospital.

319
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,958
They have specialists.

320
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:46,376
- You're leaving tonight?
- Tomorrow morning.

321
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:49,090
Very early.

322
00:38:49,383 --> 00:38:51,791
The flight is at 7:30.

323
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,093
All because of the telegram?

324
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:06,888
It worried me very much.

325
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,070
I'd like to know how things really are.

326
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,784
If I put it off, I'll never do it.

327
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:17,405
Suppose the telegram
wasn't from Allan?

328
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,887
Who else would have sent it?

329
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,760
Wake up, Mr. Zimmermann.

330
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,502
Excuse me, I'm late.

331
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:03,561
You had a good flight?
You feeling well?

332
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:07,075
I took the appointment for you
at 10 o'clock at the hospital.

333
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,695
You have no more time to loose.

334
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,552
Rodolphe studies medicine.
He will stay with you and help you.

335
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,116
If there should there be any problems.

336
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,752
We go to the American Hospital.

337
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:40,284
It's the best one in Paris.

338
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:41,711
World famous.

339
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,499
Good nurses got there...

340
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:46,012
should get them too.

341
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,072
I don't intend to die here.

342
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:56,198
I think it's normal to see another doctor...

343
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,206
in such a serious case.

344
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,306
Mommy, shall I answer it?

345
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:11,308
Ask who it is.

346
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:18,600
No, only my mother.

347
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:20,979
The doctor.

348
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:23,389
I'm coming.

349
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:27,257
She isn't here yet; she's just coming.

350
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:34,540
Idiot, you look in the side,
not the top.

351
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:36,163
Idiot yourself!

352
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:51,051
Daniel, be careful with those things.

353
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:52,095
Dr. Gabriel?

354
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:58,069
No, he isn't here today, he's in Paris.

355
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:02,030
I thought you knew about it.

356
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:10,705
Any message for him?

357
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:20,453
When was he first diagnosed?

358
00:43:21,652 --> 00:43:24,281
1971. No... 1972.

359
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:25,807
And you've had regular treatments?

360
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,656
No.

361
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:30,231
Where are you from?

362
00:43:30,863 --> 00:43:32,124
Hamburg.

363
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:34,927
Northern Germany.

364
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,484
Is the Reeperbahn still as exciting?

365
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,453
Are you Swiss?

366
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:44,908
I studied in Berne.
But you're Swiss, too.

367
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,411
From Zürichhegel.

368
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,712
Then you can stand a lot.

369
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:54,922
Because I'm afraid this is going
to be painful in any language.

370
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,010
Yes, I know.

371
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:58,572
Let's do it.

372
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:39,789
Have you thought about the other affair?

373
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:42,191
The proposition
I made in Hamburg?

374
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:46,058
Well, I did not change my mind.

375
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,275
I will tell you have left.

376
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:52,114
Now, we take you to your hotel.

377
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:25,095
I'm going to hang a sign up

378
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:27,195
What's it going to say, I'm still alive?

379
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,283
No.

380
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:30,986
Deliver me from evil.

381
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:36,849
You're right, I'm dead and doing very well.

382
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:40,892
Andrew Pogosh Jerimiah.

383
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,832
I am alive.

384
00:46:43,227 --> 00:46:44,803
You changed the blue.

385
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,599
- What do you mean?
- The last painting I sold...

386
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:50,305
you changed the blue.

387
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:52,176
It's different than any of the others.

388
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:53,199
How could you tell?

389
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,031
Oh, I couldn't tell.

390
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,162
I got got a friend in Hamburg
who told me that.

391
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,644
Did you have any trouble selling it?

392
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:03,353
None at all.

393
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,654
So...

394
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,201
just means he has a better eye
than you have, that's all.

395
00:47:11,638 --> 00:47:14,607
Not for very much longer, I'm afraid.

396
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:31,054
- Hello, Jonathan?
- Hello.

397
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:34,029
I've got the report from the hospital.

398
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:36,923
I told them to work it out
as soon as possible.

399
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,010
Already?

400
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,368
Yes.

401
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:40,411
A first summary.

402
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,939
Oh, God. What is it?

403
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:46,528
- Why don't you come to my apartment?
- Okay.

404
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,798
On the other side of the river.

405
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:52,138
If you look out of your window,
you can see it.

406
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:55,178
It's the modern building
on the left of the bridge.

407
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:56,560
The third floor.

408
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:58,885
I'm wearing a white...

409
00:47:58,886 --> 00:48:01,374
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can see you.

410
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:04,610
All right Jonathan, see you later.

411
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,383
I read it Jonathan.

412
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:55,423
I'm deeply sorry.

413
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:28,095
You look pale.

414
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:30,946
You better take this.

415
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:35,509
It will calm you down.

416
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,605
- I am very calm.
- Take it.

417
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:56,275
This is the man.

418
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:57,712
His name is... Ingraham

419
00:49:59,347 --> 00:50:02,005
An American Jew from New Jersey.

420
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:03,546
A killer.

421
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:06,079
You wouldn't guess it
just from the photograph.

422
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:20,592
Nobody could recognize
an ordinary looking man...

423
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:23,096
in a subway crowd.

424
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:26,168
- Just from a single photograph.
- Of course not.

425
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,306
Rodolphe is coming with you.

426
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:31,709
He will show him to you.

427
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,560
The best opportunity in Metro station...

428
00:50:36,235 --> 00:50:39,424
where he changes from one line into another.

429
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,353
You go into the... and shoot like this.

430
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:48,621
And after the shot, don't run away.

431
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:50,907
Take it easy.

432
00:50:50,908 --> 00:50:54,536
Just move like a normal passenger. Okay?

433
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:29,206
Have you hurt yourself?

434
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:01,050
Thank you.

435
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,343
What's wrong with you?

436
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,107
I'm confused.

437
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,840
Don't try to be a nice guy.

438
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:10,803
I want to go home.

439
01:03:10,804 --> 01:03:12,768
Let me love you for your money.

440
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:17,270
I'm confused.

441
01:03:19,654 --> 01:03:22,755
Close the doors,
don't come in through the windows.

442
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:35,411
A little older, a little more confused.

443
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:47,748
You better watch your step, cowboy.

444
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,376
Strange.

445
01:03:55,392 --> 01:03:58,451
You say he was shot? Subway?

446
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:00,517
In Paris?

447
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,886
No, I didn't have anything to do with it

448
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:04,974
Mona!

449
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,538
Can you repeat that?

450
01:04:06,894 --> 01:04:07,937
Yes.

451
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:10,771
I can't hear you.

452
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:15,006
Speak a little louder.
Make it plainer.

453
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:18,188
All right, I can hear you now.
Go ahead.

454
01:05:39,737 --> 01:05:42,310
We saw you from the window.

455
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:46,239
- I thought you'd be back this morning.
- I took the first plane.

456
01:05:47,328 --> 01:05:52,324
- Did you bring me anything?
- I'm sorry, I had no time.

457
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:56,333
- Have you been bleeding?
- Just a bit, nothing serious.

458
01:05:58,433 --> 01:05:59,477
Paris.

459
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:04,513
What did the doctors say?

460
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:09,717
They can't say if it's worse until
they've seen my case notes.

461
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:13,394
Our doctor must send them.

462
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:16,346
Come here.

463
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:17,857
Bye.

464
01:07:02,569 --> 01:07:04,706
It's not my frame, I hope?

465
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,492
It's been one of those days.
For you.

466
01:07:12,888 --> 01:07:16,428
I'm sorry your frame is not ready. Yet.

467
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,173
- I wasn't here yesterday.
- That's all right.

468
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:27,529
- Cut your head?
- It all right.

469
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:30,665
I started to work on your frame.

470
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:36,855
- Let me see it.
- What.

471
01:07:37,402 --> 01:07:38,446
The frame.

472
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,712
It's in my workshop.

473
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:43,675
In the back room.

474
01:07:46,465 --> 01:07:48,033
I like this room.

475
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:54,139
It's got a good feel to it.

476
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,085
It's quiet and peaceful.

477
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:09,648
Just like you.

478
01:08:10,484 --> 01:08:11,877
I envy you.

479
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:15,680
The smell of paint and wood.

480
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:20,261
Must be good to work here.

481
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:24,639
Then when you finish something,
you can see what you've done.

482
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:26,924
It's not that easy.

483
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:32,681
Not that safe and easy.

484
01:08:36,356 --> 01:08:37,749
What do you make.

485
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:39,533
I make money.

486
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,453
And I travel a lot.

487
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:45,650
I'm bringing the Beatles back to Hamburg.

488
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,096
I don't believe you that.

489
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,836
- No rumour.
- This is no rumour.

490
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:53,285
Rumor.

491
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,615
There wasn't time to tell you
this morning.

492
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:05,584
The doctors in Paris advanced me
some money...

493
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:08,211
because I'll probably have to
go there again.

494
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:13,924
That must mean it's serious,
or they wouldn't give you money.

495
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:18,387
They're taking a risk and so am I.

496
01:09:22,315 --> 01:09:24,307
And if it's successful?

497
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:30,196
If it's successful, then I can
live a few more years.

498
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:44,895
Hello?

499
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,038
I take the night train.
I arrive at tomorrow morning at 9:14

500
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:55,109
I have something very presentable for you.

501
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,460
Okay, see you at the station.

502
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:06,149
That was the Paris specialist.

503
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:11,441
He'll be here tomorrow on business
and he wants to see me.

504
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,611
He wants to continue the treatment.

505
01:10:14,914 --> 01:10:16,785
I don't believe you.

506
01:10:16,786 --> 01:10:17,829
What?

507
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:21,041
I simply don't believe you.

508
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,668
You went to Paris
for quite another reason.

509
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:25,793
What sort of reason?

510
01:10:26,051 --> 01:10:29,053
How do I know?
You never tell me anything.

511
01:12:26,074 --> 01:12:28,387
There's less than half
of what you promised me.

512
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:31,735
I told you that...

513
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:35,269
there might be a second case.

514
01:12:36,278 --> 01:12:37,903
Count me out.

515
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:43,296
I already made a date for you
with a specialist in blood diseases.

516
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:45,570
- Where?
- Munich.

517
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:49,196
- When?
- Tomorrow.

518
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:51,648
On a Sunday?

519
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,215
Yes.

520
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,733
It's a private arraignment.

521
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,532
I want you to take back the train
to Hamburg in the afternoon.

522
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:04,309
There is a man in the train...
I suppose.

523
01:13:05,877 --> 01:13:06,920
Exactly.

524
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:13,527
The first part went so well.

525
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:18,776
I will see the doctor in Munich.

526
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:23,038
I will be on the train.

527
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,650
But I will be sleeping on the train.

528
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:31,051
And enjoy the ride.

529
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:42,195
Did you read the papers?

530
01:13:42,524 --> 01:13:44,968
Ya. Congratulations.

531
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:47,003
To you.

532
01:13:47,509 --> 01:13:48,989
What do you mean?

533
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,610
It was your idea.

534
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:52,398
Shut up.

535
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,798
You are too sensitive, Tom.

536
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:00,930
You will do it again.

537
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,522
What?

538
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:07,114
The American in the train.

539
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,234
Belongs to the other organisation.

540
01:14:15,788 --> 01:14:18,509
You... never told me about...

541
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:20,648
the second murder, Minot.

542
01:14:21,106 --> 01:14:22,148
So what?

543
01:14:23,563 --> 01:14:26,797
It will look like a revenge
for the murder in the Metro.

544
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:29,285
And that's what I want.

545
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,817
Doesn't make any sense.

546
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,079
And it won't work.

547
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,524
And it's much too dangerous in a train.

548
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,513
This man can't cope with it.

549
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,716
Now, you get a professional.

550
01:14:46,013 --> 01:14:47,756
I trust him.

551
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,556
He won't ever do it.

552
01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:30,741
Framed.

553
01:15:38,674 --> 01:15:39,717
Your son?

554
01:15:41,715 --> 01:15:42,757
Daniel.

555
01:15:43,866 --> 01:15:45,159
Danny Dan.

556
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,604
Look what I found.

557
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:04,977
You turn it like...

558
01:16:15,694 --> 01:16:16,737
Well...

559
01:16:17,183 --> 01:16:18,751
- You like it?
- A hum.

560
01:16:19,014 --> 01:16:20,759
I'm going to give it to you.

561
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:31,882
Why?

562
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:34,765
Because the last time I saw you,
your behavior was so disgusting...

563
01:16:37,578 --> 01:16:38,829
You know what I mean?

564
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:51,656
- You restore old paintings?
- Yes.

565
01:16:52,013 --> 01:16:54,757
Some workers at my house today...

566
01:16:54,802 --> 01:16:57,202
badly damaged one of mine.

567
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,248
I'll be home all day tomorrow and a...

568
01:17:01,318 --> 01:17:03,270
Maybe you can come by?

569
01:17:03,403 --> 01:17:04,428
No.

570
01:17:04,429 --> 01:17:05,734
Tomorrow I can't.

571
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,541
I don't live very far from here.

572
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:13,075
No, tomorrow I...
have to make a little trip.

573
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:17,387
I see.

574
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:42,732
We really must be going.

575
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,230
Have a nice trip.

576
01:17:52,616 --> 01:17:55,454
Thank you a lot...
for your present, Mr. Ripley.

577
01:18:07,518 --> 01:18:08,851
A present?

578
01:18:08,894 --> 01:18:12,014
I gave him one when he brought
the engraving.

579
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:14,224
You seem to know him well.

580
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:22,367
It's December 6...

581
01:18:24,828 --> 01:18:25,871
1976...

582
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:32,418
There is nothing to fear, but fear itself.

583
01:18:35,037 --> 01:18:37,414
I know less and less all the time.

584
01:18:39,526 --> 01:18:40,777
Who are you?

585
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:45,783
I don't know who anybody else is.

586
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:06,851
Get out.

587
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,186
I'll have it for you tomorrow morning.

588
01:19:15,362 --> 01:19:16,931
7 o'clock in the taxi.

589
01:20:38,162 --> 01:20:39,204
Train station.

590
01:21:03,954 --> 01:21:05,960
I don't know the old one with the girl.

591
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:08,594
Don't worry about them.

592
01:21:09,815 --> 01:21:11,985
You have the gun?
And the other thing?

593
01:21:13,971 --> 01:21:15,496
Did I give you the tickets?

594
01:21:22,327 --> 01:21:24,903
My wife will get the money
whatever happens to me.

595
01:21:25,931 --> 01:21:28,463
She will Jonathan. For sure.

596
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:46,530
- Hello, a letter for Zimmermann.
- Thank you.

597
01:25:39,661 --> 01:25:40,704
Hi, Jon.

598
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:55,199
close...

599
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:59,342
Now looks like we're going
to have to finish this.

600
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,345
Drink this.

601
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:08,953
All right!

602
01:26:14,124 --> 01:26:16,793
A friend is in there.

603
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:20,330
He's sick... a friend of ours.

604
01:26:25,241 --> 01:26:27,861
Knock 3 times if everything's okay.

605
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:25,897
No drinking water.

606
01:28:51,422 --> 01:28:53,342
Tell me when he's back.

607
01:29:18,298 --> 01:29:19,340
Where's the gun?

608
01:29:19,341 --> 01:29:20,690
I don't know.

609
01:30:10,884 --> 01:30:12,082
It's occupied.

610
01:30:13,387 --> 01:30:15,426
It's busy.

611
01:30:17,517 --> 01:30:19,141
Ticket, please.

612
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,636
Just a moment.

613
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,280
You put it in the blue jacket.

614
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:12,742
Watch that corridor.

615
01:31:16,024 --> 01:31:17,067
Open the door.

616
01:31:21,549 --> 01:31:22,592
Help me with this.

617
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:46,132
Tomorrow at your shop.
Move!

618
01:31:46,217 --> 01:31:47,677
Move! Move!

619
01:34:14,277 --> 01:34:17,148
This time I've brought you something.

620
01:34:17,489 --> 01:34:19,197
What is that?

621
01:34:19,657 --> 01:34:24,404
It's a gyroscope...
that's what it's called.

622
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:33,375
Your hand shook, but you threaded it.

623
01:34:41,774 --> 01:34:42,816
Hello.

624
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:48,676
One minute, who are you?

625
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,301
I cannot talk now. Sorry.

626
01:34:55,489 --> 01:35:00,531
I've had enough! Who was that?
Your specialist again?

627
01:35:00,953 --> 01:35:04,239
I'd like to know the truth, for once.

628
01:35:04,624 --> 01:35:08,622
Don't tell me tales about check-ups,
not on a Sunday.

629
01:35:09,212 --> 01:35:14,503
I'm sure your sudden trips are part
of Gantner and Ripley's crooked deals.

630
01:35:15,343 --> 01:35:19,259
What dirty work are you doing?
What are they paying you?

631
01:35:19,557 --> 01:35:23,555
I've had enough of your
skulking, lying.

632
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:25,146
Please be quiet.

633
01:35:25,355 --> 01:35:29,305
I feel so deserted by you, so betrayed.

634
01:35:30,777 --> 01:35:35,487
The worst is that you're using
your illness to deceive me.

635
01:35:36,116 --> 01:35:40,067
What do I care what you're up to
with your American friend?

636
01:35:52,301 --> 01:35:55,422
Be glad you know nothing about this.

637
01:37:51,326 --> 01:37:52,576
This is funny.

638
01:37:52,577 --> 01:37:57,820
They calculated that between the first and
the second man, 4 minutes must have passed.

639
01:37:57,821 --> 01:38:02,340
You throw a gangster out a train going
80 MPH and then you throw a second one...

640
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,501
how much time passes between the 2 events?

641
01:38:04,502 --> 01:38:07,515
If the train doesn't change speed between?

642
01:38:07,557 --> 01:38:08,687
Right? 4 minutes.

643
01:38:10,748 --> 01:38:13,772
I guess you'll want some of the money.

644
01:38:14,035 --> 01:38:17,706
Keep the other half.
I don't want it anyway.

645
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:24,124
No, that's not it.

646
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,832
Why were you on the train?

647
01:38:26,877 --> 01:38:29,657
I wanted to prevent a second murder.

648
01:38:31,775 --> 01:38:34,132
But you didn't mind the first.

649
01:38:37,852 --> 01:38:39,508
You had a choice.

650
01:38:40,846 --> 01:38:42,848
I didn't know how...

651
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,850
insane Minot's plan's going to become.

652
01:38:47,322 --> 01:38:48,934
By the way.

653
01:38:50,378 --> 01:38:52,603
You did the job on the train alone.

654
01:38:53,588 --> 01:38:55,769
I don't want Minot to know.

655
01:38:56,391 --> 01:38:57,433
that I was in.

656
01:38:57,756 --> 01:38:58,797
You're alone.

657
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,661
You don't want anything?

658
01:39:02,232 --> 01:39:05,070
I wouldn't know possibly
what I can win from you.

659
01:39:07,839 --> 01:39:10,021
I would like to be your friend.

660
01:39:12,551 --> 01:39:15,478
But friendship isn't possible.

661
01:39:16,766 --> 01:39:18,772
That makes me feel...

662
01:39:19,602 --> 01:39:22,134
very comfortable.

663
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:27,119
Why did you spread...

664
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,251
this rumor...

665
01:39:28,252 --> 01:39:29,295
that I am...

666
01:39:30,092 --> 01:39:32,667
with one foot in the grave?

667
01:39:32,917 --> 01:39:36,894
You remember that day that
we were introduced at the auction?

668
01:39:38,011 --> 01:39:40,110
And you said "Ya..."

669
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:41,637
I've heard of you.

670
01:39:41,814 --> 01:39:44,565
"I've heard of you."

671
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,251
You said that in a very nasty way.

672
01:39:55,566 --> 01:39:57,222
that was all?

673
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:00,374
Isn't that enough?

674
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:46,254
Hello?

675
01:40:55,081 --> 01:40:56,124
Hello?

676
01:41:46,482 --> 01:41:49,816
97,000 marks! Where from?

677
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:05,622
The doctors in Paris and Munich
have made a bet.

678
01:42:08,548 --> 01:42:11,040
A bet on my life.

679
01:42:11,885 --> 01:42:14,507
Who do you think will win?

680
01:42:17,391 --> 01:42:19,384
That's the stake.

681
01:42:20,103 --> 01:42:22,060
You're mad.

682
01:42:23,564 --> 01:42:25,807
I get nothing out of it.

683
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:41,063
Jonathan.

684
01:45:43,307 --> 01:45:45,519
What's gone wrong, Jonathan?

685
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,014
What happened?

686
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:52,310
They bombed my flat in Paris.
Car blew up.

687
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:55,972
Did you tell anybody about me?

688
01:45:55,973 --> 01:45:58,846
- What?
- Something wrong in the train?

689
01:45:58,847 --> 01:46:01,038
Why are they after me?

690
01:46:01,648 --> 01:46:03,830
How can they know about me?

691
01:46:04,237 --> 01:46:05,280
I don't know.

692
01:46:05,591 --> 01:46:07,729
Everything went fine.
We killed the man.

693
01:46:08,882 --> 01:46:11,808
- And one of his bodyguards.
- What do you mean "we"?

694
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:14,283
Tom and me.

695
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:16,054
Tom?

696
01:46:17,332 --> 01:46:18,375
Tom Ripley?

697
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:20,256
Yes.

698
01:46:26,123 --> 01:46:28,162
Swine!

699
01:47:17,733 --> 01:47:20,571
Tom... it's me.
I've got to see you.

700
01:47:21,407 --> 01:47:22,976
I don't know what to do.

701
01:47:23,404 --> 01:47:26,662
- Tom, he knows, he...
- Stay cool.

702
01:47:26,838 --> 01:47:30,070
You know what I mean?
Because I'm coming right now to pick you up.

703
01:47:30,167 --> 01:47:31,648
Did you hear me?

704
01:48:09,152 --> 01:48:11,781
What you got there, man?
You take this...

705
01:48:22,356 --> 01:48:24,667
What do you want me to do here?

706
01:48:24,668 --> 01:48:26,413
Just stay in here.

707
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:31,246
From here, you can see anybody
that's approaching the house.

708
01:48:31,309 --> 01:48:32,898
Take care of it. All right?

709
01:48:32,943 --> 01:48:34,707
Because we know somebody's
going to show up. Right?

710
01:48:34,752 --> 01:48:36,414
- Who?
- Who? What do I know?

711
01:48:36,459 --> 01:48:37,808
You know, the mafia?

712
01:48:37,853 --> 01:48:40,019
I'm on the roof with a gun.

713
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:43,122
But I don't want to use it
because of the neighbors.

714
01:49:33,802 --> 01:49:35,240
Jonathan?

715
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:51,478
I brought you something
to keep you alive.

716
01:50:57,821 --> 01:51:01,317
Like this... I'm not going to live
very much longer.

717
01:51:02,706 --> 01:51:04,274
Give me a cigarette, please.

718
01:51:07,881 --> 01:51:10,194
You must be freezing out there.

719
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:14,103
I'm thinking about you all the time.

720
01:52:21,226 --> 01:52:22,268
I need...

721
01:52:25,102 --> 01:52:27,634
Sweet Jesus, light of the world.

722
01:52:44,822 --> 01:52:46,700
Huh. Ambulance.

723
01:53:21,455 --> 01:53:23,522
What the hell is holding up Angie?

724
01:54:28,272 --> 01:54:29,315
Just take it!

725
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,242
Come on!

726
01:54:32,387 --> 01:54:33,430
Run!

727
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,784
You have to drive the second car.

728
01:56:03,138 --> 01:56:04,181
What?

729
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,543
You have to drive the second car.

730
01:56:09,807 --> 01:56:11,770
- Okay.
- Jonathan...

731
01:56:22,604 --> 01:56:24,216
Move over.

732
01:56:27,011 --> 01:56:29,990
It's automatic.
All you have to do is start it.

733
01:56:29,991 --> 01:56:32,891
Put it in gear.
Step on the gas.

734
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:34,635
Steer.

735
01:56:44,108 --> 01:56:46,772
It's going to be a long road, Jonathan.

736
01:56:48,276 --> 01:56:49,625
We gotta make it.

737
01:56:49,974 --> 01:56:51,017
Shit!

738
01:57:24,138 --> 01:57:26,629
I've looked for you everywhere.

739
01:57:27,683 --> 01:57:29,059
Let's go home.

740
01:57:38,654 --> 01:57:40,148
We can discuss things.

741
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:43,238
In peace and quiet.

742
01:57:48,957 --> 01:57:54,711
I've seen the doctor.
You were deceived in Paris.

743
01:57:55,798 --> 01:57:58,715
Those medical reports were faked.

744
01:58:00,594 --> 01:58:02,635
Let's go home.

745
01:58:22,076 --> 01:58:23,868
You needn't explain now.

746
01:58:24,194 --> 01:58:25,588
Mrs. Zimmermann...

747
01:58:25,867 --> 01:58:27,173
It's all right.

748
01:58:34,226 --> 01:58:35,531
Mrs. Zimmermann...

749
01:58:37,016 --> 01:58:39,484
you can settle your problems tomorrow.

750
01:58:39,572 --> 01:58:42,781
And you have plenty of time.

751
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:45,382
We're in a lot of trouble.

752
01:58:45,383 --> 01:58:46,824
Help us.

753
01:58:46,825 --> 01:58:49,429
Baby you can drive my car...

754
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:51,742
Now, if you want to help your husband...

755
01:58:55,099 --> 01:58:57,572
you better drive the car

756
01:58:57,573 --> 01:59:00,403
and follow us in the ambulance.

757
01:59:00,623 --> 01:59:03,550
Because we have something we have to finish.

758
01:59:04,649 --> 01:59:07,180
I think he's too exhausted to do it.

759
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:31,391
Try to sleep a little.

760
01:59:34,448 --> 01:59:36,986
Where's he going?

761
01:59:37,243 --> 01:59:40,694
I think he wants to get to the sea.

762
02:00:36,718 --> 02:00:38,052
Oh, Angie! Can't win them all, eh?

763
02:02:31,231 --> 02:02:33,567
He'll never bring the Beetles
back to Hamburg.

764
02:02:34,896 --> 02:02:36,604
Shouldn't I drive?

765
02:02:37,023 --> 02:02:38,399
I'll make it to Hamburg.

766
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,269
Back to Daniel.

767
02:02:41,612 --> 02:02:46,025
One day you'll have to explain
everything to him.

768
02:03:09,893 --> 02:03:13,677
Marianne, it's getting so dark.

769
02:03:15,299 --> 02:03:16,343
Jonathan.

770
02:03:19,719 --> 02:03:20,762
Jonathan!

771
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:38,343
Oh well.

772
02:03:41,509 --> 02:03:43,997
We made it anyway, Jonathan.

773
02:03:46,823 --> 02:03:48,172
Be careful.

774
02:03:51,030 --> 02:03:53,782
Pity the poor emigrant...

775
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,043
whose...
