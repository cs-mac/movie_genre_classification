1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,480
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,080
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,360
After the game is before the game.

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
<i>Man...</i>

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>... probably the most mysterlous
specles on our planet.</i>

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,480
<i>A mystery of unanswered questlons...</i>

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from?</i>

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,440
<i>Where are we golng? How do we
know. What we thlnk we know?</i>

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,680
<i>Why do we belleve anythlng at all?</i>

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,840
<i>Countless questlons
In search of an answer.</i>

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>An answer that wlll glve
rlse to a new questlon...</i>

13
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>... and the next answer wlll glve
rlse to the next questlon and so on...</i>

14
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,800
<i>... and so on.</i>

15
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,400
<i>But, In the end, Isn 't It
always the same questlon?</i>

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,960
<i>And always the same answer?</i>

17
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,360
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes.

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,960
That's a fact. Everything
else is pure theory.

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,440
Here we go!

20
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,920
RUN LOLA RUN

21
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
- Manni?
- Lola?

22
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,600
What's up? Where are you?

23
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,320
Where were you, damn it?

24
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,960
I got there too late.

25
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,000
But why today?
You're always on time! Always!

26
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,440
My moped got ripped off.
It doesn't matter.

27
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Yes, it matters!

28
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
What's wrong?

29
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,520
<i>It wasn 't my fault, Mannl.
I went to get some clgarettes.</i>

30
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
<i>I can 't belleve how fast the guy was.</i>

31
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,040
<i>There was nothlng I could do.
He was gone before I got outslde.</i>

32
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,440
<i>I even took a taxl.</i>

33
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,800
<i>That dumb-ass drove east. They've
got a Grunewald St. There too.</i>

34
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,040
<i>When I notlced, It was too late.</i>

35
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,400
<i>I was so screwed up because
of our moped, I dldn 't reallze.</i>

36
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,960
<i>- Doesn 't matter. - And when
I got there, you were gone.</i>

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,360
<i>- It doesn 't matter now.
I'm done for. - But why?</i>

38
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Help me, Lola! I don't know what to do.

39
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,320
You weren't there, and I messed
it up. I blew it. I'm such a jerk!

40
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>Just calm down. Now, what happened?</i>

41
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,160
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay?</i>

42
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,600
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

43
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,120
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

44
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,560
<i>- Dld you get caught? - No, but
that would have been somethlng.</i>

45
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,440
<i>Everythlng went really great. We drove
the cars there, and those guys came.</i>

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,360
<i>They pald and that was lt. Easy as ple.</i>

47
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
<i>I got waved across the border...</i>

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>... and then theydropped me off out there.</i>

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,840
<i>I went to see that cyclops,
and he was flnlshed In no tlme.</i>

50
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,200
<i>And everythlng was on tlme,
ex cept for you.</i>

51
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
<i>You woeroe n't t hnoeroe</i>

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

53
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,800
<i>I couldn 't even call a taxl,
so I walked to the subway statlon</i>

54
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>On the traln, there was thls bum...</i>

55
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>... who somehow fell down. Suddenly,
these Inspectors showed up.</i>

56
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,040
<i>And I got out llke always.
An old reflex.</i>

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
The bag!

58
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,920
The bag!

59
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
The bag!

60
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm such a fucking amateur!
A dumb-ass!

61
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,920
<i>Thls could only happen to me! If you'd
plcked me up, It wouldn 't have happened.</i>

62
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,040
<i>I was so out of lt.
You're always on tlme!</i>

63
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,880
<i>- Dldn 't you call the next statlon?
- Sure.</i>

64
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>But It was too late. The
fucklng bag was already gone.</i>

65
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,640
<i>And that bum has lt.
That plastlc-bag freak!</i>

66
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>He 's on a plane to Florlda or Hawall...</i>

67
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,720
<i>... or Canada or Hong
Kongor Bermuda or whatever.</i>

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
<i>What about Ronnle?</i>

69
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
<i>- He 'll klll me.
- You gotta tell hlm.</i>

70
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>Forget lt!</i>

71
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,720
- Why?
- He won't believe a single word!

72
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,840
<i>I kept a carton of clgarettes
once. He notlced rlght away.</i>

73
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,720
<i>He doesn 't belleve anybody.</i>

74
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,440
The job with those Mercedes
was a kind of test.

75
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,600
To see if he could trust me. Shit.

76
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,400
How much was there in the bag?

77
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
- 100.000
- What?

78
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,040
100.000. A test.

79
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Shit.

80
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,360
<i>See! I knew you wouldn 't come up
wlth any Ideas. I always sald...</i>

81
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,320
...someday you wouldn't know what
to do. Not when you die. Sooner!

82
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>You said, ''Love can do everything.''
So find 100.000 marks in 20 minutes!</i>

83
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,960
At 12 by the water tower around
the corner, Ronnie said. In 20 minutes.

84
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,360
Run away, Manni!

85
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,680
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

86
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Nobody escapes Ronnie.

87
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go with you.

88
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,520
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes
I'll be a goner.

89
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
- Stop it, Manni!
- What for?

90
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,800
You can't get me 100 grand either!

91
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,760
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100.000 ashes...

92
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,520
...floating down the Spree to the sea.
No more Manni! You can't do a thing!

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,280
Shut up!

94
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,680
Listen.

95
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,560
Wait for me. I'll help you. Stay put,
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

96
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,840
<i>- Okay?
- You gonna pawn all your jewelry?</i>

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
Where are you?

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,480
In a phone booth downtown
in front of the Spiral Bar.

99
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,920
Okay, stay where you are.
I'll come up withsomething.

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
In 20 minutes, okay?

101
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,000
What the hell. I'll go over to
Bolleand get that 100 grand.

102
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
C ut it out!

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,200
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

104
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>You're nuts! Don 't do a thlng!
Just stay In that damned booth!</i>

105
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,960
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Have you lost it?

106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't do a thing! Stay put, I'm coming!

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Then what?

108
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll think of something!

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,720
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

110
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,680
- No, wait!
- What for?

111
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
I'll get the money somehow.

112
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm going there at 12
if you aren't here.

113
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,880
Okay. Who?

114
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
Who?

115
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,200
Dad!

116
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,800
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo!

117
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

118
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

119
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,600
Yes, but you're married too.

120
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,920
Watch where you're going!

121
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,080
Bitch!

122
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
It's worst at night.

123
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,200
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

124
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
And then I'm afraid.

125
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Me! Afraid of the dark!

126
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,400
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never even been afraid before.

127
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,920
But I think about us...

128
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,800
...and I just think
it'll keep going on like this.

129
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,360
That you wouldn't dare...

130
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,640
And then I ask myself
what I'm doing here.

131
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,760
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

132
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,040
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

133
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
Hey, you need a bike?

134
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
50 marks, as good as new.

135
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,040
No!

136
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
AND THEN

137
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,640
Hey man! I know that!

138
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,680
It's not my fault it's so much money!

139
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,520
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

140
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,080
Thanks.

141
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
Your phone card!

142
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,680
I have to go. Meyer will be
here in a minute.

143
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,000
Ca n we nm eet ate r on?

144
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,520
- Do you love me?
- What?

145
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
Do you love me?

146
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,280
Why are you asking me now?

147
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,360
Do you love me?

148
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes, damn it!

149
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,920
Then decide.

150
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
Not now.

151
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
You have to decide sometime.

152
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,880
But why now, here, at once?

153
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,720
Because I'm pregnant.

154
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Look who's here!

155
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,000
Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

156
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

157
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,040
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

158
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,320
Sorry.

159
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,080
AND THEN

160
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

161
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

162
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,000
Lola?

163
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,360
Dad.

164
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,360
Your daughter?

165
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

166
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,920
- Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.
- It's okay. I was just about to...

167
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
What are you doing here?

168
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,720
What are you doing here?

169
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Nothing.

170
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,520
Listen...

171
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
...if I told you I needed your help...

172
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,480
...more than I ever have before and
you're the only one who can help me...

173
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,560
...would you help me?
- You look terrible.

174
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
- Would you help me?
- What happened?

175
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,200
I can't explain now.
Would you help me?

176
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
With what, damn it?!

177
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,520
I need 100.000 marks immediately.

178
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,800
What?

179
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,520
I need it within
the next five minutes or else...

180
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,080
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

181
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

182
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Please, Dad! You've got to help me! Please!

183
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,440
- I don't have 100.000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

184
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,520
What about it?
It isn't worth 100.000

185
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,960
Please, Dad, I'm serious.
This isn't a joke!

186
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,640
Yes, it is, Lola!
You can't be serious!

187
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
- If you don't help me, he'll die!
- Who'll die?

188
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
- Manni!
- Manni? Who's Manni?

189
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,800
My boyfriend, for over a year!

190
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,080
I don't even know him.
Why will he die?

191
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
It doesn't matter!

192
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,800
Okay. Come with me.

193
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,520
- You're going to help me?
- Of course.

194
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
Go home and go to bed.

195
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,480
And tell your mother I won't be
home today or tomorrow or ever again.

196
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm leaving you guys
and I'm marrying another woman.

197
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,400
We're going to have kids. I'll try to be
happy because she only wants me.

198
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,680
<i>I'm so sick of hearing
''All you do is work.''</i>

199
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,600
<i>''You always play the boss!''</i>

200
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,200
Maybe I do, but so what!
You guys have no idea!

201
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,840
I'm so tired of being
blamed for everything!

202
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,480
Sure, Daddy's money is good enough
right? Well, not anymore!

203
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,640
Not anymore.

204
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,200
Besides, I'd never have
fathered a freak like you.

205
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

206
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,200
You're not mine.

207
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,360
Now you know.

208
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,600
The guy who sired you left
before you were even born.

209
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,320
Throw her out, please.

210
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,400
Conm e on! Get h e r out of h e re!

211
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,600
Well, we all have our bad days.

212
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
See you around.

213
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,080
My dear.

214
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,760
What's wrong?

215
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,320
Do you have the time?

216
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,560
This afternoon?

217
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
All right.

218
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,840
No, forget it. It's okay.

219
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
Yeah.

220
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
<i>Wait!</i>

221
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
<i>Don 't do lt!</i>

222
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,520
<i>Mannl, please!</i>

223
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,320
<i>Wait!</i>

224
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,440
<i>Wait for me!</i>

225
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
<i>I'll be rlght there.</i>

226
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,720
<i>Please.</i>

227
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
<i>Mannl, please...</i>

228
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
<i>... wait!</i>

229
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,800
Lie down on the floor. On the floor!

230
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
Lie down on the floor.

231
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,400
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

232
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,320
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

233
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,440
Open the registers!

234
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,840
Open all the cash registers!
Open them!

235
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,680
Open them, and lie down!

236
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

237
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,200
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

238
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,360
Lola, where were you?

239
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
I couldn't get here faster.

240
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,040
Will you help me?

241
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,080
Can't we just get out of here?

242
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

243
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,760
Why didn't you wait for me?

244
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,200
I did. You got here too late.

245
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,080
So, are you with me?

246
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,880
Put your hands up! Hurry up!

247
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Conm e on!

248
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
Drop your gun!

249
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,560
Hurry up!

250
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,800
Don't move.

251
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,360
The safety is on.

252
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,080
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

253
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,680
Kid, you don't know how to use...

254
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,320
Don't move.

255
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,040
Conm e h e re

256
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,840
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

257
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,800
Hurry, before the cops come.

258
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,240
Don't move!

259
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,680
Do you love me?

260
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,920
Sure, I do.

261
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
How can you be sure?

262
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I don't know. I just am.

263
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,440
I could be some other girl.

264
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,560
Why not?

265
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,320
- Because you're the best.
- The best what?

266
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,200
The best girl.

267
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,360
In the whole world?

268
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,720
Sure.

269
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,360
How do you know?

270
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,320
I just know.

271
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,680
You think so.

272
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,480
Okay, I think so.

273
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,280
- You see?
- What?

274
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You aren't sure.

275
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,400
Are you nuts, or what?

276
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,280
What if you never met me?

277
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,240
What do you mean?

278
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,040
You'd be saying the same
thing to someone else.

279
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,000
- Okay, if you don't want to hear it...
- I don't want to hear anything.

280
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,520
I want to know how you feel.

281
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,520
Okay.

282
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
My feelings say...

283
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,320
...you're the best.

284
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,600
<i>Your feelings?
Who is ''your feelings'' anyway?</i>

285
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,280
It's me.

286
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,280
My heart.

287
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,960
<i>Your heart says
'' Hi, Manni. She's the one. ''</i>

288
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,520
Exactly.

289
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,080
<i>And you say, '' Thanks for the info.
Talk to you soon. ''</i>

290
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,440
Exactly.

291
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,080
And you do whatever your heart says?

292
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,160
<i>Well, it doesn't really ''say'' anything.</i>

293
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,880
I don't know...

294
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,320
...it just feels.

295
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,920
So what does it feel now?

296
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,280
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

297
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,520
You aren't taking me seriously.

298
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,520
Lola, what's wrong?

299
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,280
Do you want to...

300
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,440
...leave me?

301
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,480
I don't know.

302
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,280
I think I have to make a decision.

303
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,680
But I don't want to...

304
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,480
I don't want to leave.

305
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,240
Stop!

306
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

307
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

308
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,320
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

309
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,480
Yes, but you're married too.

310
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,480
Excuse me!

311
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,680
Watch it, you stupid cow!

312
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Fucking bitch!

313
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,240
AND THEN

314
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Hey, you need a bike?

315
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
No.

316
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,640
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

317
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,000
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

318
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,480
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

319
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,960
Yes.

320
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,480
Even if it isn't yours?

321
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,000
Look who's here! Lola, our...

322
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,560
I'm in a hurry, please!

323
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,760
Please let me in!

324
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,080
Courtesy and composureare
the queen's jewels.

325
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Let me in, please.

326
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,400
A little anger is good for the heart...

327
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,200
...the circulation, the skin.

328
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,080
What kind of love is that?!

329
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
- If you hadn't neglected me...
- I have a family!

330
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,880
I can't leave a sick wife and three
kids just to please her highness.

331
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,000
Your wife is drunk
from morning to night!

332
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,720
So what!

333
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,560
What do you know?

334
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,520
Can't you see you're interrupting?

335
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,400
Hi, Dad.

336
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
Why didn't you knock?

337
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,640
What's going on?

338
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,880
What do you want?

339
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
Is she your daughter?

340
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Shut the door.

341
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,000
What do you want?

342
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,320
I need your help.

343
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,920
- You see that I'm busy.
- There's no other way.

344
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Damn it! Why did you
have to show up here now?!

345
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,600
I have a problem.
Do you understand?

346
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,720
Who's that slut?

347
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,200
That's none of your business!

348
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
Lola, leave.

349
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,600
Go home.

350
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,880
Leave me alone.

351
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,880
I can't!

352
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,200
Why not?

353
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,400
I need money.

354
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,120
Then get a job.

355
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,080
I will, but I need the money now!

356
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,800
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

357
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
No, I need lots more.

358
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
<i>What do you mean, ''lots more''?</i>

359
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,080
A whole lot more!

360
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,560
Aren't you ashamed barging in like
this? Can't you see we're busy?

361
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,720
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

362
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,560
Don't you dare...

363
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,880
What?

364
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,320
What's going on?

365
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,360
It just isn't your day today.
Doesn't matter.

366
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,680
You can't have everything.

367
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
You're coming with me.

368
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,240
Have you lost your mind?

369
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,960
- You think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

370
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,640
Kid...

371
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,880
...you don't know how to
use that thing.

372
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,480
Let me make a suggestion.

373
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,200
Stay back.

374
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
- Listen, we can talk this over.
- Fuck off!

375
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,960
AND THEN

376
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,400
Shit!

377
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,960
The combination.

378
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,000
Quiet!

379
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,200
What the heck are you doing?

380
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,040
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

381
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,400
The police will be here in a second.

382
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,200
You said they always come too late.

383
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,480
Bag it. 100.000

384
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,080
Come on, kid.

385
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,280
Leave your daddy alone.

386
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,920
You don't want to
hurt anyone, do you?

387
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't know.

388
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,880
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

389
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,400
There's only 88.000

390
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,840
I'll have to get the
rest from downstairs.

391
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Okay, get going!

392
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,840
Go, go!

393
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,680
Hurry up, man!

394
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,240
100.000

395
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
In there.

396
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,400
Bye, Dad.

397
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,680
I don't believe it.

398
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,080
You want to get killed, kid?

399
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,080
Attention! This is the police!

400
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,800
The building is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

401
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,520
What a ruckus!

402
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,800
Do you have the time?

403
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,280
Get out of the way!

404
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,880
Give me a lift, will you?

405
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,680
- Are you nuts?
- Wait!

406
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,560
<i>Wait, Mannl! I'm comlng.</i>

407
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,200
<i>I'm almost there...</i>

408
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,720
<i>Wait!</i>

409
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,520
<i>I'm gonna make lt!</i>

410
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
What would you do if I died?

411
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,560
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, but...

412
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,240
...what if I were fatally ill?

413
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,680
- I'd find a way.
- What if I were in a coma...

414
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,760
<i>...and the doctor said
''One more day''?</i>

415
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,320
I'd throw you into the ocean.
Shock therapy.

416
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Okay, but what if I died anyway?

417
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,800
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on, tell me.

418
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,760
I'd go to the isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

419
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,320
And then?

420
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,800
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

421
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,680
I know what you'd do.

422
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,000
- You'd forget me.
- No!

423
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,080
Sure, you would.
What else could you do?

424
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,320
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

425
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,600
It wouldn't be so bad.
Everybody's real compassionate.

426
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,280
And everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

427
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,720
You can show everyonehow strong you are.

428
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,160
<i>''What a great woman, '' they'll say.</i>

429
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,440
<i>''She's pulling herself together
instead of crying all day. ''</i>

430
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,800
And suddenly, this really nice
guy with green eyes shows up.

431
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,840
And he's super sensitive
and listens to you all day.

432
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,200
And you can talk his ear off.

433
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,520
And you can tell him how tough
things are for you...

434
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,480
...that you have to look after yourself
and you don't know what'll happen...

435
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,600
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

436
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,720
What?

437
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,880
You're not dead yet.

438
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,880
No?

439
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,480
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

440
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,320
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

441
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,280
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

442
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,760
Yes, but you're married too.

443
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,480
AND THEN

444
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,520
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

445
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,520
I bet you're sorry!

446
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,200
Fries and a sausage.

447
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,360
Give me another one.

448
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,240
I'll be damned.

449
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,080
Life's really crazy
sometimes isn't it?

450
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Come on, kid.
I'll buy you a drink.

451
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,360
You need a bike?

452
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,720
A special price. 70 marks.

453
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,840
Mr. Meyer?

454
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,960
Is everything okay?

455
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,880
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

456
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,480
Yes.

457
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,760
<i>Mr. Meyer Is here.</i>

458
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,080
- There's something else.
- Not now.

459
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,720
<i>Mr. Meyer asked If he should
parkor If you're comlng out?</i>

460
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,440
I'm coming.

461
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,720
This is the nicest present
you could give me.

462
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,680
I'll see you later?

463
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,720
Hi there.

464
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,560
- Hi there, Ms. Jäger.
- Hello.

465
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,960
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

466
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,000
Wait!

467
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,920
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

468
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,320
Yes, with your daughter!

469
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,440
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

470
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Shit! Shit!

471
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,360
You've come at last, dear.

472
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,200
Thanks.

473
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,760
Wait.

474
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,720
So I decided, it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

475
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,280
I work so muchthat
they'd never see me.

476
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,400
Watch out!

477
