1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:02,483
{\i1}All together towards victory{\i}

2
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:05,151
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

3
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:08,318
{\i1}For life and for peace{\i}

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,650
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,942
{\i1}Chile{\i}

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,400
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

7
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,151
{\i1}Chile{\i}

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,400
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

9
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,067
{\i1}Good morning, Mr. AnÃ­bal.{\i}

10
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,609
{\i1}Two bread rolls, please.{\i}

11
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,192
{\i1}Of course, Ms. Yolita.{\i}

12
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:30,817
{\i1}Here you go.{\i}

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,442
Anything else?

14
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,318
Some tea.

15
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:36,192
Of course.

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,901
Two bags?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

18
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,192
Just one.

19
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,901
We all have a reason to vote NO.

20
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,901
{\i1}No more poverty.{\i}

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,192
{\i1}This man wants peace.{\i}

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,775
{\i1}This man wants peace.{\i}

23
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,151
{\i1}This man is Chilean.{\i}

24
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:16,109
{\i1}This man is Chilean.{\i}

25
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,734
{\i1}This man fights for what he believes.{\i}

26
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:23,859
{\i1}This man fights for what he believes.{\i}

27
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:28,234
{\i1}They have the right to live in peace{\i}

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,567
{\i1}and work for what they believe in.{\i}

29
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,859
{\i1}Our nation will be great{\i}

30
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,609
{\i1}when no Chilean is afraid{\i}

31
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,483
{\i1}of any other Chilean.{\i}

32
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,109
{\i1}Chile will be great{\i}

33
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,067
{\i1}when everyone has a place {\i}

34
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:44,650
{\i1}in our homeland.{\i}

35
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,442
{\i1}So this never happens again.{\i}

36
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,276
{\i1}In war, everyone is afraid.{\i}

37
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:56,192
{\i1}Peace is achieved in democracy.{\i}

38
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,650
This is a voting paper.

39
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,067
With it, you will be able to express

40
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:08,276
your decision, freely and in secret

41
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,109
{\i1}on October 5th.{\i}

42
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:11,567
{\i1}Don't miss this event.{\i}

43
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:12,901
{\i1}Go and vote.{\i}

44
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,109
{\i1}Without hatred, without violence,{\i}

45
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:17,650
{\i1}and without fear.{\i}

46
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:19,609
{\i1}No more.{\i}

47
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,734
{\i1}Vote NO.{\i}

48
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,984
{\i1}Now the YES option will use{\i}

49
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,442
{\i1}its 15 legal minutes.{\i}

50
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,734
{\i1}This is the most important part.{\i}

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,901
{\i1}What's going on?{\i}

52
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:48,942
{\i1}A horizon of hope{\i}

53
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:53,609
{\i1}Born from an unforgotten September{\i}

54
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:58,276
{\i1}Made us masters of this legacy{\i}

55
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:02,359
{\i1}That we promised to defend{\i}

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,901
{\i1}A voice that flows like wind{\i}

57
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:12,650
{\i1}Makes the YES in our consciences grow{\i}

58
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,942
{\i1}We have a country{\i}

59
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,817
{\i1}A winning country{\i}

60
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:21,817
{\i1}YES! In democracy and freedom{\i}

61
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,567
{\i1}The people and you{\i}

62
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,151
{\i1}Pinochet!{\i}

63
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:31,151
{\i1}Makes this hope possible{\i}

64
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,609
{\i1}Today, victory has a name{\i}

65
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:40,192
{\i1}President Pinochet!{\i}

66
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,359
{\i1}YES!{\i}

67
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:47,567
{\i1}We want{\i}

68
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,984
{\i1}every worker{\i}

69
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,483
{\i1}to achieve their maximum{\i}

70
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,609
{\i1}to be always respected{\i}

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,901
{\i1}to become a homeowner{\i}

72
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,650
{\i1}and never again a proletariat.{\i}

73
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,734
{\i1}This is my commitment.{\i}

74
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,318
{\i1}Did you know that on average,{\i}

75
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,192
{\i1}Chilean children{\i}

76
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,525
{\i1}are today taller and heavier?{\i}

77
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,192
{\i1}A winning country{\i}

78
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:16,817
{\i1}YES!{\i}

79
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,442
{\i1}On July 3 1986,{\i}

80
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,109
{\i1}I was coming home from work,{\i}

81
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,734
{\i1}when they announced{\i}

82
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,942
{\i1}a peaceful protest.{\i}

83
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,067
{\i1}The bus I was traveling in{\i}

84
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,359
{\i1}was attacked by terrorists.{\i}

85
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,234
{\i1}Many innocent people were injured.{\i}

86
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,318
{\i1}I suffered burns{\i}

87
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,817
{\i1}on my face and on my hands.{\i}

88
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:40,234
{\i1}We could say many things{\i}

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,859
{\i1}after watching these horrifying images.{\i}

90
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,276
{\i1}But we will only say one:{\i}

91
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,734
{\i1}think.{\i}

92
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,859
{\i1}In the country of the NO,{\i}

93
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,525
{\i1}there's no respect,{\i}

94
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,567
{\i1}neither for your possessions,{\i}

95
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,567
{\i1}nor for your future,{\i}

96
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,901
{\i1}nor your security.{\i}

97
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,817
{\i1}When you vote,{\i}

98
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,525
{\i1}think about everything you could lose.{\i}

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,026
{\i1}Think about what you cherish the most,{\i}

100
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,026
{\i1}your loved ones.{\i}

101
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:25,901
{\i1}A winning country{\i}

102
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,109
{\i1}YES!{\i}

103
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,859
Our campaign is a piece of garbage.

104
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,859
It's appalling.

105
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,734
We're throwing our money away.

106
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,276
I don't think it's that bad.

107
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:40,567
It's more serious than the others'.

108
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,525
My General was very offended.

109
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,442
They attacked him personally.

110
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:46,984
It's a mockery.

111
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,359
How can we stop this humiliation?

112
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,109
It would be a scandal.

113
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,151
It would legitimize us

114
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,817
internationally.

115
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:57,109
That's what the referendum is for.

116
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,359
I don't understand

117
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,817
what the problem is.

118
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,109
The strategy's driving force

119
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,901
was its economic achievement.

120
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,525
It has nothing to do with that.

121
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:10,192
We can't fight universal principles

122
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,359
like joy or that dumb campaign,

123
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,276
a rainbow,

124
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:17,234
with a film about fruit exports.

125
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,901
We have strictly followed

126
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,775
the client's guidelines.

127
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,609
The two premises were:

128
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:24,901
that no-one would see the campaign,

129
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,192
and the president couldn't lose.

130
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,151
Minister, you said

131
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:30,901
the campaign didn't matter.

132
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,859
The president is going to win anyway.

133
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,859
Let's cut the bullshit.

134
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,984
For fuck's sake.

135
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,067
Guzman will from now

136
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,942
be in charge of the campaign.

137
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,984
It's an honor, Minister.

138
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:47,483
We'll deal with those bastards later.

139
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,359
Don't worry, Sir.

140
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,692
The NO film'll run out of steam

141
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,609
in a couple of days.

142
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:55,318
These people are using

143
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,234
advertising tricks, you see?

144
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,859
We have to work on one axis:

145
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,483
who is capable of governing,

146
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,276
and who isn't.

147
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,442
We must carry out an audit immediately.

148
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:09,192
I'm sorry, Guzman, but...

149
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,318
what do you mean by that?

150
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,692
That we're going to screw them.

151
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,609
Excuse me?

152
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,026
We're going to screw them.

153
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:26,067
{\i1}Our Father, Holy God{\i}

154
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,901
{\i1}today we bless Your name...{\i}

155
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,984
{\i1}The fraternal, progressive climate {\i}

156
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,775
{\i1}created by Pinochet's government{\i}

157
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,692
{\i1}has meant{\i}

158
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,692
{\i1}that in April 1987, {\i}

159
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,859
{\i1}Pope John Paul II{\i}

160
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,026
{\i1}will finally visit{\i}

161
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,192
{\i1}our country.{\i}

162
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:49,109
{\i1}Do not be afraid to look at Him!{\i}

163
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,151
Your campaign is a copy.

164
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,734
{\i1}Love always conquers!{\i}

165
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:03,775
A copy of the copy of the copy

166
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,984
of the copy

167
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,817
of the copy of the copy.

168
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:08,650
Fine.

169
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,151
We didn't copy.

170
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,276
You mixed rainbows, pretty people,

171
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,400
blonde children skipping,

172
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,567
celebrating I-don't-know-what.

173
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,901
A tall man who's 15 feet tall.

174
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,650
Where did you find him?

175
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,775
Denmark?

176
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,192
Who is that guy?

177
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,276
Us Chileans are small.

178
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,901
Who are all these people laughing,

179
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,151
celebrating? Celebrating what?

180
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,483
Us getting screwed

181
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,359
in the referendum?

182
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,775
I don't know where you think you are.

183
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:44,109
We should do something.

184
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,859
I don't want to fuck.

185
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,192
After, you'll make a scene.

186
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,525
Don't say that!

187
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,942
We've done nothing for years.

188
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,192
You've got a bad memory.

189
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:01,734
What?

190
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,734
Last time, you didn't want to do it.

191
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:05,859
Simon was there.

192
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,276
He was sleeping.

193
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,692
{\i1}This is a normal scene{\i}

194
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,734
{\i1}in the life of this man.{\i}

195
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,984
{\i1}At sunrise or sunset.{\i}

196
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,692
{\i1}He always works tirelessly.{\i}

197
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,234
{\i1}His time, his energy,{\i}

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,026
{\i1}the sacrifice of incomprehension,{\i}

199
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:29,067
{\i1}he gives it all to his initial cause.{\i}

200
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:30,942
{\i1}In his words:{\i}

201
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,817
{\i1}"For Chile, everything."{\i}

202
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,609
Don't get up.

203
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,817
Shit, I've got to go.

204
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,483
Why don't you stay?

205
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,650
I can't.

206
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,318
Simon needs you.

207
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,026
I fell asleep, that's all.

208
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,734
Don't get confused.

209
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:25,942
Go on.

210
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,609
Stay.

211
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,817
What for?

212
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,692
Did you pay the school?

213
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,984
Yes.

214
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,483
With my Allende Foundation grant.

215
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:01,984
Stop it.

216
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:06,400
Bye.

217
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:07,859
Stay.

218
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:37,026
We're pulling Pinochet off the screen.

219
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:38,942
You agree?

220
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:42,192
Let's protect him.

221
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,901
Too many soldiers.

222
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,650
Too many tacky women.

223
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:56,026
Tacky?

224
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,442
Too tacky, too fat.

225
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,609
Too many colonels' wives.

226
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:04,609
You don't have enough material.

227
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,442
Let's talk about them.

228
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:09,609
About the politicians?

229
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:11,026
No, them.

230
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,734
Their campaign is very funny.

231
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,734
It's amusing.

232
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,318
Shall we add a little humor?

233
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,067
{\i1}Say YES!{\i}

234
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,984
{\i1}Dear NO supporters,{\i}

235
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,525
{\i1}don't waste your time with lies{\i}

236
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,942
{\i1}and fantasies{\i}

237
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,567
{\i1}as you have up until now.{\i}

238
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,026
{\i1}To us,{\i}

239
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,192
{\i1}it is a duty{\i}

240
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,984
{\i1}to expose to the country{\i}

241
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,359
{\i1}some of the NO camp's lies.{\i}

242
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,650
{\i1}THE LIE{\i}

243
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,692
{\i1}"Mrs. Yolita" ad.{\i}

244
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:53,609
{\i1}THE TRUTH{\i}

245
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,692
{\i1}The protagonist was paid.{\i}

246
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,942
{\i1}She has 3 houses,{\i}

247
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,734
{\i1}and one business property.{\i}

248
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:02,692
God, how awful!

249
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,318
We're not going to respond.

250
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:10,276
Who is doing this?

251
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,276
OK?

252
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:14,151
I'm going.

253
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:15,483
All right, good luck.

254
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,817
Call me when you get home, OK?

255
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,067
It's really annoying.

256
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:49,359
What happened?

257
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,067
They followed me.

258
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,318
Everybody calm down.

259
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:56,359
They're just trying to scare us.

260
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,192
It's too dangerous.

261
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,109
Do we have any empty boxes?

262
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:01,234
Or tapes?

263
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,234
Yes, we do.

264
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:04,442
Here.

265
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,775
We'll leave with this,

266
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,318
all at the same time.

267
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,359
Let me go out first.

268
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,483
Hand me the original.

269
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,859
You're sure?

270
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,483
The National TV Council?

271
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:42,734
Come in.

272
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:44,442
This is the NO campaign.

273
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,400
Sign the form.

274
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:55,734
Here?

275
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:56,775
Yes.

276
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,859
And I'll give you...

277
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:01,234
a receipt.

278
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,525
Receipt.

279
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:05,109
Very well.

280
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,567
Sir...?

281
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:08,901
RenÃ© Saavedra.

282
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,234
Thank you.

283
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:34,400
Tomorrow's.

284
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:36,859
Thank you.

285
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:05,109
{\i1}TORTURE IN CHILE{\i}

286
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,442
{\i1}THE TV IS SILENT{\i}

287
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,817
{\i1}Those who have appeared{\i}

288
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:11,901
{\i1}number more than 50.{\i}

289
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,734
{\i1}All of them tortured by the CNI.{\i}

290
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,400
{\i1}These people have endured{\i}

291
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,901
{\i1}endless torture sessions,{\i}

292
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,942
{\i1}lasting days at a time{\i}

293
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,734
{\i1}and into the night,{\i}

294
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,942
{\i1}until 3 or 4 in the morning.{\i}

295
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,400
{\i1}They are then thrown,{\i}

296
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,775
{\i1}like useless pieces of trash,{\i}

297
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:34,276
{\i1}onto the cot in their cells.{\i}

298
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,192
{\i1}They rest for a few hours{\i}

299
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,234
{\i1}only to start all over again.{\i}

300
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,734
{\i1}Without hatred.{\i}

301
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,525
{\i1}Without violence.{\i}

302
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:43,984
{\i1}Without fear.{\i}

303
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:46,109
{\i1}No more.{\i}

304
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,817
There's a call from the CANT.

305
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,609
What is it concerning?

306
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,318
Good.

307
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,650
Don't worry.

308
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,442
Goodbye and thank you.

309
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:14,817
Tomorrow's program can't be aired.

310
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:15,942
The judge's section

311
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,609
breaks the law.

312
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:18,817
The judge?

313
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,026
You put the judge in?

314
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,567
We're changing nothing.

315
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:24,692
This is censorship.

316
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,942
We have to go on air.

317
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,109
Or people will get scared.

318
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:30,192
Let's hold a press conference,

319
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,483
and denounce it...

320
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,234
I'm sick of your fucking denouncements!

321
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:35,984
We must be more creative

322
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,984
and turn this around.

323
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,318
NO CENSORSHIP

324
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,276
{\i1}Chile{\i}

325
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,609
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

326
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:58,525
{\i1}Hello.{\i}

327
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,442
{\i1}Through these programs,{\i}

328
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,817
{\i1}we have realized{\i}

329
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:04,151
{\i1}that it's important{\i}

330
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,567
{\i1}to say things how they are.{\i}

331
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,442
{\i1}Expressing oneself{\i}

332
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,318
{\i1}and talking is a good thing.{\i}

333
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,609
{\i1}Censorship is pointless.{\i}

334
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,359
{\i1}Why censor?{\i}

335
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,192
{\i1}But for 15 years,{\i}

336
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,067
{\i1}a large part of this country{\i}

337
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,483
{\i1}was prevented from{\i}

338
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,650
{\i1}doing what we've done{\i}

339
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:21,775
{\i1}on this show.{\i}

340
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,734
{\i1}NO-EWS{\i}

341
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,234
{\i1}Public opinion{\i}

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,650
{\i1}has unanimously condemned{\i}

343
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,734
{\i1}the censorship{\i}

344
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,817
{\i1}of the opposition's television program.{\i}

345
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,192
{\i1}During last Monday's NO campaign,{\i}

346
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,567
{\i1}a judge was prevented from appearing{\i}

347
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,151
{\i1}who confirmed the CNI's involvement{\i}

348
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:46,442
{\i1}in over 50 cases of torture.{\i}

349
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,318
{\i1}It was wrong.{\i}

350
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:49,359
{\i1}Why?{\i}

351
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:50,859
{\i1}Because they are hiding{\i}

352
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,650
{\i1}what really happened.{\i}

353
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,984
{\i1}It's very frustrating. Very.{\i}

354
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,775
{\i1}You realize everything is fake.{\i}

355
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:58,775
{\i1}It's an outrage,{\i}

356
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,483
{\i1}a daily outrage.{\i}

357
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:01,609
{\i1}The government{\i}

358
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,567
{\i1}is afraid of us knowing the truth.{\i}

359
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,901
{\i1}They wanted to stop the NO show.{\i}

360
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,734
{\i1}It's unfair.{\i}

361
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:10,901
{\i1}It is bad.{\i}

362
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,692
{\i1}They just do what they want.{\i}

363
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:13,984
{\i1}Yet another injustice.{\i}

364
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,483
{\i1}It doesn't suit them{\i}

365
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,692
{\i1}for the truth to be known.{\i}

366
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,901
{\i1}Why don't we have the right to see{\i}

367
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,483
{\i1}what has been going on in this country?{\i}

368
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,984
{\i1}Democratically, we have the right{\i}

369
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,567
{\i1}to be freely informed.{\i}

370
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,109
{\i1}That's what I think.{\i}

371
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,318
{\i1}How are you, Saavedra?{\i}

372
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,734
{\i1}How's Simon?{\i}

373
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:46,567
{\i1}I like your little train.{\i}

374
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,151
Simon?

375
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:08,692
Are you ok?

376
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:09,650
Yes.

377
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,942
Hi, darling.

378
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,109
Hi, Mommy.

379
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:53,026
Hello.

380
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,109
How are you?

381
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:55,192
Here.

382
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,859
Be a good boy.

383
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,192
OK.

384
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,567
Listen to your mother.

385
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,276
Don't go out by yourself,

386
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:07,984
you hear me?

387
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,234
They're doing this

388
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,525
because you hit the old man hard.

389
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,276
I love you, sweetie.

390
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,942
It's all good. Congratulations.

391
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,151
Hello.

392
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,567
Did you have breakfast?

393
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:36,609
No.

394
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,109
Would you like some?

395
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:39,151
No, thanks.

396
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,984
If you need anything, just let me know.

397
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,609
You work with the YES camp?

398
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:17,859
No.

399
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,109
No, it's...

400
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,026
it's just advisory.

401
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,192
Did you see it?

402
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,442
There's a change

403
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,442
in the conceptual strategy.

404
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:31,775
Did you like it?

405
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,192
It's bad.

406
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,192
Real bad.

407
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,400
It's awful, Lucho.

408
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,775
It's a huge pile of shit.

409
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,692
It's the copy of the copy

410
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,734
of the copy of the copy of the copy.

411
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,734
It's all mixed together there.

412
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,984
How will people remember this campaign?

413
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,483
The employees made the NO campaign,

414
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,318
and you bosses made the YES one.

415
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:16,650
That's how it's going to be.

416
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:18,318
We're going to screw you.

417
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:20,650
So shut up, asshole,

418
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,650
and look after your son.

419
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:23,859
Don't threaten me.

420
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:25,234
I'm just saying.

421
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,318
If they want cash, let me talk.

422
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:28,567
Hello.

423
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:30,817
Hello RenÃ©.

424
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:31,734
How are you?

425
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:33,026
Shall we go?

426
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,400
How's it going, Pedro?

427
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,775
"Beautiful"

428
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:44,609
in a classic, powerful font.

429
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,817
And "Bold" in something youthful,

430
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:47,901
more playful.

431
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,609
Most viewers

432
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:53,192
will watch this soap opera.

433
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:56,109
What we want to do

434
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,151
is produce a marketing event

435
00:23:58,318 --> 00:23:59,734
to present the soap opera

436
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:00,901
Beautiful and Bold

437
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,442
on the Santa Maria tower.

438
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,567
We want to avoid

439
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,525
a typical soap opera ad

440
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,359
filmed with crappy lighting.

441
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:10,276
It makes it look cheap and ugly.

442
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:12,609
We want to create a news story,

443
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,525
and insert it under camouflage,

444
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,151
into the evening news program.

445
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,609
Perfect!

446
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,817
The girls will be on the terrace,

447
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,026
on the heliport.

448
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,318
All the actresses,

449
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:32,483
dressed in their best clothes,

450
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,692
doing a photo shoot.

451
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:36,026
We can reuse

452
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:37,734
the pics from the shoot.

453
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:39,567
We can use them twice.

454
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:42,525
We'll also have the soap's heartthrobs,

455
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,817
the actors, dressed like...

456
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,151
James Bond.

457
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,483
But with more of an "action" feel

458
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,192
and more modern.

459
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,734
We'll have

460
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,525
the models and the actresses

461
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:57,359
showing off their best features.

462
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,067
And a helicopter

463
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:01,151
flying around the tower

464
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,525
with the soap opera's main heartthrob

465
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:06,984
leaning right out with

466
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:09,151
a bunch of roses for the girls.

467
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,442
Wave to them!

468
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:25,442
No, the election is under control.

469
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,151
Don't worry, Guzman.

470
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,525
But they're making noise.

471
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:33,609
They could hinder any measures you take.

472
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,775
{\i1}They'll happen anyway.{\i}

473
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,442
Ensure their name is mud,

474
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,692
expose those clowns for what they are.

475
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:47,734
This will upset the NO camp.

476
00:25:49,151 --> 00:25:50,400
Who are all these people?

477
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,026
We couldn't find any artists.

478
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:55,859
They're all with them.

479
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,650
This is all that's left.

480
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,318
The bottom of the barrel.

481
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,109
That's enough. I'm leaving.

482
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,942
{\i1}The idea is that,{\i}

483
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,609
{\i1}no matter what your option is,{\i}

484
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,942
{\i1}or who you vote for,
ou pour qui vous votez,{\i}

485
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,234
{\i1}the important thing is what you feel{\i}

486
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,901
{\i1}through these TV programs.{\i}

487
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,692
{\i1}The lady{\i}

488
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,151
{\i1}will ask questions{\i}

489
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,901
{\i1}and the idea is to build a debate.{\i}

490
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:35,483
{\i1}The NO camp seem too serious,{\i}

491
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,817
{\i1}too strange.{\i}

492
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,276
{\i1}They talk about problems{\i}

493
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,192
{\i1}that concern old people.{\i}

494
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,734
{\i1}Matilde,{\i}

495
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:43,984
{\i1}tell us about the YES campaign.{\i}

496
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:46,942
{\i1}I thought it was too violent{\i}

497
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,650
{\i1}and underhand.{\i}

498
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,109
{\i1}Underhand...{\i}

499
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,318
{\i1}What is your name?{\i}

500
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:56,151
We need more testimonials.

501
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,109
No, more humor.

502
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:03,525
Did you like the NO campaign?

503
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:07,192
To make it more fun and more inclusive.

504
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:10,318
Be careful with that letter!

505
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:11,942
Turn off that light!

506
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,359
Pay attention for a moment!

507
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:21,234
Thank you all for coming.

508
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:23,359
We're very happy.

509
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,442
The soldiers will be proud

510
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:28,567
to see their musicians, actors,

511
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,942
and artists committed to the NOs.

512
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,901
We can shoot.

513
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,067
24 frames per second

514
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:36,650
with a 2.8 lens.

515
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:40,734
Closer, Marco Antonio, please.

516
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:45,525
Let's do it.

517
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,775
We must put on a good show.

518
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:50,359
OK? Show me happiness.

519
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:51,859
Sound?

520
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:53,483
Rolling.

521
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:54,609
Camera?

522
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:55,442
Speed.

523
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,984
36, take one!

524
00:27:59,067 --> 00:27:59,775
Mark.

525
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:00,859
Action!

526
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:06,318
{\i1}Chile, happiness is coming!{\i}

527
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,567
{\i1}This land{\i}

528
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,901
{\i1}was not a propitious place{\i}

529
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,775
{\i1}for warlords and strikes.{\i}

530
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:40,984
{\i1}The new democracy...{\i}

531
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:41,984
{\i1}Is it OK?{\i}

532
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,525
{\i1}Or not?{\i}

533
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,734
{\i1}No.{\i}

534
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:48,942
{\i1}It's no good.{\i}

535
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,567
{\i1}He abandons his uniform{\i}

536
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,151
{\i1}for regular clothes.{\i}

537
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,859
{\i1}After so much hatred and threats,{\i}

538
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,525
{\i1}he now offers peace.{\i}

539
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:00,984
{\i1}He is alone.{\i}

540
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,692
{\i1}He alone speaks.{\i}

541
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,859
{\i1}What would you say to a dictator?{\i}

542
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,151
{\i1}15 years ago,{\i}

543
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,901
{\i1}the dictatorship began here,{\i}

544
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,483
{\i1}and we've had it up to here!{\i}

545
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,109
{\i1}But it ends now.{\i}

546
00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:27,151
{\i1}My love, say yes.{\i}

547
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,026
{\i1}No.{\i}

548
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,942
{\i1}Say it for me.{\i}

549
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,234
{\i1}Come on, say yes! Please.{\i}

550
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:36,525
{\i1}All right then, NO!{\i}

551
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,442
{\i1}If the YES camp triumph,{\i}

552
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,817
{\i1}everything will be much better,{\i}

553
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:42,483
{\i1}according to the results{\i}

554
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,400
{\i1}of the latest polls.{\i}

555
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,942
{\i1}What were the results?{\i}

556
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:50,525
{\i1}YES wins.{\i}

557
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,692
{\i1}A winning country.{\i}

558
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,692
{\i1}YES!{\i}

559
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,692
{\i1}Comrade{\i}

560
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,734
{\i1}Happiness is coming!{\i}

561
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:08,984
{\i1}Destroy everything{\i}

562
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:11,567
{\i1}Happiness is coming!{\i}

563
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:14,067
{\i1}For life and for peace!{\i}

564
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:16,359
Have you seen the time?

565
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,817
We had stuff to do.

566
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,942
{\i1}...with the power of my voice{\i}

567
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,109
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

568
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,984
{\i1}I sing it without fear{\i}

569
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,151
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

570
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,109
{\i1}Together victorious
Tous ensemble pour gagner{\i}

571
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:33,276
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

572
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:37,483
{\i1}For life and for peace{\i}

573
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,067
{\i1}A Marxist dressed in velvet{\i}

574
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:43,192
{\i1}is still a Marxist!{\i}

575
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:51,442
{\i1}Chile{\i}

576
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:55,234
{\i1}Happiness is coming!{\i}

577
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:20,359
{\i1}Today, huge rallies{\i}

578
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,192
{\i1}closed the electoral campaigns.{\i}

579
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,400
{\i1}The YES camp{\i}

580
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:26,192
{\i1}held huge celebrations{\i}

581
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,609
{\i1}for the arrival{\i}

582
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:29,650
{\i1}of President Pinochet.{\i}

583
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,359
{\i1}There's a carnival-like atmosphere.{\i}

584
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:34,318
{\i1}You can feel the joy{\i}

585
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:35,859
{\i1}on Bernardo O'Higgens Boulevard.{\i}

586
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:37,318
{\i1}Thousands of people{\i}

587
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:40,442
{\i1}have come together to say YES.{\i}

588
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,400
{\i1}They support Pinochet{\i}

589
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,817
{\i1}and will return a big majority{\i}

590
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:46,692
{\i1}on October 5th.{\i}

591
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,692
{\i1}Foreigners{\i}

592
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,692
{\i1}have refused to film{\i}

593
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:51,525
{\i1}these scenes of joy.{\i}

594
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,234
{\i1}They refuse to show{\i}

595
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,859
{\i1}Pinochet's thousands of supporters.{\i}

596
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,400
{\i1}Meanwhile,{\i}

597
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,151
{\i1}the NO supporters marched today{\i}

598
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,609
{\i1}to where the freeway {\i}

599
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,400
{\i1}meets the road in Santiago.{\i}

600
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,984
{\i1}The main speaker there{\i}

601
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:05,859
{\i1}was the spokesman{\i}

602
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:07,775
{\i1}for the NO coalition {\i}

603
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:09,734
{\i1}and Christian Democrat leader,{\i}

604
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,151
{\i1}Patricio Aylwin.{\i}

605
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,775
{\i1}I've said it clearly:{\i}

606
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,609
{\i1}if the referendum is held{\i}

607
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:17,525
{\i1}under the correct conditions,{\i}

608
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:20,609
{\i1}we will accept the result,{\i}

609
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:21,901
{\i1}whatever it is.{\i}

610
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:27,609
{\i1}NO to hunger!{\i}

611
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,942
{\i1}NO to exile!{\i}

612
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:32,026
{\i1}NO to violence!{\i}

613
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,984
{\i1}NO to suicide!{\i}

614
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:38,318
{\i1}We will dance together for this NO{\i}

615
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:01,026
{\i1}We will dance together for this NO!{\i}

616
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:15,567
We ask the authorities

617
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,901
to not attack us!

618
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:18,942
Fuck, my car!

619
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:20,984
Remain calm!

620
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,692
Here! Give me your hand!

621
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,276
No violence!

622
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:29,234
Please!

623
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,483
We ask the authorities...

624
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:35,026
Come! Close your eyes!

625
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,901
What's happening, Daddy?

626
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,151
Murderers! Murderers!

627
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:19,276
What are you doing?

628
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,276
Why are you there?

629
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:22,483
Go home!

630
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:26,859
Hold on tight!

631
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,775
Come on! Let's go!

632
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,609
Daddy!

633
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,109
Give me your hand!

634
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,151
Get in! And stay here!

635
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,026
And Mommy?

636
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,734
Did you hear me? Stay here!

637
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,483
Take Simon home!

638
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,775
Take Simon home!

639
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:06,234
Where are you going?

640
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,817
Where are you going, Saavedra?

641
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:09,859
She's my wife!

642
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,650
Go home.

643
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:55,483
Hello.

644
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,775
The officer in charge?

645
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:57,984
Yes, Colonel.

646
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:08,817
She's here, they told me.

647
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:13,567
Thanks, Lucho.

648
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:14,984
Don't worry,

649
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:18,067
I'd have done it for any of my people.

650
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:24,151
Happiness, huh?

651
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:27,192
My congratulations.

652
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:31,359
Unbeatable.

653
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:04,901
Thank you very much.

654
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,067
It's quite alright.

655
00:37:25,984 --> 00:37:28,400
{\i1}Hello. This is our last program.{\i}

656
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,442
{\i1}For the last 27 days, I've been here{\i}

657
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:33,567
{\i1}showing you the whole of Chile.{\i}

658
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:36,400
{\i1}This morning, we'd like to say{\i}

659
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,109
{\i1}while you stay at home and rest,{\i}

660
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:41,817
{\i1}NO to hatred,{\i}

661
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:43,650
{\i1}NO to violence.{\i}

662
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:45,942
{\i1}And in this message, we are not alone.{\i}

663
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,650
{\i1}Remember that the ballot is secret{\i}

664
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:50,817
{\i1}and the future of your country{\i}

665
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,234
{\i1}is in your hands.{\i}

666
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:56,318
{\i1}The pain of Chile over these long years{\i}

667
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,151
{\i1}has been the pain of all of us.{\i}

668
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,276
{\i1}We'll be with you in our hearts{\i}

669
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:03,984
{\i1}on October 5.{\i}

670
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:10,817
{\i1}NO-EWS{\i}

671
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,276
{\i1}Which flags do you sell most of?{\i}

672
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:15,609
{\i1}YES or NO ones?{\i}

673
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:17,567
{\i1}NO ones mostly.{\i}

674
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,567
{\i1}Do the YES ones sell?{\i}

675
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:21,234
{\i1}A little. Not much.{\i}

676
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:23,359
{\i1}How many badges sold today?{\i}

677
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,276
{\i1}1,500 NO badges.{\i}

678
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,359
{\i1}And 50 YES ones.{\i}

679
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:28,650
{\i1}More NO ones.{\i}

680
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:32,318
{\i1}That's why I've only got NO things here.{\i}

681
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:34,359
{\i1}That's what sells best.{\i}

682
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:37,775
{\i1}This program is coming to an end.{\i}

683
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,442
{\i1}We've run out of time.{\i}

684
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,734
{\i1}From now on,{\i}

685
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,442
{\i1}you will only hear the official opinion.{\i}

686
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:47,109
{\i1}Freedom for Chile and its TV coverage{\i}

687
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:49,692
{\i1}now depends on you.{\i}

688
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,276
{\i1}Happiness is in your hands.{\i}

689
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:54,609
{\i1}See you soon.{\i}

690
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:56,609
{\i1}THE YES CAMP WILL USE{\i}

691
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:58,400
{\i1}ITS 15 LEGAL MINUTES{\i}

692
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,109
{\i1}My love,{\i}

693
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:01,859
{\i1}say YES.{\i}

694
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,817
{\i1}Honey, it's NO.{\i}

695
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:06,483
{\i1}Tell me YES.{\i}

696
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:11,650
{\i1}Come over here.{\i}

697
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:12,942
{\i1}Tell me YES.{\i}

698
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:16,192
{\i1}YES!{\i}

699
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:18,400
{\i1}YES!{\i}

700
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,318
{\i1}In the other campaign,{\i}

701
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,483
{\i1}this ends with a NO.{\i}

702
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:24,318
{\i1}In this campaign,{\i}

703
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,318
{\i1}it ends with a YES.{\i}

704
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:27,942
{\i1}You choose!{\i}

705
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,234
{\i1}Consider that this country{\i}

706
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,525
{\i1}has a great future ahead of it!{\i}

707
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:35,734
{\i1}Great expectations!{\i}

708
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:38,151
{\i1}Don't throw it all away.{\i}

709
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,067
{\i1}I don't recommend myself.{\i}

710
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:42,859
{\i1}You judge.{\i}

711
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:45,276
{\i1}If I did wrong, forgive me.{\i}

712
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:47,775
{\i1}But if you do the math,{\i}

713
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:49,734
{\i1}it adds up pretty positively.{\i}

714
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,276
{\i1}A winning country...{\i}

715
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,442
{\i1}YES!{\i}

716
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,067
{\i1}In compliance...{\i}

717
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,234
{\i1}with the laws{\i}

718
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,276
{\i1}governing the electoral process,{\i}

719
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,192
{\i1}the TV channels have been integrated{\i}

720
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,151
{\i1}into the state channel.{\i}

721
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:07,234
{\i1}From now on,{\i}

722
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,067
{\i1}retransmissions can continue{\i}

723
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:11,901
{\i1}separately.{\i}

724
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:32,609
Long live Chile and Pinochet!

725
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:38,817
Of course.

726
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:40,234
You have a call.

727
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,067
Excuse me.

728
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,151
Go right ahead.

729
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,567
Don't worry.

730
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:47,775
Everything's fine.

731
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,109
Where will you celebrate?

732
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,192
With the family...

733
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:56,984
and friends.

734
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,442
Are you confident?

735
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,483
The little campaign's over.

736
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,859
It's now a matter of state.

737
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:11,151
Let them dance a while.

738
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:15,942
Are you celebrating?

739
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:18,817
Yes.

740
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:23,775
Are you going to eat?

741
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,234
{\i1}From north to south,{\i}

742
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,775
{\i1}the best team.{\i}

743
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,276
{\i1}All the news and information{\i}

744
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:33,109
{\i1}from where it happens,{\i}

745
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:34,901
{\i1}across the entire country.{\i}

746
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:37,151
{\i1}TelevisiÃ³n Nacional of Chile.{\i}

747
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,359
{\i1}Across the capital{\i}

748
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:41,109
{\i1}and the rest of the country,{\i}

749
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:42,942
{\i1}voting booths were set up{\i}

750
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,400
{\i1}early in the morning.{\i}

751
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:45,359
{\i1}The public,{\i}

752
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:48,318
{\i1}following official recommendations,{\i}

753
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:50,067
{\i1}began arriving to vote{\i}

754
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,775
{\i1}from first light,{\i}

755
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,734
{\i1}causing some traffic jams{\i}

756
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:55,775
{\i1}in certain areas.{\i}

757
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,650
{\i1}A few minutes before 11am,{\i}

758
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,483
{\i1}the President exercised{\i}

759
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,400
{\i1}his right as a citizen,{\i}

760
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,192
{\i1}voting at table number 1.{\i}

761
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,359
{\i1}The images show the Head of State{\i}

762
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,984
{\i1}completing each stage of the process.{\i}

763
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,650
{\i1}Patricio Aylwin Azocar voted{\i}

764
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:16,276
{\i1}at table number 16.{\i}

765
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:21,026
{\i1}91, 92, 93,{\i}

766
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:23,442
{\i1}94, 95, 96...{\i}

767
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:16,359
{\i1}The Undersecretary of the Interior{\i}

768
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:17,734
{\i1}is on the podium.{\i}

769
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:19,692
{\i1}I shall now read{\i}

770
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,483
{\i1}the third official count{\i}

771
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,609
{\i1}by the Ministry of the Interior{\i}

772
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:26,984
{\i1}which is currently announcing{\i}

773
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:32,483
{\i1}a 57.36% YES vote,{\i}

774
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:37,650
{\i1}and a 40.54% NO vote.{\i}

775
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:42,192
He can't give those results.

776
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:48,234
Of course they want to win,

777
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,817
but they can't.

778
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:53,318
They can't, right?

779
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:00,359
I don't think so.

780
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:04,692
Easy, now.

781
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:12,483
I didn't want to say it out loud,

782
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,775
but apparently, the old fucker

783
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:18,026
refuses to accept the results.

784
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:38,901
The cops are leaving.

785
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:43,817
I don't understand.

786
00:44:44,483 --> 00:44:45,817
Maybe Ricardo knows...

787
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,192
They've all gone?

788
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:48,901
Simon!

789
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:50,359
Come.

790
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,276
It's a self-coup!

791
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,984
Get out the torches.

792
00:44:58,151 --> 00:44:59,442
They want to screw us!

793
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:02,609
We have to back up the computers.

794
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:04,400
What's the procedure?

795
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:07,359
For those counting votes by hand,

796
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:09,067
you are each responsible.

797
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:10,942
They're robbing us!

798
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:13,984
There's foreign journalists everywhere.

799
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:14,942
So?

800
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:16,525
It'll be OK.

801
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:18,400
Will the foreigners help?

802
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:19,650
We need help!

803
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,234
Let's call some journalists!

804
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,442
International help or we're screwed!

805
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:24,859
This is critical.

806
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,359
We cannot lose.

807
00:45:30,942 --> 00:45:32,026
JosÃ© TomÃ¡s!

808
00:45:32,192 --> 00:45:33,567
Listen!

809
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,192
Our parallel count shows that we won.

810
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,359
This can't go on.

811
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:45,234
They're trying to buy some time.

812
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,359
This may keep happening

813
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:49,234
more and more frequently.

814
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:06,276
We don't know anything either.

815
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:07,442
Fucking military!

816
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:08,859
The TV, please!

817
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,984
{\i1}...outside the Moneda Palace,{\i}

818
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:13,984
{\i1}where all the generals are arriving.{\i}

819
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:15,400
{\i1}They've been summoned{\i}

820
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,192
{\i1}to an emergency meeting{\i}

821
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,525
{\i1}by President Pinochet.{\i}

822
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,567
{\i1}General Matthei!{\i}

823
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,817
{\i1}Does the government have the results?{\i}

824
00:46:21,984 --> 00:46:23,567
{\i1}To me, it really looks like{\i}

825
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:25,567
{\i1}the NO vote has won.{\i}

826
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:29,234
{\i1}It seems pretty clear to me now.{\i}

827
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,817
{\i1}That was the General of the Air Force,{\i}

828
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:33,067
{\i1}Fernando Matthei...{\i}

829
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:35,692
The generals are abandoning Pinochet.

830
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:40,859
They're forcing him

831
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:42,817
to recognize the victory.

832
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,775
So that means...

833
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:46,650
this thing is over.

834
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,109
Shit, we won!

835
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:54,859
We won!

836
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:03,442
Really?

837
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:04,650
Yes! We won!

838
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:16,942
{\i1}The YES vote won{\i}

839
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,276
{\i1}43.04%.{\i}

840
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:22,775
{\i1}The NO vote won{\i}

841
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:26,775
{\i1}54.68%.{\i}

842
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,775
Today, a new Chile is born.

843
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:53,901
Fairer and more unified,

844
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:57,359
with no privileges;

845
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,692
we all have the right

846
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:01,442
to think different...

847
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:02,901
Bravo!

848
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:07,817
Where we all have

849
00:48:07,984 --> 00:48:10,067
the same opportunities.

850
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,817
Because after this long day,

851
00:48:12,984 --> 00:48:16,234
without a single drop of blood shed,

852
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,109
we have overthrown this dictatorship

853
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:23,650
simply by saying, loud and clear, NO!

854
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,192
Therefore...

855
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:27,359
long live Chile!

856
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:35,151
{\i1}Chile{\i}

857
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:37,859
{\i1}Happiness is coming!{\i}

858
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:44,692
Did you see that?

859
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:45,901
Up there!

860
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:48,901
Thank you.

861
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,359
We are happy. Chile wins.

862
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,151
It's a triumph,

863
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:04,942
a personal triumph

864
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,567
that represents

865
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:09,901
a choice, I would say...

866
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:12,901
We don't have to impose our opinions.

867
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:34,442
{\i1}People are taking to the streets{\i}

868
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:37,109
{\i1}to celebrate the NO vote winning{\i}

869
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:40,359
{\i1}over 54% of the total vote.{\i}

870
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:42,984
{\i1}Thousands of people are there.{\i}

871
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,859
Who doesn't jump for joy? Pinochet!

872
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:49,942
I'm going to leave you with RenÃ©.

873
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:51,984
He will present the piece.

874
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,359
RenÃ© is one of the main creators

875
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:58,859
of the successful NO campaign.

876
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:01,026
Thank you, Lucho.

877
00:52:03,525 --> 00:52:04,734
Well...

878
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,609
First of all,

879
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,276
I'd like to say

880
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,775
that what you're about to see

881
00:52:12,942 --> 00:52:15,483
fits with the current social context.

882
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,026
We believe the country is ready

883
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:21,109
for communication like this.

884
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:22,609
Absolutely.

885
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:25,442
Let's be honest:

886
00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:27,276
Today,

887
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:30,483
Chile is thinking about its future.

888
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,483
Alright?

889
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,609
Shall we?

890
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,276
{\i1}Santa Maria tower's heliport{\i}

891
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:47,609
{\i1}welcomed{\i}

892
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:50,276
{\i1}10 women in formal gowns{\i}

893
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:53,067
{\i1}and 5 men who admired their beauty.{\i}

894
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:54,109
{\i1}Suddenly,{\i}

895
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:56,650
{\i1}the soap opera's hero, EstÃ©ban Greve,{\i}

896
00:52:56,817 --> 00:52:58,567
{\i1}played by Osvaldo Silva,{\i}

897
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,109
{\i1}appeared in a helicopter{\i}

898
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:01,984
{\i1}offering a bunch of flowers{\i}

899
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,609
{\i1}to these Beautiful and Bold women.{\i}

900
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,567
{\i1}These James Bond-style images{\i}

901
00:53:07,942 --> 00:53:09,192
{\i1}will be used to promote{\i}

902
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,026
{\i1}the state channel's new soap opera.{\i}

903
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,109
{\i1}My name is Kiki Blanche.{\i}

904
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:17,192
{\i1}I have 5 children,{\i}

905
00:53:18,026 --> 00:53:19,942
{\i1}I own a hair salon,{\i}

906
00:53:20,942 --> 00:53:21,859
{\i1}and I was a dancer{\i}

907
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:24,442
{\i1}at the Bim Bam Boum.{\i}
