LOCKED UP (8)
64406008001001
C000000

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,640
Good morning.

3
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:05,664


4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,560
Please sit down.

5
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:08,999


6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Firstly, some good news.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,840
This month's wages will include
what is owed from Christmas.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,800
Good, about time.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,360
On to other matters.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,640
As you know, today
we have a wedding.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,720
Inmate Saray Vargas
is getting married.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,520
The ceremony will be
held in the chapel.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,760
Five family members, two witnesses,
a priest and myself will be attending.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,440
This is a fantastic opportunity
to go public with it.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
Imagine the headline:

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,360
"Cruz del Sur supports groups
at risk of social exclusion."

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,800
Sandoval's right. A bit of
good publicity couldn't hurt.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,200
- We've had a bad run recently.
- That's just great.

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,560
Can we cover up the woodland
shooting, the dead Chinaman,

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,120
Yolanda's murder,

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,480
or that of our colleague Paloma,
with a gypsy wedding?

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,400
To finish up,

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,240
another tricky subject.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
- How are you, Tere?
- Fine.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Tere, how old are you?

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Have you had breakfast?

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,440
Sandoval, for how long was Tere
being treated with methadone?

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,480
Two months.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,800
Well that's two months wasted.

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,880
Someone has sold her heroin.
We all know who.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
- Inmate Anabel Vilaroch.
- It's no use saying it was Anabel.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,560
She doesn't do drugs,
it was someone else.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
I want her watched more closely.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Her friends and cellmates too.
I want to know how she gets the drugs.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
Valbuena, be meticulous
during frisking,

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,640
raids and at entrance
control points.

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,840
We're going to redo tests
on all suspected drug users.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Palacios, I want you to read
each letter inmates receive...

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,920
- with Fabio.
- What? Excuse me?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
You're joking, right?

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Do I look like I'm joking?
This is a priority.

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,000
This prison
will not become another...

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
drug supermarket.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,920
Exactly, Miranda. Exactly.

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,280
I should be out there with
my colleagues, using my faculties,

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
instead of sitting here
sifting through letters.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Remember, you're not
on Homicide any more.

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,040
If you can't accept my decisions,

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
find work elsewhere.

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
Let's get to work.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,720
Palacios, a word.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
I need a witness.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,120
We're going to do
another drug search.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Of course.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,000
In the employee lockers.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
Now.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,760
# Here I am

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,760
# What you did?

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,160
# Look at me

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,480
# Life in jail. #

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,160
LOCKED UP

62
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Macarena wants the three of us
to go to the next visit.

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,960
She has something
important to say.

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,240
- Did she say what?
- No.

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,000
What if it's bad?

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,200
Don't assume the worst, Encarna.
It could be anything.

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,640
What should I think?
Do you know what it is?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,960
The prosecutor says she's guilty.
They'll have proof. What do we know?

69
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,160
Macarena is still awaiting trial.
Nobody has convicted her of anything.

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,200
- Macarena is innocent, Encarna.
- And how do you know?

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
I went to see Simón.

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I had him at gunpoint.
He told me everything.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,160
He tricked Macarena and
ripped her off. It was him.

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,600
- Calm down.
- You had a man at gunpoint?

75
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,200
Leopoldo, are you insane?
You'll be the end of us all.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
I had to know the truth.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,280
You'll end up in jail, and
my life will be even worse.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,520
I went to the doctor because
I couldn't even get out of bed.

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm sorry, but my head
hurts. Excuse me.

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm going to try and sleep.

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,520
- Do you want me to stay with you?
- No, go and see the lawyer.

82
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,080
That's more important.

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
You need to look
relaxed in the interview.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,080
Don't sit on the edge
of the seat. Don't slouch.

85
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
It will come across as disrespectful.

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
- OK.
- Understand?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
- What does "slouch" mean?
- Sitting like this,

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
with your legs apart.

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,160
That's how I always sit
when I'm fingering myself anyway.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,400
My uncle is going
to love your honesty.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,480
What if he asks
why I'm in prison?

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, best to...

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,120
It doesn't matter.

94
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,760
- No, let's think.
- No, it doesn't matter.

95
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,880
Your uncle will never trust me.

96
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Who would trust a thief with money?

97
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
Nobody. No one.

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,240
That's not fair.
People can change.

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,640
Or not. What if
I can't stop myself?

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,480
- And I steal the money?
- What do you mean?

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,920
What if I think it seems
great to have a job,

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,720
but then I lose it and steal
everything from the till?

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
You're not a thief.

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,480
- I'm in jail.
- Curly,

105
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,400
you're not a thief.
You're a lovely girl.

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,480
I would trust you
with my money.

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Listen. I'd also
trust you with my child.

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
Curly, they attacked you
the first day I got here.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,400
They beat you up because
you helped me. You barely knew me.

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
Whenever I've been down
you've been there...

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,360
to help me, to tell me
it's just like being on holiday.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,520
And you know what?

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Ultimately, at times,

114
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
there have been moments,

115
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,480
where I've forgotten I'm in prison.

116
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
And it's down to you.

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,640
That's who you are.

118
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Anyone who spends
more than five minutes with you

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,200
is going to see that too.

120
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,920
It's a real shame
you're not a dyke, Blondie.

121
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,560
They tell me you've got
two belly-buttons.

122
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,840
What's the question?
I look good on camera.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Sure, there's drugs.

124
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
How could there not be
drugs here, girl?

125
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
If there weren't,
it'd be bedlam in here.

126
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,040
There's loads, all kinds.
Do you want some?

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,880
I can put you in touch
with dealers. I don't get involved.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,120
It's like a supermarket here.

129
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,520
You can get it all.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,160
How do the drugs get in?
Up vaginas,

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
up arseholes, in stomachs.

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,920
They throw it over the walls
in shoes or nappies.

133
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,760
There's heroin, cocaine,
amphetamines, LSD.

134
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,800
It costs double.
Double the street price.

135
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,600
When there's a drought,
there's glue, detergent, cheap stuff.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
Drugs are the non-gypsy's bullshit.

137
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,520
We gypsies are smarter.
We sell them to people...

138
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,400
but we don't take any.

139
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,920
- Fabio Martínez.
- Go ahead.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,440
Miranda, this is crazy.

141
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,920
Stop wasting time checking
their things, come on.

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,080
They'll resent you for it.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,400
I know. Go on.

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm paid to run this prison.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,400
Keep going.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Not to make friends.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,600
- That's mine, here you go.
- Thanks.

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,960
- Keep going.
- Empty, empty.

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,360
- Ismael Valbuena.
- Go ahead.

150
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
And what about me?

151
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,520
My things aren't in here.

152
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
They're in my office,
in the infirmary.

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,960
We can go there
when we finish this.

154
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,480
Check everything there,
or just frisk me now.

155
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm not going through
your things, Carlos.

156
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,280
30 officers work in this prison.

157
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Can you vouch for
every single one of them?

158
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,360
That's not the point.

159
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
There are better ways
of doing things.

160
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Why do you second guess
every decision I make?

161
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,080
How's the gut? Sore?

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,520
No. It sometimes stings a bit,
but there's almost no pain.

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,160
- Are you still...?
- Yes.

164
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm still pregnant.

165
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
It's a boy.

166
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,120
God knows what
I'm going to do with a boy.

167
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,320
You men are strange.

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
Wait.

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Apparently...

170
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,000
you and Curly spend
a lot of time together.

171
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,800
Yes. She's my friend,
and a good one at that.

172
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,520
You shouldn't trust her.

173
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,560
I don't understand.

174
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Let's see,

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,960
this prison holds
murderers and drug dealers.

176
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,960
Around here, stealing
a car is no big deal.

177
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,920
Curly helped the police.

178
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,080
She bugged your cell
with microphones.

179
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,400
That's why Castillo
took you to the woods.

180
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
No.

181
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,880
- That can't be true.
- Curly is a troubled girl.

182
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,560
How else could she earn third grade?

183
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

184
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,000
But the truth is, I owe you.

185
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,080
That's the real reason
I came here.

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,320
To thank you for everything
you did for me.

187
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,680
If it weren't for you,
I'd probably be dead.

188
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,520
I probably would be too.

189
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Tell me something.

190
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
Why did you shoot?

191
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,760
I've already said.

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,960
I was scared, I ran,
and it went off by accident.

193
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,280
I know that's
what you told the police,

194
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,760
but I don't buy it.

195
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,240
That's what happened.

196
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
Don't move.

197
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,160
You're Macarena, aren't you?

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Where's the money?

199
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,440
It's two kilometres that way.

200
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,000
Turn around and start walking.
You're coming with me.

201
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
No.

202
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,200
SHE PANTS

203
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Don't move.

204
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
- I know you're out of bullets.
- Are you sure?

205
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080
You're coming with me.

206
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,800
Tell me where the money is,
and then I'll take you back to prison.

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,600
I want you to give
a message to Zulema.

208
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,320
Don't move.

209
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,280
I swear I'll shoot.

210
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
"Tahiri Nafsek."

211
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
Repeat!

212
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,360
"Tahiri Navsuki."

213
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,480
"Tahiri Nafsek."

214
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,720
"Tahiri Nafsek."

215
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Good.

216
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Now give me the gun.

217
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
No.

218
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,720
No.

219
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,800
No!

220
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,640
SHE SCREAMS

221
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,640
PHONE RINGS

222
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Zulema,

223
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,280
I've got a message for you.

224
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
From who?

225
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,920
Hanbal, the Egyptian.

226
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
What's the message?

227
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
"Tahiri Nafsek."

228
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
SHE REPEATS

229
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,040
- Where did you see him, bitch?
- I have nothing else to tell you.

230
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,760
- Where?
- In the woods.

231
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,840
Why the wait?

232
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
I don't know.

233
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Did you shoot him?

234
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,160
Have you shot him?

235
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
No.

236
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,440
Look at me.

237
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,800
If you're lying to me...

238
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
if you hurt him,

239
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,520
I'll cut you open,

240
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,720
take your baby,

241
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
and flush it away.

242
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960
Give me the gun.

243
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I swear I'll shoot.

244
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
SHE YELLS

245
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,080
Stop!

246
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,840
Sandoval,

247
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,160
I need to be moved
to the maternity block. Please.

248
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes, the Governor told me.

249
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
What? I thought
you wanted to avoid me.

250
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Yes, but now
I'm here talking to you.

251
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm scared for this child.
I won't let anything bad happen to it.

252
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,240
I understand, of course. How could I
not sympathise with your situation?

253
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,720
The problem is, Maca, that you're
not the only one pregnant here.

254
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,360
There are girls
further along than you.

255
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,960
And have done more to deserve it.

256
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,160
You know what
I like most about you?

257
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,320
You're much stronger
than you look.

258
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,880
I don't think you'll be needing that.

259
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,760
I swear, I'm trying to be obedient.

260
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
I need to get into that block.

261
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,680
But there's something,

262
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,160
deep inside of me.

263
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,320
Making me want...

264
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,000
to clench my teeth.

265
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
To bite down hard.

266
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,760
I'm not sure
I can stop myself.

267
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Welcome back to Block 2.

268
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,480
I think your transfer to the maternity
block will have to wait for...

269
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
a more suitable moment.

270
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,320
BEEPING

271
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,080
INAUDIBLE

272
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,520
ALARM BEEPS

273
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,480
They've cancelled the interview,
they're not coming.

274
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm sorry.

275
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Dad, your food's ready.

276
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
The Egyptian burgled us.

277
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,680
- Are you sure?
- He's taken the money.

278
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,600
The money your mother
got from her family.

279
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,120
And the map, the photos.
That bastard knows everything.

280
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,160
No. Fuck it.

281
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,200
We can't pay bail.

282
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,600
No bail money, no money in the woods,
we've got absolutely nothing.

283
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,320
We can't leave Maca in there, Dad.

284
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,840
They're harassing her.

285
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,760
There's a prison officer
asking her to suck him off.

286
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
How the fuck
do we get her out of there?

287
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,360
What are you doing?

288
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,920
Dad.

289
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,080
Where are you going?

290
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,120
- To get the money.
- And if he's there?

291
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,280
He killed a policeman.

292
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
Dad.

293
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,160
You whore.

294
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,040
Turn around.

295
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
I thought you were my friend,
but you're a fucking whore.

296
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,400
Why did you tell your uncle
not to employ me?

297
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,880
I thought you were my friend,
but I don't want a friend any more.

298
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,160
Not one who records me
and sells me out to the police.

299
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,920
They almost killed me
because of you!

300
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,240
You did it because of that?

301
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
What would you have done?

302
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,520
If they said
they'd get you out of jail,

303
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,520
wouldn't you?
Of course you'd do it.

304
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,240
We aren't as different as you think.

305
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,760
"No, I shouldn't be here.
It's all a big mistake".

306
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,200
But where's the mistake?

307
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,480
You committed fraud.
You stole.

308
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,840
For a man or for whatever's
about to drop out your pussy.

309
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,800
You did it, Maca.

310
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,760
So you're no better
than any bitch in here.

311
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,240
- It's empty.
- There are bullets in the glovebox.

312
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,120
You look like shit.
What's wrong with you?

313
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,360
I've been thinking.

314
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
About you and me.

315
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,400
About our chat
in the laundry room.

316
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
I wasn't honest.

317
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
There's something...

318
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
I didn't tell you.

319
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,560
I guess...

320
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,080
I was lying to myself.

321
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,120
I shot at your boyfriend
in the woods.

322
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,120
I shot to kill.

323
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
And I missed.

324
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,040
I'm not a murderer,

325
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,080
but I could be.

326
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,840
Now you want to be bad, don't you?

327
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,360
Don't you want
to know why I did it?

328
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,240
It wasn't because of you,

329
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,280
or the money.

330
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,240
It was for my child.

331
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,480
So the next time
you threaten to harm him,

332
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,960
think about something.

333
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
I can be like you.

334
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
Like me? No.

335
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,960
I've never had anything to lose.

336
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,680
If anything happens to this child,

337
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,240
I swear,

338
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,800
I swear to God,
you'll never leave prison.

339
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,680
Over there. To the right.

340
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,800
Love has brought us here today.

341
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,800
CHURCH ORGAN PLAYS

342
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,720
Love that is free.

343
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,520
For that is the essence of marriage:

344
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,760
freedom and commitment.

345
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,800
And the vows that Saray
and Armando will make today,

346
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,160
in front of their parents
and witnesses,

347
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,520
I LOVE YOU, GYPSY

348
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,120
will unite them eternally.

349
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,560
Therefore, today is
a joyous day for you,

350
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,480
and for all those who love you.

351
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,480
Armando.

352
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,320
Do you take Saray
as your lawfully wedded wife?

353
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,360
I do.

354
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,040
Saray, do you take Armando
as your lawfully wedded husband?

355
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
Yes, of course.

356
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,480
I do.

357
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

358
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,280
You may kiss the bride.

359
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,840
To the happy couple!

360
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,360
SHE GASPS

361
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,120
Sorry for startling you.

362
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,280
Zulema sent me, as a show of
friendship, to serve you for the week.

363
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,360
For anything you need.

364
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,080
You must be joking.

365
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,880
I don't follow.

366
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,040
She sent me
to make peace with you.

367
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
I can brush your hair,
give you cream,

368
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,040
have sex.

369
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,040
- I can also give massages.
- Stop.

370
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,640
I don't need anyone for any
of that. I'm fine by myself.

371
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,480
It's not you, honestly.

372
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,880
I just like to have my own space.

373
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,760
That's all I need.

374
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,040
Tell Zulema thank you,
that I appreciate the gesture.

375
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,080
But I don't need...

376
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,360
a companion, a servant,
or whatever you're meant to be.

377
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,160
OK?

378
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,080
If I tell Zulema
you don't accept me,

379
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,920
she'll tear me to pieces, please.

380
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,800
It's just one week.

381
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,280
You won't even know
I'm there. I promise.

382
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,240
I won't make any noise
or talk. Please.

383
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,200
- Is something wrong?
- What?

384
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,160
- No, nothing.
- Just tell me, for fuck's sake.

385
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,400
Miranda searched
our lockers for drugs.

386
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,760
Cheeky bitch.

387
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,600
But the dickhead searching each
and every one of them was me.

388
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,760
She was only there as a witness.

389
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,440
And you don't know how to say no?

390
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
And...

391
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,080
I found this in Valbuena's locker.

392
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,680
I've kept it quiet.

393
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,880
- Coke.
- Shit.

394
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Should I tell Miranda?

395
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,960
See what happens.

396
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,760
I've thought about it,
and it's my duty to tell her.

397
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
Now?

398
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
You had your chance.

399
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,200
But I froze up.
Valbuena is a colleague.

400
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,560
A colleague that had drugs
in his locker. Cocaine.

401
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,200
Now it looks like it's yours
and not Valbuena's, idiot.

402
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,240
Shit.

403
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
What should I do?

404
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,840
I'll sort it out.

405
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,160
I want to know who sent me
to the woods, with the money,

406
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,320
the jihadist and his whore
of a mother on a bike?

407
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,880
Enough's enough.

408
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,480
From now on, just like me,

409
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,280
you'll have
the life of a pensioner.

410
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,560
Holidays in Benidorm,

411
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,440
DIY at weekends.

412
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,480
They've put me in with a spic.

413
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,400
You've got to laugh.

414
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,040
Who would've thought
I'd miss that Chinaman.

415
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,360
And Muñoz, and Fonseca.

416
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,200
That's what happens
after so many years' service.

417
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,440
Castillo, we know each other.

418
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
Why did you come?

419
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
To tell you that a terrorist
wanted by half of Europe

420
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,880
is not a good dance partner.

421
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,560
If you're talking
about the 9 million,

422
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,840
I don't have it,
nor do I want it.

423
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,160
I'm glad,

424
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,160
because that bastard is capable of
turning up here and breaking skulls.

425
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,400
- You know that, right?
- I know.

426
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,360
But I have faith
in this state's security forces.

427
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,400
Surely you'll catch him soon.

428
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,760
It's hard. He never sleeps
in the same place twice.

429
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,600
You know that.

430
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,240
He's one slippery bastard.

431
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,640
So any information,
any clue,

432
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
would really help.

433
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,960
All I can tell you...

434
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,760
is that the beer's getting warm.

435
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,920
All right, one more
and I'll leave you be.

436
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,000
The Egyptian's gun,
it was a Glock.

437
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,480
He's capable of turning up
here and breaking skulls.

438
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,160
Hot stuff.

439
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,800
SHE YELLS

440
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
You worthless bitches.

441
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm married. Haven't
you got anything to say?

442
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,400
That's what I thought.
Let's sing or dance or something.

443
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,400
Everyone, free bar.

444
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
Who wants the bouquet?

445
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,000
Who's the next bitch
here to get married?

446
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,640
THEY SING

447
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,800
Sing it!

448
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,880
Keep singing!

449
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,440
This is addressed to Zulema.

450
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,280
No drugs in it.

451
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,680
No return address.
Could it be from the Egyptian?

452
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,760
Wow.

453
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,440
That's a beauty of
a 500 note, a real one too.

454
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,880
If I take it,
that's my rent paid.

455
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,880
- Don't you live with your mum?
- Does it matter?

456
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,680
I guess we can't use
Google Translate.

457
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,440
We'd best speak
to Miranda and Castillo.

458
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,880
It looks like the Egyptian is trying
to get in touch with Zulema.

459
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Hi.

460
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,280
Hi.

461
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,120
You like the gift?

462
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,360
Yes, a lovely gesture.

463
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,000
- What do you want?
- Absolutely nothing.

464
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,600
It's a goodwill gesture.

465
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Since you got here,
all I've done is threaten you.

466
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,800
I had my reasons.
9 million reasons.

467
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
- You don't need to give me your maid.
- No, don't call her maid.

468
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,240
Call her helper. It upsets her.

469
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,760
Has she offended you?

470
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,160
No, she's done nothing wrong.

471
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,560
I want to be left in peace.
I don't need anyone following me.

472
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,280
It suits the new you.

473
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,880
Everyone should know.

474
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,520
Hey,

475
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,880
I give gifts with good intentions.

476
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,440
Do you despise me?
Or are you still scared of me?

477
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,920
I want to know who she speaks to,
who she's close to.

478
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,000
Everything.

479
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Everything.

480
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,440
The graphologists confirm

481
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,200
that the handwriting found on the note
corresponds to that of the Egyptian,

482
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,760
the one we want.

483
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,160
What's the meaning of his poem?

484
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,080
It's not poetry.
It's from the Qur'an.

485
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,960
Chapter 30, Aleya 12.

486
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,760
"On the day the hour arrives,
the sinners will be in despair."

487
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,280
Doesn't sound good.

488
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,560
When is Zulema
supposed to get the letter?

489
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,080
An inmate hands out
the post mid-morning.

490
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,400
When all the jobs are done
and they're back in their block.

491
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,640
It's vital that Zulema gets
the letter with that note,

492
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,880
and that she doesn't suspect
that we've seen it.

493
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,360
Bastards.

494
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,400
Today she sees her lawyer.

495
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,280
- Do we act as normal?
- Yes.

496
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,320
We're watching her lawyer.
We don't want to tip him off.

497
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,840
I still don't get

498
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,840
why is he writing verses from
the Qur'an on 500 euro notes?

499
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,320
He's letting her know he's got
the money from Yolanda.

500
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,280
The notes' serial number is the same
as those stolen from the truck.

501
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,680
I guess the quote from the Qur'an
is to tell her to keep calm,

502
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,240
- that he'll get her out.
- And the phone number?

503
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,720
Let's hope Zulema
dials that number,

504
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,280
and the Egyptian answers.
Then we'll trace the call.

505
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,080
With your approval, Miranda,
I'll ask for a court order

506
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,000
to tap all the phone booths
this morning.

507
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,440
I'll inform
the penal authorities.

508
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,760
We have a golden opportunity,

509
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,120
to get the Chinaman's killer.

510
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,080
What are you doing?

511
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,400
Write this down.

512
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,320
Six assault rifles,

513
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,800
handguns, ammunition,
and five grenades.

514
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,280
Tell me how much
and I'll do the rest.

515
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,120
Subtitles for the deaf
and hard of hearing by Ericsson

516
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:51,144
