1
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,197
Isabel!

2
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,097
We're leaving.

3
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,364
Huh? Why?

4
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,097
Seriously?

5
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,531
I'm not playing, come on.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

6
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:25,431
Manuel... Manuel...

7
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,097
Rocky!

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,064
How you doing, brother?

9
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,564
What's up?

10
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,231
Don't tell me, no.

11
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,131
You don't recognize me?
It's me, Naldo!

12
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,498
- Naldo.
- Naldo who?

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,164
Naldo Ruiz. Naldo!

14
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,464
How long were you in prison for?

15
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,197
Too long, man!

16
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,197
I really wanna know, all right.

17
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,164
3 years, man.

18
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,598
3 years?

19
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,164
- Whoo! Damn!
- 3 years.

20
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,764
Oh, yeah, sorry about
the detective, man...

21
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,297
Hey, drop it. That ain't really
up for discussion, man.

22
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,131
That's your brother Jose's wife?

23
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,331
- Uh-huh.
- Ah, OK.

24
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,064
- Nice to meet you. Naldo.
- Isabel...

25
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,630
- Let me get you a taxi.
- No, Manuel, Manuel...

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,797
She's gone already.

27
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,198
Hey, yo, my nigga,
I'm gonna walk her

28
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,264
down to the train station
real quick.

29
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,431
I'm gonna holla at you.

30
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,310
Meet me back in the club,
all right?

31
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,697
Mm-hmm.

32
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,164
Uh-huh?

33
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,231
Isabel, and I bet you could
learn to speak English, too.

34
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:12,398
- Go home and go take it easy.
- Ciao.

35
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,697
OK.

36
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,131
Isabel!

37
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,031
Thank you. Thank you.

38
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,230
Scotty!

39
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:15,797
Scotty!

40
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,097
Is he still here?
I want to see him.

41
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,730
Janine, no.

42
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:27,397
What happened?

43
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,031
Nobody's telling me anything.
What happened to Joey, Scotty?

44
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,196
- What happened to my husband?
- We don't know.

45
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,031
We want you
to be with the kids, OK?

46
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,797
Hug them,
tell them it's gonna be OK.

47
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,064
We'll get someone
to drive you back, OK?

48
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,430
- OK...
- Johnson!

49
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,330
- Amen.
- Amen.

50
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,463
Marisol?

51
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,430
- Sorry about your partner.
- Thanks.

52
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,096
Close the door.

53
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:23,697
Charlene wants you to
come by this week... for dinner.

54
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,063
OK?

55
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,697
Sure.

56
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:35,130
Bring Anthony.

57
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,196
He's staying with my sister
for a little while.

58
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:41,130
Yeah? Well, when he gets back

59
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,764
we gotta get on the boat,
do some fishing.

60
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,363
Yeah.

61
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:51,063
Yeah... Charlene's
a little worried about you.

62
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:57,096
Tell her I'm fine.

63
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:59,030
Really?

64
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,397
- Yeah.
- Your partner was just killed.

65
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,530
You're not fine.

66
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,397
I wanna put you with Ramirez.

67
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,330
I don't want you working
on this case alone.

68
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,430
And frankly, I don't want you
working on this case at all, but...

69
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:13,797
It's fine.

70
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,163
So, what do we know?

71
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,463
Not fucking much.

72
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:28,063
What, didn't you
talk to someone?

73
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:31,063
Yeah, Joey's informant,
Kendu Wallace.

74
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,330
I don't know shit!

75
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,096
I don't know shit!
I'm telling you the truth!

76
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,764
Shh...
Don't scream, OK?

77
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:44,764
Just be honest.
You were Joey's snitch.

78
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,463
Who killed Joey?
Tell me the truth.

79
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,497
I don't know shit, man!
I'm telling you the truth!

80
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,363
I'm not fucking lyin' to you!

81
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:55,196
I... I don't know nothing.

82
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,130
I don't know who killed Cullen.

83
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:12,163
You could say
we had a conversation.

84
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:15,131
He knew squat.

85
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,764
Well... why the hell
you talking to him then?

86
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:24,263
There was a crew over in Harlem
that Joey had his eyes on.

87
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:25,430
In Harlem?

88
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,363
What the fuck
is Joey doing in Harlem?

89
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,397
He was suspended.

90
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,130
I don't know.

91
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:41,296
When we, uh... We found
his camera near his body.

92
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,130
How's his wife?

93
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:48,597
She's... not too good.

94
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,130
I'm taking her to the
coroner's office to ID the body.

95
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,597
That poor bastard!

96
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,630
Hey, I want to scream, too!

97
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,030
- No.
- What's up?

98
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:47,463
They killed him, Scotty!
They fucking killed him!

99
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:50,797
I mean, who would do that?

100
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:54,129
They said that when they found him,
he still had the knife in his back!

101
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:56,063
Who would do
such a thing to him?

102
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:59,030
They stabbed him
in the back and then they...

103
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:04,263
they threw him away
like he was a piece of trash.

104
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,096
They butchered him.

105
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,763
Oh, come on, are you serious?

106
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:21,063
Yo, don't say that!

107
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:24,263
Stuff like that really
be happening. I'm serious!

108
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,297
I'm laughing at y'all.

109
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,796
Look at your faces
for believing this shit.

110
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:35,796
Shut up!

111
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:36,763
Here you go.

112
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,130
In the air?

113
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,063
He shouldn't
work with the devil.

114
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,030
Elisa?

115
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,063
Sir...

116
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:39,330
Do you know where
I can find one of these?

117
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:05,030
That's a very beautiful horse.
Does she have a name?

118
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,629
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

119
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,030
Listen, you're one of us.

120
00:20:58,032 --> 00:20:59,696
- We're all here for you, OK?
- OK.

121
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,263
Anything you need,
just tell us, OK?

122
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:03,096
- OK.
- All right.

123
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,763
We're gonna find the cocksuckers
that did this, mark my words.

124
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,980
- OK.
- OK.

125
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,196
- Joey loved you.
- He loved you, too.

126
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,096
Hey, pal.

127
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:34,330
Hey.

128
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,463
How you doing?

129
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,397
First you lose your wife,
now your partner.

130
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,130
Hey, I'm gonna have a little
birthday party

131
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,729
for the twins in 2 weeks.
Bring your son.

132
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:47,030
He's in Florida.

133
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:48,230
Florida?

134
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:51,163
Why are you torturing
the poor kid?

135
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:40,263
Mm-hmm.

136
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,596
Hmm?

137
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,362
What's the charge?

138
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,596
Shut up.

139
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,163
Do you think he knows
why he's here?

140
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,462
I think he knows
it's for murder.

141
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,796
I think he knows that much.

142
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,329
Why do you think
they call him Black?

143
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:40,796
I asked his pal, Kendu Wallace, why they
called him Black but he didn't know.

144
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,296
Did he know anything else?

145
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:46,596
Well he knew Black
didn't like Joey.

146
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,030
He knew that.

147
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:49,063
Hmm...

148
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:52,196
He said Black hated him.

149
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:55,163
Can I ask y'all something?

150
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,130
Please do.

151
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:03,763
What did Kendu Wallace
ever do to you?

152
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:07,096
I don't care
about Kendu Wallace.

153
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,295
He means nothing to me.

154
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:11,063
Yeah?

155
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:13,030
Obviously.

156
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:21,462
Say "good doggy."

157
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,230
Tell him again.

158
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:32,596
Aww...

159
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,796
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

160
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:38,096
You're a good boy!

161
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,130
Yeah, you're a good boy.

162
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:43,096
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, don't fight it.

163
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,496
Don't fight me...
Hey, look at me, don't fight it.

164
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:47,262
Come on, I'm almost done.

165
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,562
I'm almost done.

166
00:25:57,132 --> 00:26:00,696
Victims ID'd as Kendu
Wallace and Jennifer Richards.

167
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,163
<i>Where's my bro, Rocky?</i>

168
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:13,130
Washing your dirty dog.

169
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:15,662
<i>Hey, careful, that's my baby.</i>

170
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,563
None of that
same stuff again, Eva.

171
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,362
<i>I'm calling from Iraq and
you're still talking about...</i>

172
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,063
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

173
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,796
Who's that causing ruckus
in my house, man?

174
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,130
What?! What?!

175
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,096
Who's calling from the
Middle East?

176
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:47,262
My brother!

177
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:49,362
<i>So you're a free man now,
my nigga.</i>

178
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:50,462
Yeah.

179
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:52,496
Wow. How it feel?

180
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:54,529
I ain't trying
to go back in. Know that.

181
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,729
<i>Hey, but listen to me,
you feel me?</i>

182
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,096
You have to stand up
straight, you know?

183
00:26:59,098 --> 00:27:00,295
You don't have
the same opportunities

184
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:02,030
like you used to have.
Do you hear me, Rocky?

185
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:03,763
<i>Look at me, look at me
in the camera, over there.</i>

186
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:07,030
No, your boy is done.
None of that bullshit.

187
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,462
<i>You like that meat, boy?</i>

188
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:20,796
So everything OK?

189
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,030
You need me
or why you call me here?

190
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:28,596
How's things with you?

191
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,496
Business is good, you know?

192
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:35,162
How you?

193
00:27:35,164 --> 00:27:41,096
Well, they had me down at the
police station the other day.

194
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:42,629
Oh, yeah? Why?

195
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:47,529
Something about some cop
that got murdered.

196
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,329
Um... a DT named Cullen.

197
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,796
Oh, yeah...
yeah, I heard that there

198
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,796
was a cop that got killed over
there in the subway at 191st.

199
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,030
You know, they had some
snitch pictures, man,

200
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,629
of you and some other cat.

201
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,129
Me?

202
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:11,763
No, no, no.

203
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:15,796
Why? I don't know what
you're talking about.

204
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,030
I couldn't figure it out either,
I'm like, you know...

205
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,362
You know,
what type of connection

206
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:21,496
could you have to this,
you know?

207
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,095
Connection?

208
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:26,030
Black, I have no connection
with no cops, man.

209
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:28,796
You know, I'm just...
I'm just out here, you know,

210
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:30,329
I'm always hustling...

211
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:32,729
- Well...
- I don't...

212
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:37,195
It was pictures of you
and some Dominican nigga

213
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,063
in front of, um...

214
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,396
Club Miami.

215
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:47,129
Oh, OK, OK.

216
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:51,596
That's my friend, Rocky.

217
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,595
Yo, Rock, you should let
that nigga go, man!

218
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:57,062
I'm serious, man!

219
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:03,095
Look, my brother,
this is my bro's dog.

220
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:06,496
How am I gonna put the dog
in harm's way? Explain it to me.

221
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:07,562
Good boy!

222
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:09,229
His brother was
a tough ass dude,

223
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,195
that's why he got
a tough ass dog.

224
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:14,195
Munch, the nigga is a dog, B!

225
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,329
Shit, you don't understand!

226
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:18,262
Cut some of that fur off
and you'll get it!

227
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:21,462
So you're talking about Cullen.

228
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,030
Cullen, Cullen,
the Detective Cullen?

229
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:25,496
Oh, man, he's the devil.

230
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,429
He is dirty, man, he's dirty.

231
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,096
Do you know what he did?

232
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:30,763
He violated my nigga
with a stick, man.

233
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,980
He...

234
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,195
I don't even want to talk
about that because it's just...

235
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:41,062
It's just crazy that he did that
to Rocky, who just got out.

236
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,763
He did 3 years,
he never snitched on me before,

237
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:46,662
so I don't know
what he was doing,

238
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:49,796
maybe he was scouting him
or something because...

239
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:51,729
I don't know, but I have
nothing to do with that.

240
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:53,579
I don't know...

241
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,658
I don't know what you
want me to tell you, man.

242
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:00,662
Pay that man.

243
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,129
Shh...

244
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:05,029
You ever seen
one of those ant farms?

245
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,763
I got one for Chrissy
for his birthday last year.

246
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:12,763
He never looks at it,
but I find it fascinating.

247
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:16,329
It's amazing...

248
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,095
Leslie...

249
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:30,062
Anyway this Joey thing...

250
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:33,162
could get pretty ugly
if it's not handled properly.

251
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:37,229
He had a lot of enemies and...

252
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,396
I'm not just talking about
the drug dealers he robbed.

253
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:46,362
I know he was your partner

254
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,295
but Scotty,
he was a fucking idiot.

255
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:54,229
You know, he was very dirty.

256
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:57,562
And, unfortunately,
his dirt caught up with him.

257
00:31:57,564 --> 00:32:00,729
But at least his wife
will get his full pension.

258
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,029
Now, the more you dig
the more you risk

259
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:07,129
screwing up that pension
for his wife and kids.

260
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:11,496
And I don't think you want
that on your conscience.

261
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,596
Like Chrissy's ant farm,
sometimes the ants die.

262
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,696
The other day I'm looking
at a dead one,

263
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:20,062
and he's all the way down
at the bottom,

264
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,095
and all the other ants are...

265
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:25,596
crawling all over him
like it's nothing, you know?

266
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,596
No big deal.

267
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:35,763
And Black, Mr. Jonathan Jones?

268
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,195
There's nothing there.

269
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:40,195
He has motive.

270
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:42,763
What's his motive?

271
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:46,696
It seems like Joey was
maybe blackmailing him.

272
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,462
Extorting him.

273
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,162
I don't know.

274
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:53,462
But he definitely has motive.

275
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:56,696
Mr. Jones.

276
00:32:57,431 --> 00:32:58,729
The Feds have been all over him

277
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,596
for a while now.

278
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,062
Years.

279
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,329
He knew that.

280
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:06,262
He's not killing a cop.

281
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:11,362
OK.

282
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,095
Who else you got?

283
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:17,229
Well, I'm waiting on MTA.
forensics...

284
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,195
There's this girl.

285
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,562
I don't know.

286
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,029
I think she might
know something.

287
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,795
This nigga's buggin'.
I'm lying?

288
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:53,029
Yeah, nigga on some other shit!

289
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,229
Hating is a weak emotion.

290
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,762
Y'all niggas gotta be
better than that, B.

291
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:59,095
How's it going, man?
All good?

292
00:34:01,564 --> 00:34:04,662
Just out here.
What about you?

293
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:08,662
Just chillin', my nigga,
just got off of work.

294
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:15,079
cutting meat.

295
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,062
I got a switch
my whole style up, you feel me?

296
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:19,429
Yeah, man.
I know, I know how it is.

297
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,062
I don't know if you heard,

298
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:23,329
but that detective
you had beef with,

299
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:27,262
somebody caught that nigga
in the subway. He's dead.

300
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:31,579
So what?

301
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,561
I don't care nothing
about that faggot ass cop.

302
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:36,195
Whether he's dead or alive, B.

303
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:50,496
Maybe you should lay low.

304
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:52,429
Yo, my nigga.

305
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:56,029
I already told you, that shit
ain't up for discussion.

306
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,262
Olga.

307
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,062
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

308
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:43,429
Open, open, open!

309
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,129
Open!

310
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:11,195
- OK, you ready partner?
- Yeah, OK.

311
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:13,095
Let's get this over with.

312
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:27,062
Well, our main concern
is for you.

313
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,462
So what are you saying exactly?

314
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:33,561
If things came out
and an investigation

315
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:37,029
were opened on Joey, you know.

316
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:41,795
We wouldn't want that
to jeopardize,

317
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:45,528
you know, Joey's pension.

318
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:53,362
Really?
So you come into my house,

319
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:58,195
my and my dead husband's house,
and you're telling me what?

320
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:01,329
That you're not going
to go after his killer?

321
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:04,062
I want you out of my house.

322
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:07,295
Scotty, make her get
out of my house!

323
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:08,728
I don't want her in here!

324
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,461
OK, partner,
I'll meet you outside.

325
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:20,495
You know what you are, Scotty?

326
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,595
Well, I'll tell you.

327
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,762
You're pathetic.

328
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,795
Look at me.

329
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:32,762
Nobody likes you.

330
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:34,495
Janine...

331
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,195
Don't Janine me.
You had one friend!

332
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:41,062
You had one fucking person
in this world

333
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,428
who gave
a flying fuck about you!

334
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:49,762
Who took you kid every weekend
because you couldn't handle it!

335
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,728
Who watched your son!

336
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,561
You couldn't even take care
of your own fucking son!

337
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:01,595
And this is how you treat him?

338
00:40:45,797 --> 00:40:47,495
What about her?

339
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:55,329
I'm sorry, officer,
my English no good.

340
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,728
If I see him, I call you.

341
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:02,361
Lemme see, lemme see.
You see this guy?

342
00:41:02,363 --> 00:41:04,661
He don't look Dominican,
he look Puerto Rican.

343
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:09,428
OK.

344
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:52,162
He's so young, too.

345
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:11,095
What, you're bigger than me now?

346
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,528
You're bigger than me now?

347
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,046
Lucky!

348
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,728
We regret to inform you
that your son,

349
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,062
Jose Alvarez de la Cruz,
was killed in action.

350
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,795
My nephew is no slouch either.

351
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,728
Let me tell you
how good a cop he is.

352
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,495
He is, in my opinion, the best
doughnut guy we ever had!

353
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:26,595
And he was nice enough
to give a ticket

354
00:43:26,597 --> 00:43:28,261
to an old girlfriend of mine.

355
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:31,428
A chick who, sad to say,
broke the D-man's heart.

356
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,261
How much was that ticket?

357
00:43:33,263 --> 00:43:38,728
Oh, that's right,
$250 for blocking the bus!

358
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,095
I call him
the brains of the outfit.

359
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:34,561
Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry to hear
about your brother, Jose, man.

360
00:44:35,797 --> 00:44:38,261
Just waiting until I clear
my head some more, you feel me?

361
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:40,762
I feel you, but look,

362
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:43,261
the police came
looking for you the other day.

363
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,395
- For real?
- Seriously.

364
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:48,445
Yo, that must be what

365
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:50,095
that nigga Naldo was talking
about, remember?

366
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:52,128
Come on, bra, pay attention.

367
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,095
That nigga Naldo is dead.

368
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:58,595
- That nigga's dead, B?
- Yeah, my dude, nigga's dead.

369
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,361
You just watch your back, man.

370
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:08,361
Word is Black is the one
that killed Naldo.

371
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:09,595
That's crazy, man.

372
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:11,595
Maybe you should just
lay low for a minute.

373
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,161
What is it?

374
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,661
Come on,
what do you got, partner?

375
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,161
I don't know, probably nothing.

376
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:29,695
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

377
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:38,762
- What?
- Tell me about your kids.

378
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:42,561
My kids?

379
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,194
What do you wanna know?

380
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,061
What are they like?

381
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:51,795
They're loud. They're wild.

382
00:45:51,797 --> 00:45:55,128
They're annoying. They're loud.

383
00:45:57,063 --> 00:45:58,628
Yeah.

384
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,029
What about you, huh?

385
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:03,561
What about your kid?

386
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:06,795
- He's quiet.
- Yeah.

387
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:10,261
- And sloppy.
- Yeah.

388
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,128
He's a good kid.

389
00:46:13,797 --> 00:46:15,561
Anthony.

390
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,261
Hey, let me ask you a question.

391
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:51,294
What'd you really
think about Joey?

392
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,094
He was there for me
when my wife died.

393
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,495
Yeah. OK.

394
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,762
Elisa...

395
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:24,261
Isabel.

396
00:47:31,497 --> 00:47:33,028
Isa...

397
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,461
You OK, Mami?

398
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:04,795
OK...

399
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,428
No.

400
00:48:45,063 --> 00:48:47,094
No.

401
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,161
Janine.

402
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:15,094
Keep your eyes closed!

403
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:20,061
OK.

404
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:22,061
Are they closed?

405
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,194
Yeah.

406
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,294
OK.

407
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,528
Happy Birthday.

408
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,294
You remembered.

409
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,794
Of course I remembered.

410
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,495
Now you gotta make a wish.

411
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:44,161
Come on.

412
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:02,194
It's good.

413
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,495
- Janine...
- You gotta relax.

414
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:17,428
The kids won't be
back till tomorrow.

415
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,727
You swore at me
'cause I was mean to you.

416
00:52:21,729 --> 00:52:25,361
- But I lied.
- Yeah.

417
00:52:25,363 --> 00:52:29,261
When I said that you didn't
have no fucking friends.

418
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,028
I'm your friend.

419
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:36,161
And I care about you.

420
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:40,228
Hmm?

421
00:52:43,696 --> 00:52:47,161
- We can't.
- We can't what?

422
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,161
I can't.

423
00:52:50,163 --> 00:52:51,794
What?

424
00:52:58,096 --> 00:53:00,528
Janine...

425
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,128
Janine...

426
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,794
Janine, what?

427
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:06,094
Shh...

428
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:07,561
It's OK.

429
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,528
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

430
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,395
Janine...

431
00:53:18,397 --> 00:53:23,061
If you want to leave,
you can leave.

432
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,761
But it ain't
no good being alone.

433
00:53:37,563 --> 00:53:39,361
Hey...

434
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:47,727
We need some good news.

435
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,660
Gloria...

436
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,128
Gloria...

437
00:55:31,296 --> 00:55:33,761
She needs to leave
this house right now.

438
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,560
Let her parents
take care of her.

439
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:38,328
- I don't want her here!
- I'll tell her to leave.

440
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:46,761
Manuel...

441
00:56:15,096 --> 00:56:17,361
You think I don't feel guilty?

442
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:20,061
I don't know.

443
00:56:20,063 --> 00:56:21,794
Of course I do.

444
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,028
But you should feel way worse!

445
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:28,427
Come on.

446
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:30,494
Don't be a little pussy.

447
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:32,527
We didn't do nothing wrong.

448
00:56:32,529 --> 00:56:36,061
Your wife is dead,
my husband's dead.

449
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,361
We're just human.

450
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,194
I know.

451
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:52,028
Besides,
Joey wasn't no choir boy.

452
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,928
Yeah, I know.

453
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:59,727
I know he took money from
dealers. Everybody knew that.

454
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,128
Yeah.

455
00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:05,460
He did more than that.

456
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:10,294
Remember that... A few years
ago, that Dominican kid?

457
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,194
Yeah, of course.

458
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,028
What about it?

459
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,328
He did do it, Scotty.

460
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:21,194
One day he just broke down,
and he told me everything.

461
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:27,360
But the kid was a real
troublemaker, you know?

462
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:30,094
He was dealing drugs and shit.

463
00:57:31,296 --> 00:57:34,360
Joey said he was just trying
to mess with him, you know?

464
00:57:38,596 --> 00:57:42,761
But I don't want my Joey's name
tarnished with this shit, OK?

465
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,494
I mean, we got kids!

466
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:48,394
I mean, you owe him that much.

467
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,394
Hello?

468
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,394
Hey, buddy, it's me.

469
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:25,161
How's it going?

470
00:59:25,163 --> 00:59:28,061
Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping.

471
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:31,260
I know. I know, OK.

472
00:59:31,262 --> 00:59:33,460
Go back to sleep.

473
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:35,560
<i>Dad, did you get my card?</i>

474
00:59:35,562 --> 00:59:37,560
I did.

475
00:59:38,196 --> 00:59:40,660
It's the best card ever.

476
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,194
You really liked it?

477
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:47,128
I loved it.

478
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:54,394
Uh...
I'm coming down to visit soon.

479
00:59:54,396 --> 00:59:56,128
When?

480
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:00,195
Soon.

481
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,694
I just gotta finish a case here,
and then I'm coming down.

482
01:00:05,729 --> 01:00:08,360
Anthony?

483
01:00:08,362 --> 01:00:12,594
Anthony, OK, go back to sleep.

484
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:15,094
- <i>Oh, Dad...</i>
- Yeah.

485
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:18,161
Did you have a nice birthday?

486
01:00:19,262 --> 01:00:22,660
Yeah, it was good.

487
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:24,161
The, uh...

488
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:31,394
The guys, um... they had
a little cake, you know,

489
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:35,794
and a little something for me
down at the station.

490
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:40,061
It was...
It was real nice.

491
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:47,794
OK, um... go back to sleep, huh.

492
01:00:47,796 --> 01:00:50,427
- I love you.
- <i>Good night, Dad.</i>

493
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:54,227
- <i>I love you, too.</i>
- OK, good night.

494
01:00:55,195 --> 01:00:57,061
Good night, pal.

495
01:01:28,496 --> 01:01:31,694
Olga, Olga...

496
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,660
Mm-hmm.

497
01:02:04,562 --> 01:02:06,494
Olga...

498
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:11,727
Amen.

499
01:03:13,562 --> 01:03:15,093
Amen.

500
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:37,360
Playboy, how much
they pay you up in here?

501
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:38,761
Why, you need a job?

502
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:42,794
Nah, man,
I'm just curious, man.

503
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:44,794
Ah, let me see.

504
01:03:44,796 --> 01:03:49,093
How about some... pig butt?

505
01:03:49,095 --> 01:03:51,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

506
01:03:51,362 --> 01:03:53,227
Pork butt.

507
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,127
Yeah.

508
01:03:56,496 --> 01:03:59,560
Let me get the biggest piece
you got, man.

509
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,694
Yeah.

510
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,160
And trim
all that fat off, homie.

511
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,560
Yeah.

512
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:22,761
Yeah.

513
01:04:22,763 --> 01:04:26,660
You know I like my butt
to be firm, feel me?

514
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:34,027
You know, for some reason

515
01:04:34,029 --> 01:04:36,060
I just feel like
you one of them brothers

516
01:04:36,062 --> 01:04:38,761
that's been violated before,
you know?

517
01:04:38,763 --> 01:04:41,060
Like I don't know what it is,

518
01:04:41,062 --> 01:04:44,427
but I just get
that vibe, you know.

519
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:48,193
That type of energy
from you, man.

520
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:54,727
Have you ever been sodomized
or anything like that before?

521
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:56,761
Now I'm just saying, no, no, no,
hear me out, hear me out,

522
01:04:56,763 --> 01:04:59,494
because if you have...

523
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:02,494
it wasn't your fault.

524
01:05:02,496 --> 01:05:05,311
Because you see,

525
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:08,127
if you decided to kill the
nigga that did it to you.

526
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:13,560
I don't think anybody would
hold that against you, homie.

527
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:19,227
So you obviously know more
about me than I know about you.

528
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,093
- I tell you what.
- What's up?

529
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:26,460
- This is what I need you to do.
- What you need me to do?

530
01:05:26,462 --> 01:05:28,594
I need you to go to the police

531
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:31,594
and tell them
what happened between you

532
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:34,560
and that little faggot cop,
Cullen.

533
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:38,527
Because you see right now

534
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:41,594
they thinking that I'm
the one that killed him.

535
01:05:44,095 --> 01:05:48,460
And you and me both know
that that ain't what happened.

536
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,527
If you came here to kill me,
right?

537
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:54,660
You better make sure
you do a good job, homie.

538
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:58,027
And that's the only thing
I'ma tell you.

539
01:05:59,262 --> 01:06:03,293
You know,
under different circumstances

540
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,761
you could've been
one of my top employees.

541
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,794
Thank you, come again.

542
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:33,193
Mm...

543
01:07:36,229 --> 01:07:42,027
Isabel, I need
to talk to Manuel De La Cruz.

544
01:07:42,029 --> 01:07:44,093
Do you know
where I can find him?

545
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:51,694
Half-a-pound of that now?

546
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:52,793
She's crazy out here.

547
01:07:52,795 --> 01:07:54,594
Nah, we got to get at her.

548
01:07:58,462 --> 01:08:01,527
Isabella Rossellini.

549
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:15,660
A little vacation,
you know, to clear his head.

550
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:42,193
- Dibronski.
- He's downtown.

551
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:44,227
Oh, perfect.

552
01:08:46,596 --> 01:08:48,327
Hey, talk to me.

553
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:52,594
Well, let's see...

554
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:54,327
He's dead.

555
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:56,527
He's dead.

556
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,160
She's dead.

557
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:02,494
Mr. De La Cruz
is nowhere to be found.

558
01:09:02,496 --> 01:09:05,726
And she saw something.
She was there.

559
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:09,060
But what am I gonna do?
Bring her in?

560
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,627
She'll be dead in a week.

561
01:09:11,562 --> 01:09:14,027
No one's saying a thing.

562
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:17,394
And suddenly nobody
speaks English either.

563
01:09:17,396 --> 01:09:20,527
Well, your Spanish is
half-way decent, isn't it?

564
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:24,027
My Spanish fucking sucks,
but that's not the problem.

565
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:27,327
It's just nobody's talking.
Nobody's saying a fucking thing.

566
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,227
And I don't fucking blame them.

567
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:31,693
But somebody knows something.

568
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:34,027
She knows what happened.

569
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:39,760
But what am I gonna do?
Haul her in? Get her killed?

570
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:41,260
Shit!

571
01:10:05,762 --> 01:10:07,193
Are you a known felon?

572
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:11,227
Because Mr. Jonathan Jones here

573
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:15,460
cannot associate
with any known felons.

574
01:10:25,062 --> 01:10:29,360
So this is their new plan?

575
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:34,027
To just sit there
and harass me to death?

576
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,527
What can you do?
They think you killed a cop.

577
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,360
OK.

578
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:22,693
Oh...

579
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,394
I know you.

580
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:28,427
I remember you!

581
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:37,659
I remember you!

582
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,093
Elisa!

583
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:09,793
Huh?

584
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:28,193
Huh?

585
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:45,060
We're going to show Uncle Scotty

586
01:16:45,062 --> 01:16:47,192
how pretty your hair can be.

587
01:16:47,695 --> 01:16:49,192
Her.

588
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:51,060
Who is this?

589
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:53,793
A girl.

590
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:56,192
I can see that.

591
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:02,160
Joey had some photos of her
on his camera.

592
01:17:02,162 --> 01:17:04,793
She's related to the
Dominican kid that he had that...

593
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:06,960
Shh.

594
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:09,126
Hey, sweetheart,
you want to go upstairs?

595
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:12,326
You can go watch some cartoons,
OK?

596
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:14,459
They love TV.

597
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:21,159
Was Joey messing round
with this bitch?

598
01:17:21,161 --> 01:17:22,526
I don't know.

599
01:17:23,294 --> 01:17:24,693
Yeah, so what's your point?

600
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:27,127
I mean, what's this
got to do with anything?

601
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:30,259
I don't know, I just wanted to
know if he mentioned anything,

602
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:34,192
or if you ever saw her
or or anything.

603
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:38,493
No, I never saw her before.

604
01:17:49,328 --> 01:17:52,693
So are you gonna
stay a little while?

605
01:17:52,695 --> 01:17:54,493
I can't.

606
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:57,093
I gotta get to the city.

607
01:17:57,095 --> 01:17:58,726
Whatever.

608
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:12,292
- So that's it?
- That's it.

609
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:15,059
And what about Jonathan Jones?

610
01:19:15,061 --> 01:19:17,292
We're just gonna let him off?

611
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,760
Is your gut telling you
he's our guy?

612
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:25,359
Cause what about the kid
that Joey allegedly sodomized?

613
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:27,059
Any word on him?

614
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:31,459
It's either him
or Jonathan Jones, OK?

615
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:33,393
I know that much.

616
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:36,693
Scotty you're not gonna
drop this, are you?

617
01:19:40,762 --> 01:19:42,426
What is this?

618
01:19:46,128 --> 01:19:47,359
Who is she?

619
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,126
Well, your buddy raped her.

620
01:19:53,528 --> 01:19:56,459
At least that's what she said,
and will say under oath.

621
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:02,026
We're dropping the
investigation, let it go.

622
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:04,259
Your buddy was a rapist.

623
01:20:04,261 --> 01:20:06,626
You understand me?
He was not a good guy.

624
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:11,059
The department's not gonna
take a fall for that prick.

625
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,459
So the case is dropped
for good.

626
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:16,226
It's dead.

627
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:19,726
That's it.

628
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,159
They're not gonna be
bothering you anymore.

629
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:40,326
I got the inside line,
the cops are dropping

630
01:20:40,328 --> 01:20:42,459
the investigation
into Joey Cullen's murder.

631
01:20:42,461 --> 01:20:45,292
And I am 100 percent
certain about that.

632
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:48,493
That's what I want to hear.

633
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:50,659
You did good, Mr. Himmel.

634
01:20:50,661 --> 01:20:54,159
But you know
I woulda killed him,

635
01:20:54,161 --> 01:20:57,092
that crooked-ass cop, Cullen.

636
01:20:57,094 --> 01:21:01,092
But, I guess somebody else
beat me to it.

637
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:05,126
Well, it's all over now.
Right?

638
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,659
Yeah, almost.

639
01:21:09,194 --> 01:21:11,393
One more loose end.

640
01:21:27,428 --> 01:21:29,192
My bigger nigga.

641
01:21:29,762 --> 01:21:31,426
Come on, my dude.

642
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,793
Actually, um...

643
01:21:32,795 --> 01:21:35,393
I'm looking for
that homicidal maniac

644
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:36,693
you be running with, man.

645
01:21:36,695 --> 01:21:39,626
I haven't seen Rocky
in a long time, man.

646
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,793
Well, I got some unfinished
business with him.

647
01:21:41,795 --> 01:21:44,026
Let's talk upstairs, bro.

648
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:30,493
You know,
I'll give you one thing.

649
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:34,026
You definitely
one little tough nigga, man.

650
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:41,760
But you see the game
is over now, playboy.

651
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:44,410
Yeah.

652
01:22:44,411 --> 01:22:47,059
I can't afford you bleeding
on these $1,500 Ferragamo's!

653
01:22:59,728 --> 01:23:03,493
I'll tell you what.
I got it.

654
01:23:03,495 --> 01:23:07,192
I mean that's the least
I can do for you.

655
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:22,393
I told you to make sure
you do a good job.

656
01:23:37,695 --> 01:23:39,026
Isabel?

657
01:25:07,761 --> 01:25:09,426
"Isabel."

658
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,326
Elisa?

659
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,359
Huh?

660
01:25:51,028 --> 01:25:52,626
OK...

661
01:25:58,294 --> 01:26:00,359
Isabel!

662
01:26:02,294 --> 01:26:03,759
Rocky, no.

663
01:30:16,028 --> 01:30:18,092
Isabel...

664
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,358
OK, somebody get her some water.
