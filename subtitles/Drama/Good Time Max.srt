1
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,192
# I think I got this covered

2
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:39,602
# I think I got this mother handled

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,704
# There ain't no particular path

4
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,214
# I got to follow my own way

5
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,747
# Nothing's gonna show me

6
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,185
# No one's gonna own me

7
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,315
# This is my decision, yeah

8
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,380
Max...

9
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,427
# Lay down, wanna lay down

10
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,894
# And dig, I won't dig out

11
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,831
- # Living for...
- Max, don't. You gotta study.

12
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,199
# I don't care, man!

13
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,300
# I'm a caveman

14
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,913
# I don't care, man

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,312
# I'm a caveman

16
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,053
Adam Verbinski.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,223
Good job, Adam.
"A." Good work.

18
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,288
And Max Verbinski.

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
A- plus. Amazing, Max.

20
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,261
- I studied really hard.
- Well, it paid off.

21
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,908
# I'm thankin' my stars

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,005
# The muscle in this car

23
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,846
# Is bangin' like a bloodsicle

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,117
# And love ain't in the air,
so, sucker, get this square

25
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,059
# You better lock up your doors
and daughters

26
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,424
# You'll never be as quick

27
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,523
# This monster's on a chair

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,364
# And this I can promise you

29
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,634
# I'm gonna win

30
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,765
# It's win or die

31
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,468
# I'm gonna win

32
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,440
# Watch me fly

33
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,777
# I don't care, man!

34
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,215
# I'm a caveman

35
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,717
# I don't care, man

36
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,088
# I'm a caveman

37
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,255
Oh, God!
Oh, shit, that's nasty.

38
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,990
- Told you, man. That's the fake shit.
- Fuck.

39
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,831
Yo, check it out. The real shit right here.
All the rest is fake.

40
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,336
- Can't tell the difference, huh?
- Nah.

41
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,533
- We gotta get him to take it from that side.
- All right.

42
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,406
- Shit, I hope this works, genius boy.
- Here we go.

43
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:36,141
Please don't let him be that big.
Oh, shit, he's huge. Fuck.

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,243
What's up, man? Want some
crystalline tropane alkaloid, or what?

45
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,920
What?

46
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,480
Cocaine. That's what
we're talking about, right?

47
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,356
We got some white lines.
100% pure, man.

48
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:53,127
- One kilo. That's what we're talking about.
- Don't talk so much.

49
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,068
- Get out the car.
- Me?

50
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,799
- Yeah, you.
- OK, yeah.

51
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,535
- Stand right there where I can see you.
- Yep.

52
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,149
This stuff... better be pure.

53
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,741
Yeah, man. Pure as snow.

54
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,083
Pure as your girl.

55
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,955
No, uh-uh. Ha-ha.
Take from this side over here.

56
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,634
- It's all the same.
- If it's all the same, won't be a problem.

57
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,847
Yeah.

58
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,076
All right. No problem.

59
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
- It's good.
- Ha-ha. Told you, man.

60
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,674
- Yeah, ha-ha!
- Ha-ha. Pure as your girl.

61
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,052
All right.

62
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,127
All right.

63
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,829
Let me get that for you, sir.

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,214
Motherfucker. Velour's out, bitch!

65
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,591
I could've kicked his ass. I could've
kicked his fuckin' ass. Fucker.

66
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,998
Let's go.

67
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,048
Adam. It's closing time.

68
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,717
Go ahead, Sam.
I'll let myself out.

69
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,143
Ripped your fucking boyfriend off!

70
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,746
Hey, not that side, the other side.

71
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,916
You bet I did.

72
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,953
Just sold him a kilo of inositol
for 20 fucking grand.

73
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,022
What an idiot!

74
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,337
# We walk through the streets

75
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:24,035
# Like lottery winners on acid

76
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,101
Oh.

77
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,780
# We walk through the streets

78
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,377
# Like lottery...

79
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,051
- I don't think that guy respects you.
- Oh, yeah? And you do?

80
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,686
Yeah... I do.

81
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,001
Hold on.

82
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,376
- # If she like Gordon's, I like Gordon's...
- Wait.

83
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,351
# If she like the black stuff
I like the black stuff, too

84
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,019
Please, man...

85
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,457
Stop it! Stop!

86
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,792
Know who I am, motherfucker?
Do you know who I am? Huh?

87
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:22,824
Do you know who the fuck I am? Huh?
How you feel now, Max?

88
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,632
I got the real shit over there.
You can have it all.

89
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,969
- Stop!
- Please, man. Please.

90
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,136
- I got... I got the money.
- Don't worry. The money is mine.

91
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,078
- Stop it!
- Shut the fuck up! You're next.

92
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,508
- Down, Max.
- What?

93
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,573
Down!

94
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,581
You fucked with the wrong motherfucker.

95
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,625
- No!
- Uhh.

96
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,557
Fuck you!

97
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,362
What the fuck are you doing?

98
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,232
Fuck!

99
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,980
With this bowel recession, we see
how the tumor has blocked the bowel,

100
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,682
therefore we resect the bowel
and remove the tumor,

101
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,247
giving our patient a patent G.I. tract again.

102
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,318
If we're not careful to take
a nice margin of healthy tissue

103
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,695
- on either side of the diseased tissue...
- Adam, I need to talk to you.

104
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,291
- I can't right now.
- It's an emergency.

105
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,066
- I'll call you later.
- Could you excuse Adam for one minute?

106
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,130
- You're in deep shit.
- I know.

107
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,766
What are you gonna do?

108
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,539
Maybe you can take me
to California with you.

109
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,980
No. You can forget about that.
You're not putting this on me!

110
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,883
- I'm desperate.
- I am going to be doing my residency.

111
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,081
Do you have any idea how hard that is?

112
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,351
Right, I won't get in your way.

113
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,484
Please, Adam, just help me.

114
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,689
Look, you took the high road,
I'm the big loser.

115
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,755
But I wanna be different now.

116
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:38,395
- Just go with yourself.
- I need a good influence in my life now.

117
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,838
If I live with you,
it might help me clean up my act.

118
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,569
- I've heard that before.
- No.

119
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,669
It'll be different, I promise.

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,240
I'll be good-boy Max.

121
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,977
No more coke?

122
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,349
No more coke.

123
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,088
- Goodbye, my little surgeon.
- Take care, V an.

124
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,329
- So, is Max coming to say goodbye?
- Uh, no.

125
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,540
You're my only son, Max.
Everybody else abandoned me.

126
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,479
I'm not abandoning you.
I just gotta get outta New York.

127
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,881
- I'm in trouble here.
- You're in trouble wherever you go, boy.

128
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,442
It follows you like the plague.

129
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,581
Thanks for the encouragement.

130
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,682
Look, I gotta take off.

131
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,197
- I love you. I'll call you when I get there.
- Yeah, sure you will.

132
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,534
Thanks, buddy.

133
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,444
- You're crazy, you know that?
- I know.

134
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,416
Peace, New York!
Peace to your moms. Ha-ha-ha.

135
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,013
# Turn the lights down

136
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,457
# Come to me

137
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,960
# Trouble's gone now

138
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,671
- # As far as I...
- You broke Mom's heart.

139
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,267
Please! Stop!

140
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,370
You didn't even say goodbye.

141
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,278
Mom loves you, Max.

142
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,011
So what's your game plan
when we get out there?

143
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,613
Stay out of trouble.
Get a job.

144
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,060
- Where?
- Computers or somethin'.

145
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:47,760
- I'll just look in the paper.
- Wind up with some entry-level position.

146
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,735
Don't worry, man. I'll work up quick.
I'm a genius, remember?

147
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,398
Yeah, right.

148
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,701
You think you're smarter than me now,
don't you?

149
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,768
Yes.

150
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:04,077
Really? All right.
Wanna play numbers?

151
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,985
Go ahead. Test me.

152
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,488
All right.

153
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,926
32 times 76.

154
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,630
2,432.

155
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,233
Uhh!

156
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,475
# Let the healing begin

157
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,111
Still got it.

158
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,815
# Let the pain escape...

159
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,757
Look at that.

160
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:00,195
# Takes the worry away

161
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,511
Oh, good God, he smells.

162
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,053
- So how you feelin'?
- OK.

163
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:50,486
- Nice palace, Doctor.
- All right, just give it a chance.

164
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,888
# Verbinski's livin' in the ghetto

165
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,949
Shut up.

166
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,770
Hi. I'm Max Verbinski.

167
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,079
I'm here to see the guy who's hiring.

168
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,681
Come on in.

169
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:34,923
Basically I think I'm, like,
the best guy around at computers.

170
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,437
I mean, if you hire me, I-I...

171
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,066
I'm pretty confident that, uh,
I'll advance very rapidly,

172
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,772
because, well, I think I can pretty much say
I'm better and faster

173
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,644
than anybody else you have here.

174
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,908
Well, actually, uh,

175
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,149
I took this personality test
when I was a kid,

176
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,124
and basically they said
I was, like, one in a million.

177
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,394
Except for my brother.
He's pretty smart.

178
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,523
So, like, one of two in a million.

179
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,236
We'll try you out.

180
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,829
Great. Great.

181
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,375
All right.
Well, put her there, boss.

182
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,837
And punch and duck.

183
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,903
Bend those knees.

184
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,415
Adam, I got it!

185
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,917
- Excellent.
- Wait one second.

186
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,954
Now swing your arms.

187
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,492
Come on, work out with me.
It'll make you feel good.

188
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,053
Come on, girls.

189
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,498
Yeah, I'm gonna be making a tenth
of what I was making before,

190
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,627
but I feel a lot cleaner now.

191
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,797
Well, that's great.
Welcome to the responsible world.

192
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,206
Now... let's do 50 crunches, right now.

193
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,475
Wow, glad you're excited.

194
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,393
Ah, it's good to be at work.

195
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,175
- Hey, Bob.
- Hi, Max. Catch the Lakers?

196
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,614
- Yeah. Go Kobe. Janet.
- Hi, Max. Getting all settled in?

197
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,117
Yeah, I'm gettin' there.
Howdy, Wally.

198
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:39,123
- Maximus, how's it hangin'?
- It's hangin' pretty well, partner.

199
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,352
Hey there, Thor.

200
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:45,625
- Skeet, how are ya, buddy?
- Fine.

201
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,631
I'm pretty fine myself.

202
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:52,261
I'm just glad to be here at MBM.
Ha-ha.

203
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,306
Hey, Max. Just makin' sure
your first week's runnin' smoothly.

204
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,865
- Hey, Bruce. It's goin' A-OK.
- Good.

205
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,707
Skeet, saw your latest designs.

206
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,373
Yeah?

207
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,917
Phew!

208
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,950
Ken doll bastard.

209
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,054
That's funny, man.
That's pretty funny.

210
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,734
- How do you do it?
- What?

211
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,603
Aren't you bored out of your mind?

212
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,137
This will make things exciting.

213
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,977
Aw, no, no, no. I can't do that.
Drugs are bad.

214
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,675
Suit yourself.

215
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,742
You suit yourself.

216
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,142
Hey, bro.
Wanna go to a movie?

217
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,509
No way. I'm beat.
I'm goin' to bed.

218
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,018
Wha?
You're not even gonna work out?

219
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,020
Come on,
let's do 50 crunches right now.

220
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,420
Yeah, right, Hercules.
Not tonight.

221
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,788
The night's young...

222
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,327
Just go hang out
with your friends from work.

223
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,990
- They're all nerds.
- You need to make friends, Max.

224
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,996
Look at this mess.
What, did you shit all over the kitchen?

225
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,238
Max! OK. OK, good.

226
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,904
Max, come on. Come here.

227
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,844
Man, this is so hot.

228
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,577
Oh, man, that's sick.

229
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,415
Gore-Gore Girls.
It's the fucking best.

230
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,286
Sometimes when I'm alone,
I call myself Luke.

231
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,126
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

232
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,393
But I could do some serious damage
to Carrie Fisher.

233
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,160
Oh, yeah.

234
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,895
These rockets are great.

235
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,938
Exact replicas of NASA's
Apollo mission rockets.

236
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:45,409
I wanted to work for Lockheed, to design
missiles, but they wouldn't hire me. Idiots.

237
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,638
Now for some rocket fuel.

238
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,283
- You ever tried? It's crystal meth.
- No.

239
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,553
Oh, man, it's the best.
So much more intense than coke.

240
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,823
And it lasts longer,
so you don't have to snort as much.

241
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,988
Here. Try some.

242
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,974
All right. Twisted my arm.

243
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,741
Time for the show.

244
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,082
Ah, damn.

245
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,320
- Burns.
- Now we're ready for launch.

246
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,259
Blastoff!

247
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,222
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, yeah!

248
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,132
Awesome.
This is like nerds havin' fun.

249
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,192
We're ready, Mission Control.

250
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,602
Three, two, one!

251
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,602
- Oh, man.
- Oh, shit!

252
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,974
Aah!

253
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,410
- Oh!
- Oh!

254
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,572
Man.

255
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,640
What the fuck do you think you're doin'?!

256
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,047
Sorry, Joel. It was a misfire.

257
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,522
Fuckers.

258
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,790
Stay in your hole over there. You think
it's fun to burn other people's houses?

259
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,128
- Fuck! Cost me 150 bucks!
- Speed freak!

260
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,464
Have some of your own medicine!

261
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,800
- What are you doin'? Stop that.
- I got him.

262
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,862
Yeah!

263
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,340
- That's it. You are so dead.
- Get him, Max!

264
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,502
- You like that? I got him.
- Yeah!

265
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:30,070
We'll get you back!
Max, go!

266
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,275
Yeah! Oh, shit!

267
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,021
Roscoe, sic his balls!

268
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,381
Ha-ha.

269
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,554
- Max, can I come in?
- Uh, hang on.

270
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,968
Don't have to be at the hospital till
after four. Thought we'd go to the beach.

271
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,267
Sorry, bro.
I already have plans.

272
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,036
I took your advice.
I made a friend.

273
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,009
That's great.

274
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,069
Happy girl hunting.

275
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,382
Hi.

276
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,286
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ladies.

277
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,561
Drinking alcohol on the beach is illegal.

278
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,068
But I won't tell.

279
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,661
Fuck you.

280
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,104
Asshole.

281
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,155
Baby. Feels good.

282
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,216
Yeah.

283
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,284
- Whoo.
- Whoo!

284
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,661
Thank you. Thank you!

285
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,633
Yes! You are hot!

286
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:36,402
My brother thinks he's gonna be a doctor.
I'm the doctor of love. Yes!

287
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:42,245
Hello, America,
and welcome to "Fact or Fiction?"

288
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,010
I'm your host, Ron Vicker.

289
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,678
Now on today's show,
let's welcome back ourchampion, Bunny.

290
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,415
- Hi.
- Oh, Bunny, come on in.

291
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,895
Psst.

292
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,077
- Whoo! Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

293
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,307
Hey, what are you guys doin'?

294
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,011
Ohh, is that cocaine?

295
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,611
No, man. This stuff's better.

296
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,053
Want some?

297
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,293
- Oh.
- All right.

298
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,229
- Did you get signed consent?
- Yes.

299
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,329
- X-rays?
- They're... I had them.

300
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:45,035
Goddamn it, Verbinski.
Get back to Radiology and get them, now.

301
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,101
One minute. Why am I still seeing you?

302
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,772
This is gonna help you relax, sir.

303
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,351
Ah-ah. What about the Betadine?

304
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,412
- Sorry. First time I put in a chest tube.
- That's OK. You're doing just fine.

305
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,824
- I think this guy's got a dropped lung.
- Let me see the film.

306
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,862
You're right. Can I get some help?

307
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,194
Yeah!

308
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,133
Who are you kidding, man?
You're a total fucking wimp.

309
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,830
I may look like one,
but I know how to throw a punch.

310
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,342
- I can take a punch, too.
- Oh, yeah? Let's see what you got.

311
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,938
- Doctor, we need your help over here.
- Start up another kit.

312
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,380
- Where's the other intern?
- Page him again.

313
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,749
- Doctor, please?
- I'll be right there.

314
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,788
Ooh! Ooh.

315
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,153
Ohh.

316
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,589
Ooh!

317
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,428
Yeah!

318
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:43,263
- Ow!
- Ooh, ooh. Man, what are you doin'?

319
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,896
- Oh!
- Shit. Dude.

320
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,999
Why'd you do that, Max?

321
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,102
Don't hit me on top of the head, partner.

322
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,477
Hey, what the hell's goin' on in here?

323
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,944
Who's back there?

324
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,956
Skeet, clean him up.
Bob, get back to work.

325
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,993
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,961
Max. Come here, I wanna talk to you.

327
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,055
Come here.

328
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,695
Did you punch him?

329
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,365
Yeah.

330
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,776
Nice shot.

331
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,213
- Thanks.
- I've always hated that bumpkin.

332
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,277
So, you wanna go out tonight?
Could use a wingman.

333
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,082
Indeed.

334
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,350
Is that a yes or a no, Max?

335
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,415
Indeed, yes.

336
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,954
No fighting on company time, Wally.

337
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,663
I'm sorry.

338
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,198
Oh, man, I am so fuckin' horny.

339
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,704
Indeed.

340
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,105
Indeed.

341
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:02,442
# Gotta save yourself
'Cause the world don't love you no more

342
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,505
All right, man, she's yours.

343
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,345
Hi.

344
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,887
Fuck you.

345
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,013
Another round.

346
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,187
I'm not good with girls my age.
I date younger chicks.

347
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,126
No, no, no, no, it's not you.

348
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,155
They aren't out for a killer lay.
They got their good fucks in college.

349
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,964
- What do I say to 'em?
- Look, we're not dealing with geniuses.

350
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,801
These girls wanna be movie stars.

351
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,706
Oh, man! There's Janet.

352
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:36,180
I been waiting to fuck her
since she transferred to our office.

353
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,238
- Janet?
- Yeah, man.

354
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,650
Love ballin' nerdy chicks.
I feel like a hero.

355
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,815
# Don't love ya no more

356
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,647
# Aah

357
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,013
# There's no way

358
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:19,080
# Out, there's no way out
There's no way out

359
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,188
# There's no way out
There's no way...

360
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,821
Hey, how are you doin'?
Uh, I'm a producer.

361
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,888
- Wow. Really?
- I produce movies.

362
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,595
- I'll put you in one of my movies.
- You'll put me in one of your movies?

363
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,637
I'm Max.

364
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,674
- King of the bedroom?
- I'll be the judge of that.

365
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,606
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah, yeah!

366
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,667
Oh, man, I love this song.

367
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:45,273
# There's no way out

368
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,623
Don't hurt yourself.
There's a...

369
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,869
Wow. Wow, thanks.

370
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,500
- Would have been here all night.
- You'll still be here all night.

371
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,510
Yeah.

372
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,739
Well...

373
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,952
Whoo!

374
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,988
Whoo-hoo!

375
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,182
Whoo-oo hoo-hoo!

376
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm gonna get you.

377
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,557
Ah! Ah.

378
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,363
Gotcha. I gotcha, bunny-wunny.

379
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:43,464
What if I told you all I like to do
is watch soap operas and have orgasms?

380
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,838
I love you.

381
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,838
Well, see, I used to have this little bunny,
and it was so cute,

382
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,350
but it never let you pet it, you know,
and it was so frustrating.

383
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,012
It was like... like a furry little tease,

384
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,920
and I wanted to, like, catch it
and jerk off on it.

385
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,421
- So we're on for this weekend?
- I can't wait to meet Terry.

386
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:07,487
- Aw, man, she's great.
- I got special plans for us this weekend.

387
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,396
You and Bruce?

388
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,867
Wally, clean it up.

389
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,235
I just can't picture it. Since when
do you hang around with Mr. Universe?

390
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,300
I hang out with everyone.
Everyone likes me.

391
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,711
I'm not gonna hang out with that guy.

392
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,443
So don't.

393
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,781
Max Verbinski.

394
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,152
Hey, brother Adam.
What's up?

395
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,091
Oh, I'm just hangin'
with my computer buddies.

396
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,459
Dinner. 8:00.
What's the occasion?

397
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,023
Surprise?

398
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,763
All right, long as you're payin'.

399
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,635
I'm flat as a matzah.

400
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,665
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Peace.

401
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,440
- Cool.
- Time to work.

402
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,039
You had to say that.

403
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,883
Yo, Skeet.

404
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,618
Got any of the good stuff
from the other day?

405
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,991
You're out of control.
I don't feel right about it.

406
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,053
Fuck.

407
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,595
Max, you don't have any on you, do you?

408
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,934
Got any cash?

409
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,030
Yeah, I got 20 bucks.

410
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,442
All right. I'll join ya.

411
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,387
Wow, this is...
this is great, Adam.

412
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,763
It reminds me of the old days in New York.

413
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,930
Look, first of all, I want you to know
how proud I am of you.

414
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,441
I mean, being clean for so long.

415
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,341
I never thought you could really do it.

416
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,311
Yeah. Thanks, man.

417
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,872
And because of that,
I have a little surprise for you.

418
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,683
Wait a second here.
What did you do, Adam?

419
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,784
- Did you set up a double date for us?
- You got it, baby.

420
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,233
Nurses?!

421
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,067
Oh, my gosh. It's too much.

422
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,867
Hi, I'm Trixie.

423
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,845
I'm Ditsie.

424
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,644
I dropped my fork.

425
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,047
Um...

426
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,384
- Who's your big brother?
- You are.

427
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,158
- Gotta dance.
- All right.

428
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,198
All right, let's get crazy!

429
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,357
Yeah!

430
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,130
Max! Max! Max! Max!

431
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,693
Max! Max!

432
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,070
Max! Max! Max!

433
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,665
- Max!
- Max!

434
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,210
- Max!
- Max! Max!

435
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,008
- Max! Max!
- Max!

436
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,879
Max! Max! Max!

437
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,645
Max! Max!

438
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,047
Max?

439
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,784
Max.

440
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,595
Mom?

441
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,222
V an?

442
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:33,032
This is the surprise I talked about. I wanted
to show 'em how well you were doing.

443
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,368
Why'd you bring her here?
She hates me.

444
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,603
As if you haven't given her
enough reason. Shame.

445
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,008
Shame? Look at your hairstyle.

446
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,014
Honey, honey,
when are you gonna learn?

447
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,051
Zebras don't change their stripes.

448
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,817
- Yeah.
- Hey!

449
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,418
Whoo!

450
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,924
Whoo!

451
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,798
# The smoke nearly choked the stars

452
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,637
# When I put you out

453
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,804
# To think this was...

454
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,575
Nice.

455
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,411
#... it would go

456
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,850
- Ready to fly, girls?
- Ready to fly.

457
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,616
# And for five...

458
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,152
#... I let you burn

459
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,455
# I said, for five...

460
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,657
Max, she's asking if it's safe.

461
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,168
This is the first time
I've ever had any people up in the plane.

462
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:42,730
- Four times he's practiced.
- It's really pretty up here.

463
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,868
What'd I tell you? I told you it's gonna be
a great day, and it's a great day.

464
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,903
- Wow. That's impressive.
- Yeah.

465
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,883
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

466
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,146
Hey, can I try for a minute?

467
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,523
The plane is yours.
Take the controls.

468
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,082
Oh.

469
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,958
- Ah!
- Don't fuck up.

470
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,326
- Wow!
- Whoo!

471
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,525
Fucked up!

472
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,541
- Max, what are you doing?
- I don't know.

473
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,448
- There's something out there!
- There's nothing out there.

474
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,145
- Guys...
- Aah! My God!

475
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,710
A bird!

476
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,484
- You're hallucinating.
- It's a pterodactyl!

477
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,527
Pterodactyl, my ass!
Give me the fucking controls!

478
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,620
- You're hallucinating!
- God, he's coming right at us!

479
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,892
- Give me the controls.
- I'm fuckin'...

480
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,502
Stop it, Max!

481
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,438
You fuckin' let go!

482
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,907
- I'm not letting go!
- Stop it!

483
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,261
What the hell?

484
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:25,036
- Adam, what the hell's going on?
- You promised me. No more drugs.

485
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,442
I said no more cocaine.
This isn't coke.

486
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,380
- I really thought you were changing.
- I am. I just got a promotion!

487
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,747
Shh.

488
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,117
- Keep your voice down.
- Why?

489
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,022
- You gotta move out.
- What the fuck, ma...

490
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,358
Look, you don't even know
what happened to me today. I almost died.

491
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,193
I want you outta here, Max.

492
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,827
You don't even care.
Fucking cold-hearted.

493
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,761
Is everything all right, Adam?

494
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,967
- Who's this?
- None of your business.

495
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,812
What, she pop your cherry?

496
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,474
Shut up and get out!

497
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,512
No.

498
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,058
- Get out.
- Uh-uh.

499
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,563
Hey.

500
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,894
Hey!

501
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,629
This isn't funny. Now get out!

502
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,228
No.

503
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,331
Hey.

504
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,870
Fine.

505
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,778
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

506
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,624
Ohh. Oh, my...

507
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,893
There you go, Doc.
Left you a little stool sample.

508
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,296
- My favorite rug.
- Oh, my...

509
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:05,599
Oh, that's great, Bunny.
As you know, Bunny has won $17,000...

510
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,439
Oh, my God.

511
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,638
You all right?

512
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,911
- You thinking about your brother?
- Yeah.

513
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,856
Adam.

514
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,291
Good pickup. You're the only one
who caught that bleeder.

515
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,853
That's terrific work for an intern.
You're assisting tomorrow.

516
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,922
Seven a. m. in Surgery.

517
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,831
Thank you, sir.

518
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,370
Dr. Verbinski.

519
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,533
I'm sorry I shit on your favorite rug.

520
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,202
Was it hard to clean up?

521
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,268
I hope you die.

522
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,154
What did he say?

523
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,658
That we're brothers forever.

524
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,207
Here we are, buddy.

525
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,005
This is what they call the Grand Canyon.

526
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,376
It's a big one.

527
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,550
- This is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

528
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,013
They put a canopy up over this.

529
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,547
You gotta just kinda jump to get over.

530
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,892
Now it's behind the clouds, man.

531
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:51,073
- It's starting to get warm, don't you think?
- Mm-hm.

532
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,708
Look at that.

533
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,617
There it is.

534
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,656
- Oh, my gosh.
- There it is.

535
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,714
Look at that.

536
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,622
Whoo!

537
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,061
It's pretty much right on time.

538
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,122
That is sweet.

539
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,702
It's a beautiful thing right there, Max.

540
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,408
What is this, a business meeting?

541
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,811
Bob, Janet, can you give Max and I
a second, please?

542
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:42,824
Look, Max, this is your warning.
I dare you to bring that shit in here again.

543
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,634
Ohh. Ahh.

544
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,238
Whoo! Brucie, Brucie, Brucie puce-y.

545
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,506
- Can kiss my ass.
- Yes, indeed.

546
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,585
Hey, Skeety dog.
I think Skeety dog needs some love.

547
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,485
Cut it out.

548
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,855
- Bruce said he needs to see you.
- Ohh.

549
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,156
Skeety dog, the messenger boy.

550
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,433
MBM. Max Verbinski speaking.

551
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,696
Max, it's your old man.

552
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,139
Hey, Dad.
I was just gonna call you.

553
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,803
Savor it, it's been a year -
and don't worry, I didn't miss you.

554
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,813
I called to tell you
I can't make your brother's wedding.

555
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,371
His wedding?

556
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,646
And I know your brother Adam
doesn't really wanna see me.

557
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,744
I guess you're on your own, son.

558
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,289
- Take it easy.
- OK.

559
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,537
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, have a seat.

560
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,604
Max, the work you did
on your last assignment was substandard.

561
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,877
Oh, man, I had an off week.

562
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,250
You should see the stuff I'm doing now.
It is amazing.

563
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,722
- Max, you have a problem.
- Oh, get outta here! I'm fine.

564
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,554
Don't bullshit me.

565
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:19,460
Having a near-death experience
doesn't mean you have to turn into a jerk.

566
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,226
I'm giving you a chance, man.
Take it or leave it.

567
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,291
But I'm a genius, man.
Aren't there special rules?

568
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,564
Well... Look.

569
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,199
You are corrupting my employees,
you are totally out of control.

570
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,837
The party has gone on way too long,
and it's time to stop.

571
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,778
This is so lame, man.

572
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:41,875
Max, I'm not firing you.
I'm giving you a choice.

573
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,250
A choice? Choose this.

574
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,687
Ohh! You fuckin' bastard.

575
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,456
No, I don't wanna fight.

576
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,093
- What?
- Got fired.

577
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,366
- Didn't you get the choice to go to rehab?
- Yep.

578
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:06,170
- So go.
- Nah. Think I'm gonna take some time off.

579
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,735
What do you mean?
Don't you think you have a problem, Max?

580
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,646
I'll probably quit drugs tomorrow.

581
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,980
I just don't wanna work anymore.

582
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,395
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

583
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,426
- What about money?
- Maybe we can switch around.

584
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,874
- I'll watch soaps all day, you go work.
- I don't know how to do anything.

585
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,933
I don't like to work.

586
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,254
Well, what are we gonna do?

587
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,093
- Tsk. Guess it's time to ramble.
- What?

588
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,660
Sometimes you just gotta ramble.

589
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,897
Bro, this shit looks good.
I'm gonna fuck 17 hookers tonight.

590
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,305
I ain't gonna stop
till they rip my dick off at the base.

591
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,775
This is the good shit.
This is the "go fast. "

592
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,540
We can get 20 grand easy
on the street for this.

593
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,913
- Fuckin' 40 grand, my friend.
- You ain't bullshittin'?

594
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,785
T- Ray.

595
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,794
- Look, T-Ray.
- Huh?

596
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,831
Bro, you see that giraffe, bro?

597
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,970
Just smoke, man.

598
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,032
Ah. Ah.

599
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,176
Yeah.

600
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,615
Yeah.

601
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,154
Hello?

602
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,629
Where have you been?
I've been calling all day.

603
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,893
Hey. It's been a while.

604
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,299
Max, you know why I'm calling.

605
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,360
I'm calling about Dad.

606
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,808
What's up?

607
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,311
I just got off the phone
with the doctors in New York.

608
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,176
- They think Dad only has a couple days.
- Oh, jeez.

609
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:34,479
We gotta catch a plane tonight.
I'll work out the flight.

610
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,285
OK? Just meet me at 9:30 at the pier.

611
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,585
All right. I'll be there.

612
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,602
Yep! Ah.

613
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,935
Oh, yeah.

614
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:01,000
- I gotta go to New York. My father's dying.
- I'm sorry.

615
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,706
Take care of this for me?
Guard it with your life.

616
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,213
- All right.
- Hey.

617
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,349
Now you just blow
that "guard that with my life" stuff?

618
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,655
- Hi.
- Hi there.

619
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,491
Tell me you're here alone.

620
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:24,432
I'm out on the prowl. Looks like
you're the man with all the action.

621
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,766
What do I gotta do to get a bag like that?

622
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,932
What do I gotta do to get a bag like you?

623
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,546
Ooh, ooh, my fuckin' balls are blue!

624
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,785
Whoo!

625
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,663
Damn, you're hot.

626
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,504
- What's your name?
- I don't know.

627
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:49,476
# Hold on, hold on

628
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:54,249
# Hold on, hold on...

629
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,752
Heat it up.

630
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,226
Gonna burn the place up, dude.

631
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,670
I'll burn as much as I want.

632
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,937
By the '70s, the big bang theory
was already well established.

633
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,813
So they tried to come up with alternative
scenarios for the universe's evolution,

634
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:25,150
like, what if you mess around with gravity
or strength of the electromagnetic force?

635
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:29,215
What do you think that will do
to the universe's evolution?

636
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,227
- Nothing.
- Wrong, dumbass.

637
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,391
Even the slightest tinkering
derails the whole process.

638
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,026
You're just focusing on what you want to.

639
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,663
There's just as much evidence
for a random universe,

640
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,731
that life is completely insane and chaotic.

641
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,606
What are you talking about, man?

642
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:51,545
Even the most seemingly random events
have logic behind them.

643
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:55,176
As far as my life goes,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

644
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,083
Geniuses don't make mistakes.

645
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,349
They instigate their own problems

646
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:03,086
so they can be worked out
for deeper insight.

647
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,993
Chaos is harder to embrace.

648
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:11,000
It's scary to think there's no one out there
looking out for us.

649
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,526
Just smoke, man.

650
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:17,164
# Hold on, hold on

651
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:23,973
# Hold on, hold on

652
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:45,130
# Hold on, hold on

653
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,396
# Hold on...

654
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,995
- Hey.
- Hey.

655
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,779
- Come here to Mama.
- It's been a long night.

656
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:02,717
# Hold on, hold on

657
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,346
I really gotta get going.

658
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,822
# Hold on...

659
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,518
Carl?!

660
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,061
- Christine, who the fuck is this?!
- Carl...

661
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,689
Shut up, bitch.
You been gone two fucking days!

662
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,892
- Don't! Leave him alone!
- Come on, I didn't do anything!

663
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,734
- Shut up and get out!
- I don't even know her name!

664
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,137
Hey, man, come on, I...

665
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,773
- Let's get out of here.
- Where we goin', man?

666
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,833
I got an idea.

667
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,630
Tuck that shit in, man.

668
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,846
- Yes?
- Uh, hi, uh... Jo.

669
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:44,520
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm Max. Adam's brother?
Remember we met one time?

670
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,716
Oh, yes. You shat on the carpet.

671
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,659
- Is-is Adam here?
- No, he's not back from work yet.

672
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,391
Um... well, could we wait for him?

673
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,524
Uh...

674
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,967
Blood pressure's dropping.

675
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,834
I need some more suction.
I can't see.

676
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,703
- 110 over 70.
- Not there, here.

677
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,435
100 over 60.

678
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,939
- I need another clamp.
- Hell, we just lost the pulse.

679
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,073
Open up the IV s full bore.

680
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,266
Fuck.

681
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,264
Oh, yeah, that's it. Yeah.

682
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,200
Put that away. Put that away.

683
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,041
Hey, Adam.

684
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,343
How you doin'?

685
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,441
What the fuck are you doin' here?

686
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,453
I... I just came by
so we could go visit Dad.

687
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,718
- He's dead.
- Aw, shit.

688
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,852
- We all missed you at the funeral.
- You guys had a funeral without me?

689
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,125
What the fuck do you care?
You wouldn't have come anyway.

690
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,792
Yeah, I would have.

691
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:42,435
You know I was with him to the very end?
He could have cared less.

692
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,338
All he kept asking for was you.

693
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,979
I'm sorry. Look, if it was Mom,
you know she would have asked for you.

694
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,709
Would it have been so hard
to just jump on a plane?

695
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,549
One time, do the right thing.
Just... just once.

696
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,056
I'm sorry. There was a lot of traffic.
I couldn't meet you.

697
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:04,389
Oh, you-you fucking liar!
Is nothing important to you?

698
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,691
- I really wanted to be there.
- Bullshit!

699
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,891
I did. I'm here now.
A- A-Are you OK?

700
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,333
No, Max, I'm not OK.
Are you gonna take care of me?

701
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,035
That's a fuckin' joke. Get out.

702
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,574
- What?
- Get out!

703
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,270
- Is that how you want it?
- Get the fuck out!

704
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,285
- Get the signed consent?
- Got it right here.

705
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,418
- X-rays?
- Uh, no.

706
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,622
- Where the fuck are they?
- Radiology.

707
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,996
You want me to get 'em?
Maybe we should ask the patient.

708
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,195
Has everybody else done their job today?

709
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:51,659
- Hey, Cohen.
- Yeah?

710
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,963
- Sorry I yelled earlier.
- It's OK. It's my fault.

711
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,796
No, you're doing great.

712
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,702
It's just that I have a temper sometimes.
But I'm working on it.

713
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:05,036
OK.

714
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,595
Dr. Verbinski,
they need you in O.R. 4 now.

715
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,654
I'll be right there.

716
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,634
Oh, yeah. That's it. Good.

717
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,718
Max?

718
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,894
Max?

719
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,357
Adam, Max just called. He's in jail.

720
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,825
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to tell him.

721
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:55,129
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

722
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,997
So what does your attorney say?

723
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,696
Uh, well, I mean,
he said I'll probably be out

724
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:05,070
in, like, six months on parole.

725
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,668
I mean, I'll have to do community service
for, like, the rest of my life,

726
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,508
but... well, at least I'll be free.

727
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,576
But at least I'm clean. I mean,
I haven't used since I got in here.

728
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,711
Oh, congratulations.

729
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,256
Yeah, did they, uh, throw a party for ya?

730
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,390
How you doin'?

731
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,021
I'm fine.

732
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,690
Oh.

733
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:36,069
Well, what are you gonna do
when you get out of here?

734
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,969
I don't know.

735
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,100
I'll think of something.
I'm always resourceful.

736
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,236
I want you to come stay with me.

737
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,910
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:51,742
OK.

739
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,548
OK.

740
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,390
I'll... I'll do it.

741
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,262
Thanks.

742
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,666
I'm glad you're my brother.

743
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,131
I'm glad you're my brother.

744
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,417
We, uh, set up a room for you.

745
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,964
Wow. This is really great.

746
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,333
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, no problem.

747
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,032
Uh, dinner's at 7:00 sharp.
Adam likes to eat on time.

748
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,698
OK.

749
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,766
I'm really grateful.

750
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,869
Adam's orders.

751
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,576
So just let me know if you need anything,
and I'll be in the kitchen.

752
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,174
- OK.
- OK.

753
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,485
Doctor, your glove.

754
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,027
Let me get you another one.

755
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,528
Doctor?

756
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,697
Are you OK?

757
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,598
Yeah.

758
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,404
Yeah, I'm just tired.

759
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,743
- You don't look OK.
- I'm fine.

760
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:07,821
Adam, can I, uh, can I speak to you
outside in the hallway for a second?

761
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,120
No, all right?

762
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,025
Now just... put the patient under.

763
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:55,328
Something's wrong.
We have to talk about this at some point.

764
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:59,431
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't want to.

765
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,266
Hi, Max.

766
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,107
Hi.

767
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,149
You sure you're all right?

768
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,650
Yeah.

769
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,310
OK.

770
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,618
Why don't you swing by the hospital
tomorrow around noon?

771
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,681
We can have lunch together.

772
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,420
OK.

773
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,189
All right.

774
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,787
- I'll see ya tomorrow.
- Yeah.

775
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,387
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,427
I'm here to meet my brother,
Dr. Adam Verbinski.

777
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,792
OK.

778
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,696
- Hey, Adam.
- Max, what are you doin' here?

779
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,566
- You said we were going to lunch.
- Doctor.

780
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,196
- I did?
- Yeah.

781
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:07,902
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm not even hungry.

782
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,878
- What are you doin'?
- I'm working.

783
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,351
So, what, you don't wanna go?

784
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:25,655
- Adam? It's over, son.
- Can I help you?

785
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,696
- Dr. Verbinski?
- Yes.

786
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,823
I'm Lieutenant Lally.
I have a warrant for your arrest.

787
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,926
They showed me this tape.
Your privileges are suspended.

788
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,234
These gentlemen will escort you
from the premises.

789
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,036
I'm not going anywhere.
Get out of my office!

790
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,102
- Turn around. Take it easy.
- Get the fuck away from me!

791
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,774
- Get off me!
- Dr. Verbinski, please.

792
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:52,048
- Open your hands!
- What's goin' on?! Where you takin' him?

793
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,177
Find myself a pretty lady...

794
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,416
...big home, nice car,

795
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,509
baby.

796
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,816
I don't know.

797
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,016
It's not really that important right now.

798
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,890
Lotta work to do.

799
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,427
You got work to do?

800
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,262
Yeah, I got work to do.
So do you.

801
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,794
Get your shit together.

802
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:20,237
You're this close, man.

803
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,675
- What?
- What?

804
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,646
What do you mean, "this close"?

805
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,875
I said, "You're this close. "

806
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:34,852
To what?

807
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,790
To gettin' your shit together.

808
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,704
Think Mom... really misses me?

809
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,609
Course she does.

810
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,112
She loves you.

811
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,451
Hey!

812
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,753
Hey, sorry I'm late, man.
What happened?

813
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,996
My license has been suspended.

814
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,004
I can't practice medicine for two years.

815
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,699
Oh, man.

816
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,440
Plus, Jo kicked me out.

817
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,501
I'm sorry.

818
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,949
What are you gonna do?

819
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,008
I don't know.

820
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:43,286
Well, if you want, you can come stay
at my apartment till you figure it out.

821
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,850
I mean, it ain't much,
but... I got a job.

822
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,294
I'm movin' on up.

823
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,561
- Let me show it to you right now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

824
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:54,864
- You're welcome to stay there.
- Great.

825
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:58,373
Hey, I've matured since the last time.

826
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,806
- I've matured.
- I don't know.

827
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,343
Come on.

828
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:05,278
Look, let me take care
of you for a while.

829
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,076
We'll go to meetings together.

830
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,812
We'll be just a couple of geniuses
hanging out.

831
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,877
- Maybe.
- Ha.

832
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,956
- I just know that I'm very humble.
- Humble, my ass!

833
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,499
I'm just proud of how humble I am,
that's all.

834
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,432
You should be humble.

835
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:16,746
# Turn the lights down

836
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:23,053
# Come to me

837
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:30,897
# Trouble's gone now

838
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:37,235
# As far as I can see

839
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,072
# Let the healing begin

840
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,012
# Let the pain escape

841
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:57,950
# Comfort settles in

842
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,558
# Takes the worry away
