1
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,733
- Was it 205?
- 205th

2
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,733
What the hell, man?

3
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,150
Keep your mouth shut!

4
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,358
Fucking ...!
Sit down!

5
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,400
- What?
- Tristan?

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,650
Who the hell are you?

7
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:03,692
- Did you call the cops?
- They should not be fucking here!

8
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:06,775
Are you good now? Are you happy?

9
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:10,650
Why don't we just talk?
What are you doing out here in the country?

10
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,650
I live here.
What are you doing here?

11
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:17,650
- What's wrong? What is this?
- It's not shit.

12
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:21,483
- Have you used your own shit?
- Fuck, you're a fagot.

13
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,983
If it is to have the elf in there, take him.

14
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,025
He didn't do anything. Fuck off!

15
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,608
What the hell?
You smashed down my door!

16
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,608
Now sit down
and relax.

17
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:39,067
- You ruined my door, man!
- Sit down.

18
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:43,858
- Do you have a warrant?
- What's in there? Move.

19
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:53,108
- Don't!
- Go to the kitchen!

20
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,400
This is my apartment.

21
00:03:55,567 --> 00:04:00,275
- Simon. We need some assistance.
- I told you to sit down.

22
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,858
The police are here.
They have broken into our apartment.

23
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,733
- Andreas!
- Don't, man!

24
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,525
Don't do that!

25
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:16,025
- Let me go! Ouch!
- Now don't move!

26
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,233
- I got him.
- Damn!

27
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,608
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

28
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:26,525
- Is that your child?
- It is ours, fucking cunt!

29
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,858
You have a young Tristan?
This is a joke.

30
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,442
Come here, little buddy.

31
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,483
Sh. Up with you.
Sh sh.

32
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,400
- Give him to me.
- Stop. Sit down.

33
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,775
Sit down, I said!

34
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,775
- What's your name?
- Sanne.

35
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:53,317
- Why do you have a child with a psychopath?
- What's it to you, man?

36
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,400
- Are you a junkie? What?
- No.

37
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,942
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

38
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:07,150
He is also ice cold.
Give him some damn clothes.

39
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:12,192
- Give him to me now.
- And you?

40
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,483
- No.
- No?

41
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:19,567
- Do you have infant formula?
- Tristan drank it.

42
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,817
Shut up, bitch!

43
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,900
- So.
- Now give him to me. Give him to me!

44
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,233
Give him to me.

45
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,067
Yes, it's not funny.

46
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,400
- Hi there.
- Give him to me.

47
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:06,733
- Hello!
- Hi, honey.

48
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,817
Oh, how nice.

49
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,150
Hey, little man. Hello.

50
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:23,317
- Why did you call?
- You have been so strong.

51
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:28,817
- It was stupid. Sorry.
- It's okay. But it was weird.

52
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:33,608
There was some trouble in an apartment.
One guy I had arrested in Copenhagen.

53
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:41,900
And then it turns out,
he's got a little boy.

54
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:47,525
This baby was covered
in his own shit and piss. Ice cold.

55
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:54,317
And then I just...
So I wanted to call you.

56
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,442
Yes, I did.
You are just about to fall asleep.

57
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,983
You're so fine.

58
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,150
Oh, are you mad now?

59
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,525
- I'll drive with him.
- No, I will.

60
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,150
Shh.

61
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,400
- Shouldn't I come with you?
- No, you go to sleep.

62
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,775
You gotta get your pacifier.

63
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:03,525
Shh, shh. Shh, shh.

64
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:08,108
There. It's all right. So.

65
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,233
So. It's all right.

66
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:24,733
You just wanted to go for a ride
so you can fall asleep.

67
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:45,900
When your child is otherwise sound and healthy,
it can't be forced to be taken away.

68
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,400
It looked like shit!
They're junkies!

69
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:54,067
Her drug test is negative.

70
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:57,442
Why were we not announced that
Tristan was released?

71
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:02,233
Because he has a registered address
in Værebroparken.

72
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,067
Otherwise they had informed.
He is out on three years probation.

73
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:09,608
- We better know it.
- He is not listed as the father.

74
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,483
Only because there is no child support
was to retrieve.

75
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:18,192
Now see what he usually does to his girls.

76
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:24,442
The man must be locked up again. The child should
be taken away. The man is the star psychopath.

77
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:29,983
We need something on him.
He will end up beating them both to death.

78
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:36,275
- Andreas?
- Yes.

79
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:39,817
- Is Simon free?
- Yes, it's his son's birthday.

80
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:44,275
He's at a restaurant with
Trine and her new husband.

81
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,483
- It is, isn't it?
- We must see.

82
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,483
Come on, man! Hey!

83
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,233
Is it okay if
I have a drink?

84
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,275
What's up, man?

85
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:09,608
It is a good scheme.
I can get rid of your dirty money.

86
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:13,817
Then I can get a free drink.
That's okay. Isn't it?

87
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:16,358
Isn't it a good system?

88
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:20,858
- You know, they all are gay?
- Is it true?

89
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,692
- What's your name?
- Pamela.

90
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,317
They are all gay.

91
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,650
Come on, dammit.
I just need a drink.

92
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,650
- I'm going.
- No, you go to sleep.

93
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,400
- Hello?
<I> - Andreas? </i>

94
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,733
- Who is it?
<I> - Klaus from Dollhouse. Listen. </i>

95
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,192
<I> Simon drank a lot. </i>

96
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,733
I have to run.
It is Simon. You know how it is.

97
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,775
- Should I go with you?
- Take Alexander to the strip club?

98
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,067
I'll skip that.

99
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:52,733
- What do you want?
- Is this your...

100
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,233
Where is he?

101
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,692
Whoa, whoa! Stop!

102
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,650
Stop!

103
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:07,275
Get down!
Sit down.

104
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,233
Okay? It ends here.

105
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:17,192
- I have got him.
- We'll sit down and have a drink.

106
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,692
Boy, look at this.
It's damn disgusting, Simon.

107
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:30,400
- Why didn't you buy a stove?
- I don't cook.

108
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,442
Albert won't get past if it looks like this.

109
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:39,067
Albert does not come here anyway.
He's with his swim teacher.

110
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:42,400
How was the dinner?
Did you say something stupid?

111
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:47,483
I didn't fucking say anything stupid.
I sat there and smiled for four hours.

112
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:53,150
Friendly and all that
to his swim teacher.

113
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:56,817
Although we have talked about
not giving him something big -

114
00:13:56,983 --> 00:14:00,733
- He gives him an iPhone.
And I'm coming with football gloves.

115
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,650
Don't feel sorry for yourself. Take your coffee.

116
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:09,317
Swim Teacher, that's no damn
job. Anyone can be a swim teacher.

117
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,817
Simon. You will have to
to go to sleep now.

118
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:16,858
I may as well be a swimming instructor,
if that's what.

119
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,775
I can do a damn good splash-around out there
from eight to four.

120
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,442
You can still get three hours of sleep.

121
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You will need to take
your shit together. Stay off the booze.

122
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:36,275
You can also go out on the island to my mother's
cabin, if you like.

123
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:43,650
I'm on the toilet.
And I'll have a glass of milk.

124
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,150
No, no.

125
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,942
Try to see.

126
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,775
It is quite sick, man.

127
00:15:56,983 --> 00:16:00,317
He can wear
it for confirmation. Perfect.

128
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:04,858
Typical mother. It is easier
to send something than to get even.

129
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,067
- Is he sleeping?
- Yes. He's sleeping

130
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,108
Good night.

131
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,692
I can't believe he's here.

132
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:50,317
Imagine that we have him now.
I still havn't grasped it.

133
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:54,525
I think he is good
in drawing the attention to himself.

134
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,775
Do you regret it?

135
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:02,233
Why do you say that?

136
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,733
Why do you say that? I love him.
He is the most important thing in my life.

137
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,108
- Why would you say such a thing ?!
- Anna, Anna ...

138
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:17,233
I just meant,
it's a bit harder than we thought.

139
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,233
Sorry.

140
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:12,275
- I'm getting ready here.
- Sonny must have food.

141
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:16,817
Do not touch him.
He is fine there. I mean it.

142
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:21,817
- He'll just start crying.
- He is fine. Do you hear me?

143
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,733
I'll take him.

144
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,858
Sanne! Put him down.

145
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,150
Sanne ...

146
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,108
Shh, shh.

147
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:46,108
- Make him.
- He's hungry.

148
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:49,442
What is it
you fucking do not understand?

149
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,233
- He must have food.
- Well, must he have some food?

150
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,608
Have I asked you to go here?
Do you hear what I say?

151
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:03,275
So then, tax,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

152
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,192
No, it's not there. Come on.

153
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes, that's not good either.
Shut up.

154
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,192
Stay there. You will be there.
I mean it.

155
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,817
So ...

156
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,775
Yes. Shh, shh.

157
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,692
- Come on.
- He must have some milk.

158
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:43,067
Come on. Come here.

159
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:47,233
Come on.
You there!

160
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:52,150
- Stay down!
- I do not have anything!

161
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,442
You will be there,
or I fucking pans you one.

162
00:19:56,608 --> 00:20:00,400
So ... so.

163
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,775
Stay down!

164
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,525
Yes. Well, it's sweet.

165
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,275
So ...

166
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,775
No, no, no.

167
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,067
No, no, no.

168
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:03,983
Wake up. Wake up.

169
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,400
Wake up now, come on.

170
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:11,317
Wake up! Wake up.

171
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:14,150
Wake up. Wake up.

172
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,442
No! Wake up!

173
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,775
- Wake up.
- Anna?

174
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:34,900
- Anna?
- No!

175
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:38,192
Anna?

176
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,317
Move away!

177
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,817
Do something.

178
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:54,483
Do something.
Just do something!

179
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:59,192
- Do something!
- Call an ambulance.

180
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,525
Anna, call an ambulance.
You must call an ambulance.

181
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:09,733
If you call,
they'll take him away.

182
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:16,567
- He's dead, Anna.
- Why do you say that?

183
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,483
- You are insane.
- He's dead.

184
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,150
We need to call.

185
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:29,108
- No phone calls.
- I have to call.

186
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:32,983
No.

187
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,775
- Anna, he ...
- No !!

188
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,567
I have to call.

189
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,358
If they take him,
I'll kill myself!

190
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,733
- Anna?
- No!

191
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,775
- Anna, come here.
- No!

192
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,233
- No!
- Anna, sit down!

193
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,733
- No phone calls.
- No.

194
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,858
If they take him,
I'll kill myself!

195
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:12,525
I will kill myself. I mean it.

196
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:16,692
- I mean it.
- I understand.

197
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,108
Want some food?

198
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,817
Come on.

199
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,983
Come on.

200
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,608
Eat a little.

201
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,692
Eat something.

202
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,942
Anna?

203
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:08,567
- Come on.
- You need to get some sleep, honey.

204
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,608
You just ...
You must take these pills, honey.

205
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:16,525
So you can sleep.

206
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:21,108
- Here.
- Thank you.

207
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:31,775
It's all right. Drink.

208
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:37,817
Here.

209
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,150
- No phone calls.
- I won't call.

210
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,358
You must sleep.

211
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,233
- No phone calls, right?
- I won't call. I promise.

212
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,525
Thank you.

213
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,817
He won't eat.

214
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,983
<I> Leave a message after the beep. </i>

215
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:12,358
Shh, shh.

216
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,650
My little treasure.

217
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:42,400
- Alexander?
- It is not Alexander.

218
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,775
It's another baby.

219
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:56,692
- Alex ...
- It is not him.

220
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:02,483
Ok.

221
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,192
I have taken their child.

222
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:25,483
Those people that I've talked about.
Tristan.

223
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,483
I left Alexander there.

224
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,108
I have taken him.

225
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,608
- I want Alexander.
- He's dead.

226
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,400
- He's dead.
- Where is he?

227
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,858
He has died, Anna.

228
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:11,067
We don't have a child anymore.

229
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:23,817
We don't have Alexander anymore.

230
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:32,275
I want Alexander.
Where is he?

231
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,025
Where is he?

232
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,442
Hey, Sonny. Sonny?

233
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,275
Sonny.

234
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,317
Hey! Hey!

235
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,692
Sanne!

236
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:31,858
Sonny? Sonny?

237
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,400
Come on. Sanne!

238
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:42,608
- Sanne, come here!
- Yes. Relax.

239
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:45,775
Come, come, come.
Sanne, come on!

240
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:47,983
Sonny. Sonny.

241
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,567
- Sanne!
- Yes. Calm down.

242
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:54,942
Try and take him up. Check whether he is breathing.

243
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:59,150
Of course, he's breathing.

244
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:05,233
- What the hell, man ?!
- Is he breathing?

245
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,025
- What the hell have you done?
- Check if he is breathing.

246
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:12,733
He draws breath?

247
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,650
Check if he's breathing.

248
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,942
What the hell?
You fucking killed him.

249
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:23,900
Fuck!

250
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:29,608
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
We are going to jail.

251
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:33,108
We are both going to jail.
It's fucking lie.

252
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:36,275
Fuck, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

253
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,567
Sh.

254
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,650
It is not fair.

255
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:21,025
It is not right that we get to
lose Alexander, and they get to destroy him.

256
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:27,108
You can't
lose a child, Anna.

257
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:31,817
I lost him.
Alexander is still dead.

258
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,525
Right?

259
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,442
You said,
that you would kill yourself. No?

260
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:56,067
You said,
that you would kill yourself.

261
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:13,692
When I met you, you said -

262
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:17,733
- That the only thing you ever wanted,
was to have a child.

263
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,483
He's ours now.

264
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:19,317
<I> Simon? </i>

265
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,108
<I> I need your help.
Call as soon as you hear my message. </i>

266
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,983
Hello, Simon.

267
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,442
Hello.

268
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,900
Everything is fine.

269
00:42:52,192 --> 00:42:55,317
- What do you mean?
- The message that you've left.

270
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:58,317
You sounded
as if you've seen a ghost.

271
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:01,483
<I> I was just ...
Everything's all right now. </i>

272
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,692
Are you sure?
Is Anna okay? Alexander?

273
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:07,692
<I> Yes, yes. Anna is doing fine. </i>

274
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:10,775
Should I just come over?

275
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,858
Sonny is not dead!

276
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:43,567
- What are you doing?
- He is not dead!

277
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:47,067
- Shut up, shut up.
- Sonny is not dead!

278
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,983
Shut up.

279
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:58,192
Shut up.
Do you hear what I say?

280
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:04,817
If you shout again,
I'll cut your throat.

281
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:08,358
Do you hear what I say?

282
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:18,067
Yes, it is good. It's good. So.

283
00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:35,483
- It is not Sonny.
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.

284
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,275
They seem different,
when they are dead, man!

285
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:43,858
- It's Sonny!
- Listen.

286
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,775
I won't go back.

287
00:44:46,942 --> 00:44:51,067
I'm not going back and do time
because of you. Do you understand?

288
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:55,192
We have to do something.
I have a plan, okay?

289
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,400
And we follow through with it.
Trust me, baby. Okay.

290
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,358
Let him go now. Let him go.
Come on, baby. Come, come.

291
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,858
That's great, honey.

292
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:24,025
Huh?

293
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:38,692
- What was that?
- They haven't reported it yet.

294
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:42,067
- Why not?
- Because they just don't care.

295
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,733
They are safe and sound.

296
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,567
- Someone will find out.
- There's nothing to find out.

297
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:53,233
They will never suspect us.
Come here. Here.

298
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,817
It is no crime. It would
it be if Tristan have smashed him.

299
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:06,483
We're going to save him.

300
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:11,275
I know it's hard to see that now.

301
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:13,692
We do something.

302
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,733
Oh, damn.

303
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,983
- Hello, Simon.
- Hello.

304
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,650
- May I come in?
- No. Lets just go out.

305
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:54,733
- You sounded strange on the phone.
- Everything is fine.

306
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,817
- I can see that it's not.
- Go now.

307
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:01,442
I won't go anywhere. You look like shit.

308
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:07,233
It is Anna.
She is not feeling well.

309
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:13,025
I have to go back to her, okay?

310
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,775
We'll see.

311
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:18,150
- Let me know if there's anything.
- Yes, yes.

312
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,275
Did you say that there was something wrong with me?

313
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,608
Why the hell
would you say that there's something wrong with me?

314
00:47:30,775 --> 00:47:33,233
- Sorry.
- Stop it!

315
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,150
It's fucking not me,
there is something wrong with! It is you!

316
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:40,192
It is you.

317
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:45,817
Anna?

318
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:59,442
Hello, you. Hello.

319
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,692
So.

320
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:08,192
Maybe we should ask your parents
to come and help?

321
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:12,150
- They still wouldn't come.
- No.

322
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:22,483
I must go to work and find out
why they didn't report it.

323
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:26,858
So Alexander is just there.

324
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,233
I wish I could be there.

325
00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:40,067
I will not be a mother.

326
00:48:42,983 --> 00:48:46,317
- Come on.
- I don't think I'm supposed to.

327
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,900
I miss Alexander.

328
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:56,983
I do too.

329
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,567
Huh? Huh?

330
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:36,900
Hello.

331
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:45,608
Should we turn around here?
So we can take a nap.

332
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,775
Should you have a little nap?

333
00:49:57,442 --> 00:50:00,192
Excuse me? Hey! Do you have a light?

334
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:07,650
Thank you. Hello.

335
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:13,442
Yes? What?

336
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:20,358
From whom?
No, damn it! It's fucking lie!

337
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:28,358
Hey!

338
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,733
Hey! Hey!

339
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,650
- What happened?
- He ran away with Sonny!

340
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:41,692
- He ran away with my son!
- Who?

341
00:50:41,858 --> 00:50:45,317
Call the police! Hey! Hey!

342
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:51,108
No! Come back!
Come back!

343
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,567
I have to ask about it.
Is Anna okay?

344
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,775
- What's the matter?
- Hold up.

345
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:14,192
<I> A baby of seven weeks has disappeared
on a playground at Solbakken. </i>

346
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:17,025
Station 5 here. We are on the way.

347
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,483
Good morning. As you can see,
We have closed off the area.

348
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,358
- He ran that way.
- Is it those who have lost a child?

349
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:45,775
We can cancel the barrier.
No, Tristan?

350
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,817
- What did you say?
- We don't need a barrier.

351
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:52,733
He does not believe a damn thing I'm saying.
I stand there talking on my phone.

352
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,942
A guy comes running,
takes my son and runs in that direction.

353
00:51:57,108 --> 00:52:01,233
I get them to call.
And I run down to a parked car.

354
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,733
I couldn't see the plates.

355
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,067
- He looked Eastern European.
- Shut up.

356
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:11,233
- I run after him ...
- Hey, hey. Wait right here.

357
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,942
Look at me, Sanne.

358
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,858
Look at me.
Where is Sonny?

359
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:19,150
Someone took him.

360
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:23,733
- Where is Sonny?
- Someone has taken him, dammit!

361
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,233
Someone has taken him?
You didn't just forget him somewhere?

362
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,775
Tristan.
Tristan, come here.

363
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:43,275
- What?
- Come here.

364
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:47,233
- I know that you are lying.
- What are you talking about?

365
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,483
Tell me,
where did you hide the child.

366
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,275
- My son has been kidnapped.
- Tell me. Where is he?

367
00:52:55,442 --> 00:53:00,358
- I said, I ran after ...
- What the hell have you done to him?

368
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,942
- Hey, hey!
- You got a fucking problem?

369
00:53:07,108 --> 00:53:09,567
Now relax, okay?

370
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:16,608
- Sorry.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

371
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:19,858
It just seems absurd.

372
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:23,400
- We can't know that for sure.
- You can tell he's lying.

373
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,275
I know damn well he's lying.
Quiet, right?

374
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,817
So let us take her.
I can break her in two seconds.

375
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:44,442
-

376
00:53:47,775 --> 00:53:50,067
What have you done with him?

377
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:54,317
Don't bother.
We know he hasn't been kidnapped.

378
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:58,025
We are not idiots.
You've lied to us the whole time.

379
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:01,233
How have you done with him?

380
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,317
Is he dead?
Have you killed him?

381
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:10,483
- He is not dead.
- Where is he then?

382
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:16,692
- He is not dead.
- What have you done to Sonny, Sanne?

383
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:20,400
- It is not him.
- What have you done to Sonny?

384
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:24,983
- It is not him.
- "It's not him," you say.

385
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,567
Who was it?

386
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:31,400
We don't think that
you did anything to Sonny.

387
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:35,525
If something has happened to Sonny,
it doens't have to be your fault.

388
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:40,858
If you let Tristan do something stupid
with him, we can't help you.

389
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:46,358
I think there're enough people like me
who have children. I am a bad mother.

390
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:49,858
But I have never
harmed him.

391
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:57,650
Yes, I think you're a bad mother.
You should never have had children.

392
00:54:57,817 --> 00:55:02,317
As of me, you can rot
in prison. It depends on you.

393
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:12,942
I could feel it
if he was dead. He is not dead.

394
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:32,442
- Hello!
- Hello.

395
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,692
Wow.

396
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:54,025
My parents can not come for Christmas,
if the food is not in order.

397
00:56:54,192 --> 00:56:56,900
So it is a rehearsal dinner.

398
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:00,775
Banquet.

399
00:57:00,942 --> 00:57:04,317
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

400
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:09,983
Sit. Lets eat.

401
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,150
Hi there. Hello.

402
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:17,233
- Are you awake?
- Andreas ...

403
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:27,067
We'll make it work.
It will be OK.

404
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,442
Anna?

405
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:15,150
Anna?

406
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:07,358
What happened?
Did something happen?

407
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:11,608
Please take him.

408
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:19,983
Take him. He must be cold.
He cried so much, so I took him up.

409
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:27,067
- I think I'll call ...
- No, he could get sick. Take him.

410
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,775
Take him.

411
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:35,858
You must help me.
He'll be sick.

412
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:41,608
- Take him.
- Don't worry, okay? Relax.

413
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:49,025
Take him! Take him to your truck!

414
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:54,733
I'll put him in the warmth, okay?
And then we go together to the city.

415
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,025
- Yes?
- Yes. Thank you.

416
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:23,525
Hey! Hey!

417
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:40,567
Help! Shit!

418
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:44,983
Shit!

419
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:14,525
- Hello!
- Hello?

420
01:01:15,567 --> 01:01:18,230
Who is it?
What did you say?

421
01:01:39,817 --> 01:01:44,567
So I go up to her ... Suddenly
I just stand with that child in my arms.

422
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:48,275
As soon as I turn around
and looked at her ...

423
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:52,525
... Over the fence there.
She jumped down there.

424
01:01:55,317 --> 01:01:59,442
She just asked if I
would put the baby into the heat.

425
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:07,650
Fuck, man. She just runs off.

426
01:02:27,858 --> 01:02:29,358
Shh.

427
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:04,233
Glad you came. He is inside
in the bedroom with the baby.

428
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,692
Try and hear. I am not the one
to say nothing of the situation.

429
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:33,733
But I'm
really sorry about Anna.

430
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,067
Mm.

431
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,608
I'm damn sorry, Andreas.

432
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:01,900
It's as if he knows that something has
happened. His gaze changed.

433
01:04:02,067 --> 01:04:04,983
Simon, you should go now.

434
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,525
Go. Go!

435
01:04:07,692 --> 01:04:10,150
- Now just go.
- Ok.

436
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,817
Go!

437
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:26,067
Either way, you should know
I'm here for you.

438
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,858
So, dear.

439
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:48,858
So so.

440
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:53,817
So so.

441
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:49,525
And they are...

442
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,775
Come on in.

443
01:05:56,942 --> 01:06:00,858
It makes me feel so bad.
I'm sorry.

444
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:20,650
- There is also a little milk.
- No thanks.

445
01:06:20,817 --> 01:06:26,317
Ingrid and I think that a coffin made out of
would be really nice.

446
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:33,275
- You can of course choose it yourself.
- Of course.

447
01:06:34,442 --> 01:06:37,567
There is a little sugar,
if you like.

448
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:43,525
Or white? That might be
more common here in Denmark?

449
01:06:43,692 --> 01:06:47,233
- You can do both.
- We do as I want to.

450
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:52,817
With regard to hymns and flowers ...

451
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:58,233
We can't remember,
if Anna had a favorite flower.

452
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,358
But Ingrid loves the lilies,
so maybe you could choose that?

453
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,775
- Should I keep him a little for you?
- No.

454
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,567
He has been great.

455
01:07:13,025 --> 01:07:16,317
We should have come earlier.

456
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:18,442
Yes.

457
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:33,817
I think
you should take a few weeks off.

458
01:08:33,983 --> 01:08:38,192
There's also an
internship if you need something going on.

459
01:08:38,358 --> 01:08:42,858
Simon, you take Thomas along
with you. And then get some rest.

460
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:53,108
I am ready. It makes sense
to me, if we can find the child.

461
01:08:57,817 --> 01:09:00,650
There is nothing
on the surveillance cameras.

462
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:04,233
It is only you who have seen
a man take your child.

463
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,108
- A man, you can not describe.
- I described him 20 times.

464
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:12,442
You've described 20 different guys.
You just need one with a wooden legs.

465
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:17,400
I know nothing! You use your
time on the victim! Fucking find him!

466
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:21,108
We're going to find him.
And you know what happens then?

467
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:26,358
- So do you time.
- You've decided that it's me.

468
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:31,150
Shut up, Tristan.
Sanne told everything.

469
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:34,525
What did she say?

470
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:39,525
She has not said a damn thing. It is
illegal to lie to the police.

471
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:43,858
She said, that you found him dead
on the bathroom floor.

472
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:53,192
She told that you panicked.
And then you took him.

473
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:57,567
So now we want to know:
Where did you take him?

474
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:08,358
She also said that it was you
who killed him.

475
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:15,525
<I> Where is he? </i>

476
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:26,817
Come on, Tristan.
Come on. No?

477
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:35,025
Okay, I'll tell everything.
I have tried to protect Sanne.

478
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:39,567
I come out in the morning,
I have just woken up.

479
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:45,317
And there he is, Sonny, dead in
the bathroom. I swear.

480
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:48,358
I have done nothing. Nothing.

481
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,858
What did you do?

482
01:10:53,025 --> 01:10:58,025
Sanne must admit it,
I didn't have anything to do with him.

483
01:10:58,192 --> 01:11:01,983
I am not going to jail for something
I have not done.

484
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:07,233
How the hell did you know about
the bathroom floor?

485
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,025
It was just a guess.

486
01:11:42,483 --> 01:11:44,608
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

487
01:11:44,775 --> 01:11:48,400
Can I have five minutes alone
with her?

488
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:51,567
Are sweet to close the door after you?

489
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,150
How are you?

490
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,983
Tristan has admitted
that Sonny is dead.

491
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:04,900
It is not him.

492
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:09,775
You sat with the dead child in your arms for several
hours and said, "What have I done?"

493
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:15,650
What have you done? What
happened? How did Sonny die?

494
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:18,942
It is not him.

495
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:22,983
People look very different
when they are dead.

496
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:28,108
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Just tell us the truth.

497
01:12:28,275 --> 01:12:32,817
I don't know where he is.
Tristan buried him.

498
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:40,317
Did he say where? Where?

499
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:45,442
Where did he burry him?
Where has he buried him, Sanne?

500
01:12:57,233 --> 01:13:01,400
Did I tell you what they do
in prison to child murderers?

501
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,692
Several have been poured
boiling water in the crotch.

502
01:13:05,858 --> 01:13:08,025
Look at me.

503
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:11,650
You don't have to say anything anymore.
You'll go out soon.

504
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,275
So.

505
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,733
Mother? Mother?

506
01:13:36,108 --> 01:13:37,983
Yes, what is it?

507
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:42,733
I need to run for few hours.
It's just some work.

508
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,025
Then I'll take him.
Nårh, it's allright.

509
01:13:48,483 --> 01:13:50,108
Thank you.

510
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:03,150
The police. I need to talk to
a patient. Sanne Thomsen.

511
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:06,275
- One moment.
- Thank you.

512
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:17,108
Andreas Juhl.
I need to talk to Sanne Thomsen.

513
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:19,733
- Right now?
- Right now.

514
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,150
She is sleeping.

515
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:29,192
- Yes, just sit there.
- Thank you.

516
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,400
I want him back!

517
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:09,400
I want him back!

518
01:15:09,567 --> 01:15:14,942
No! Don't!
He is not dead! Sonny is not dead!

519
01:15:22,275 --> 01:15:25,483
Don't.
He is not dead!

520
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:28,983
- Take it easy, Sanne.
- Here is the syringe.

521
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,650
Why are you doing this to me?

522
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:40,192
I want him back!

523
01:17:25,317 --> 01:17:28,358
Well, Tristan.
How are you?

524
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:33,192
You are fucked, huh?

525
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:37,733
Tell us now.
What have you done with Alexander's corpse?

526
01:17:39,317 --> 01:17:42,150
- Who the hell is Alexander?
- Sonny.

527
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:51,442
If what you and Sanne say
is true, you have been very unlucky.

528
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:55,483
Death occurs.
It's not your fault.

529
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:59,275
But if we do not find the body
and get the autopsy -

530
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,608
- You will be convicted of murder.
You know.

531
01:18:02,775 --> 01:18:07,233
It's your choice.
Think about it Tristan.

532
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:14,275
- I took him out in a forest.
- Where?

533
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:16,858
I took him out in a forest.

534
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,400
<I> I took a bicycle and drove out.
I don't know where. </i>

535
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:27,692
What did you say? You don't know
where you burried your own son ?!

536
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:30,025
I was out.

537
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:35,483
<I> I want to show you how,
if I can figure it out. </i>

538
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:41,067
I would like to be allowed to
to say one thing first.

539
01:18:41,233 --> 01:18:44,192
It is Sanne, who did this.

540
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:48,567
I think she has strangled him.
She has tried many times.

541
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:52,608
I really tried
to stop her many times.

542
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:57,650
She woudn't have killed him directly.
She should never have had him.

543
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:02,150
That's fucked up that she
takes care of him when she has clients.

544
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:05,067
She's a whore, okay?

545
01:19:05,233 --> 01:19:08,858
Now she has
turned my little boy to death.

546
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,108
Andreas!

547
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,275
Andreas! Stop it!

548
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:21,025
Andreas!
Stop it!

549
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:40,108
- Now you go home.
- I'm sorry.

550
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:44,275
You go home now.
Take a sleeping pill and get some sleep.

551
01:19:44,442 --> 01:19:48,275
As normal people.
And then talk about it with someone.

552
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:50,775
Other than your mother!

553
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:55,192
Go home.
And Simon take over from here.

554
01:19:55,358 --> 01:20:00,192
It will all be understood. And then
are you going to talk to a psychologist.

555
01:20:10,192 --> 01:20:14,317
- Tristan Markussens
custody extended by four weeks.

556
01:20:14,483 --> 01:20:18,358
Four weeks for something,
I have not done?

557
01:20:18,525 --> 01:20:22,233
Tristan, hear what I say.
In addition to the current case -

558
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,942
- They have seized about
a kilo of hard drugs from your aunt's place.

559
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:30,900
My aunt's place! I have no idea
what Kirsten is doing!

560
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:34,983
In addition, they seized
a weapon with your fingerprints -

561
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:39,983
- <I> From your </i> residence. The maximum penalty
is up to six years for these conditions.

562
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:44,483
Therefore I extend Tristan Markussens
custody by four weeks.

563
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:48,317
- <I> Fucking cunt!
</i> - Can we get the prisoner out?

564
01:20:53,817 --> 01:20:57,358
- I found something!
- Keep an eye on him.

565
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:12,400
Someone dug here recently.

566
01:21:50,983 --> 01:21:54,483
Andrew, this is Simon here.
We have found the body.

567
01:21:55,692 --> 01:22:00,317
We'll take it for autopsy. I'll call you
tomorrow when we have an answer.

568
01:22:02,858 --> 01:22:05,525
<I> Andrew, are you there? </i>

569
01:22:07,442 --> 01:22:09,567
<I> Andreas? - Are you there? </i>

570
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,608
<I> Andreas? </i>

571
01:22:53,817 --> 01:22:55,525
Good morning.

572
01:22:55,692 --> 01:22:57,775
Hello. Please.

573
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:05,733
- Well, you are early.
- It's just me.

574
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:09,483
- Should I come back later?
- No, no.

575
01:23:10,483 --> 01:23:13,733
There are no signs of external damage.

576
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:17,192
But CT and X-ray
was very revealing.

577
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:19,567
Here is the child's head.

578
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:25,067
The fresh bleeding derived from
a subdural hematoma, which is the most evident here.

579
01:23:25,942 --> 01:23:27,942
Can you see it?

580
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,817
What did you say?

581
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:34,567
There was a bleeding here
under the hard meninges.

582
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:39,608
There is also a hygrom,
a fluid-filled cavity, -

583
01:23:39,775 --> 01:23:43,525
- Derived from
one or more previous bleedings.

584
01:23:43,692 --> 01:23:47,275
However, the fresh bleeding
has beaten the child to death.

585
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:55,567
Let me show you here ...
I have taken a picture of the torso.

586
01:23:55,733 --> 01:24:00,900
There are some broken ribs,
characteristic of shake violence.

587
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:04,817
Where the offender sticked his fingers
in the body and shaked the baby.

588
01:24:07,525 --> 01:24:11,567
What we are dealing with is
<I> shaken baby syndrome. </i>

589
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,567
Now, I am not the police,
but this is a manslaughter.

590
01:25:10,442 --> 01:25:12,317
<I> Andreas? </i>

591
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:19,442
Andreas?

592
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,108
Andreas?

593
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:35,733
What the hell are you doing here? Why are
you sitting here for? Have you been there?

594
01:25:37,025 --> 01:25:40,983
You are bleeding.
What did you do to your fingers?

595
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:46,192
Hey, hey. What is happening?

596
01:25:48,817 --> 01:25:51,525
I know it's hard now.

597
01:25:52,608 --> 01:25:55,900
I want to help you.

598
01:25:58,692 --> 01:26:01,608
Andreas, dammit.

599
01:26:01,775 --> 01:26:03,817
Get out of here!

600
01:26:16,442 --> 01:26:19,150
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.

601
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:25,442
Andreas?

602
01:26:42,942 --> 01:26:45,483
What's happening?

603
01:26:48,483 --> 01:26:50,817
What are you doing?

604
01:26:54,858 --> 01:26:58,275
- What are you doing? Your hand!
- Mother! Sit down.

605
01:26:58,442 --> 01:27:00,442
Sit down. Stop!

606
01:27:02,608 --> 01:27:05,733
Andrew, what is happening?
Would you tell ...

607
01:27:08,442 --> 01:27:10,108
Andreas?

608
01:28:39,983 --> 01:28:42,608
<I> What have you done
Alexander's body? </i>

609
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:45,192
<I> Who the hell is Alexander? </i>

610
01:28:45,358 --> 01:28:49,900
<I> It's not him. I
could tell if he was dead. </i>

611
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,150
Hello.

612
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:18,150
Yes ...

613
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:23,317
What are saying?

614
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,400
You came again.

615
01:29:27,733 --> 01:29:31,108
You're so fine. You're so fine.

616
01:30:16,942 --> 01:30:20,817
If you want to get rid of me,
you need to try harder.

617
01:30:22,525 --> 01:30:24,733
Where is Sonny?

618
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:33,150
I should have figured it out sooner,
but the idea was too crazy.

619
01:30:40,608 --> 01:30:43,775
I thought,
it was the right thing to do.

620
01:30:43,942 --> 01:30:46,775
It was the right thing to do.

621
01:30:50,025 --> 01:30:53,317
Of course it wasn't
the right thing to do.

622
01:30:56,358 --> 01:30:59,358
I didn't know,
Anna ...

623
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,358
When I woke up in the night,
and he screamed, it was...

624
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:09,733
He screamed for help.

625
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:14,233
He screamed for help.

626
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:19,233
They will all understand,
what you have done.

627
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,650
But he should be back
with his mother.

628
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:26,108
She'll never get out of it.

629
01:31:27,692 --> 01:31:31,733
He'll go to a foster family.
There's nothing you can do about it.

630
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,442
It's not your business, okay?

631
01:31:57,192 --> 01:32:00,900
You're redundant,
but you probably won't go to prison.

632
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:06,400
These are extenuating circumstances.
You'll certainly get a suspended sentence.

633
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:11,942
I'll have to tell her yourself.
Take me over to her.

634
01:33:23,608 --> 01:33:26,275
- Here.
- Sonny ...

635
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:33,525
Hello.

636
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:39,150
Hello.

637
01:34:06,733 --> 01:34:09,067
Sanne...

638
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:11,108
Sorry.

639
01:36:59,442 --> 01:37:01,483
Are you lost?

640
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:10,317
- No.
- My mom forgot screws.

641
01:37:12,942 --> 01:37:15,483
I've got a hammer.

642
01:37:17,025 --> 01:37:19,817
I just can't get it out.

643
01:37:25,775 --> 01:37:28,067
What's your name?

644
01:37:28,942 --> 01:37:31,275
Sonny.

645
01:37:32,525 --> 01:37:36,067
Are you sure you're not lost?

646
01:37:36,233 --> 01:37:39,192
Yes, I work here.
