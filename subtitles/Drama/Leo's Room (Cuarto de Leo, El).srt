00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,305
Why, what's wrong?

160
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:01,435
Hurry up and change.

161
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,157
Hey, stay with me!

162
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,896
I won!

163
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:29,441
Aw, what a waste!

164
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,821
See. I told you you're no match for me
in running.

165
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:38,883
All right. I lost, I lost. Tell me your wish.

166
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:41,229
What do you mean, wish?

167
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,612
Hey, the loser was going to grant the other's wish.

168
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:48,366
I'll grant your wish. Tell me anything.

169
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:56,873
My wish? My wish... I don't have one.

170
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:00,686
What if I had a wish? It wouldn't come true.

171
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:05,007
On your birthday, do you know what
my wish for you was?

172
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,988
Let Byun So Ra always smile.

173
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,032
Kang Chan Jin.

174
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:25,053
I don't know how to make you smile always.

175
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:31,757
But when you smile or cry
I want to be by your side always.

176
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:37,054
Whether as a friend or a man,
whatever you want.

177
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,696
So don't go study abroad.

178
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,478
You... How did you know?

179
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:56,209
Last night, Jin Ju called me,
crying for me to stop you going.

180
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:01,276
That Wang Jin Ju and her nosiness.

181
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:05,928
Don't go. Or, let's go together.

182
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:11,715
You tick! You stalker. It's disgusting
being with you now.

183
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:16,706
I'm going to go.

184
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:31,023
Really, those two, can they become lovers?

185
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:34,043
Oh, do you want to make a bet?
Granting the winner's wish.

186
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:37,488
Hey, you want to bet with a person's heart?

187
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:39,642
It's because I'm curious.

188
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:42,337
Oh, what is love?

189
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,910
Hey, if I knew that would I have
stayed single till now?

190
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:51,191
Get some exercise! You have to get rid of
your stomach fat to start dating or whatever.

191
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:56,126
But that's your job, Boss. Wow, it's dynamic.

192
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,782
Yeah, that's my story.

193
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,509
You heartless boy.

194
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:02,636
Today's goal. 500. 500.

195
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:06,514
Now, hurry. Hurry up and get up.

196
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:35,578
Oh, you're here early.

197
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,548
Yeah. I couldn't get any sleep.

198
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,414
It's big news. Big news!

199
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,678
What? Head Manager and Jin Ju
getting engaged?

200
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:46,991
You've heard already?

201
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:51,751
I heard it on the way to work.
Assistant Manager Byun, are you okay?

202
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,846
We'd already broken up.

203
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,977
Even so. When I see you,
Assistant Manager Byun, I feel sorry for you.

204
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,487
When I see you, Assistant Manager Song,
I feel sorry for you too.

205
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,415
How could Manger Park leave like that
without a farewell party?

206
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:07,960
It's because he's much too important
a person! You're talking nonsense.

207
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:13,645
If he's arrived there safely, he should
at least message me or send me an e-mail.

208
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:16,710
He looked like he was going to
live and die in front of me.

209
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:22,343
That's why, he's my man when in front of me
but when he turns around he's just a man.

210
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,555
Did you guys hear it already?

211
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:31,049
It's really big news.

212
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:35,032
She already knows about
Head Manger Yoon Jun Su's engagement.

213
00:30:36,674 --> 00:30:40,800
Oh Jin Ju, congratulations!
You've really become Cinderella now.

214
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,423
Thank you.

215
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:48,269
It's spring for someone, and for someone else
it's like the Siberian steppe.

216
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,248
Cheer up.

217
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:53,041
This time I really thought I was
going to get married.

218
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:56,990
You unlucky fool. You unlucky fool really!

219
00:30:56,997 --> 00:31:00,937
Don't be too upset. He's only being sent
to China for a year.

220
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,652
But how can they send someone
all of a sudden like that?

221
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:04,960
He can't even speak Chinese.

222
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,935
Hey, just think how it worked out.

223
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,350
When Chan Ho comes back he doesn't have to
worry about getting fired. We have the lives of flies.

224
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:16,544
Isn't that nice. That someone held on to
a line before that.

225
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:21,390
Oh, Manager Park sent me a video message!

226
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:28,274
Oh, that man. He doesn't even send me a
message but he sends that to you. What is it?

227
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:31,635
Hello. Are you doing well Mi Rae?

228
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:34,591
This is Chan Ho. I'm doing well too.

229
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,782
<i>There's something I want to ask you.</i>

230
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:45,233
I've suddenly noticed, about being sent to China.
I forgot to tell Ye Jin to wait a year for me.

231
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:51,060
So Mi Rae, tell her to wait
just one year for me please.

232
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:56,037
And also, without me Ye Jin will be lonely,
so Mi Rae please meet up with her.

233
00:31:56,131 --> 00:32:01,623
Buy her good food, chat, and buy her drinks,
and later I'll pay back all the money.

234
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,700
Oh Chan Ho!

235
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:07,670
Also, lastly tell her this:

236
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:15,709
Ye Jin, wo ai ni ("I love you" in Chinese).
Bye, Mi Rae.

237
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,169
Me too, wo ai ni

238
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:30,750
It's a good morning.

239
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,139
Hey, what's wrong with his face? His face?

240
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,138
What happened to Head Manager's face?

241
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:42,281
Did you see?

242
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,386
Director, Director!

243
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:51,800
I think the rebellion against the princes started,
but it's stopped with them beating each other up.

244
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:55,471
I think their bond is stronger than we thought.

245
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:00,177
He's young so he doesn't know
what's bitter in the world.

246
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:04,902
As an adult, should I let him know
how to live in this world?

247
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:08,835
The last party, get it ready.

248
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,964
Yes. All right.

249
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:19,587
I put medicine on it yesterday, so it's okay.

250
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,688
How did you get hurt this badly?

251
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:33,094
Yesterday I met with a gang
and fought 17 to 1...

252
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,696
Chan Jin already used that.

253
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:39,375
Chan Jin already went and told you.

254
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:45,759
This morning he came to the house,
to stop So Ra going abroad.

255
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,981
Is So Ra going to study abroad?

256
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,345
Yes, she said she's going to go.

257
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:12,527
I told you to come to my room.

258
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:18,077
I heard from Jin Ju that
you're going to study abroad?

259
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:24,108
This is being spread around everywhere
by your fiancée, Sunbae.

260
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,199
Don't go abroad.

261
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:34,477
You're someone this company really needs.

262
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,367
I want to continue studying.
I want to study more about cosmetics.

263
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:47,432
Then go with Chan Jin.
I'll send both of you to work in the U.S.

264
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:54,861
Don't try to force Chan Jin and me together.
Chan Jin is just a friend to me.

265
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,612
It's not like that for Chan Jin.

266
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:02,865
Chan Jin needs you.

267
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,840
You don't realize those words
actually hurt me more.

268
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:14,837
So all this time, I meant that to you:

269
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:20,197
"Since I'm over you, you should go to another. "
I was that kind of weak presence for you...

270
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:21,195
So Ra...

271
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:26,183
My job, whether it's work or studying,
I'll take care of myself.

272
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,326
Yes, it's Byun So Ra.

273
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,376
You want to scout me?

274
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,864
Byun So Ra, I was very impressed by
your masters' thesis paper.

275
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:03,203
Oh, yes. Thank you for
looking at it so kindly.

276
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:07,482
It made me think you're someone we need
in our company.

277
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:12,503
I'm sorry, but I'm planning to
study abroad soon.

278
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:14,710
Our company can also sponsor
your studies abroad.

279
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:18,894
These are our company's terms.
Please read them over and give me a call.

280
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:20,678
I'm sorry.

281
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,647
At least read it.

282
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,976
All right. But please don't expect much.

283
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:01,726
You're here?

284
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:03,159
Are you all right here by yourself?

285
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:09,542
I'm fine. Head Manager, you've come here,
and yesterday Chan Jin came as well.

286
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,127
Chan Jin came?

287
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,643
Yes, last night.

288
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:33,851
When will my father start to move again?

289
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:40,702
Due to the after-effects of the car accident
15 years ago, his body has gotten weak.

290
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:44,258
We have to keep an eye on him longer.

291
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:54,593
Chairman was in an accident?

[Special Board of Directors Meeting

Have you already forgotten
what Chairman Yoon did to your mom?

[1. Agenda: L'aura Cosmetic's crisis
management and the next executive election]

295
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:51,022
Chairman, you were always a strong
and scary person.

296
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:55,839
Seeing you lying down like this,
it's a strange feeling.

297
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:04,902
As an employee, before I start a war,
I thought I should make my greetings.

298
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,474
Thank you for all this time.

299
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:17,652
Don't worry too much.
I'll take care of your later years.

300
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,357
There is a pleasant guest here.

301
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:30,774
I was late coming to visit him.

302
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:34,600
As you know,
the company is in a state of war.

303
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:39,011
It's funny that the creator of
this state of war is saying that.

304
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,976
If it's a company that can fall
at such a small attack,

305
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:46,231
isn't it evidence that something
is very wrong.

306
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:49,607
Are you saying my father didn't
lead the company right?

307
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,568
It's something people see as they get old.

308
00:39:55,515 --> 00:40:01,256
When did you, Head Manager, suddenly get
interested in the company and your father?

It's all thanks to you, Director Seong.

00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:12,955
Thanks to you, I've discovered how important
my father, the company, and Chan Jin are.

311
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,365
It's a pity. I should have helped you
realize this earlier.

312
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,825
I have a feeling it's too late now.

313
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:30,850
You don't have to keep guessing.
Soon, you'll know.

314
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:37,789
And also, one more thing,
just a tip on life.

315
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:41,629
Don't trust people too much.

316
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,881
You can have the engagement at our hotel.

317
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:56,422
If you tell me the date you want, Jin Ju,
I'll set it up with the hotel. When is good?

318
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,977
Head Manager says the sooner the better.

319
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:05,023
But I want it when the Chairman has
recovered a bit.

320
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:11,271
The Chairman, how is he?

321
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:12,740
Still no progress.

322
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:17,822
He had major heart surgery 15 years ago,
so they say his body is weak.

323
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,032
Heart surgery 15 years ago?

324
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,272
Chan Jin you didn't know either?
15 years ago he was in a big car accident.

325
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:31,006
When exactly was that?

326
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:33,930
I don't really know that…

327
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,981
Chan Jin!

328
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:46,485
In January?

329
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:48,426
Yes, that should be exactly right.

330
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:50,515
Because of Chairman Yoon's surgery,

331
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:52,907
I couldn't go to the Sung Soo meeting
at the main branch.

332
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:55,977
So I remember my parents were worried.

333
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,046
Do you remember how the accident happened?

334
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:05,349
He was going somewhere with a female
colleague when the accident happened.

335
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,492
A drunk truck driver was colliding with the car.

336
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:12,044
To save that colleague
he threw his body across hers.

337
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:14,595
And because of that his heart was injured.

338
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:19,615
It was a miracle the Chairman survived
that accident.

339
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,232
That female colleague, how did she...?

340
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:29,533
She died at the scene of the accident.

341
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:37,209
When the Chairman gained consciousness,
I remember he kept looking for her.

342
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:58,629
Chan Jin.

343
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:07,351
What's wrong? Did something happen?

344
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,797
Why is our rival company doing an
investment presentation on our special line?

345
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:48,780
<i>- Take a look
- [Investment Proposal: Moisturizing cream
from natural ingredients]</i>

346
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:56,122
If you take a look inside, all our special
line core information is there.

347
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:00,351
And it's very similar to Byun So Ra's patent.

348
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:03,144
How can this happen?

349
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,436
I think there's a leak.

350
00:45:06,947 --> 00:45:09,543
If it's similar to Assistant Manager
Byun's patent, then...

351
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:16,338
Me?

352
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:18,750
Don't say things without evidence.

353
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,638
The people who know about this
are Director Kang,

354
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,864
me, and all the members of
the special line team,

355
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:25,952
and the legal department who dealt with
the patent; more than ten people know.

356
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:29,825
But if the patent information is written
in detail like this,

357
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:33,544
isn't it too difficult for anyone
not directly in the know?

358
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:54,768
Please think this through.
Our company is the innocent victim!

359
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:59,018
If you invest in the special line now,
you will regret it.

Yes, he's past the critical point.

What are you doing, not getting off work?

389

Something is strange.

390
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:08,717
It's a part of my patent that we were
supposed to use,

391
00:50:08,868 --> 00:50:12,293
but our rival company has more
information that I didn't reveal.

392
00:50:12,396 --> 00:50:15,063
Maybe that company's researcher
had similar ideas.

393
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:19,491
Yes, so I'm looking through everything
like this,

394
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:22,407
and there's similar data,
but nothing exactly the same.

395
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:28,997
You know too, don't you? That I worked hard
on this patent for three years.

396
00:50:29,032 --> 00:50:32,610
I know. I saw it with my own eyes.

397
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:38,117
Because of those three years, I can't have
this special line taken away from me unjustly.

398
00:50:40,098 --> 00:50:43,779
Leave that problem to the company
and get ready to study abroad.

00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,371
Yes, So Ra?

466
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:46,838
Jin Ju.

467
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:50,520
Sit down.

468
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:01,498
If you sleep late your skin will be ruined.

469
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:06,300
Tomorrow, Jin Ju, you're the main character,
so only you need to be pretty.

470
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:08,788
It would be nice if the husband
were also handsome.

471
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:12,081
Don't worry about that
because I have a good pedigree.

472
00:58:13,343 --> 00:58:15,448
You know how to make jokes like that?

473
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:21,241
I'm actually a fun person,
but I think I haven't shown that much.

474
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,395
Because the time we had together was short.

475
00:58:31,235 --> 00:58:35,698
I'm sorry that because of company work,
I was so busy.

476
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:38,506
I didn't pay attention to you either.

477
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,197
It was hard getting ready by yourself,
wasn't it?

478
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:52,394
I thought you'd be hungry
so I made some lunch.

479
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:58,678
I was about to get hungry. Thank you.

480
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:20,338
It's good.

481
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:25,679
Liar.

482
00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:28,568
It's true.

483
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:36,593
Head Manager, I think you can't lie,
because it shows all over your face.

484
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:52,091
It's been a long time.
How many days has it been?

485
00:59:54,654 --> 00:59:59,728
Byun So Ra withdrawal symptoms,
our telepathy worked.

486
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:02,338
Have you been doing well these days?

487
01:00:06,762 --> 01:00:09,902
What is it? You called me out and
you're not saying anything.

488
01:00:13,181 --> 01:00:14,945
Do you like me?

489
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,136
How many times do I have to say I like you?

490
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:26,530
You said you always wanted to be
by my side whether I smiled or cried.

491
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,079
Was that true?

492
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:33,296
Do you want me to tell you one more time?

493
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:37,010
How come you started liking me as a woman
all of a sudden?

494
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:41,651
What?

495
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:49,679
You, by any chance were you using me?

496
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:53,033
To take revenge on
Chairman and Jun Su sunbae?

497
01:01:01,122 --> 01:01:03,456
Am I worth only that much?

498
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:13,034
Saying you'll try hard and do your best,
I know you're sincere.

499
01:01:14,456 --> 01:01:20,136
But, Head Manager, your face right now,
doesn't look happy at all.

500
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:25,667
Jin Ju.

501
01:01:27,761 --> 01:01:29,760
And I'm not happy either.

502
01:01:38,886 --> 01:01:42,556
Let's stop this.

503
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:52,514
I won't go to the engagement ceremony
tomorrow.

504
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:00,353
I really believe you didn't.

505
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,981
I know that you would never do that.

506
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:07,264
But if you have something else in your heart,
give up on the directors' meeting.

507
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:09,322
Stop making it hard on Jun Su sunbae.

508
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,283
To you, Jun Su hyung is still number one,
huh?

509
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:19,662
If I say I can't give up...

510
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:27,107
Then I won't see you again.

511
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,181
You and I... it would be the end.
