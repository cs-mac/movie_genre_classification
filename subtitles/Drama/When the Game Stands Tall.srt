1
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,460
This program was founded on certain ideals.

2
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,560
They have been drowned by the
noise and distraction of fame.

3
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,130
We got lost, caught up in the hype,

4
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,470
the celebrity, the glory,

5
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,310
and the relentless pressure
to keep the streak alive.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,120
<i>The sophomore goes back to
set up the screen for Tucker.</i>

7
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,060
<i>Tucker got a block. Tucker has space.</i>

8
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,030
<i>- Tucker breaks a tackle.
- What a move!</i>

9
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>Forty-five up the middle. One man to beat.</i>

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,100
<i>Throwing one deep down the middle,
going for Jones.</i>

11
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,400
<i>Touchdown De La Salle!</i>

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,470
<i>Absolutely unbelievable.</i>

13
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,370
<i>The greatest high-school performance</i>

14
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,370
<i>I've seen in 15 years.</i>

15
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,800
<i>De La Salle High has won
three titles in a row.</i>

16
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,940
<i>Their 48th consecutive victory.</i>

17
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,080
<i>To the fans, it's quickly
becoming known as "The Streak."</i>

18
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,280
<i>Tonight, they break a
22-year-old win record</i>

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,420
<i>held by a Michigan high school.</i>

20
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,220
<i>Talking about streaks,
there's a lot of pressure...</i>

21
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,460
<i>Coach Lad has done an amazing job.</i>

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,960
<i>De La Salle has been winning
for the past 11 years,</i>

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,530
<i>straight.</i>

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,040
<i>Welcome to the 2003</i>

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
<i>Northern Conference Sectional Championships</i>

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,680
<i>where powerhouse De La Salle</i>

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,110
<i>brings their 150-game win streak</i>

28
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,650
<i>against their rivals,
the Pirates of Pittsburg High.</i>

29
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,690
Hey, Bob. Bob.

30
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,620
Marty, you live under the stadium?

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,520
Bob, 25 years coaching this team,

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,390
favored to win your 12th championship,
150 wins.

33
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,660
How did you pull it off?

34
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,200
Well, winning a lot of games is doable.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,130
Teaching kids there's more to life,
that's hard.

36
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,140
Come on. You turned this
team into a winning machine.

37
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,700
How long you think you
can keep the streak alive?

38
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,070
The streak was never our goal.

39
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,610
Yeah? Well, then why do you keep winning?

40
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,380
<i>This program's a lot of things.</i>

41
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,050
It's not just a football team,
or win-streak machine.

42
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,020
It's a family.

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,420
A brotherhood which is based in love.

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,260
Put simply,

45
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,060
love means you can count on me,
in good times and in bad.

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,330
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

47
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,200
<i>here to play for their 12th
straight championship win,</i>

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
<i>the De La Salle Spartans.</i>

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,510
Go Spartans!

50
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,710
I love this part.

51
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,710
Totally freaks out the other team.

52
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,550
<i>I know I'm not supposed to say this,
let alone think it.</i>

53
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,050
This streak's our legacy.

54
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,420
We will never experience
anything like this again

55
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,050
in our lives.

56
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,290
You guys are all my family

57
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,720
but after tomorrow night,

58
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,620
this will never be like this again.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,060
I'll never forget my time on this team,
or with you.

60
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,330
Spartans for life!

61
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,100
Spartans for life.

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,430
Streak, streak, streak!

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,370
<i>Terrance Kelly takes the opening kickoff</i>

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,510
<i>on the five-yard line. Gets a block.</i>

65
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,780
Terrance Kelly is the best
prospect on the field.

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>Sees a wedge and shoots
up the middle over the 40.</i>

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,080
<i>Brought down on the 49-yard line.</i>

68
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,250
All right, I got Cam's card.
"Training goal:

69
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,420
Five extra gassers after
practice every day." Done.

70
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,190
"Practice goal: Catch every ball." Perfect.

71
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,590
"Game goal: 200 yards receiving,
two touchdowns,

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,230
and average 15 yards after every catch."

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,370
Did you hear that?
That is a perfect commitment card.

74
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,170
Big goals that stretch his abilities,

75
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,140
<i>but doable when giving a perfect effort.</i>

76
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,110
- You go get those, Cam.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,650
<i>Gonzales throws a long,
deep ball to Cam Colvin...</i>

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,380
<i>...who out-jumps the defenders</i>

79
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,520
<i>for De La Salle's first score of the game.</i>

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Colvin is a coveted Division 1 prospect</i>

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,520
<i>who's drawing interest from
top programs in the country.</i>

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,660
Not asking you to be perfect every play.

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,590
What we're asking of you

84
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,390
and what you should be asking of each other

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,100
is to give a perfect effort
from snap to whistle.

86
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>Cam Colvin just pitched
the ball back to Kelly.</i>

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,640
<i>The most athletic play I've seen all year.</i>

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,170
I got T.K.'s card.

89
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,740
"Three extra sets, cleans,
every day after practice."

90
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,410
Blue 18! Set, hut!

91
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,620
Throw the ball!

92
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah, that's it!

93
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,220
- I got Howard's card.
- This is Jimmy's card.

94
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,520
Nice! Great block.

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
"Two hundred fifty pushups after workout."

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,370
"Get to the second level on sweeps."

97
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,430
- I have Chris' card.
- "Training commitment:

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,260
Ten extra tire drags
after practice every day.

99
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,230
<i>Game goal: Two running touchdowns."</i>

100
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,570
Their middle linebacker's
gonna be covering you, Chris.

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,700
You have way more speed than him.

102
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,270
<i>Gonzales, under center, takes the snap.</i>

103
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,580
<i>Pitches out to Ryan, who's got room to run.</i>

104
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,110
<i>Sheds a tackle.</i>

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
<i>In for the touchdown,</i>

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,120
<i>which makes the score 27 to nothing.</i>

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,720
So, Mickey, does Chris wanna
break this record as bad as you?

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,190
Yeah, he's getting there.

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,770
Thanks. Good block, good block.

110
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,300
You see number 34? Ryan?

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,330
Chris Ryan? Write that name down.

112
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,470
When Cam Colvin and
Terrance Kelly are gone,

113
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,890
he's the whole team.
I mention he's gonna break

114
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,440
<i>the state's scoring record next year?</i>

115
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,250
If there's anything anyone wants to say,
now is your shot.

116
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,380
Look, I just wanna say, ahem,

117
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,750
in my four years here I
played a lot of games.

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,690
But none is more important to me
than tomorrow's. My last game.

119
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,390
I love you, guys.

120
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,360
We always say to finish strong, right?

121
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,430
Tomorrow I'm playing for Cam's mom,

122
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,170
who loves this team almost
as much as Cam does.

123
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,570
Love you, boy.

124
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,740
Love you too, man.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,870
I know some of you guys already know this,

126
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,180
but most of you don't.

127
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,280
My grandfather has cancer.

128
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,380
He can't come to our practices anymore,

129
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,920
he can't even make the games.

130
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,220
But every day,
he waits for me to get back from practice

131
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,360
just so I can tell him how we're doing.

132
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,400
As simple as that sounds,

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,260
that's one of the things
that keeps him going.

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,840
You know, our progress keeps him going.

135
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,570
I'm grateful for that.

136
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,970
None of the juniors share their emotions.

137
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,880
- Just the seniors.
- I know.

138
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,110
Second string, you're in.

139
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,550
<i>Coach Bob Ladouceur</i>

140
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,210
<i>is putting in his juniors.</i>

141
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,820
<i>These young men have big shoes to fill</i>

142
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,690
<i>if they plan on continuing
this undefeated streak.</i>

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,560
<i>Tayshon Lanear missed an easy block,</i>

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,530
<i>Chris Ryan pays the price.</i>

145
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,630
- Let's hit out there!
- Yo, Tayshon.

146
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,560
If it isn't too much to ask, pick it up.

147
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,330
Chill, man. I'll get you on the next play.

148
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't get it right, don't get a next one.

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,480
Hey, easy, little Lad.
Your pops is the coach, not you.

150
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,810
Hut!

151
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,980
Go Ryan! Bring it in!

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,620
<i>Ryan with great run.</i>

153

Attaboy, Chris!

154
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,460
- 34.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,830
Four, three, two, one!

156
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,970
<i>De La Salle! De La Salle! De La Salle!</i>

157

159
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,610
<i>De La Salle's streak continues.</i>

160
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,290
<i>We're number one! We're number one!</i>

161
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,460
<i>Streak! Streak! Streak!</i>

162
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,960
Great game, coach.

163
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Half a dozen schools want us
to come for official visits.

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,030
- He deserves it, Mr. Kelly.
- Thank you, coach. Great job.

165
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,670
- Hey, T-Gram.
- Great job, Coach Ladouceur.

166
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,510
- Hey, this is crazy.
- Wow.

167
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,040
Whoo! There's my baby.

168
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,710
- T-Gram! That's cool.
- Oh!

169
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,780
Get off of me, you big bugger.

170
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,650
- Pops.
- Great job.

171
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,380
- Good stuff. I love you.
- Love you too.

172
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,350
- Hey, coach.
- You're doing it.

173
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,020
You're doing it.
Getting my baby out of Richmond.

174
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,820
He's a very special young man.

175
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,520
Thank you.

176
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,730
T-Gram, I'm gonna come see
you every chance I get, right?

177
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,830
I don't want you
back in that Richmond mess.

178
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,670
We come and see you.

179
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,410
Quitter!

180
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,550
Hey, boss.

181
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,450
Morning, coach. Keep the streak alive.

182
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,790
Morning, Pete. The streak alive, yeah.

183
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,560
Michael, cut it out. All right? Seriously.

184
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,090
You kidding me?

185
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,060
- I'll break that.
- Guys, guys!

186
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,360
- Come here! Give me that horn!
- Come back here, you little...

187
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,830
Here he is. Good run?

188
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,700
Hey, Terry.

189
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,500
Hey, there he is.

190
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,370
Cal State. What do they want?

191
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,840
It's just a coaching offer.

192
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,640
You're throwing it in the trash?
A job offer.

193
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,110
We don't get to talk about it?

194
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,650
College coaching. It's not what I do.

195
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,990
But we should at least discuss it, Bob.

196
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,720
- Terry.
- Hey, great pancakes.

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Wow, okay.

198
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,690
You, Louis Armstrong, in your room.
Practice.

199
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,730
You, million things to do.

200
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,830
Gotta take the tree down.
I've been up since 5.

201
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm just like...

202
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,670
Make sure your room is clean, Michael.

203
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,940
You should at least consider it, Bob.

204
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,410
Great pancakes.

205
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,780
<i>♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪</i>

206
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,580
<i>♪ Ain't no time Like Christmas ♪</i>

207
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,950
He acts like it doesn't
mean anything to him,

208
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,790
but he's got a diary,
just counting down the TDs.

209
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,020
- A diary?
- She's a chronic liar.

210
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,190
A very, very ill young woman.

211
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,890
- Really?
- Did I mention delusional?

212
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
You have a diary.

213
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,800
It's a playbook. At least my earrings

214
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,430
aren't bigger than my girlfriend's.

215
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,170
Sure. Okay. That's mean, but true.

216
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,740
Yo, my fellow Spartans.

217
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,670
Oops. I gotta mind my etiquette.

218
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,710
You're officially Captain Chris

219
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,910
I'm-Gonna-Break-the-State-
TD-Scoring-Record now.

220
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,650
Well,
at least the vote was based on ability,

221
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,920
not family connections, little Lad?

222
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,450
Like how I'm gonna be starting
wide receiver and not you?

223
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,520
Hey, man. It's cool. We'll see.

224
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,790
Oh, look out.

225
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,560
Here comes the luckiest cornhusker

226
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,190
in Contra Costa County. Beasie!

227
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,760
What's up?

228
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,600
- How's it going, fellas?
- Hey, girls.

229
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,770
Unh! My big man on the line!

230
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,900
- Gotta bring it for me!
- To the house!

231
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
- Okay! Woof, woof, woof!
- Woof, woof, woof!

232
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,910
Okay, I'll go freshen up. Wanna come?

233
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,070
Yes.

234
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,510
How much fresher can she get?

235
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,080
- Too fresh for you.
- Sassy.

236
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,050
Why do they do that? Go together.

237
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,090
- How did you get with her?
- She asked me out.

238
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,550
She asked him out.

239
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,590
Tell me you're jumping all over that.

240
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,090
No, we're... We're waiting.

241
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,760
- They're waiting.
- Yeah.

242
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,100
- For what?
- The big day.

243
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,970
We took a purity pledge.

244
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,900
Son,
what's the name of the cult that you're in?

245
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,570
Pleasant Hill Baptist.

246
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,350
That boy's taken one too
many shots to the head.

247
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,250
Sounds like all the other college offers.

248
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,980
- A nice house?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,920
The kids going to college for free?
What was I thinking?

250
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,750
Look, the players are handpicked,

251
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,590
self-motivated, smart,

252
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,590
eyes fixed on their bright futures.

253
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,090
They don't need what I do, Bev.

254
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,730
They don't need a coach who
knows the game inside and out?

255
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,900
Who knows how to teach
kids to become honorable,

256
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
accountable men with self-worth?

257
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,070
Bob, you do it and I've
watched you do it brilliantly

258
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,540
since I was 23 years old.

259
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,610
I wouldn't be helping anyone.

260
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,810
I mean, shouldn't it be easier?
Don't you deserve that?

261
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,020
I've seen the schedule for college coaches.

262
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,280
You think it'd be easier, less grueling?
It would not.

263
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,720
You don't know. How do you know?

264
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,590
I just want you happy and healthy,

265
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,030
and, yeah, home every once in a while,

266
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,960
just playing football with your own kids.

267
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,700
Going for a stupid walk for hot chocolate,

268
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,340
maybe more than, you know, twice a decade.

269
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,840
You... You're gonna get your record, bro.

270
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,810
Even if Mickey has to steal it.

271
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,340
Forget about your dad.

272
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,880
You're 37 touchdowns away
from breaking a state record.

273
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,780
All right, it's about you.

274
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,220
Us.

275
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,590
- Our year.
- Our year.

276
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,190
Hold them high, boys. Hold them high.

277
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,990
T.K. What's up, big guy?

278
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,570
To your year. Chris, you...

279
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,800
You're captain now.

280
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,800
My man Danny over here,
he grew up on the team.

281
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,340
Has all the credit, he
doesn't need a title.

282
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,040
- Kind of makes me wonder.
- About what?

283
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,210
If it's gonna be your year,
or some other team's year.

284
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,180
- K, we haven't lost a game...
- I know, believe me.

285
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm just saying, you guys gotta
open your eyes. You ain't ready.

286
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,820
On skills, you have half the team we did.

287
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,950
On attitude, most of y'all got big heads

288
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,760
or just wanna wear the jersey.

289
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,890
So you gotta step up.
You gotta become real leaders.

290
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,160
You have to motivate your players

291
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,270
to get their game even tighter than ours.

292
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,970
Next year is on you.

293
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,400
Take care, boys.

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,780
- Peace, man.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,680
It's time to deal with
the De La Salle problem.

296
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
Last year,

297
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,820
De La Salle out-scored
league opponents 326 to 27.

298
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,190
Their average score against
league teams was 47 to 4.

299
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,300
How, Bob? How are we supposed
to compete against a program

300
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,270
that pulls in the best players
with the wave of a scholarship?

301
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,730
For the hundredth time,

302
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,870
De La Salle High's code of conduct

303
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,940
forbids scholarshipping athletes.

304
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,770
Explain to me why the best
wide receiver in my district

305
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,240
rides a bus for a solid
hour up to De La Salle.

306
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,380
Our program attracts great athletes,
plain and simple.

307
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,210
No matter how you get your players,

308
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,120
you're stacking your team with talent.

309
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
- That's not cheating?
- Let me get this straight.

310
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,760
You wanna penalize us for
building a winning program?

311
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,290
I'm done with this!

312
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,030
Nobody wins 151 football games
straight without cheating!

313
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,170
We will not play De La Salle next season.

314
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,870
Great. Done. We don't
wanna play you either.

315
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,560
We'll play our five-league games,

316
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,910
then we'll fill our open slots

317
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,880
with tougher teams from bigger conferences.

318
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,180
Gee, seems like I heard

319
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,480
the 49ers already have a full schedule.

320
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,190
Who's left?

321
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,450
Long Beach Poly.

322
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,760
Heh. Eidson,
Poly's the number-one high-school team

323
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,090
in Southern California.

324
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah. Isn't it great?

325
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,830
Poly?

326
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,100
- We talked about this.
- Never said you set it up.

327
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,200
Nationally, we're number one.
They're number two.

328
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,940
They've been trying to
get us on their schedule.

329
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,740
They're not afraid of us.

330
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,510
Guys, can't wait to see you play Poly.

331
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,110
Good luck.

332
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,850
You can thank me later.

333
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,890
In Luke 6:38,

334
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,490
Luke says,
"Give and it will be given to you.

335
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,830
"Good measure, pressed down,
shaken together and running over

336
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,530
"will be poured into your lap,

337
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:51,240
for with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you."

338
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,340
Any idea what Luke is saying here? Arturo?

339
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,980
You reap what you sow.

340
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,880
Like, whatever you do,
good or bad, comes back to you.

341
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,180
Anyone else think you give to others

342
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,980
and the blessing is
returned in equal measure?

343
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,280
Salinas.

344
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,890
I've worked hard to do the right thing,

345
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,990
- and I've been blessed.
- How's that?

346
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,990
Getting to play on the streak team.

347
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,130
You ain't in line

348
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,860
to be starting quarterback
on the streak team

349
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,130
because you've done the right thing.

350
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,370
It's because you're 6'2"
with a cannon for an arm.

351
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,310
So, Tayshon, what do you believe?

352
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,140
Well, down where I sleep,

353
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,540
the dealers in Richmond make mad money.

354
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,140
My aunt was an ER nurse.

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,380
Worked her whole life helping people.

356
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,580
Time came for her to get hers,
they up and fired her,

357
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,020
six months before they
gotta pay her retirement.

358
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Dog-eat-dog, yo. Take what you need.

359
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,550
They don't care how good you've been.

360
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,960
You sitting around waiting
for somebody to pay you back,

361
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,390
you going hungry.

362
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,830
So why does a guy like Luke,

363
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,230
who's a doctor, painter, writer, historian,

364
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,930
take the time to invent a lie?

365
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,470
It ain't a lie.

366
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,440
Your pops dies,

367
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,170
five-0 puts your mom on trial for it when,
oops,

368
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,210
our bad, the shipyard poisoned him.

369
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,440
Pressure gives her a stroke
and now she ain't got long.

370
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,280
Easy. Everyone knows the story.

371
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,580
So tell me, homey. You really been that bad

372
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,430
to deserve all that's come your way?

373
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,050
Can I speak to Cam?

374
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,360
Cam.

Yo, Coach Lad.

383
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,950
Yo, Jamal.

384
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,950
Cool, thanks.

385
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,350
Coach.

386
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,190
You know how you like to talk and talk

387
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,390
- and sometimes holler?
- That's right.

388
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,360
And one time, Cam said you said the S-word.

389
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,990
I remember that time.

390
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, here, you gotta be real quiet.
My mom's resting.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,640
Shh. Not a peep.

392
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,080
Hey, coach.

393
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,380
Cam, look.

394
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,950
Oh, man, that is tight.

395
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,990
Watch Mama, all right?

396
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,120
See, Mama?

397
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
<i>How is she?</i>

398
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,460
The nurse say, um,

399
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,330
it's just a matter of time.

400
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,400
And that's it.
That's the last of my Mohicans.

401
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,100
You have Jamal.

402
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,470
The boy don't know it yet,

403
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,540
but he's going down to San Jose,
stay with my cousin.

404
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,020
They should be good to him,
but ain't got no room for me.

405
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,150
I got nobody left.

406
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:10,160
Well, family isn't just blood relatives.

407
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,560
It's anyone who loves you unconditionally.

408
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,200
"To Coach Lad,

409
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,030
"I promise to live the rest of my days

410
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,140
"by the lessons you taught me.

411
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,210
"'Give and it shall be given to you,

412
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,640
"'for whatever measure you use,

413
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,450
it shall be measured back
to you in equal... '"

414
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,620
Why is this happening to me, coach?

415
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
What did I do?

416
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm trying.

417
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm making my perfect effort.

418
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,200
It don't matter. Ain't enough.

419
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,560
What if Tayshon is right?

420
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,230
Maybe God don't see me, or he don't care,

421
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,270
because I ain't worth his time.

422
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,470
Don't make no sense, coach.

423
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,010
I'm alone.

424
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,610
I got nobody left.

425
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,080
No, you're not.

426
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,350
You've got Jamal,

427
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,150
me and 60 brothers.

428
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,690
I'm just gonna nap for 10 more minutes,
then get up.

429
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,870
Don't snore.

430
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm not laughing.

431
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,740
What did I ever see in you? Bob?

432
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,380
Bob? Bob?

433
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,850
Bob, Bob, please. Bob? Bob?

434
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,510
Danny!

435
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,180
Bob, what's going on? Bob? Oh, my God, Bob!

436
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,190
- Danny!
- Yeah, Mom.

437
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,320
Danny!

438
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,390
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Danny, please call 911!

439
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,330
- Oh, my God! Call 911!
- Mom! Mom!

440
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,330
Dad? Where is the phone? It's not here.

441
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,800
Danny, tell them it's a seizure.

442
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,430
- Find the phone!
- Where is it?

443
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Oh, my God. Look at me.

444
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,440
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

445
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,210
Oh, my God, you okay? You okay? Breathe.

446
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,190
Hey, Amani. Thanks for coming.

447
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,520
Hey, Amani.

448
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,220
Oh, one for me. Just one second.

449
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,320
Cool.

450
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,890
Hey. Who's in there?

451
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,360
Currently paying his respects to the coach,

452
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,930
Maurice Jones Drew.

453
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,170
No way.

454
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,540
Coach, make sure I get you tickets

455
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,340
- to come see me, all right?
- I want 100 from you.

456
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,210
I still can't believe it.

457
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,640
Coach Lad smoking.

458
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,510
- Mrs. Lad. Good seeing you.
- So great to see you.

459
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,220
Take care of the big guy for me.

460
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,190
Okay, I will. Thanks for coming, Maurice.

461
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,950
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Dad.

462
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,590
Don't look so tough now?

463
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,390
Heh, heh, heh.

464
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,430
Mr. Ladouceur.

465
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,960
Eighty-three percent occlusion
in your PLA descending artery.

466
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,530
We call that the widow-maker.

467
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,330
- You're a very lucky man.
- Yeah.

468
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,270
So, what happens next?

469
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,940
Recuperation.

470
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,240
Near-term, I'll be happy

471
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,370
if you're in good condition by April.

472
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,780
That's spring practice.

473
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,810
Not for you.

474
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,950
You've got five stents
and one shot to heal.

475
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,790
Stepping onto a field before summer?

476
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,820
Don't even think about it.

477
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,590
Dad, you're gonna coach me next season,
right?

478
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,760
Danny.

479
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Danny.

480
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,000
Hey, Michael,

481
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,570
wanna go harass some more doctors?

482
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,770
Come on.

483
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,980
Danny's just worried about you.
This really scared him.

484
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,710
It's a lie.

485
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,510
What is?

486
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,680
Me. I got caught up in work

487
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,520
and the streak and let it nearly kill me.

488
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,550
I talk character, honesty, perfection,

489
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,390
commit to each other, your teachers,

490
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,390
your friends, your family.

491
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,460
Was I committed to you?

492
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,000
Was I committed to my children?

493
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I've been a lousy husband
and the worst dad.

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,640
Danny's not angry

495
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,810
because he isn't getting
the chance to play for you.

496
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,810
He's angry because he
wants a chance to know you.

497
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,480
What do I do now?

498
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,530
Spend as much time with your
family as you do the team.

499
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,630
- See you later, babe.
- Call me tonight.

500
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,930
Hey, T.K. Heads up.

501
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,960
- Oh, oh, oh. Over here.
- Who wants it?

502
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,800
- Me.
- All right.

503
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,400
- Me, me, me.
- Right here. Right here.

504
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,640
<i>- What's all this?
- All for you.</i>

505
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,510
<i>This is Coach Little.</i>

506
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,810
<i>The rules say you can't keep any of it yet.</i>

507
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,640
<i>You're getting looks from other schools.</i>

508
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,710
<i>Peek at what you look like in our gear.</i>

509
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,750
If I'd have had these,
I'd have been All City.

510
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,780
<i>Newest model from Nike.</i>

511
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,790
<i>Mrs. Kelly, maybe you wanna
open that last bubble package.</i>

512
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,620
Hey, what you got, T-Gram?

513
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Diploma.

514
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
With your name on it.

515
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,860
What?

516
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
What? What?

517
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,400
<i>No matter what, four years from now,</i>

518
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,700
<i>when you have your real diploma,</i>

519
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,670
<i>it will reward you and your family</i>

520
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,810
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

521
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,340
Yeah, sure.

522
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,010
<i>So you've got a lot of offers.</i>

523
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,680
<i>What's it gonna take to get you
to play for Oregon next year?</i>

524
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,580
Say yes.

525
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,880
- Yes.
- Cam Colvin comes with me.

526
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,620
<i>We offered a full ride.</i>

527
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,420
<i>We know his mother passed away,
but haven't heard back.</i>

528
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,130
Done deal. Full ride.

529
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,560
Oh, we did it, man.

530

Yo, the great Black Hope.

539
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,980
- Cam here?
- He's in the back.

540
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,550
Y'all come on and get something to eat now.

541
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,530
- Oh, coz, what's up?
- What's up?

542
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,030
You get a full ride from
Oregon and dodge my calls.

543
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,800
That's what's up.

544
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,440
Look, man, I ain't going to
Oregon or any place near you.

545
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,740
- I'm going to Miami.
- Miami?

546
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,080
- It's best for me.
- Best for you?

547
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,420
Since day one,
we've been doing what's best for us.

548
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,720
- You and me, together.
- We were 14.

549
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,990
We were friends.

550
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,190
Whatever.

551
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,460
Man, get up! I'm talking to you, dog!

552
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,020
Get off me!

553
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,630
As smart as you are,
you don't know what you don't know!

554
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,160
You still got Landrin,
T-Gram, you got everybody.

555
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,700
All I got left is Jamal.

556
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,900
I gotta make it to the league
so I can take care of him.

557
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,940
Cam, I know how hard this has been...

558
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,170
Don't.

559
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,440
You're just making it harder.
Don't you see?

560
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,010
You see me?

561
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm cursed.

562
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,120
Everyone I love...

563
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,600
I can't lose nobody else, man.

564
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,740
T, I gotta let you go, man.

565
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,850
Man, you done lost a lot of folks, Cam,

566
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,530
but you didn't lose everybody.

567
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,970
- Man, why'd you bring me this?
- It's proof.

568
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,570
We dreamed about playing
college ball since we was kids.

569
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,840
We prayed for it.

570
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,680
And now here we are, damn near grown.

571
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,280
Cam, what you're holding,
that just ain't a jersey, man.

572
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,550
It's an answered prayer.

573
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,550
Look at me, dog.

574
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,160
You and me.

575
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,000
Brothers for life, dog.

576
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,130
Come on.

577
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,610
Brothers for life.

578
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,750
- All right, team, bring it in.
- Everyone settle down.

579
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,290
Coach Lad is on his way in to
say a few words. Bring it down.

580
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,290
Alumbaugh's pulling the team together.

581
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,770
Okay. Good.

582
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,770
I talked to my doctors,

583
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,170
and they don't feel that I should come back

584
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,980
to coaching you.

585
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,350
But rather than drawing
this whole thing out,

586
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm just gonna be truthful with you.

587
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,290
I'm not sure when I'll be able to return.

588
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,760
I expect you seniors to
step up and lead this team.

589
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,130
And I expect you guys

590
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,670
to continue to give a perfect effort,

591
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,040
every game.

592
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,750
Not your typical trumpet number?

593
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,360
- No, not typical. Heh, heh.
- Heh, heh.

594
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,790
Getting the hang of it?

595
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,030
- Me or Michael?
- You.

596
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,900
Anything else I can help you with?

597
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,230
No.

598
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,370
Think you're doing great.

599
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,710
Just remember, I like mine rare.

600
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,080
You got it.

601
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,120
You want the other half of this?

602
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,290
Yeah, sure.

603
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,730
I've dropped more passes this summer

604
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,040
than the previous three years combined.

605
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,170
You're not seeing the ball into your hands.

606
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,410
You're looking up-field before you catch.

607
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,440
I know.

608
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,180
I try to stop, but...

609
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,750
What should I do?

610
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,020
You gotta work on that
with Coach Alumbaugh.

611
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,790
I don't need Coach Alumbaugh.

612
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,190
I need you.

613
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,260
My senior season is here, Dad.
My last shot.

614
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,290
Danny, I'm not your coach.

615
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,760
But I wanna spend some time together,
get closer.

616
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,330
I found a river rafting outfit...

617
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,030
River rafting?

618
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,470
Afterwards,
we'll win the father-son three-legged race.

619
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,970
This is perfect.

620
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,270
The whole time I needed a father,
I got a coach.

621
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,060
And now I need a coach and
all I've got is a lame dad.

622
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,320
- Exercise?
- Running again.

623
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,190
- How are my test scores?
- Better than expected.

624
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,330
Your heart has made an unusually
strong recovery, Mr. Ladouceur.

625
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,730
You're free to return to normal activities.

626
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,730
Coaching?

627
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,440
Keep the stress down, but, yes.

628
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,780
Wow, that's great. It
must be such a relief.

629
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,750
Yeah.

630
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,350
She,

631
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,850
said I could go back to coaching.

632
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,390
So is that your plan, Bob?

633
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,400
We'll see.

634
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,430
Hey.

635
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,170
What's that?

636
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,340
What?

637
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,840
- Smells good.
- Heh, heh.

638
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Me or the sauce?

639
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,210
The sauce.

640
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,380
I was hoping it was me. Heh, heh, heh.

641
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,450
Ready, and go.

642
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,090
Hey, butt kicks.

643
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,890
Ready, up.

644
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,260
You're late.

645
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,130
Yeah, I been busy.

646
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,930
Well, that explains yesterday.
You missed an entire practice.

647
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,430
I got a note from the nurse, little Lad.

648
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,970
How insensitive of us, Chris.
He had a tummy ache.

649
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,440
And you call me that again, I'll drop you.

650
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,540
Now, that's funny.

651
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,980
Nobody misses practice without
clearing it with the captain.

652
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,550
Well, I ain't nobody.
On JV, man, I played both ways.

653
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,120
Caught 38 passes and five picks.
How much practice do I need?

654
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,290
It's not about "I."
It's about us. This team.

655
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,230
Both of y'all can go ahead and kiss my...

656
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,030
Push me? Team?

657
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,500
Ain't no team! Truth is,

658
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,570
it comes down to four or
five of us bringing our game!

659
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,900
Say what you want, Chris, Danny.

660
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,870
This team thing don't mean nothing now!

661
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,200
- Back off!
- Hey, hold up!

662
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,840
"Team" means everything right now.

663
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,710
Look around.

664
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,610
To be successful,
you'll have to scrap for everything.

665
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,140
Wanna be a scrappy team?

666
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,980
You're gonna have to respect each other.

667
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,290
Now, get back to practice.

668
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,590
High kicks.

That's how it's done.
That's how it's done, boy.

684
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,570
So when you headed up to Oregon?

685
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,000
First thing tomorrow, man.

686
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,240
Don't forget about us, homes.

687
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,340

Man, all y'all horrible!

689

on the court, no game.

690
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,290
Have you heard from him?

691
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,650
Boy's got to get up early in the morning.

692
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,990
Okay, Mama.

693
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,460
Yo, Pops, what's up?

694
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,130
You didn't forget to fill the car, did you?

695
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,540
No, I just did. Supreme.

696
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,010

Minister.

748
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,870
I remember the first time I saw T.K.

749
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,210
He was that

750
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,570
awkward freshman, all arms and legs,

751
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,510
with an infectious smile.

752
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,410
A coach couldn't help but notice

753
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,320
the smooth grace of his...

754
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,220
...athletic ability.

755
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,270
People always ask me what
it's like to never lose.

756
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,270
Today, I am lost.

757
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,440
Lord, have mercy.

758
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,410
It's as if life has
taken more than it gives,

759
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,680
and I don't know if I can handle it.

760
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,220
Lord, I'm struggling.

761
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,580
I wanna understand why. Why Terrance?

762
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,260
- Yes, Lord.
- Why now?

763
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
If we are to call ourselves Christians,

764
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
we cannot ask these questions

765
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,730
because to do so is to
question your benevolence,

766
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,230
your divine wisdom.

767
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,600
But today I am lost.

768
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,670
Mr. Kelly,

769
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,200
T-Gram,

770
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,610
I can't even imagine your pain right now.

771
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,810
But you raised the kind of
young man we all strive for.

772
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:30,820
We ask our players to
learn and embrace ideals:

773
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,280
perfection, commitment,

774
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,690
compassion, brotherhood, faith.

775
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,630
From the first time T.K. came
across that field, I saw it.

776
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:45,330
A kid whose grace wasn't just athletic,

777
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,300
but genuine in so many ways.

778
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,340
He embodied those ideals.

779
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,440
Yes, Lord.

780
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,850
You never gave up on anything or anyone.

781
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,310
And I did not teach you.

782
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,580
You taught me.

783
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,520
Thank you,

784
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,990
because when on some other day I am lost

785
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:16,460
and struggling to keep my faith,
I need only remember you.

786
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,100
And for reasons we are not privy to,

787
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,460
God wanted T.K. home.

788
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,770
He is with him now.

789
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,870
May God bless you.

790
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,290
Cam.

791
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,720
Doesn't make no sense, coach.

792
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,490
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do anymore.

793
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,890
You stick to the plan.

794
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,460
Go to Oregon.

795
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,050
Mowing the lawn?

796
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,480
What are you doing out here?

797
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,350
Dancing at our wedding.

798
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,520
With your dad.

799
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,980
He grins, looks over.

800
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,020
You were talking with the priest.

801
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,590
I remember, he leans in and said:

802
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,960
"If you didn't know better,

803
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,060
which one puts the collar
on every morning?"

804
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,070
The music stops.

805
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,710
The dance is over.

806
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,740
And I'm heading over to rescue you.

807
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,650
And he said something I still remember.

808
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,090
What's that?

809
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,090
"I hope you won't be too lonely."

810
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,960
Your dad raised you.

811
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,090
He loved you,

812
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,860
but when he died,

813
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:12,700
I think he felt like he
didn't really know you.

814
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,510
Till a minute ago,
I thought that might happen to me too.

815
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,750
I was sitting up,
watching you sleep, and it hit me.

816
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,980
Some people don't know who they are,

817
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,850
all that they have.

818
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,760
They just know something's missing.

819
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,730
So I was just sitting out here,

820
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,910
getting ready to let you go again.

821
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,980
No, still way too slow.

822
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,620
You need to blow off the ball.
Faster step. Strike with intent.

823
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,980
On Friday, we play a football team

824
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,620
that's been preparing
for this game for a year.

825
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,620
You're not hitting with intensity,

826
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,890
conditioning with discipline.

827
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,990
Salinas, pull your weight. Come on.

828
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,830
- Oh, you're dogging it.
- You're dogging it.

829
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,700
Commitment.

830
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,770
Bellevue is bigger and stronger.

831
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,170
Accountability.
Perfect effort. Finally, love.

832
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,470
This bond is what has led Spartans

833
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,110
to achieve far more than anyone,

834
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,040
including themselves,
believed they were capable of.

835
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,450
Six, seven.

836
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,050
Without it, you may continue to win games.

837
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,920
Rep it out, Tayshon. Four more.

838
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,660
But you will have lost the
chance to become Spartans.

839
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,190
Eight's good.

840
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,530
<i>Welcome to Seattle,
where the 2004 season opens</i>

841
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:55,540
<i>with a matchup between two of
the best teams in the country.</i>

842
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,840
Come on! Whoo!

843
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,510
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

844
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
The powerhouse De La Salle Spartans

845
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,110
and their national record,

846
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,520
151-game winning streak...

847
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,680
- Keep the streak alive!
<i>- ...taking on defending</i>

848
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,920
<i>Washington State champs, Bellevue.</i>

849
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,960
Down, set, hut!

850
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,570
Strong right, lead at two.
Veer, pass, drag. Let's go.

851
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,100
Strong left! Strong left!

852
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,640
Open back 11. Back 11.

853
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,240
Down, set, hut!

854
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,780
<i>Rick Salinas throws a perfect pass,</i>

855
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,220
connecting with Danny
Ladouceur for a 13-yard gain.

856
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,090
Sixteen mid-line on one. Ready?

857
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,660
- Go get them, Beast.
<i>- Chris Ryan.</i>

858
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,860
<i>This man has the size and speed</i>

859
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,660
<i>to play anywhere in the country.</i>

860
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,630
Red dog! Red dog! Set, hut-hut!

861
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,770
Go, go, go! Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris!

862
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,910
Come on, Beast! Come on, Beast!
Come on, Beast!

863
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,580
That's it! Yeah!

864
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,750
<i>Chris Ryan, showing off his ability,
breaks a 45-yard run</i>

865
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,550
<i>to give De La Salle a 7-to-0 lead.</i>

866
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,020
That's a great run,

867
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,750
but our left tackle needs
to seal that backer better.

868
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,720
<i>Ryan has been a scoring machine,</i>

869
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,160
<i>amassing 52 touchdowns</i>

870
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,630
<i>in his sophomore and junior seasons.</i>

871
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,800
<i>He is now 36 touchdowns away</i>

872
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,800
from breaking the California
career touchdown record.

873
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,140
Twenty-two. Hut, set, hut!

874
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,210
Beaser!

875
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,010
This is like the drill we
run every day at practice!

876
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,110
Shed that block and get
to the ball carrier!

877
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,610
Okay.

878
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
They're changing it up.

879
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,920
They're in man to man,
then dropping to cover two.

880
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,720
Why don't you simplify it?
Read the free safety.

881
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,260
Free safety will tell you everything.

882
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,260
- Whoo!
- What? Someone break one?

883
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,330
Stop him! Stop him!

884
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,670
Get after him!

885
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,670
Jeez!

886
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,000
Bellevue's Taylor King
breaks a 76-yard touchdown.

887
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,940
<i>This Bellevue team is not
afraid of De La Salle.</i>

888
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,340
<i>We may just have a game here.</i>

889
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,690
And yet another completion.
First down, Bellevue.

890
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,260
They're playing exactly like us.

891
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,660
This Wolverine passing attack
is shredding De La Salle.

892
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,130
It's a three-deep and you got beat?

893
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,730
Your responsibility is the quarterback

894
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,670
when they run the option. Right?

895
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,140
We practiced all of this, come on, now!

896
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,780
You have to break down to make that stop.

897
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,120
Don't get caught flat-footed.

898
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,690
No, no, no!

899
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,020
Stop him! Stop him!

900
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,390
God!

901
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,160
Here's something nobody expected.

902
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,830
The Wolverines are controlling
the line of scrimmage

903
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,700
<i>against De La Salle.</i>

904
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,170
They're beating us off
the ball on every snap.

905
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,840
Down.

906
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,110
Blue 22! Blue 22!

907
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,270
Set.

908
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,180
Go left! Go left!

909
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,280
Hut!

910
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,990
<i>Bellevue scores to give the
Washington State champions</i>

911
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,160
<i>a 28-to-7 lead over powerhouse De La Salle.</i>

912
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,330
We're gonna lose.

913
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,430
Argh!

914
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,770
Hit Danny on a 12-yard curl in the seam

915
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,720
between the linebacker and the safety.

916
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,480
Down, set, hut!

917
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,820
<i>Oh! Danny Ladouceur drops a pass.</i>

918
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,920
<i>His dad will not be happy about that.</i>

919
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,220
Gotta get it to the players.

920
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,350
He's gotta catch it, Bev.

921
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,160
Ready. Set, hut!

922
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,760
<i>Ladouceur's hit and coughs up the ball!</i>

923
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,400
Gotta hold on to that ball, Danny!

924
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,100
<i>Bellevue recovers. Bellevue recovers.</i>

925
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,230
I don't care how good you think you are!

926
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,960
I'm the best receiver on this team.

927
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,170
I ran my route, they attacked, man.
Ran the ball right by you.

928
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,500
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

929
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,170
Eight, seven,

930
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,780
six, five, four...

931
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,040
Down, hut!

932
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,980
...three, two, one.

933
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,410
<i>And that's it. The streak is over!
The streak is over!</i>

934
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,920
<i>The longest winning streak
in sports history is now over</i>

935
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>as the Bellevue Wolverines</i>

936
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,860
<i>have shocked the De La Salle Spartans</i>

937
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,990
<i>in perhaps the biggest upset</i>

938
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,860
<i>in high-school football history.</i>

939
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,840
Are you okay? It's okay.

940
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,190
Hey, hey! We don't do that here.

941
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,230
We don't do that.

942
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,870
Reporters, friends, family, strangers.

943
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,900
They're all gonna ask the same thing:

944
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,870
"What happened?"

945
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,070
This is a question that's gonna follow you.

946
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,440
"How did you lose the streak?"

947
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,210
And every time,
you're gonna answer the truth:

948
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,080
"Bellevue played better than us

949
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,420
and we lost a high-school football game."

950
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,320
That's football.

951
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,620
But it's not you.

952
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,490
Don't let a game define who you are.

953
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:31,230
Let the way you live your lives do that.

954
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,640
Coach.

955
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,140
I truly believe that life's
most impressionable lessons

956
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,380
are ones where something bad happens to you

957
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,650
or something challenging confronts you.

958
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,380
No one can climb into your head and hear

959
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,550
what that little voice is saying to you.

960
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,650
Is it saying, "Oh, no, we lost the streak?"

961
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,250
Well, what's it gonna say?

962
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,560
After today, you're gonna find out

963
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,260
a lot about yourselves.

964
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,230
And you know something,
we're all gonna find out

965
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,070
what this team is made of.

966
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,410
<i>The effort you put in during
the off-season was commendable.</i>

967
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:29,020
But it has not translated onto the field.

968
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,590
You've got to decide what you wanna be.

969
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,160
<i>I get the feeling from you as a team</i>

970
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,110
that you just wanna hop on that throne

971
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:42,430
<i>and place the championship
ring on your finger.</i>

972
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,700
That you're at De La
Salle and deserve that.

973
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,700
<i>For the most part,</i>

974
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,670
<i>we're inconsistent, mistake-prone, ragged,</i>

975
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,040
<i>and not very physical.</i>

976
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,970
That's where we are.

977
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:57,070
As much as you don't wanna hear it,
that's my assessment.

978
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,140
Do I feel like you can pull this off

979
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,680
and earn the right to that throne?
Yeah, I do.

980
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,680
Attaboy, attaboy!

981
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,000
I'm not hoping you play
well against Clayton Valley.

982
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,590
You have to.
You have to play well this week.

983
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,760
Even if you step it up and
play at your ability level,

984
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,620
it still won't be easy.

985
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,520
<i>You're gonna have to fight
for victories in those games.</i>

986
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,450
All right, that's it, that's it!

987
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,300
Oh, he's got a seam! Go, go, go!

988
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,340
- Nice work.
- Oh, for...!

989
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,710
Argh!

990
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,080
<i>Despite a well-played game,
De La Salle comes up short,</i>

991
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,610
<i>and after two games,
is still winless in this young season.</i>

992
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:40,220
<i>Bob Ladouceur's gonna have
to figure something out</i>

993
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,250
<i>to get this team on track</i>

994
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,730
<i>if they plan on making
it to playoffs this year.</i>

995
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,460
Pick up your heads.

996
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,100
Meet me at the locker room tomorrow.

997
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,280
Eight a.m.

998
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,710
What's up, Alex?

999
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,280
Miss you. I'm all sweaty.

1000
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,450
It's okay. It was a tough game.

1001
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,550
Party is tomorrow, if you wanna go.

1002
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,120
Maybe. I don't know. If you do.

1003
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,260
- Are you kidding me?
- Dad, please.

1004
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,090
You let some punk pull you
down at the two-yard line.

1005
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,500
I scored three touchdowns.

1006
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,270
How many did you promise?

1007
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,430
- Mr. Ryan, please.
- Laurie, stop.

1008
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,270
Forty-one blast. Run it, now.

1009
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,800
Dad, it's midnight. I'm tired.

1010
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,340
So am I.

1011
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,810
Forty-one blast. Run it, now.

1012
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,640
You run it!

1013
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,810
Unh!

1014
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,750
You listen close.

1015
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,210
I want that record.

1016
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,820
He's not gonna get it for
you with a busted rib.

1017
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,320
Now let him go.

1018
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,360
Hey, coach. Let's you and me
huddle up for a second, okay?

1019
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,830
I don't usually huddle up with parents,
Mick.

1020
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,220
You think this is gonna freak them out?

1021
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,660
I certainly hope so.

- Good morning, Carol.
- Hi, Bob.

1030
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,530
Nurse Ballard is a friend of mine.

1031
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,230
She's in charge of the
entire nursing staff.

1032
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,260
Today, we will be following her orders.

1033
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,730
Coach Lad and I worked

1034
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:20,770
at the Juvenile Detention
Center in Richmond.

1035
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,640
It was a little longer
ago than I'd rather admit.

1036
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,610
So you guys play a tough game.
Anybody ever been injured?

1037
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,250
You've never been injured?

1038
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,550
It's part of the game.

1039
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,920
You don't think about it, you bounce back.

1040
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,650
You're very brave.

1041
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,290
This is not that.

1042
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,220
Here, nobody bounces.

1043
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,460
Break into three groups.
When you hear your name,

1044
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,430
follow the nurse who called
it to the appropriate unit.

1045
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,600
Let's go.

1046
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,370
Nurse Adams is in charge
of the Recovery Ward,

1047
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,870
and she will take over from here.

1048
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,940
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to the VA Recovery Ward.

1049
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,270
So here we specialize in transplants,

1050
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,510
amputations and general rehabilitation

1051
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,280
for limb recovery. Our focus here

1052
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,680
is on full recovery, body and spirit.

1053
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,990
If this is too hard for anybody,
don't come in.

1054
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,890
Why would it be?

1055
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,530
All our patients are
here for rehabilitation.

1056
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,360
Our job is to help them
recover from injuries

1057
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,230
received during combat.

1058
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,830
It's long and difficult,

1059
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,540
but we're dedicated to getting
them back to functioning lives.

1060
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,980
- Hey, May.
- Hey.

1061
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,980
Hello?

1062
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,580
I'll be right there.

1063
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,160
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Would you finish up?

1064
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,860
Thanks.

1065
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:14,870
What are you looking at?

1066
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,810
Oh, no, no, I just, um...

1067
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,440
- You just what?
- Nothing.

1068
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:21,350
What's the matter, boy?

1069
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,910
Get on. Pace me.

1070
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,450
What?

1071
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,950
You do speak English, right?

1072
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,830
Get on, pace me.

1073
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,800
What? What did I do? Did I hurt you?

1074
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:50,510
Heh, heh.
No, I'm just messing with you, man.

1075
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,040
I can't feel anything.

1076
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,050
Heh. Wow.

1077
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,880
Man, I...

1078
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,820
Sometimes my legs hurt so bad,
I'd wish I didn't feel anything.

1079
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,660
No, you don't.

1080
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,730
No, I don't.

1081
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:18,000
What's wrong with you, boy? You blind?

1082
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,730
My bad, man. I didn't see you.

1083
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,440
No, man. I swear I didn't even see you.

1084
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,070
Hey, what the...? Hey! Hey, man!

1085
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,740
Is that...? Was that pee?

1086
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,780
Well, it sure ain't no Gatorade.

1087
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,380
Oh, heck, no!

1088
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,850
Hey, nurse!

1089
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,820
Come on, man!

1090
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,390
Come on, Danny. You gotta speed this up.

1091
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,620
All right. Let him catch up, though.

1092
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,630
Oh, great. You're a real gentleman.

1093
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,460
Oh, baby.

1094
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,670
Stop. Salinas. Quit it.

1095
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,700
Salinas, enough.

1096
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,500
I don't know if it is fast enough.

1097
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,570
Show me what you got.

1098
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,480
Let's go, Danny. Show him what you got.

1099
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,780
One night we get overrun.

1100
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,110
I just curled up, waiting to die.

1101
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,780
Till somebody dragged me
into this deserted mosque.

1102
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,880
I look at the guy who just saved my butt.

1103
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:16,150
He's just some hillbilly kid from Arkansas.

1104
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,790
Hey, at least you got out.

1105
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,160
If they could put me back together,
I'd go back today.

1106
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,000
For what?

1107
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,570
My unit.
Listen, half of them are still over there.

1108
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,130
That don't make no sense.

1109
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,830
It's simple.

1110
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,410
Over there,
who you are in the world don't matter.

1111
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,740
Fighting for your country don't matter.

1112
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,910
What does?

1113
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,610
The guy next to you.

1114
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,710
It's a brotherhood.

1115
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,850
- Let's go, boys.
- You're running. Come on.

1116
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,020
Come on, Danny. Spartans for life, baby.

1117
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,120
Live together. Die together.

1118
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,820
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

1119
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,760
You wanna go faster?

1120
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,030
Let's go faster.

1121
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,800
- Don't let us down, baby.
- Come on.

1122
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,600
Let's go, baby. Come on, Danny.

1123
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,470
You got this, dog.
Don't stop, baby. Come on.

1124
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,540
Do not stop on me. Do not stop.

1125
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,080
You're a Spartan. Don't stop, Danny.

1126
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,710
I can't. I can't.

1127
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,820
- What?
- He's gonna go forever.

1128
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,620
No.

1129
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:33,530
Not forever, Danny.

1130
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,460

By every measure,

1140
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,820
the best high-school
football team in the nation.

1141
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:11,060
Offensive line, average over 300 pounds.

1142

Their starters. Beaser,

Three hundred and thirty
pounds of pure aggression.

1145

Poly runs 60 percent of
their plays behind him.

1146
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,920
And you're gonna face him the whole game.

1147
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,950
But we have speed, right?

1148
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,680
Their number-one wideout clocks a 4.440.

1149

I don't think we have anyone that fast.

Their key player?
Strong safety Darnell Bing.

1151
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,960
Just committed to SC

1152
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,990
and plays like he's been there three years.

1153
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,230
Tayshon.
You're a better match for this guy's speed.

1154
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,870
You're gonna start against Poly.

1155
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,870
You're going into the most
physically demanding moment

1156

<i>One tradition that defined this program</i>

1170
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,170
<i>is the willingness of our players</i>

1171
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,640
to share their emotions at
the end of these meetings.

1172
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,070
This team hasn't done that.

1173
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,970
You guys are still carrying around

1174
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:11,680
the stigma of losing the streak.
Forget that.

1175
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,210
Forget it.

1176
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,020
Open up.

1177
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,100
Talk to each other.

1178
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,100
My brother was captain of the 2000 team.

1179
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,310
In four years, he never lost one game.

1180
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:50,080
When we blew the streak,
I couldn't look him in the eye.

1181
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,720
I'm done with that.

1182
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,690
Everything we've been
through was for a reason:

1183
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,150
To bring us together.

1184
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,760
I love you guys.

1185
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,390
I will die on that field
before I let you down.

1186
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,670
Collapse. Not die.

1187
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,620
It's just a high-school football game.

1188
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,070
I've been on this team four years.

1189
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:24,180
I've never once played in
a varsity football game.

1190
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,780
I mean, I'm not good enough.

1191
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:32,280
And that's okay,
because the greatest moments of my life

1192
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,890
were the times I've spent
on this team with you.

1193
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:40,170
I've never been prouder of
anything than being a Spartan.

1194
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:51,770
When we first watched Poly's film,

1195
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,740
and I saw Buster Matthews,

1196
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,910
I was scared.

1197
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:00,810
Then I remembered
something Coach Lad told us

1198
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,150
on my first day of practice.

1199
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:06,820
"Face your fears."

1200
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,120
That night I pasted
Buster's name and his number

1201
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,960
on my ceiling above my bed.

1202
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,890
And every night since,
no matter how tired I was,

1203
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,960
I've been saying:

1204
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,430
"Buster Matthews, number 79,

1205
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:24,740
you are mine."

1206
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,500
A hundred times every night.

1207
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,440
I promise you, guys.

1208
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,920
We're not gonna lose
because of Buster Matthews.

1209
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,130
My old man is insane.

1210
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,860
My mom used to keep him in line,
but he wore her out.

1211
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,100
Once I made the team,
I thought it'd be better.

1212
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,370
He became an animal.

1213
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,440
I hated him.

1214
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,250
Funny thing is, what...

1215
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,050
What saved me was being on this team.

1216
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,080
I used to play as hard as I could

1217
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,920
because I thought that
would make him happy.

1218
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,320
And then I'd be happy.

1219
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,900
You guys love me whether I'm
scoring touchdowns or not.

1220
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,040
I was missing that,
and you guys gave it to me.

1221
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,810
I could never repay you for that.

1222
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,280
But come tomorrow,

1223
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,820
I don't play for him.

1224
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,250
I play for you.

1225
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,950

01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,180
Dive in the end zone one
more time and I bench you.

1273
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,750
We're not a celebrating team.

1274
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,450
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

1275
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:48,350
We knew they were quick.
Now we've seen how quick.

1276
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,450
Settle them down.
Let's show them real speed.

1277

1284
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:13,040

<i>determination and toughness.</i>

1294

Reverse!

1295
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,640
- No! No!
- That's how you play football!

<i>Poly gets its first score of the game,

On the pre-game show,
De La Salle's assistant coach

1299
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,820
Terry Eidson said

1300
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,550
the heat could be a factor in today's game.

1301
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,190
Pssh. He wasn't kidding.

1302

1303

<i>With eight minutes left in the half,</i>

1310
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,450
De La Salle's two-way players
are struggling to get back up.

1311
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:40,560
And because Poly has a hundred-man roster,

1312
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,420
nobody plays both ways.

1313
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,130
This could be a huge
factor in today's game.

1314

Five-forty down! Fifty-fifty!

1315

You know why they call me Buster?

1316

Poly's coming on strong.

1371
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,860
There's no way we can start Beaser or Chris

There is no a.c. in here.

1377

Determine if they can play.

1379

You're gonna handle substitutions.

1380

- Okay, coach.
- Rotate in the second-stringers.

1381

01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,910
That was amazing. Amazing.

1428

<i>Poly lines up for a field goal. High snap.</i>

1429
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,460
<i>The kick is up, and...</i>

1430
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,930
<i>no good.</i>

1431
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:18,090
- Yeah! Let's go!
- See that? That's on you.

1432
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,200
If you don't make that stop,
they don't miss that field goal.

1433
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:25,240
<i>Poly misses. The score remains 21-17.</i>

1434
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,770
Yo, coach, coach.

1435
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,070
Yo, take a look at us, man. We ready to go.

1436
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,010
- Beaser?
- I'm ready.

1437
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,180
- Tayshon?
- I'm ready.

1438
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:36,180
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

1439
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,780
Bob. They're ready.

1440
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,150
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1441
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,820
All right, D, 40 cover two and go.

1442
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,690
Let's go, man. Let's go.

1443
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,740
It looks like the starters are
running back onto the field.

1444
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,630
This is no longer about who the bigger,

1445
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,590
faster, stronger players are.

1446
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,230
It's about who plays with more heart.

1447
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,640
- Relax. We're good.
- That's right.

1448
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,200
- Fifty!
- Draw right.

1449
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,040
Set, hut!

1450
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,250
Go, go, go!

1451
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,080
No! No!

1452
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,820
The Jackrabbits have come back

1453
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:25,560
<i>and now lead 24-21 over
an exhausted De La Salle.</i>

1458
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,740
That's how you wrap them up! Good job!

1459
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,740
Get off of him!

1460
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,880
How are they still on their feet?

1461
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,750
Those linebackers are flying out of there.

1462
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,050
Run the draw. Go.

1463
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,620
Set, hut!

1464

Come on, Chris! Come on, Chris!

1465
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,890
Yeah! Go!

1466

28-24.

1468
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:12,870
What do you think?
You can't play with the Beast.

1469
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,840
You can't play with the Beast.

1470
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,140
With two minutes left in what is a classic

1471
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,580
high-school football game...

1472
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,610

Hey, man, take it down.

1552
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:32,100
How does it feel to go from

1553
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,070
to the biggest winner?

1554
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:37,040

Hey, coach. Great game Friday.

1604
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,530
Three more touchdowns for the Beast.

1605
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:22,130
Yeah, he played well.

1606
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:24,400
- Whole team did.
- Hey, Chris!

1607
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,730
Over here! Hi!

1608
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,230
What's up?

1609
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,500
Get ready to break that scoring record.

1610
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,470
Got a place for the trophy all picked out.

1611
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:34,140
- Hey, Mickey?
- Yeah?

1612
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,680
Did Chris show you the
thesis he wrote for my class

1613
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,110
on Matthew 23:12?

1614
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:41,110
Amazingly insightful for someone his age.

1615
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:44,490
Really terrific. You should read it.

1616
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:50,520
Matthew 23:12? Seriously?

1617
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,430
What's he talking about?

1618
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,560
We're on our way to a championship,
a state record.

1619
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,330
Those who exalt themselves will be humbled,

1620
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:00,800
those who humble themselves
will be exalted.

1621
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,270
- Exalted?
- Yeah.

1622
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,570
You get 37 touchdowns in the season,

1623
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,470
then you'll be exalted.

1624
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:07,470
Sheesh.

1625
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,450
Do you realize what winning this
record is gonna mean for you?

1626
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:15,610
For your life?

1627
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:19,150
Do you have any idea how
people are gonna look at you?

1628
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,680
How they're gonna respect you?

1629
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:24,420
Breaking this record, you'll have something

1630
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:28,430
that nobody can ever take from you. Nobody.

1631
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,460
That's why I push you so hard.

1632
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:33,100
It's not about me, it's about you.

1633
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,840
You're a salesman, Dad.

1634
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,140
I'm a what?

1635
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,540
You sell cars.

1636
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:46,840
Don't try and sell me.

1637
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,710
This is for you.

1638
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:52,280
I'm just another one of your
trophies you keep in your case.

1639
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,780
Like all the medals you've been collecting

1640
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,480
to show everybody when they walk in.

1641
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,690
I am sick of it.

1642
01:34:57,690 --> 01:35:00,530
What are you trying to say?
You don't want this record?

1643
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,230
What do you care?!
It's always about what you want!

1644
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,490
You little punk.

1645
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,330
Don't you ever talk to me like that!

1646
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,860
While you live in my house,
you will do as I say,

1647
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:14,530
and you will show me the respect I deserve!
You understand me?

1648
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:16,870
Now you tell me with that mouth of yours,

1649
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:21,240
you promise me that you'll go
out and get me that record.

1650
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:25,210
- Promise me, Chris.
- Okay.

1651
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:28,880
No, Chris. I wanna hear you say it. Say it!

1652
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,450
I promise I'll get you that record, Dad!

1653
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,520
Attaboy.

1654
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,530
<i>And in local sports, we toss it to Jim,</i>

1655
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:44,830
<i>who's standing by at De La Salle high.</i>

1656
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,700
<i>De La Salle Spartans pulled off</i>

1657
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,170
<i>one of the greatest comebacks in sports.</i>

1658
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:51,170
<i>After a devastating opening,</i>

1659
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,540
<i>they're poised to compete
for their 13th championship.</i>

1660
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,800
Dad, look. It's about
the championship game.

1661
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:57,890
<i>All around me and very excited</i>

1662
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,750
<i>are the new generation of Spartans.</i>

1663
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,910
<i>What grade are you guys in?</i>

1664
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,650
<i>Sophomores, play on the JV.</i>

1665
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:05,550
<i>You're riding a nine-game streak.</i>

1666
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,520
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

1667
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,490
<i>If we go undefeated in our
junior- and senior-year season,</i>

1668
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:13,560
<i>we're gonna push this
streak to 33 games in a row.</i>

1669
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,530
<i>Thirty-three, 33, 33!</i>

1670
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:17,890
<i>Thirty-three games in a row.</i>

1671
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,000
<i>Thirty-three, 33, 33!</i>

1672
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,500
<i>Back to you.</i>

1673
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,810
<i>Thirty-three, 33, 33!</i>

1674
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:30,620
Bob?

1675
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,960
Hey, you.

1676
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,500
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

1677
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,400
Are you seriously considering that?

1678
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,670
You know, when we started
this 25 years ago,

1679
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,510
there was no Internet.

1680
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,580
No high-school football on TV.

1681
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,710
Not every kid alive was a celebrity.

1682
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:14,410
It's all changed now.

1683
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:18,560
Maybe the kids have changed too.

1684
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,760
All the things I've taught and believed in.

1685
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,330
I don't know if I'm still
doing much good here.

1686
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,740
I better get some sleep.

1687
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:56,680
Is this mine?

1688
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:00,410
Who else's would it be?
Of course it's yours.

1689
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:01,820
How do I look?

1690
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,950
- Real cool, man. Real cool.
- Thank you.

1691
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:07,350
Oh, my gosh.

1692
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,560
- Okay, I'm dying, I'm dying.
- Thank you again.

1693
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,890
Get dressed. Let's go to the game.

1694
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:14,560
De La Salle staged a miraculous comeback

1695
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,030
for an unprecedented 13th shot
at the sectional championship.

1696
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:21,800
On the line for running back
Chris Ryan is a personal quest

1697
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,540
as he takes the field
only three touchdowns away

1698
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,910
from breaking a record.

1699
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:29,380
Let us begin.

1700
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,580
Our father, who art in heaven,

1701
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:32,980
<i>hallowed be thy name.</i>

1702
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:34,910
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done</i>

1703
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,850
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1704
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:40,650
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

1705
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,990
<i>as we forgive those who
trespass against us.</i>

1706
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:47,020
Lead us not to temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

1707
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,760
- One, two, three.
- Spartans!

1708
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,500
<i>This season is ending</i>

1709
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,160
<i>with De La Salle in a familiar place:</i>

1710
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:55,970
<i>Competing for their 13th North
Coast section championship.</i>

1711
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,710
<i>Danny Ladouceur is slammed to the turf,</i>

1712
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:06,910
<i>but somehow holds on for
a De La Salle first down.</i>

1713
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,480
Yeah, Danny boy!

1714
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,150
Huddle up. Get it to Chris. Let's go.

1715
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:12,520
<i>De La Salle is a favorite to win this game.</i>

1716
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,650
<i>And most eyes are on Chris Ryan's quest</i>

1717
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:17,890
<i>for a touchdown scoring record.</i>

1718
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:25,930
Yeah!

1719
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,160
Yeah, that's it! That's it! Way to go.

1720
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,100
One down, two to go for the record.

1721
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,170
Two more touchdowns for the record.

1722
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:35,570
<i>Chris Ryan's historic run at
the state touchdown record</i>

1723
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:37,510
<i>continues with another touchdown</i>

1724
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:39,940
<i>as De La Salle takes a 7-0 lead.</i>

1725
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,190
Pick him up!

1726
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:50,650
No!

1727
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:55,020
Why didn't you tackle him?
It is a contact sport.

1728
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,790
You can hit someone. It's encouraged even!

1729
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,160
Yes!

1730
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:02,000
<i>With just a little over five minutes left</i>

1731
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,630
<i>in the second quarter in this
hard-fought championship,</i>

1732
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,230
<i>the score is tied, 7-7.</i>

1733
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:09,470
Beaser, you need to keep him contained!

1734
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:12,540
Hut, blue one. Hut!

1735
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,180
Reverse! Reverse!

1736
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,940
Ooh! Oh!

1737
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:21,250
- Contain the runner!
- Contain the runner!

Coach.

1747
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:50,210
Watch the defensive back.

1748
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:51,640
He leans inside a lot.

1749
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,110
When he does, beat him to the corner.

1750
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:56,650
Give him a hard fake on your first move.
Finish strong.

1751
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:59,580
Corner.

1752
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,980
Thirty-four, 34. Give it to 34.

1753

1760

Come on, block for him!

1772
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,930
Give him some help, will you?

1773
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:25,670
Come on!

1774
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:29,930
One more for the record.

1775
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:32,740
Give it to the Beast. Give it to Chris.

1776
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:39,180
Down.

1777

1780
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:04,370
Come on, come on.
There's still time. Still time.

1781
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,800
Let's get it to Chris.

1782
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,840
<i>Chris, Chris, Chris!</i>

1783
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,840
Break that record, son! Let's go!

1784
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,380
Here we go, baby,
41 blast into the record books.

1785
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,150
Hoo-hoo-hoo. Here we go.

1786
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:20,780
It's the last play of the game, dog.
Make me proud.

1789
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:32,690

1790
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,760
What are they doing?

1791
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't know. It's their drive.

1792
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,120
- What are you doing?
- Coach Lad's doing this for me.

1793
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,010
He won't say...

1794
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:47,210
Dude, what are you talking about?

1795
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:49,080
I just...

1796
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,940
I don't want my last play
as a Spartan to be about me.

1797
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:55,080
Why not?
You trained to get here, you deserve it.

1798
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,420
Look, it's an easy shot.

1799
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:00,020
He never took the easy shot.

1800
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,760
Coming back to coach us,
he could have died.

1801
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,760
And what have we done for him?

1802
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,430
Won a few games? A championship?

1803
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:11,760
No, he's right.

1804
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,760
While we've been staring at the dirt,

1805
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,770
coach has been saying look up.

1806
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:18,240
It's about time we did.

1807
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,310
It's time for us to stand tall.
Victory formation.

1808
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:24,340
No, no, no. You gotta do it.

1809
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,050
All right.

1810
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:31,920
Boys,
no matter where we go or what we achieve,

1811
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,050
nothing's gonna come close
to what we have right here.

1812
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:37,720
You're all my brothers. Spartans for life.

1813
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,290
Spartans for life.

1814
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:43,760
Shotgun formation, direct snap,
on me, on one. Ready?

1815
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,160
<i>De La Salle is lining
up in shotgun formation,</i>

1816
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,360
<i>but Chris Ryan is quarterback
instead of Salinas.</i>

1817
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:52,770
<i>This is a formation we
haven't seen from De La Salle.</i>

1818
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:54,240
<i>Look for Ryan to run this in</i>

1819
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:57,440
<i>for his record-setting
89th career touchdown.</i>

1820
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,280
Maybe this wasn't the best
time to give Salinas free will.

1821
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,210
Down. Set, hut!

1822
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,780
<i>The snap, and Ryan...</i>

1823
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:10,150
- What the hell was that?
<i>- ...takes a knee.</i>

1824
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:14,090
<i>Wow, rather than running in
for his 89th career touchdown,</i>

1825
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:16,760
<i>Chris Ryan instead opts to take a knee.</i>

1826
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,190
What are you doing, coach?

1827
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:22,430
Let him run it. Forty-one blast, come on.

1828
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:24,900
There's still time. Run it! Run it!

1829
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,770
Mickey, Bob's not calling the plays.

1830
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,800
You don't understand football.

1831
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,840
It's not about football.

1832
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,040
Your husband is costing my son this record.

1833
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,880
My husband's turning your son into a man.

1834

You're the only person who doesn't see.

<i>Ryan takes another knee.</i>

1838
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:46,950
Time out. Stop that clock, Ladouceur.

1839
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:49,090
Stop that clock and run that play!

1840
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:52,120
Run the play!
Let him get the record! Come on!

1841

01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,230
and out in our community,

1896
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:42,530
you can be depended on.

1897
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:44,130
Lad said it. He goes:

1898
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:47,340
"You know, if, you know,
Terry wasn't on my staff,

1899
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,600
<i>I wouldn't be doing this right now."</i>

1900
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,170
<i>There's a tremendous bond</i>

1901
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:53,340
<i>of trust and friendship that's there.</i>

1902
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:55,580
<i>They share a commitment to their players.</i>

1903
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:59,710
<i>No matter what's going on,
the players come first,</i>

1904
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:01,550
<i>and that means the team.</i>

1905
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:04,650
<i>They will never sacrifice
the team for the individual.</i>

1906
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:07,460
<i>And all they wanna do
is create a community,</i>

1907
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:11,300
<i>have a common goal, and play the game.</i>

1908
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,430
We're De La Salle.
Some guys wanna call it a curse,

1909
01:52:20,430 --> 01:52:23,170
I say that's the blessing of De La Salle.

1910
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:25,400
You gotta go out every week and prove it.

1911
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:30,580
So when you show up tomorrow,
whatever it is that excites you,

1912
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:32,280
whatever it is that's gonna get you

1913
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:35,680
to bring your A-game and your A-heart,

1914
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,180
you bring it and you do it.

1915
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,220
I don't know what that is for you.

1916
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:42,290
What is it that gets your heart swollen.

1917
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:45,620
Hopefully,
it's gonna be that last chapter in the book

1918
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:48,900
that you've written for yourself this year.

1919
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,560
And I'd like to say,

1920
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:55,230
I'd like to just call that
last chapter just what...

1921
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:57,200
Just what Coach Eidson called it.

1922
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,640
Last chapter of the book

1923
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:02,310
isn't the NCS 3A title or San Leandro.

1924
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:05,340
It's "Brotherhood."

1925
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,780
That's what it should be titled.
