1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:03,979
you move already

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:04,983
Hey this is luke

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,398
this is my film

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,571
let me ask you a couple of questions

5
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,407
why do you dance?

6
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:10,339
because its like

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,298
breathing, its like walking to me

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,668
i'm not pretending, and when i dance, i dont pretend

9
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,769
i'm more my self when i dance
then any other moment in the day

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,812
i dance to become someone else

11
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:23,872
there is a so many things in this world want to
push down on you

12
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,000
but when you dance you're free

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,616
we started dancing at the age of 7

14
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,305
in our house, in the living room

15
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,600
just dancing dancing copy ah copy michael jackson

16
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,864
and i'm just like listening to the music in the grocery store

17
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,227
just like dancing to
the alvis and stuff like this

18
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,426
she is like..
contain your self! calm down

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,010
and i'm like, i cant stop,
i have to do it, i have to do it

20
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:44,746
after everybodies went to sleep i would

21
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,598
open the grage and just practise

22
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,093
thats petty much when i knew like

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:54,004
i love it, because i never dedected so
much time and efforts to something like that

24
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,482
its not like just jumping around
dance has vocabulary

25
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:57,984
i'm from Argentina

26
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:00,102

00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:58,732
my parents used to be dancers
and they started this place for people like them

313
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,869
but they didnt just wanna be a back up dancers

314
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:06,905
you know, do their own thing
build their own respect

315
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,706
i thought that was cool
so i wanted to carry on the tradition

316
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:13,199
in my own way
but for them you know

317
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,550
so what is they think of you turning
this place into a mad house

318
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,455
they never get to see it

319
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:31,614
i'm so sorry

320
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,975

321
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,174

322
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,652

323
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:40,883
family are family

324
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:44,389
you know, the vault used to be their life
and now its mine

325
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,112

326
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,123

327
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,082

362
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:45,204

363
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:48,514
he does not look anything like me
and i will not ... to those controverters

364
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:51,181
i've seen your works and you dont ...

365
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,763
yeah but just for fun
its not something profissional

366
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:58,199
well what if the pirates and the rivalry didnt exist?

367
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,118
wouldnt you give your film making a shot?

368
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,673

369
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:05,053
yeah but its not an option

370
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:06,975
so i dont think about it

371
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,122
the world jams are my main focus

372
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:12,281

409
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:05,591
it can not be
they know our whole set

410
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,579
what do you mean? who would do that?
julian and the samurai

411
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:10,660
how could they get our rehearsal footage
does everyone has their DVDs?

412
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:15,416
they're just stoling it alright
we just gotta figure something else

413
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:17,759
okay you see there?

414
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,915
if you could just let go on that spin
we can laing this thing

415
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:23,429
those guys may have our tapes
but that wont stop us

416
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:24,426

417
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:26,653
luke i dont know

418
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,676
maybe somebody else should do it

419
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:31,427
if we pull this off
we'll kill on the stage

420
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:32,890
julian wont even know what hit him

421
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,708
whatever happened between you two?

422
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:40,364
me and julian?

423
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,920
he used to be a pirate

424
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:47,047
we used to be best friend back on the days
but as time were on i think he changed

425
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:48,651
how do you mean he changed?

426
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:50,732
we found out he had a gambling problem

427
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:54,148
he run out in bad bets, so desperate
that he bets against his own house

428
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:55,775
and threw the battle to win the bet

429
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:57,315
he threw a battle to win a bet?

430
00:49:57,315 --> 00:50:00,353
the whole house was devastated
so we had to kick him out

431
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:03,088
he is been trying to take us down ever since

432
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:07,086
the crazy thing is if we dont win the world jam
he can actually do it

433
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:51,927
hey, welcome home

434
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,468
you lied to me

435
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,686
you told me luke kicked you out
because he was jelous

436
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,725
but it wasnt that, was it?

437
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,796
you threw a battle for a bet!?

438
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,521

439
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:06,376

and put it online

440
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:07,296
what you talking about?

441
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:09,174
what kind of BS that you said about me now

442
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:10,639
luke was jelouse

443
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:12,931
he want it to be the leader so he kicked me out

444
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:14,485
he used me and he kicked me out

445
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:21,482
i'm sorry

446
00:51:22,978 --> 00:51:25,338

447
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:27,525

449
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:31,765
okay

450
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:34,989
we have too much in this
we work too hard

451
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,365
despite what mom and dad said
doesnt always have to be about winning

452
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:39,875
you start to sound like him

453
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,271
you need to check your self and remember
whos side you're on

454
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,547
freaking ridiculous

455
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:46,549
you know luke isnt some monster julian

456
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:48,937
he is a good guy
he takes care of the people that he loves

457
00:51:48,937 --> 00:51:49,907
who you gonna believe?

458
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,895
him or your family?

459
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:53,277
you gonna talk to me about family?

460
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,602
when luke is not even related to any of
those dancers

461
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:58,577
he would never lie to them
oh i'm a liar?

462
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:00,434
what about you?

463
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:05,125
how do you think your precious luke is gonna feel
when he finds out that you have been playing him?

464
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,059
actually now that i think of it

465
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:10,018
you should come clean

466
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:12,702
that might be just what i need to throw
a game off for world champ.

467
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:15,724
thanks sis
you really helped me

468
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:20,650
i'm not putting a man on the street over some stupid rivalry

469
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:24,840
i will not be part of it

470
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,584
jacob, you scared me

471
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:44,980
you dont seem like a girl that get easily scared

472
00:52:50,658 --> 00:52:52,273
tell luke i'm sorry

473
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:59,130
you have a choice you know

474
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,651
its not that easy

475
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:07,964
the most important decisions in life were never easy

476
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,810
dance can reveal a lot about a person

477
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:29,538
the way they move, the way they learn new steps

478
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:31,393
i mean if you were dancing for real

479
00:53:31,393 --> 00:53:33,698
it comes from the most truthful parts
of your self

480
00:53:33,698 --> 00:53:36,503
i dance to express how i feel inside

481
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:41,339
whether its anger, happiness, loneliness

482
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:50,072
this is where i feel safe, is where i belong
this where my family is

483
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,133
this place is very special, is our world

484
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:55,622
finally, well i have some place where i can be my self

485
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:59,159
people said that you dont really choose your family
we did

486
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:01,409
if you wanna be one of us
luke will find you

487
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,952
luke
why would she just leave like this?

488
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:51,109
i dont know

489
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:53,896
but for the moment we got bigger
problem than that

490
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:56,839
the bank put the house in the auction

491
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:57,733
what?

492
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,618
they're selling it

493
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:03,231
hey look i'm gonna deal with this alright

494
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:07,933
what the hell walt?
hey luke, how are ya? sit down

495
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:09,095
i dont wanna sit down

496
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:11,371
luke, i understand how hard this might be

497
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,757
if you can just wait a few days
we'll have the money

498
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:15,697
you're 5 month behind on your morgage

499
00:55:15,698 --> 00:55:19,973
unless you can catch up with your payments
i'm afraid there is nothing more i can do for you

500
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:24,400
ware house is in prime property and the bank
is well aware what its gonna go for an auction

501
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,499
i need more times

502
00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:29,189
i see if can get them to suspend the
closure but dont get your hopes up

503
00:55:29,189 --> 00:55:32,337
i can take your ware house today luke

504
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:35,010
i guess that never gonna happen
cause its not for sale

505
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:40,141
look what i just got from natalie

506
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:42,181

635
01:11:59,471 --> 01:12:00,958
one move

636
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,749
can set a whole generation free like elvis

637
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:08,744
one move can make you believe like you're something more

moose sit down before you make a fool of both of us

745
01:32:00,522 --> 01:32:03,384

747
01:32:11,571 --> 01:32:13,310
pirates

748
01:32:16,005 --> 01:32:24,635
oh my god, the house of pirates are 
the winner of the first annual world jam

749
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:32,336
its over, 100,000 $ to the house of pirates

750
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:24,553
you can go if you want to, i will take
care of everything until you get back

751
01:33:24,553 --> 01:33:28,249
you give us a chance to live our dreams

752
01:33:28,249 --> 01:33:33,009
and now its time for you to go and live your dreams

753
01:33:53,244 --> 01:33:54,923
you know some famous guy once said

754
01:33:54,923 --> 01:33:58,578
to travel is better than to arrive

755
01:33:58,578 --> 01:34:01,640
and i was like, what?

756
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
maybe because i used to think that there is only
one path to take to what you gonna be in life

757
01:34:08,136 --> 01:34:12,698
but if you choose that one path it doesnt
mean you have to ban the other ones

758
01:34:12,698 --> 01:34:18,197
i realize that if i see what happen along the way that counts

759
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:27,349
to stumbles, no any falls and pressures

760
01:34:27,349 --> 01:34:32,638
its your journey not to destination

761
01:34:32,378 --> 01:34:40,103
you kind of, i guess, trust that the future will work so fine like it suppose to

762
01:34:44,372 --> 01:34:46,582
but i'm ready to jumb

763
01:34:46,582 --> 01:34:54,843
what you're asking for here is a
double major in engineering and dance
