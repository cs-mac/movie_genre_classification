1
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:48,063
Fairytales are usually
crystal clear.

2
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,425
lt's impossible to love
and not love someone...

3
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,901
...at the same time.
You have to take a stand.

4
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,501
But l know.
l felt that with Nadia.

5
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,902
l felt it every day, it was
much stronger than me.

6
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,068
Maybe our fairytale
was expired.

7
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,099
Nadia landed in a place
we considered our own.

8
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,984
lt wasn't a plain cafeteria.
lt was our home.

9
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,661
Our boss had gathered us
here from newspaper ads...

10
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:44,061
...but he was so much more
than an employer.

11
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,347
-How was it?
-Fine.

12
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,303
-Did it hurt?
-No.

13
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,706
-Here's 30.
-You said 45.

14
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:36,543
-He wasn't satisfied though.
-You promised 45.

15
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,145
Look, he was a low income
customer. Yellow.

16
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,144
lt was hard to push him-
and you had to be tested.

17
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,188
lf you do well in the
future, as l know you will...

18
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,109
...you'll get better johns
and make more money.

19
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,539
Your cut is 50%.

20
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,347
-l don't have where to stay.
-Come again?

21
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,148
Can you give me some extra?
l'll pay you back tomorrow.

22
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,620
l never pay in advance.

23
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,418
lf you want, l can give you
another job for tonight.

24
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,577
l've three on hold. Green.
Stay the night with them...

25
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,221
...then l can get you a
hotel room. Deal?

26
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:26,428
Make up your mind, l also
have Martha to take care of.

27
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,948
l treat you better 'cause
you're new - an investment.

28
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,546
Martha is anything but.

29
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,907
Soon, l'll have to pay
for them to fuck her.

30
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,304
-How much?
-1 00. All night, their place.

31
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,222
l'll take you.
Martha! Prove me wrong!

32
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,227
-How was l?
-Good. No surprises.

33
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,861
l want you to tell me
how good l was!

34
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,746
Sorry, not really up for
a chat right now.

35
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,819
The boss always told me:
Martha, never be pushy!

36
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,260
But l didn't understand.
l really wanted to be good.

37
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,428
And l was sick of Zois
escorting me to the jobs.

38
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,587
l wanted the boss to
take me, just like Nadia.

39
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:26,187
But she was 1 6 and a beauty.
At 1 7, l was feeling old.

40
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,669
l was sure her clients were
getting more pleasure...

41
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,264
...were begging her
to stay more.

42
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:51,465
All of us had followed up
an ad for a part time job.

43
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,462
Greeks only. The boss
insisted on our nationality.

44
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:03,383
And he understood our needs.
He had Zois to protect us...

45
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,227
...and the Whistler to provide
us with any drug we wanted.

46
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,099
Nadia was not like us.

47
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,784
ln the beginning,
she never spoke to anyone.

48
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,982
Unlike us, she just came,
picked up the post-its...

49
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:23,188
with client info and took off.
l don't know where she went.

50
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,149
Even the boss had realized
she was a special breed...

51
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:28,699
...and treated her
differently.

52
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,108
His great passion were
the fucking post-its...

53
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,738
...but he had a soft
spot for Nadia.

54
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,786
Over here, when you complete
1 00 post-its we've a ritual.

55
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,818
Come, l'll take you.

56
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,660
This really annoyed me.

57
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:05,749
But l knew the Whistler
was on his way.

58
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,707
Miltos was more eager
to see him than me.

59
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:12,669
The Whistler had
a strange habit.

60
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,065
He only spoke
through horoscopes.

61
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:18,147
Today is a lucky day
for Capricorn.

62
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:28,818
Dare risky investments, but
beware of your love life.

63
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,739
No way. l go with no one
more than three times!

64
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,185
-But he pays double!
-l don't care!

65
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,939
l can't stand softies!

66
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,538
They get obsessed,
specially the limp ones.

67
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,787
You can't trust them.
Am l right?

68
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,425
Am l right?

69
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:15,781
l've no problem. lf l picked
them, l'd be out of work.

70
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,140
How would l make a living?

71
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:20,539
That's why you do it,
to make a living?

72
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,065
What else?
For a hobby?

73
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:27,223
-Maybe for fun.
-Nice thinking.

74
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:45,741
Argyris was gorgeous.
Super-sought after.

75
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,539
He wasn't smart, but he got
more than any of us.

76
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:52,861
His clients, of course, are
much more sensitive.

77
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,219
He gave you a bonus.
For me.

78
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:19,704
Maybe you like what you do.
You never know. Time'll tell.

79
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:23,778
Time? All l want
is to make a living.

80
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,618
l think you might
be a plain slut.

81
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,582
You sit here all day,
worshipping an asshole...

82
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:33,265
-...who acts like your daddy.
-What about you?

83
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,621
l'm not here to stay.
lt's just a stage.

84
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,622
l couldn't accept my defeat.
l had to find someone too.

85
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,784
And our job's misunderstood.

86
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,339
They either put it in the
news with a violin score...

87
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,428
...or they think it's the
easiest job in the world.

88
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,861
But fucking 3-4 guys a day
really wears you down.

89
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:10,264
You can't date a stranger.
He'll never understand.

90
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,628
So, we started
dating each other.

91
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:17,537
Like a Beverly Hills
TV episode.

92
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:38,426
We felt like accomplices.
We had a common secret.

93
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:44,099
Nadia kept staring at me.
She knew l was jealous.

94
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:47,581
And even though Argyris was
madly in love with her...

95
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,946
...she started taking
a greater interest in me.

96
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,341
''Presentation of new model
high-security door.''

97
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,228
Most of them are from out of
town and out of their ease.

98
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:28,863
Give them small talk...

99
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:32,147
...show interest in their
work, don't force it!

100
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,422
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

101
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:52,024
-Astronaut?
-Knock it off!

102
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,864
-Policeman?
-l'm serious.

103
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,621
-Hairdresser.
-Really?

104
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,383
-l'm not sure.
-That's ok. l'll be famous.

105
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,387
-How?
-Can't tell you.

106
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,025
Follow me.

107
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:53,300
-Why did you do that?
-Solidarity. Let's go peep!

108
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,338
-Why are you doing this?
-l need an ally.

109
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:44,144
The others are chickens.
They don't get it.

110
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:47,421
-What about Argyris?
-Argyris won't make it.

111
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,582
And you need someone
to take care of you.

112
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,342
You're losing it!

113
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,587
-Nadia, l'm older than you.
-So what?

114
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,907
She was soft.
l really liked that.

115
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:24,228
For the first time,
it felt like fluffy clouds.

116
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,024
You get laid to buy cds?
Now that's twisted!

117
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:39,941
-What's this?
-Past glories.

118
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:49,786
Let's play shrink, since
you're so bloody restless!

119
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,582
-Truth or dare?
-Truth.

120
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,619
l want to know...
how you left your home.

121
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,025
Are you sure
you want to know?

122
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,988
Promise you won't
get scared of me.

123
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,304
l couldn't stand my parents.
And they weren't even mean.

124
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,625
Just incredibly boring.

125
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:30,742
My mom especially,
deserved instant death.

126
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:33,580
One day l set
the house on fire...

127
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,541
...opened the door and left.

128
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,900
What do you mean
set the house on fire?

129
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,663
Matches, alcohol,
the works!

130
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,541
-And your parents?
-They were sleeping.

131
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,587
l think they are ok.

132
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,060
They never made the
news, anyway!

133
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:50,902
You're mad!

134
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,102
You promised you
wouldn't be scared!

135
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,501
l then dyed my hair
and looked for a job.

136
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,180
How did you leave?

137
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:05,507
Come on!

138
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:10,303
l didn't exactly leave. l've
lied that l'm in university.

139
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:13,623
-Where?
-Alexandroupoli.

140
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,904
lt's the farthest away
l could think of.

141
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:20,380
-What if they bump into you?
-They won't. They don't care.

142
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,467
l had thought of
burning my house too!

143
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,299
Martha... you truly
disappoint me!

144
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:45,464
Why don't you
fuck me right here?

145
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:49,538
Right before the boss, so
he might finally get it up!

146
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:51,421
No, not here.

147
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,303
Are you daft, or have
all the people who...

148
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,024
...fuck you made you
officially gay?

149
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:59,777
Piss off! l don't enjoy it,
l just get paid.

150
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,259
lf l enjoyed it, like some
others do, then l'd be gay.

151
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,580
-So why don't we fuck?
-Don't want to.

152
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,945
You're gay!

153
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:17,666
l'll super-educate you!

154
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,544
-Would they ever accept us?
-lf you pay, you get in.

155
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:25,184
Simple as that?

156
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,382
We're planning to take off
and study abroad!

157
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,148
Lovely!

158
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:35,025
And then we'll come back,
buy your place and fuck you!

159
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,466
l'll get a plastic dildo,
much bigger than yours!

160
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,864
lt's made of rubber...

161
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:49,183
So, since you have
such high aspirations...

162
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,185
...l'll tell you about mine.

163
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,347
Today, l'm introducing
a new range of appointments.

164
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:57,983
Purple!

165
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:01,386
They're double the reds.
For you and for me!

166
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:04,867
There's a party at a
fancy house tonight.

167
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:07,339
And the chosen ones are...

168
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,901
You, Martha!

169
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,707
And you...

170
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:22,502
Nadia!

171
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,104
Leave it,
l'll get it later!

172
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:31,460
Ten sharp!

173
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:38,901
Take this and
go buy something fancy.

174
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,098
And don't be late.

175
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:55,701
Good morning.
l came for the ad.

176
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,147
Today,
Mercury enters Libra.

177
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:23,461
Be calm and patient,
specially in family matters.

178
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:56,741
Argyris is saving money
to take her abroad.

179
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:00,744
Abroad my ass.
Nobody is going abroad.

180
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:04,027
You're always broke,
you definitely won't!

181
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:07,899
That's ok. You're purple.
You'll take care of us.

182
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,506
What's wrong,
are you feeling ignored?

183
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:21,385
Are you in love?

184
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:24,024
l want us to have a
relationship...

185
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,266
...like real people.

186
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,705
Do we have anything in
common with real people?

187
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,099
-l do.
-l don't.

188
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:39,222
Don't you want to have
a family?

189
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,860
Good luck tonight.

190
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:23,828
Good evening.

191
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,267
Goodbye.

192
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,137
Here's our new baby.

193
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:17,585
Marvel at your new baby.
Adopt me and l'll sing!

194
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:52,981
You want me
to fuck your husband?

195
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:56,142
Will you watch,
or do something?

196
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:39,662
Nadia is jealous.
Nadia loves me.

197
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:49,980
Nadia is right.
l'm a slut.

198
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:54,342
And l like, really like
to get paid and fucked.

199
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,304
Martha tonight
has a new id:

200
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:02,863
Name: Slut, Address: Slut
Religion: Slut.

201
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:10,059
She's in a great mood,
she's gonna make you proud.

202
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,819
Give you
the best party ever!

203
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:20,068
Nadia go fuck yourself!
l'm not going anywhere.

204
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:25,584
lt's not a stage.
This is where l want to be!

205
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:14,903
l'm sorry, l don't know
what got over me.

206
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:18,505
You nuts? You were great!
Blew them away!

207
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,584
We're so much alike,
you and l!

208
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,109
-But l fucked up.
-Don't worry, we'll avenge!

209
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,779
l have a proposition to make.

210
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:49,901
l rented an apartment.
Want to live with me?

211
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,577
We'll pay half rent and
live together, like family!

212
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,821
Want to?

213
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:10,702
Want to?
Please say yes.

214
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:13,942
lt really means much to me!

215
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:19,344
-Yes.
-Yes?

216
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,341
When l'm very happy, l have
a hard time showing it.

217
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,861
My throat dries up and
my ears whistle.

218
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:31,187
l wanted to start jumping up
and down and show my joy...

219
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,659
...but l stayed put,
like an idiot.

220
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:36,025
l don't think
she minded though.

221
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,063
You need to have doubts
in order to mind.

222
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:18,662
We want our money.
For last night.

223
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:23,223
The boss wants
to speak to you.

224
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,824
l heard you
messed up the party.

225
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:30,625
-Where is he?
-At the hotel. Training day.

226
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,746
Training day is laying
the path for others.

227
00:36:44,149 --> 00:36:47,141
We had all gone through it,
except Nadia.

228
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,384
The boss had a room
specially for that...

229
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,707
...and to entertain friends
in special occasions.

230
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:01,105
He often called up on me.

231
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:06,425
One day, 5 guys gang-banged
me in that room.

232
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:18,538
-What's up? Going on a trip?
-l'm moving, maybe...

233
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:21,019
We want our money
for last night.

234
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:24,388
After what happened,
you're asking for money?

235
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,337
-You fucked up big time last night.
-Bullshit!

236
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:29,227
l talked with the client.

237
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,777
l said it's good to talk,
but there's a limit.

238
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:37,346
These people aren't
interested in your problems.

239
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:43,223
Do you have any suggestions?

240
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:46,097
-For free.
-Come again?

241
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,620
We'll work. For free.

242
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:52,026
Hear that Nadia?
Do you have any other ideas?

243
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,182
Now leave.
We'll discuss this later.

244
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:13,787
Calm down. Drop it.
Let's go home.

245
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,980
We need to go on vacation.

246
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:04,778
Charge our batteries
before things get rougher.

247
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:08,739
-Vacation? We just moved in.
-So? Don't you want to?

248
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,425
Rougher?
Will it get rougher?

249
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,144
What do you think?
Are you happy?

250
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,227
-Yes.
-l'm not.

251
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,585
We need to speed things up.

252
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,864
lt's your fault, right?

253
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:39,100
We must go slowly now.
Start from the top.

254
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:43,588
l think you are special,
l want to treat you special.

255
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:47,818
But l need to trust you.

256
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:53,622
When l help you, you
must help me. Am l wrong?

257
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,464
Sorry for not helping much.
Not a good month for me.

258
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,660
That's ok.

259
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:56,747
Nice house. But l
expected it cozier.

260
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,338
What's up Miltos?
How come?

261
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:25,223
Shit, what drugs
are you on?

262
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,586
What's this?

263
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:51,783
A gift from a client.
Who cares for me.

264
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:53,667
Nice client.

265
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:04,348
Give it to me.

266
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:22,301
Why did you move in with her
and not with me?

267
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:24,426
Don't you like me?

268
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:27,946
-l'm just a little tired.
-We can fix that.

269
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:49,421
Bloody hell!
She threw me out!

270
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:11,466
Keep going,
don't let me stop you.

271
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:46,384
Don't let this happen again.

272
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,900
You've worked for one year.

273
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:56,305
You were bound to have
some accident.

274
00:44:56,629 --> 00:45:00,019
-lt's not from work.
-Then what?

275
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:03,343
Maybe it is a client.
l'm not sure.

276
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:05,660
Tell me. What happened?

277
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:10,347
-Argyris. He got crazy.
-How crazy?

278
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,740
Remember when they came with
Miltos, totally fucked up?

279
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,183
Argyris wanted action,
l didn't.

280
00:45:19,669 --> 00:45:22,103
He gave me a line, then
opened my legs...

281
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:24,465
...and plastered me with coke.

282
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:28,542
He wanted to snort it
from down there.

283
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:32,705
-What?
-He really fucked me up.

284
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:41,227
l fucked up. l'm sorry.

285
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:47,659
Come on. Let's play.

286
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:26,583
-Will you teach me?
-Let's go shoot some cats.

287
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:41,026
What's this nightie?
You look like a prostitute!

288
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:46,628
Thanks. l can't believe
you're all fine with him!

289
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:49,220
Give the prick a lesson!

290
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:51,540
Don't worry, l know what
l'm doing.

291
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,820
-Sure, you always know.
-Be patient.

292
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:56,145
We're going on vacation soon.

293
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:43,377
-You fucked up big time.
-Yes, but l said l'm sorry.

294
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:47,865
l don't care.

295
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:54,779
Yes, but what on earth
do you want me to do?

296
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:58,178
-Make me laugh.
-What?

297
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:01,109
-Make me laugh.
-Fuck!

298
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:11,187
Ok, so be it.
Do you believe in Superman?

299
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:15,103
-No.
-You just lost a friend.

300
00:49:19,549 --> 00:49:23,428
You liked that...
Peace?

301
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:33,585
Listen, l don't want you to
worry about a thing.

302
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,979
Everything will be fine.

303
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,144
Three more jobs
and we're off!

304
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:00,067
-Can you work?
-l'm fine.

305
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:05,663
Today l'm breaking my rules.
l'm going with a softy.

306
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:09,625
And it's a double offense.
This will be the fifth time.

307
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:15,266
-How come, are you in love?
-You don't get it, do you?

308
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:20,026
lt's a secret gig. He's an
accountant at a magazine.

309
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:24,348
And he gives me 1 00 a night.
He's obsessed with me!

310
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:27,627
Aren't you scared the boss
might find out?

311
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:43,141
l can't put in words
the way l feel about you.

312
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:58,300
l really want to help. Tell
me, what can l do for you?

313
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:12,304
Our vacation was calm,
in absolute silence.

314
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:18,143
That was the plan, we didn't
let anyone come with us.

315
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,742
Nadia picked a totally
deserted beach.

316
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:28,021
We spoke to no one,
not even each other.

317
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,698
Silence was a gift.

318
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,778
She only broke up one time.

319
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:40,659
Soon l won't be able
to picture myself...

320
00:51:41,029 --> 00:51:43,020
...doing anything beautiful.

321
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:46,028
Nothing that will interest
anybody.

322
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:48,664
And that's not fair, Martha.

323
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,384
We'll grow old,
we'll keep getting screwed...

324
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:57,381
...and no one will know.
Or care. People should care!

325
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,461
l need you to promise that
you'll stand by me...

326
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:20,181
-...no matter what.
-l promise.

327
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:28,148
l'm looking for Nadia.
Can you help me?

328
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:34,784
Her mobile's out of service.
Can you please help me?

329
00:52:43,749 --> 00:52:45,626
Come to think of it...

330
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:48,947
...l wish this silence
had lasted longer.

331
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,943
As soon as we got back,
the boss awaited us...

332
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:59,185
...with brand new post-its.

333
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:02,308
Purple! lris Hotel, room 121 .

334
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:06,428
Nadia, though,
didn't look too impressed.

335
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:14,621
l was eager to see Miltos.
l'd missed him...

336
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:18,465
...especially when l saw
Nadia drooling with Argyris.

337
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:22,825
But she was right once more.
Miltos couldn't take it.

338
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:03,101
l'm not sure if she just
wanted to get back at him...

339
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:06,142
...or had realized that he
was pissed off and had...

340
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:08,340
...set us up with Zois.

341
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:11,177
But Nadia knew what she
was doing. Always.

342
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,180
Do something!

343
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:44,100
Come on!

344
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:53,139
Please!

345
00:55:14,149 --> 00:55:17,539
Go and get changed.
We'll meet you later.

346
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:21,461
And throw away your
clothes.

347
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:07,905
Let's forget it.
Play happy family.

348
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:16,458
You don't have
to say anything.

349
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,739
Don't be afraid,
no one can harm you.

350
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:23,065
Anyway you didn't
do anything wrong.

351
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:26,506
You just watched,
because Argyris forced you.

352
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,859
Did you do anything wrong?

353
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:33,347
No.

354
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:36,588
Neither did l, right?

355
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:40,701
What?

356
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,299
Argyris did it all.

357
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:52,499
No you didn't. He did.

358
00:57:17,549 --> 00:57:20,382
-Truth or dare?
-Truth.

359
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:24,021
But l want to tell you
something by myself.

360
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:32,060
Miltos and l rarely had sex.
Neither of us really cared.

361
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:36,540
One day, he showed up
out of his head...

362
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,138
...and wanted to fuck me
on the kitchen table.

363
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:45,863
-So? Big deal!
-We weren't alone.

364
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:49,303
-Where was l?
-ln your room.

365
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:53,587
Fine, who was
the third party?

366
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:58,261
He told me that he found me
very sexy, that he would...

367
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:00,859
...prefer to be fucking me
and not him.

368
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:03,419
Ok, fine, who was it?

369
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:07,377
Forget it, let's say he was
a stranger.

370
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:11,025
Which means he's not.
Who was it?

371
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:29,304
They were really fucked up.
There was nothing l could do.

372
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:21,227
''You won't believe it...

373
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:23,779
...but l really wanted
to come with you.''

374
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:57,338
l want you to go out.
We need to be alone tonight.

375
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:02,698
-What?
-Please.

376
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:37,618
-l'm flying!
-Where?

377
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:41,063
High above.
l can see God!

378
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:45,663
-What's he doing?
-Laughing at us.

379
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:56,106
Put your hands down, man.
This ain't no TV series!

380
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:06,066
1 -2-3, 1 -2-3. Best is worst.

381
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:09,304
Nadia and l are going
to make a family.

382
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:11,580
God is coming down
and l'll stop thinking...

383
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:14,947
...like Nadia, l've stopped
thinking, 3-4-5, 3-4-5...

384
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:18,267
...l don't want to know,
someone else should know.

385
01:05:18,629 --> 01:05:20,665
Best is worst,
we deserve the best...

386
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:24,424
...we'll be fine, we deserve
the best, we'll be fine.

387
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,557
Nadia surrendered like
the ultimate victim.

388
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,872
They held her for a while
but she had everything.

389
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,312
She was lost, beautiful,
under-aged...

390
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,599
...and had mr. Softy
who really loved her.

391
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,191
ln the beginning,
l didn't understand why...

392
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,279
...she asked me
to give him her old photos.

393
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,677
Then l remembered that he
worked in a magazine.

394
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,157
And the magazine's publisher
was interested in Nadia too.

395
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,032
And he knew well how to
cut and paste.

396
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,957
So, Nadia became
the face of the month.

397
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,474
lf it wasn't for her,
l'd be lost...

398
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,835
...like everyone else.

399
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,676
And she was so pretty...

400
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,076
...that girls wanted
to look like her...

401
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,477
...and boys masturbated
at her pictures.

402
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,071
Sure enough, the Perfect Man
would soon come for her.

403
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,715
Juvenile tragedy

404
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,756
Know them?

405
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,039
Do you have to watch this
every day?

406
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,637
They could do me no harm.
They had no proof.

407
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,270
l told them what Nadia
told me to.

408
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,711
l didn't do it for her,
l did it for me.

409
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,036
l didn't want any trouble.

410
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,675
-Know him?
-Yes, it's Argyris.

411
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,077
Why was Nadia with him
at the murders?

412
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,591
She was his girlfriend.

413
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,157
She just watched.
He forced her.

414
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,760
-Why?
-l don't know.

415
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,238
Turned him on probably.
He wasn't well...

416
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,193
He did drugs, you know.

417
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,470
-And this?
-lt's fake.

418
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,157
l don't know where they found
the old photos.

419
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,830
We've always been victims.

420
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,754
They're taking advantage
of us, even now!

421
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,511
How do you feel
after your acquittal?

422
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,189
-Fine.
-Just fine?

423
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,879
We were victims. Now we
must move on with our lives.

424
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,709
Can l have some water?

425
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,829
You don't really like me,
do you?

426
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,476
You've been getting fucked,
for what, 3 years?

427
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,593
l've been for 13!
You should try and relax!

428
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,910
-l'm getting a job today!
-What?

429
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,357
-On TV!
-What kind of a job?

430
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,752
l'm gonna ask
for a music show.

431
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,715
l already know so much,
and what l don't, l'll learn.

432
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,956
Think the others
are better?

433
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,356
-l don't know.
-l do. They suck.

434
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,830
You promised things
would change.

435
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,760
You're doing the same shit
all over again.

436
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,116
l disagree.

437
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,672
Nadia had sky-rocketed and l
was left guarding the house...

438
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,071
...and reading her letters.

439
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,392
Sometimes, l was convinced
l had turned invisible.

440
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,478
You can select songs
and make dedications.

441
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,269
l need us to have
an open line between us.

442
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,716
l want you to write in,
specially those...

443
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,991
who've suffered like l have.

444
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,316
Together, we can change
something.

445
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,631
The best letters and
e-mails will be read on air...

446
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,279
...only if you want me to.

447
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,637
Nadia carefully observed
the pyramid of her new job.

448
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,432
Above every publisher,
there's a bigger publisher.

449
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,195
Nadia found him, easily.

450
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,030
l didn't want her to
bring them home...

451
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,396
...no matter how important
they were.

452
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,712
l was convinced that we'd be
together. We'd be happy.

453
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,430
But he seemed to know how
to realize her dreams.

454
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,153
-Did you like my TV show?
-Yes.

455
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:18,115
-Just yes? No comments?
-You were fine. As always.

456
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,388
Sounds like
you're sick of me.

457
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,958
lt's hot. Why don't you
take off your shirt?

458
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,477
-What?
-l want to see your breasts.

459
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,634
-You're mad.
-Maybe. Do it!

460
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,433
-You're gonna get us killed!
-l don't care. Do it.

461
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,794
See? lt was that simple.
Was it worth dying for?

462
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,077
-Why don't you come in?
-Don't want to.

463
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,437
-She may be back in a while.
-Don't want to.

464
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:26,229
Just tell her l came by.

465
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,989
She didn't betray you.

466
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,838
She's different from us.
Don't try to understand.

467
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,356
Nice, isn't it?

468
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,754
Do you still like me?

469
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,596
Of course.

470
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,000
So why do you cheat on me?

471
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,395
Think it's the right time
to make a scene?

472
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,920
Everyone thinks
we're a couple.

473
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,431
We live in the same house,
we share almost everything.

474
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,878
What do you think?
Screw everyone else.

475
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,715
-No.
-No what?

476
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,515
l don't think
we're a couple.

477
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,434
Exactly. We're much
more than a couple.

478
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,870
Others can never understand.

479
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,557
Please get a job, leave the
house, you're going crazy.

480
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,510
l don't want no job.
l know no job.

481
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,836
Whatever.
Will you leave us now?

482
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,637
l helped you.
Didn't l?

483
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,028
Can you please
pass the butter?

484
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,558
Thank you.

485
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,470
Babe, are we
going on vacation?

486
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,837
Yes babe, but not tomorrow,
l have work. ln a few days.

487
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,111
-Where are you going?
-Rome.

488
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,118
-Rome?
-Can we come too?

489
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,556
No, l thought you could
keep the children.

490
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,473
Can you keep the children?

491
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,876
-Let's all go together!
-Why can't we come?

492
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,151
Sorry guys,
l'm going with my babe.

493
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,390
Come on. lt will be great!

494
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,758
Fine, can we go
somewhere too?

495
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,392
Don't you want
to have a family?

496
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,474
No. l have you.

497
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,308
-A child?
-No.

498
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,270
-Never?
-No.

499
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,272
lf you did, who would you
have it with?

500
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,315
-Nobody, l guess.
-With Argyris?

501
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,678
With no one. What's wrong
with you? Getting old?

502
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,038
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

503
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,112
l'm dead. Christmas show's
in a week.

504
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:16,637
Will you come?
lt'll be nothing special.

505
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,472
Nothing special?
lt's your dream, no?

506
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,351
Yes.

507
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,160
Do you love me?

508
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,719
Are you happy?

509
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,355
So came Christmas.
Season of Love.

510
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,238
But l didn't know how
much love l had left.

511
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,632
And Nadia was getting more
and more distant.

512
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,429
Maybe l was to blame too.

513
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,879
l need to go
to the bathroom.

514
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,670
The New Year is ambiguous
for Water Signs.

515
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,990
Friends will hurt you,
professional doors close...

516
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,837
...but you'll find a new,
much clearer balance.

517
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,630
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

518
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,635
Didn't you like it?
l thought they liked me.

519
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,192
l just don't think they'll
call me again.

520
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,551
Let's go live in a farm.

521
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,150
Or on an island,
open a salon.

522
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,988
That's what you want,
isn't it?

523
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,236
l need an ally.

524
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,438
The others are chickens.
They don't get it.

525
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,316
Martha won't make it.
And you need someone...

526
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,717
...to take care of you.
You're losing it!

527
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,352
But l need you to promise
you'll stand by me.

528
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,596
No matter what.

529
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,870
Nadia asked me to call you.
She'll be home soon. Come in.

530
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,432
l think we need
to go find her.

531
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,751
ls it possible
to love someone...

532
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,389
...and not love them
at the same time?

533
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:51,191
People think it isn't,
but l know better.

534
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:59,193
-Where are we going?
-To the sea.
