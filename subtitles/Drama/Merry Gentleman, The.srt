1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,910
What about this weather today?

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,380
You're telling me.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,530
The weather is great.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,820
This weather!

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,260
Shall we get something to eat or not?

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,750
Hey, in Betty, no matter what, you can't eat.
But it's Yoon Pal's car.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,290
♫ On a dark desert highway, ♫

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,890
♫ Cool wind in my hair...♫

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,000
What the hell?

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,880
Have we just had an accident?

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,250
It was one episode in a boring life.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,790
The car is a Joondaehyung sedan.
The driver is a male in his early 20's.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,550
For sure, the car belongs to his dad.
When we get out, what will we say?

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,340
All together, "my neck!"

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,530
Get out!

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,960
Ouch.  Oooh.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Aigoo, it's my bones.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,990
My Number #3  vertebra!

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,600
My spine.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,810
Oh, my knee!

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,340
Do you know who we are?

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,020
We collectively have the most valuable bodies
in the Republic of Korea.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,510
Jeez, how, under Korean law,
is someone your age driving?

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,790
One moment, make a telephone call.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,040
Hello, it's Attorney Choi Yoon.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,800
Supreme Court Justice, Sir, I'm a bit concerned right now about a car accident.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,500
This is the police, right?
If he's there, could I talk to the chief?

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,390
He knows Im Tae San.

29
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,530
Oh, honey.  It's me.  I've had an accident.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,610
Right now we are taking turns making phone calls.

31
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,380
Hello, is this National Forensic Service?

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,520
Could I speak with Yoon Ji Hyung?

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,090
Yes, Supreme Court Justice.

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,430
I'm not terribly injured.

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,220
The current condition of the back of my neck is unknown,

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,890
but then in a car accident,
one never knows immediately.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes. Has Doctor Yoon Ji Hyun passed away?

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,400
What's this?  Look at this.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,410
Yes, Is this the insurance company?

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,790
I just had an accident.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,740
It happened because I rear-ended a car.

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,370
Yes , it was my fault.

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,050
Yes, I will wait.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,810
I'm really sorry.
Someone will come in ten minutes.

45
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,080
Are you badly injured?

46
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,460
--It's fine. The weather is really nice.
--It's warm.

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,590
The police chief?

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,990
Why hasn't the police chief shown his face immediately?

49
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,240
Speak for yourself.  Right there, he was looking for his wife.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,960
The highest authority for me is my wife.

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,730
What?  National Forensic Service??

52
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,900
Well, trying to make the genre a bit different
went that far.

53
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,310
Why's the time creeping?

54
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,050
<i>Calling the insurance company after you have an accident was not something we didn't know.</i>

55
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,230
<i>However, when we were in our 20's, we scorned the way the older generation treated people in their 20's.</i>

56
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,940
<i>If you applied common sense,
it was the hard way to go, and</i>

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,670
<i>if a bluff felt like it was of substance,</i>

58
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,020
<i>unfortunately for you</i>

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,310
<i>you, who despised the older generation like that, didn't know  you would eventually become "misters"</i>

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,660
<i>or old men.</i>

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,710
<i>A Gentleman`s Dignity</i>

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,390
<i>Episode 18</i>

63
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,110
Why was your phone turned off?

64
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,950
Meari is leaving now.  She's at the airport.

65
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,910
Just now, even for me, her cell phone has been deactivated.

66
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,730
Are you going to let her go like that?

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,120
Hey, Meahri's leaving.  She's going.
Today, she's going.

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,790
It seems you already heard that?

69
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,330
You may still be able to see her.
If you really step on it.

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,360
It's not yet the ticketed time.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,460
She's not that driven.

72
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,270
There's duty free shopping or she might miss the plane.

73
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,980
She might get arrested for firearms or drugs in her bags or something.

74
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,700
Some guy might be carrying the same bag

75
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,880
Some guy might be carrying the same bag.
After switching bags, their eyes meet.

76
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,640
She's waiting for you now.

77
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,580
Can you leave?
I have a trial tomorrow.

78
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,350
Dumbass.

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,550
The trial is tomorrow, but

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,040
Meahri is leaving right now.

81
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,750
If my brother finds out...

82
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:49,190
<i>♫ Even more freely on my own, ♫</i>

83
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,600
<i>♫ I am fine caring more for you like this. ♫</i>

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,320
<i>♫ You more than I ♫</i>

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,270
<i>♫ loving me...♫</i>

86
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,310
I love you, Im Meahri.

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,430
I'm sorry because you suffered alone.

88
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,840
For admitting it so late, I am sorry.

89
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,090
You aren't going anywhere now.
I am not letting you go anywhere.

90
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,880
Oppa.

91
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,580
Now that I'm holding you, what I said doesn't
just mean not going to the U.S.

92
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,610
It means you are coming to me.
And it means my heart is not hiding.

93
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,890
It means, from now on, I am the Oppa you follow.

94
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,450
Because I will take care of everything.

95
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,810
Although it's going to be difficult,

96
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,720
--it's definitely not going to be easy-- but

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,210
I will never let go of your hand.

98
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,810
I will never let you cry alone again.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,380
Where are you?
I'm here in the cafe parking lot.

100
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,660
Okay.  I'll wait.

101
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,470
He should wash his car...

102
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,680
Oh, you came.

103
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Have you had dinner?
I haven't eaten.

104
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,660
I caught her.

105
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,260
I'll come in for a while.

106
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,450
Let's sit and talk

107
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,340
You...

108
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,490
How could you...

109
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,930
Choi Yoon Pal...How could you?

110
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm sorry

111
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,220
If I let her go now, I thought I'd lose her forever

112
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,380
Then you should have just let her go

113
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,970
I . . .

114
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,730
What am I supposed to do?

115
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,430
If you say you're sorry to me.

116
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,250
what am I supposed to do?

117
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,630
Im Meahri, aren't you going to stop?

118
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,340
Say it to me.

119
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,030
Whatever you're going to say, say it to me.

120
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
I'll take the blame.

121
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Choi Yoon Pal.

122
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,720
I've thought about it more than a thousand times.

123
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,420
It was a thousand times worse.  So I  suppressed it.

124
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,120
I suppressed it to death.

125
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,880
The moment that I heard that Meahri was leaving,

126
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,940
I thought the world was ending.

127
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,500
Because at that moment,  I was full of regret.

128
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,020
I was avoiding, not thinking, and pretending it wasn't

129
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,050
what my heart was hoping for earlier.

130
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,070
I'm sorry

131
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,770
because I've made Meahri cry so many times.

132
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,100
I'll do well.

133
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,770
I'll take care of her forever.

134
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,160
Tae San...This is my first and last request of you.

135
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,770
Just this once, forgive me.

136
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,330
So, are you ready...

137
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,090
to lose me?

138
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,130
Im Meahri...

139
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,190
In the end,

140
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,180
this is what you have to do to be happy?

141
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,950
Oppa!

142
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,520
Just forgive me this once.

143
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,980
I've forgiven you too many times.

144
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:54,100
Now, I regret it. I didn't know
how you two would end up like this.

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,070
I said I'd watch over you.

146
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,320
I  alone will be crazed as a raving lunatic.

147
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,550
Oppa!

148
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,430
From now on, I...

149
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,740
have lost both of you.

150
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,840
Im Meahri...Leave this house.

151
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,020
This isn't your home anymore

152
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,830
and I'm not your brother.

153
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,280
That rude little girl.

154
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,770
She always fought back against what you said, but this time she's leaving because her brother told her to?

155
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,000
If she was going to listen so well,

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,150
why didn't she listen to me?

157
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,230
She's quite smart on that side.

158
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,690
Do you think those two people met?

159
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,040
Did he even go to find her?

160
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,010
I give one point to he went, and two to they met.

161
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,650
Why?

162
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,580
Because I'm a guy that lost someone and found her again.

163
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,170
I know the feeling of having lost your everything.

164
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,670
If you fall in love, you can't even put on hand cream by yourself. You can't.

165
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,510
What time is it?
Why isn't he calling?

166
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,630
Didn't you do that when you were dating your wife?

167
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,730
You want to do everything for them, and when they said they'd do it by themselves, you wouldn't believe them.

168
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,770
It bothers me so much this woman eats alone.

169
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,700
I mean, if I don't feed her, how does she eat?

170
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,190
Oh sorry, my stomach...

171
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,410
Ah, seriously!

172
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,050
At this rate, you're going to be kissing the window.

173
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,720
A perfectly normal person kissing through the window!

174
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,330
How did you know that?

175
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,350
Huh?

176
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,320
Oh! It's Attorney Choi.

177
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,990
Hello?

178
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,520
Right now?

179
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,490
It would've been a hard choice to make for you...

180
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,880
This is embarrassing, the state that I'm in...

181
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,630
No, out of everything I've seen of you,

182
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,660
you seem the coolest right now.

183
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,100
A person that made a hard choice to a friend...

184
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,270
Shouldn't look cool

185
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,570
If I were to give you advice as someone who has gone through this hardship,

186
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,030
that weight was too hard for me to carry so that I couldn't even move a step.

187
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,450
But at one point, I overcame it.

188
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,340
Thinking, "oh this weight, is the weight of my heart...

189
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,460
As much as you loved and as much as you were happy,

190
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,690
it was that much heavier."

191
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,910
I was really... in love.

192
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,050
It'd be nice if Tae San made
the same conclusion as you did.

193
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,120
He will.
Don't worry about it too much.

194
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,450
And, what I wanted to say

195
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,520
although it's a bit late, I'd like to say thank you.

196
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
For....

197
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,910
I found out. At the cafe, you four came to help me.

198
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,970
You're the oppa that helped
me with the stuff with the law.

199
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,430
Ahh

200
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:41,250
But I was thinking, the other
people could contact you too...

201
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,910
If they do, then please let me know.

202
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,340
I don't want the four of you to worry about it.

203
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,230
If they call, I'll tell you.

204
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,010
Since you're taking care of Meahri,
I would have to do at least that much.

205
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,430
Then I'd be so grateful.

206
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,340
But...How'd you know we went to the cafe?

207
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,450
Because you guys didn't pay or anything,
then left after breaking things there.

208
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,340
Ohhh

209
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,140
Your helping is helping.  But since money is money,
I'm planning to get it from you all evenly.

210
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,400
If Tae San doesn't approve of Meahri,

211
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,910
then should I charge a lot more to Tae San?

212
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,230
What?

213
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
What?

214
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,210
Yoon stopped you?

215
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,790
Does your brother know?

216
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,710
I met him with Yoon Oppa...

217
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,030
But my brother told me to leave, so I did.

218
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,820
He said he doesn't have a sister like me anymore.

219
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,720
So you just left because he told you to?

220
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,700
What was I supposed to do? He was totally pissed.

221
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,990
Even if he was, how could you leave him alone like that?

222
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,800
You can stay here alone, right? Lock the door.

223
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,060
Thank you.

224
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,720
There's nothing to be thankful for. You take care of your man, I'll take care of mine.

225
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,460
I'm going to tell Tae San you're here.

226
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,530
He's probably going to be worried.

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,120
I've come.

228
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,030
Where are you?

229
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,070
You didn't even turn on the lights.

230
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,510
Are you okay?

231
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,600
Meahri...is at my house.

232
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,680
It's okay.

233
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,770
It's going to be okay.

234
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,020
That little brat, to her brother....

235
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,080
Im Meahri...I'm totally going to yell at her.

236
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,380
How dare she make my man cry?

237
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,950
Does she want to die?

238
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,230
Honey! I came back home~

239
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,740
I haven't been able to contact you the whole day today!

240
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,210
You told me you were in the parking
lot and you didn't even come in!

241
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,930
Hey, did you know?

242
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,630
Yoon and Meahri, they

243
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,710
(You) went to the motel?

244
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,610
Motel?!

245
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,170
Huh...

246
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,200
They even went to a motel?!

247
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,640
When?

248
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,030
You think I'm in the mood to joke around?

249
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,300
(You) went to the motel. Lee Jeong Rok did.

250
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,020
Me? Myself?

251
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,490
Oh you, why would I?

252
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,010
Ah, I did go!

253
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,180
Tae San suddenly left for a business trip,
so I went to bring him his clothes.

254
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,060
Now your facial expression doesn't even change. <i>And</i> now you have an alibi.

255
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,760
Figures. It's about time your acting improved.

256
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,100
You're getting at an innocent person again... You did this at the party too! Ask Tae San!

257
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,480
Did you guys agree on saying something too?

258
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,700
But if you come out so confident,
then it gets me even more angry!

259
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,220
What do you mean agree on saying something?!

260
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,050
I'm going to go crazy.

261
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,870
I understand.  This isn't the first time I've done this kind of things.

262
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,780
But I swear, this really isn't it.

263
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,280
Oh Meahri! Ask Meahri, because she's the one that asked me to do that.

264
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,460
So now you're trying to buy some time?

265
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,040
How am I supposed to call a girl going on a plane to America!

266
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,840
Meahri didn't go to America!

267
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,900
Yoon, stopped her.

268
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,390
Anyway, call her right now!

269
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,720
You think I won't do it?

270
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,400
You're really going to do it?

271
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,580
Don't embarrass yourself in front of Meahri.

272
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,230
Let go. I said I don't care

273
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,050
Yeah, It's Min Sook unni.

274
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,620
I want to ask you something.

275
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,600
Your manager said he went to Choon Chun, because you asked him a favor. Is it true?

276
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,970
Yeah. I got into a fight with my brother, so I asked Rok oppa for a favor.

277
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,850
Why? Did Rok oppa still not come home?

278
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,590
It's nothing.

279
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,290
I understand.

280
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,200
What'd she say?

281
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
She said I'm right, right?

282
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,330
Why are you like this?

283
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,040
She said it's not true?

284
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,600
Why that little, there's some things not to joke about!

285
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
She said you're right.

286
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,120
She said that...

287
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,230
She did ask that of you.

288
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,590
Then, why are you crying?

289
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,910
Because you're embarrassed?

290
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,770
I don't think I can do this.

291
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,010
I really can't do this.

292
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,940
Let's get divorced.

293
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,090
Again?

294
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,780
You always say that. Aigoo.

295
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,890
If you're embarrassed, just say you are.
Why mention divorce?

296
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,560
If you say that again, you're in trouble!

297
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm going to wash up.

298
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:35,650
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Gentlemen's Club @ viki.com</i>

299
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,830
What about school? Is it okay? Is it fun?

300
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,130
The amusement park is more fun than school.

301
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,230
Did you make a lot of friends?

302
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,680
One, who looks like a lot of friends.

303
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,580
You made a friend?

304
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,560
What's his name?

305
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,990
Kim Dong Hyub.

306
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,470
Manly, tough...

307
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,050
That kind of person is in mind.

308
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,870
But he's bad at studying.

309
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,630
Did you think about making other friends?

310
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,710
Did Jung Rok do well in school?

311
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,030
What time is good for you?

312
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,950
Of course, minus lunch and break time.

313
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,810
1 minute before lunch time.
1 minute before break time.

314
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,760
I like those times.

315
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,750
By any chance... Does 1 minute
before meeting your real dad...

316
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,660
Count?

317
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,470
I'm tired. I want to sleep.

318
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,070
You left your girl with my girl.

319
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah.

320
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,290
She got kicked out by Tae San.

321
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,960
Really?

322
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,240
Looking at your face, at least you didn't get hit by him.

323
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,610
At least for now.

324
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,320
Do you remember?

325
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,210
When Meahri was in elementary school, a boy in her class hurt her forehead.

326
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,240
And Tae San was in a rage.

327
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,060
He went to that boy's house and said, "Do you know who my Meahri is?"

328
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,760
She's going to be Miss Korea, what're you going to do about this?

329
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,990
I remember,

330
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,380
I was with him.

331
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:07,000
Of course, we didn't know at that time that she couldn't try out for Miss Korea due to her height, not that wound.

332
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,260
But why that?

333
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,770
He went crazy over a scratch on her forehead.

334
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,830
But I'm the one that wounded her life.

335
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,800
And in Tae San's view, this is a betrayal.

336
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,840
Will he ever forgive me?

337
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,000
Why is every man's love like a war?

338
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,640
How can I help you?

339
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,090
I'm okay, so you just take Tae San's side.

340
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:52,280
I should suffer.  Meahri is everything to Tae San.

341
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,910
Today was a long day for you.

342
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,980
Rest.

343
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,950
<i>♫ My heart aches ♫</i>

344
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,540
<i>♫ Only looking at you ♫</i>

345
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,810
<i>♫ Not having you with me ♫</i>

346
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,090
<i> ♫ I became used to it like a habit ♫</i>

347
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,510
<i> ♫ So I don't even know that it hurts ♫</i>

348
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,100
<i> ♫ Though tears form ♫</i>

349
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,740
<i> ♫ I can't say anything ♫</i>

350
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,080
<i> ♫ And I need to smile ♫</i>

351
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,330
<i> ♫ But like a habit ♫</i>

352
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,570
<i> ♫ In front of you I love you like a fool. ♫</i>

353
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,750
<i> ♫ So tears come ♫</i>

354
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,640
Tell Team Leader Choi to get ready
for the presentation rehearsal.

355
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,060
Be ready in 10 minutes.

356
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,130
Yes!

357
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:09,670
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Gentleman's Club Team @Viki.com</i>

358
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,760
Sorry for being late.

359
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,110
You couldn't sleep a wink.

360
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,430
Are you okay?

361
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,800
Didn't you say

362
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,110
if you act like you're okay, you will eventually be okay.

363
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,240
How do I look?

364
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,980
Do I look okay?

365
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,920
Nope.

366
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,390
Really...?

367
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,080
Did Yoon come to work?

368
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,300
Did Tae San come to work?

369
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,160
Is what Yoon just texted me.
Do you want to respond to him?

370
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,710
Aishh.

371
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,850
Oh!

372
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,410
If you come out like that, it's going to be hard.

373
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,640
For Meahri's problem, I'm on your side.

374
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,400
Why?

375
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,990
Yoon told me to be on your side.

376
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,340
He said he's fine.

377
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,430
Pisses you off, right?

378
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,450
You, really...

379
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,700
Wow, you can't trust me.

380
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,370
You want me to kick Yoon out of the house?

381
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,280
You want me to tell my girlfriend to kick Meahri out??

382
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,340
Alright.

383
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,860
I guess I'll have to do that.

384
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,430
These kids, would they understand
after they start hanging out in the streets--?!

385
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,130
Why?

386
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,660
Why don't you just live with both of
them and set up a house for them?

387
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,270
I'm going to the presentation rehearsal.

388
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,190
Forget it.

389
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,160
I'll go.

390
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,930
Then you do that.

391
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,770
The houses of 44 families full of individual personalities

392
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,400
will share the same big front yards
in this Dong Tan Loft  Village.

393
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,510
Reflecting each owner's life style,

394
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,390
A house of light, a house of a pin wheel,
a house which will be the background for life,

395
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,930
a house with bigger space, and so on.
Each will have a theme and...

396
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:09,810
The revival of front yard and the loft will become
the family's revival as well as the neighbor's revival..

397
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,980
Should I start over?

398
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,150
Huh?

399
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,160
Don't worry about him.
Huh?

400
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,220
Don't worry about him.

401
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,460
He's suffering from a family issue.

402
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,900
I heard what he said.

403
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,100
A house with a love affair (sounds a bit similar to "pin wheel),  a house with really big space..

404
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,620
It's good.

405
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,850
Go ahead.

406
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,430
Why are you laughing?

407
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,180
It's been quiet for a while, right?

408
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,770
Are you performing an exorcism of the statement of accounts for the first half of the year?

409
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,510
Generally it's good.   It's just that it doesn't have a lot of humor.

410
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,130
No humor.

411
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,230
What's humor?

412
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,730
It's a way to gently deliver
the result of deep observation!

413
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,950
Right!!

414
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,070
A house with a love affair,
a house with really big space..such things!

415
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,000
This stuff isn't humor, but...

416
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,510
It's Mom.  Mom!

417
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,850
Let's add one more thing.

418
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,930
The functional aspects like A/C, heating system
or security system,

419
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,970
the common prejudice that people, who have lived in apartments for a long time, often have.

420
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,110
For your reference, the A/C and heating of this project would use the cooling system.

421
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,690
That's all.

422
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,560
Yes!

423
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,110
This person~

424
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,430
It doesn't seem like it, but he does his job very well~

425
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,500
First let's go eat, I'll buy it.

426
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,760
You go eat.
I have to see someone.

427
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,520
With whom?

428
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,900
You...

429
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,190
Yeah. I took off the ring.

430
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,370
Let me say it so you can understand it. Let's say you brought a 24 year old girl and said it was your girlfriend.

431
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,510
Then I, probably would've said this,

432
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,960
"Hey you cradle robber!"

433
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,430
But that 24 year old is my younger sister.

434
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,190
How do I understand this?

435
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:51,170
Jung Ah... is your deeplyy hurting wound
for me to discuss with you as your friend,

436
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,450
But as her brother, it's your past
which is hard for me to accept.

437
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,710
Put youself in my shoes.

438
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,050
If you were me, would you accept it?

439
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,850
I understand your reaction.
It's an obvious reaction.

440
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,800
If you understand,

441
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,840
then why would you make a situation like this
and let me say that? Why?

442
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,560
I can't give up.

443
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,270
I know it's stupid and that I'm a bad guy.

444
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,310
I also know you must feel
like you are suddenly robbed.

445
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,410
Does a guy that knows that do this? A guy that knows?!

446
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,590
Even though I didn't trust Meahri, I at least trusted you!

447
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,660
I'm sorry.

448
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,770
But I . . .

449
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:44,250
I hate that Meahri's crying over a guy like me.

450
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,520
So, now, I'm going to try to not let Meahri cry.

451
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,360
What about her dreams, her future?

452
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,190
The fact that Meahri wants to design and make bags,

453
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,070
Actually I don't like it.

454
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:10,240
But, it's her dream.

455
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,490
I want her to learn more, and master more

456
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,780
and achieve her dream.

457
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:22,710
I don't want Meahri to toss away her dreams either.

458
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:28,660
Tae San...Meahri....is also my dream.

459
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:37,420
Whether she's a designer, or anything else,

460
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,030
I'm going to try my best

461
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,760
to care for my dream.

462
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,810
I'm going to look at some houses.
Do you want to come with me?

463
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,280
I heard Do Jin oppa was going.

464
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,410
Go with him in a lovey-dovey mood.

465
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,480
Although I have more problems than you now,

466
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,640
I'm Meahri who cheers for your love, Teacher.

467
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,130
You think you'll be okay?

468
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,640
Se Ra will give you a real hard time.

469
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,000
It's really unexpected.

470
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,300
I didn't know she loved my brother that much.

471
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,290
In Se Ra's life, there are only two groups,
enemy and ally.

472
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,460
You're now in big trouble.
I'll be back later.

473
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,190
See you later.

474
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,900
<i>Please come in.</i>

475
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,900
This place was used by a single woman,
so it's cleanly maintained well.

476
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,130
Will you two live here?

477
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,700
It would look good in your opinion, right?

478
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,850
Two women will live here.
With my friend.

479
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,390
Se Ra and I have decided to live together.
This time, I'm the owner.

480
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,970
So, do you like that?

481
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,580
That's unhappy news to me.

482
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,610
The price for rental is very good,
so there are many people coming here to look at it.

483
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,040
So, if you like this place, you'd better sign
the contract before other people take it.

484
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,830
Then, look around more.

485
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,790
Thank you.

486
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,350
We must look like newlyweds.

487
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,390
How could you dream such an ambitious dream
in the daytime?

488
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,730
Well, we might look like a couple
whose marriage is the second one.

489
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,400
Are you embarrassing me
because I have a son?

490
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,410
I meant that we're both already passed
the usual age of marriage.
Are you embarrassing me
because I have a son?

491
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,900
I meant that we're both already passed
the usual age of marriage.

492
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,340
You must have an inferiority complex.

493
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,540
I should have that kind of humble charm a bit.

494
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,240
If I'm too bling-bling,
I would look like a hero of a TV drama.

495
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,810
Choose this one.   As an expert, I think this is
the best among all the places we've seen so far.

496
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,700
Which parts do you like as an expert?

497
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,450
The part that this place is the closest one
to my place?

498
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,700
How did you suppress your
desire to do this all that time?

499
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,010
Since I barely suppressed it,
I will do this whenever I have a chance!

500
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,530
The condition of wall paper is still okay, so....

501
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,740
if we change just one side wall
with some color paint as a point color...

502
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,480
It will be done soon.

503
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,860
Then it will make the space look lively, not dull.

504
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,150
You will do the painting, won't you,
Kim Do Jin ssi?

505
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,060
Do you have to use this high-quality
human resource in that......?

506
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,380
Oh, oh, it's a bug!!

507
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,160
Yi Soo Oppa, you're number one!

508
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,080
What did you say?

509
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,350
Didn't you know that?

510
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,890
Usually, if someone catches a bug for others,
that person becomes Oppa.

511
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,710
I will sign the contract.

512
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,700
Within this week, can we come back for disinfection and painting which will give a lively look to a dull place?

513
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:54,640
Within this week, can we come back for disinfection and painting which will give a lively look to a dull place?

514
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,900
Of course.

528
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,310
It's not an easy task...

529
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,280
You couldn't have done this without me.

530
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,950
If you weren't here,
I could've done it much earlier.

531
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,670
Why did you give me a piggyback ride
while the ladder is sitting there?

532
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,720
I didn't think you would really climb on my back,
even though I told you to do so.

533
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,730
I helped you by betting my life as a man.

534
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,600
My back could have been broken.

535
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,580
It would have been very unfortunate
for Seo Yi Soo  eventually.

536
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,650
Aish, seriously...

537
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,950
That's sexual harrassment.

538
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,250
You know it's a sexual harrassment
if the victim feels uncomfortable about it?

539
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,280
Is that now a uncomfortable look on your face?

540
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,130
It's the face that wants more.

541
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,780
Aish, seriously, you're so good at talking.

542
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,740
I said I'll do it directly.

543
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,770
Do you think I'm the type to hold myself back?

544
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,270
She brings in dangerous things, this woman.

545
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,390
Lay down again.

546
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm letting you win.

547
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,380
How's Tae San?

548
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,370
Meahri is... doing alright...

549
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,980
He's not letting me know what he feels.

550
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,380
Since he doesn't show emotion about what he feels about Meahri.

551
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,660
I think she's really... brave, Meahri.

552
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,540
Seo Yi Soo is the same way.

553
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,780
I guess so.

554
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,620
I'll build a cool house for you later.

555
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:31,250
Big, with lots of room, and sunshine coming through. And where the wind flows nicely.

556
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,980
A house where no one leaves.

557
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,430
Where in Canada are your parents?

558
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,510
Toronto.

559
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,290
It's a place that feels cool when you
go in the shade in the summer time.

560
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,470
How long did you guys live together?

561
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,520
As soon as I went to college, they left like the wind.

562
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,030
Actually, I wanted to study another year before college.

563
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,310
My mom said that with my skills that was enough and that they had to go to Canada.

564
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,530
And she told me to just register for class.

565
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,150
My personality is like my mom's.

566
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,580
A harmonious family.

567
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,470
Although we weren't rich, I grew up in decent comfort.

568
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:17,390
Because their relationship was excellent,
I was always the disrupter.

569
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,560
At that time I was sad, but I knew later.

570
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,110
That's what happiness is.

571
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:30,230
It seems as though your confidence and composure flows from that.

572
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:35,790
I'm also confident and composed, but you're different from me.

573
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,620
Because I am working hard to make real what you were born with.

574
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,300
People can recognize at a glance a person who is naturally like that.

575
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,500
Because it makes someone a little more frustrated.

576
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:58,580
I didn't have a really happy childhood.

577
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,640
My family was nothing to be proud of.

578
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,990
Look at me.

579
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Do you know this?

580
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,410
Seo Yi Soo's happiness at the sweet age of 36 has been driving me since the third quarter.

581
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,210
Let's start now from this moment.

582
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,110
You will be happy.

583
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:27,210
Will it satisfy you if I say again
I will keep a promise I made before?

584
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,180
Tomorrow you will be happier than today,
the day after tomorrow

585
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,760
you will be happier than tomorrow.

586
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,420
I promise you.

587
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,940
I am going to believe it again.

588
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,000
This time, I'm going to keep it until I die.

589
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,270
Is this call taxi service?

590
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,790
I'll call you back.

591
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,890
Were you going to take a taxi carrying that?

592
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,290
Sometimes I use Yi Soo's car. I was going to do that.

593
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,000
The car is also equipped with a spare tire.

594
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,050
It's also full of high quality gasoline.

595
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,890
Thanks.

596
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,060
Here.

597
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,650
I'll have the rest of the money the day after tomorrow because of  moving-in day.

598
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,050
You drive.

599
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,190
Take me back.

600
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,610
When did you say you're moving?

601
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,060
You don't have to worry since I called a packing company.

602
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,300
How can a stranger's work be the same thing as the  work of a family member?

603
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,350
On that day, a man should help out.

604
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,860
This isn't like moving out of a rented room when you're in college.

605
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,520
Meahri will be there, and you probably
don't want to see her.

606
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,590
Where is Meahri sleeping now?

607
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,590
Sometimes she sleeps in the living room on the couch while watching the TV,

608
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,700
and sometimes she sleeps on the floor of Yi Soo's room.

609
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,570
You don't cook often.

610
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:04,760
You worry about the unncessary things!
The take-out booklet has over thirty choices,
from Korean to Mexican.

611
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,140
Did you talk to Yoon yet?

612
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,820
I only say what I have to say,
and he only says what he has to say.

613
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,140
If we just look at Meahri's life,
this might be her happiest moment.

614
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,170
I met the man of my life when I was 36,
and she met hers when she was 24.

615
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:35,250
She'll be happy twelve more years than me.

616
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:43,070
Don't take sides. I would still be disappointed even if she were 34. But she is just 24 years old..

617
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:49,090
Do you know how mean I am to her?
Should I go see Yoon and be a complete jerk to him?

618
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,680
What should I do?
Tell me anything.

619
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,470
I graduated from sports university.
Everyone's dead meat.

620
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,750
Do Jin will come, and I will send Jung Rok.
Have a good moving day.

621
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,030
Don't worry.

622
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,510
We're here.

623
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,240
You came?

624
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,610
You, come here.

625
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:27,730
You were going to run off to America without saying good-bye?

626
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,030
In the end, I didn't leave.

627
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,590
Teacher, Do Jin oppa is here.

628
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,810
Why did you change your clothes? Isn't the dress uncomfortable?

629
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,200
No, not at all. I just spilled something on my clothes.

630
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,730
Teacher, this is awesome.  If this weren't moving day, at this rate, you would be wearing a bikini right now.

631
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,780
What's this? Who are you to join in the conversation?

632
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,500
This is because Kim Do Jin is here, right?
Because of somebody, Tae San can't even come here.

633
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,820
I'll go organize the clothes.

634
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,550
No, it's not.

635
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,480
This is my normal attire.

636
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,110
Why didn't you just wear clothes you wear when you head outside?

637
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,600
How's the unpacking going?

638
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,850
I have to start now. Follow me.

639
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,280
What should I do?

640
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,700
I used to do this a lot long ago.
Work at a comfortable pace.

641
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,400
We will.

642
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,070
You guys look great in your uniforms.

643
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:08,550
Switch places with me!

644
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,510
Who said to wear tthat kind of clothing?

645
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,610
You even catch bugs. Do you think that flower-print suits you?

646
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,200
Look! A bug!

647
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,550
None of your beeswax.

648
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,310
Go to work.

649
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,660
What number is it?

650
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,410
What?

651
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,330
What number is it out of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?
Was it three, the number I liked?

652
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,020
Three my butt!

653
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,370
Number two?

654
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,650
Oh. Number two.

655
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,000
What about yesterday?

656
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,370
Kitty.

657
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,010
Your face is really funny.
What's up?

658
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,490
I was thinking of something else for a second.

659
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,860
I didn't move that much stuff, but yet my nails are all broken.

660
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,370
Me too.

661
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,970
When are we going to eat today?

662
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,400
You're hungry?

663
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,830
We worked all day. Of course I'm hungry.

664
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,890
Tae San isn't hungry. He has no appetite.

665
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,130
I am walking on eggshells too.
It's just that I am not making it apparent.

666
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,330
Make it apparent! You look too fine.

667
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,320
Honestly. After what happened, have you met Lawyer Choi?

668
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,500
We talk on the phone everyday. He dropped by for a short time a few days ago too.

669
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,170
My brother needs to calm down a bit for us to do something.

670
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,140
Please don't move.

671
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,980
Will it take long? She said she's hungry.

672
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,740
No. It's a fast-drying nail polish, so it won't take long.

673
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,210
A few days ago, you met Tae San. How was he?

674
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,380
Manager Im, nice hitting.

675
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,090
What do you want?

676
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,730
Why did you come here?

677
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,540
The move went well.

678
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,010
The two women are happy in the little house.
It's a gem of a house.

679
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,870
Meahri has already made herself at home.

680
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,120
Meahri worried about you a lot.

681
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,410
When?

682
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,650
We bought you some medicated strips!
Do you want the sticky kind or the spray-on kind?

683
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,840
Do you want to go to the sauna?
Do you want me to scrub your back for you?

684
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,190
We are always on your side. You know that?

685
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,280
Honestly..

686
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,870
You guys leave.
I have a foul temper!

687
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,200
Go. Go. go. Go.

688
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,620
Lawyer Choi! Nice pitching!

689
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,400
Nice pitching!

690
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,950
What? What is it?

691
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,030
We moved in successfully, and Meahri has already made herself at home.

692
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,490
Meahri worried about you a lot.

693
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,750
Did you go see Tae San?

694
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,850
Rok: Yes
Do Jin: No

695
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,200
Both: Really?

696
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,800
If you planned it out, at least match your words.

697
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,010
Rok: We were going to go now.
Do Jin: We just came back.

698
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,410
Both: Seriously?

699
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,430
How is Tae San?

700
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,300
You're throwing and he's hitting.

701
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,960
We bought medicated strips.

702
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,380
Do you want the sticky kind or the spray-on kind?

703
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,120
Do you want to go to the sauna?
Do you want me to scrub your back for you?

704
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,160
We're always on your side. You know that?

705
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,380
You did that to Tae San too, right?

706
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,910
But... aren't we cute?

707
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,990
Let's go
Go!

708
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,930
Why did you come so early? I said I'd wait.

709
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,990
Because... It just happened this way.

710
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,630
But why aren't you looking at me?

711
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,810
I can't seem to look at you.

712
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:57,920
I want to look at you. Raise your head.

713
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
Is this really your concept?

714
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,930
It's not a concept. I'm doing it because I'm really nervous.

715
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:12,450
I don't even know why I'm nervous.

716
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,450
Huh?

717
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,300
You didn't throw the bag away?

718
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,490
How can I throw it away? You personally made it.

719
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,330
Let's go eat.

720
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,020
So we

721
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,860
went to Tae San and told him we were on his side.

722
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,530
And then we went to Yoon and told him we were on his side.

723
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,100
So?

724
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:58,760
So that is why I couldn't receive your call.
I couldn't be like "Hi honey!" when Tae San and Yoon are both about to die.

725
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,280
They're my friends.

726
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,590
What?

727
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,030
By chance...
Do you not believe me?!

728
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,030
Fine.
Do you want to call Do Jin?

729
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:17,350
No...you won't believe Do Jin either.
How about Yoon?

730
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,860
Are they not that much different?

731
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,320
Yeah! The pharmacist!

732
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,220
We bought a whole bunch of medicated strips to give to them. The pharmacist would remember me.

733
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,250
Wow honey...
Do you really not believe me?

734
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,250
Yeah.

735
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,840
I can't believe you anymore.

736
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,150
Even if you carry a surveillance camera with you, I can't believe you.

737
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,520
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

738
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,640
Other people

739
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,590
tell me that I have everything.

740
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,480
That's right.

741
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,890
I <i>do</i> have everything.

742
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,160
But, I...

743
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,960
To me, you were all I had.

744
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,970
Why are you crying again?

745
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:26,170
A wedding ring, since a husband and wife cannot always be together,

746
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,340
it's how a husband keeps his wife
at the side closest to his heart.

747
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,100
and how a wife keeps

748
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,050
her husband at her closest.

749
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,210
On the ring finger, which is connected to the heart.

750
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,410
But now, this ring...

751
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,680
I'm the one who wants to take it off.

752
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,140
I really mean it.

753
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:52,810
Now, I can't believe you even if you tell me that 1+1 is 2.

754
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,350
"What did he talk about with that woman?"

755
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:59,330
"Is that phone call with a man or a woman?"

756
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:02,470
"Is he just smiling or smiling for her?"

757
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,740
I go to heaven and hell back and forth everyday.

758
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,310
I'm sorry...

759
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,470
I know I've done wrong up until now.

760
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,970
But, honey...

761
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,340
I'm never going to take off my ring now.

762
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,500
I'm being serious.

763
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,890
I really won't do it.

764
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:27,640
Okay?

765
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,350
I'm going to do it from now.

766
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,140
Even if you won't, I will.

767
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,020
Please do this for me.

768
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,090
Let's get a divorce.

769
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:43,180
This is because I feel so bad for myself.

770
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:48,620
This is because I look like a crazy woman for doubting you nonstop!

771
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,760
Honey.

772
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,330
I will ask you sincerely.

773
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,660
Just let me go.

774
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,370
Please divorce me.

775
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:07,780
While I am at least still intact,
please let me go, huh?

776
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,080
<i>Science Department Park Hyun Joo
010-6985</i>

777
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,210
Hello. This is Teacher Park Hyun Joo from Joo Won High School, right?

778
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,540
I don't know if you're enjoying tonight's meal.

779
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:59,620
I come here very often with my husband,
I like this kind of place.

780
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,820
But can we accept dinner from a parent?

781
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:12,640
I have invited all of you here, not as a parent,
but as Seo Yi Soo's boyfriend.

782
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,060
If by any chance you enjoy wine . . .

783
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,440
Oh my!  How did you know that I only drink wine?

784
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,510
Did you tell him, Teacher Seo?

785
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,780
Oh...
About that...

786
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,130
It's written on your face.
Elegant and refined.

787
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:28,220
I wish that wasn't so blatantly obvious.

788
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,180
It's a bit pricey.

789
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,070
Really?

790
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,140
Then look at just the most pricey one.
I am honored to treat you.

791
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:59,800
Teacher Seo, you are so lucky.
You have this actor-like boyfriend.

792
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,080
What?  Then are you saying my husband
is lacking qualities?

793
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,430
Everyone says he looks like Jang Dong Gun (actor's real name).

794
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,690
Is that so?

795
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,770
You are so beautiful.

796
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:18,550
Good-looking men must have something in common!

797
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,460
Teacher Seo, you've met the perfect man.

798
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,650
Yes.

799
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,380
You're drinking a lot today.

800
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:37,770
I am in a very good mood.
Cheers, then chug it.

801
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:41,260
Cheers!
One shot!

802
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,580
Please take good care of her, who is careless very often.

803
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,190
Our Teacher Seo is like a younger sister to us.

804
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:02,350
I think you know already because you've heard, but I'm really sorry that

805
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,660
I am the sole flaw in her life.

806
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,580
What do you mean by flaw? No one thinks of it like that here.

807
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,780
Then that's good.

808
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:20,960
But I wish for her to be happy while doing
the work she wants to for a long time.

809
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,840
In order to make that happen, I hope that you guys will help out.

810
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,760
All of us here are on Teacher Seo's side!

811
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,190
Teacher Seo...

812
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,960
Cheers!

813
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,880
Cheers!

814
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,150
Are you alright?

815
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,430
Yes.
I didn't drink a lot.

816
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:14,410
Thank you. You did a lot of work today.

817
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:17,310
If it is this kind of work, then I'm not opposed.

818
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,410
Let's stay seated a little bit longer before we leave.

819
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,800
Okay.

820
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:50,800
Should we turn on the radio?

821
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,570
Alright.

822
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:01,370
<i>My hot lips want to</i>

823
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,520
<i>touch your soft lips.</i>

824
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,560
<i>So that my love will be delivered to your heart</i>

825
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,640
What are other stations playing?

826
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:21,640
<i>Touch me. Hold me. Don't stop.</i>

827
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,660
<i>I feel like I am about to fly.
To my two eyes</i>

828
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:38,240
<i>Start now. Little by little, hotly.</i>

829
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,940
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

830
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:50,350
<i>The sun shines a path before your eyes.</i>

831
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:53,060
<i>Don't ever stop.</i>

832
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,570
<i>Don't go home, baby.</i>

833
01:04:56,570 --> 01:05:00,530
<i>I have a present here for you.</i>

834
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:04,690
<i>Don't go home tonight, baby</i>

835
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,110
So funny.

836
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,450
What kind of a radio turns on music according to the person listening to it?

837
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:25,710
It's so weird that all the songs are sexy.

838
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,760
I know.

839
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:34,750
I think when I hear this song later, I will remember today.

840
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,500
I can make it more memorable.

841
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,270
What are you going to do

842
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:50,390
if I don't let you go home tonight?

843
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:00,600
I don't want to let Seo Yi Soo go.

844
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,730
<i>My love, my love.</i>

845
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:15,330
<i>My love that I long for.</i>

846
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:19,240
<i>Who I call out as loud as I can</i>

847
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,130
<i>but can't hear me.</i>

848
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:27,620
<i>My love, my love.</i>

849
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,660
<i>My love that I miss.</i>

850
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,280
<i>A melody of destiny that cannot be forgotten.</i>

851
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,930
<i>Five Fingers</i>
