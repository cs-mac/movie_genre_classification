1
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:45,121
TWO DAYS, ONE NIGHT

2
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:29,742
Hello?

3
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,672
I was resting.

4
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,801
Just a second.
I have to get my tart out.

5
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,846
I've made a tart for the kids.

6
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,680
Yes. Why?

7
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:57,861
Tell me why.

8
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:07,778
No.

9
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:11,291
No, Juliette.

10
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,092
You mustn't cry.

11
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,128
Hold up.

12
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:06,833
You mustn't cry.

13
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,423
Sandra?

14
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,353
Sandra?

15
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,951
Juliette called me.
Why don't you want to go?

16
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,330
It's no use.

17
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,712
If you go,
Dumont will agree to a new ballot.

18
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:48,625
No one gives a damn.

19
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:52,672
She told me the foreman
talked to them and scared them.

20
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,093
They want their bonus.
It's normal.

21
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,930
No, it's not normal.

22
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,217
It's Juliette.

23
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,225
Hello?

24
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,729
She wants a word.

25
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:14,688
Sandra, please. Talk to her.

26
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,698
Please.

27
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,916
Hello?

28
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,704
Yes.

29
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:39,794
All right.

30
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:43,923
Well?

31
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,884
Dumont hasn't made his mind up yet.

32
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,638
He's willing to see me.

33
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:51,018
Now?

34
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,608
Before 5 pm.

35
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,057
I'll take you.

36
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,475
And the kids?

37
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,771
We'll pick them up on the way.

38
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:02,568
I'll text Estelle to wait by the steps.

39
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,541
It can't start again...

40
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:20,838
It'll be ok.

41
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,971
I'm not going.

42
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,841
You have to, Sandra.

43
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,392
Taking more?

44
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:38,266
I have to.
I'm crying like an idiot again.

45
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,608
The doctor said you should stop.

46
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:42,655
Just have half.

47
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:48,026
The only way to stop crying
is to fight for your job.

48
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:49,900
Shit...

49
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,248
How'll we pay the mortgage
without your salary?

50
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,579
We'll go back lo social housing.

51
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,373
No, we won't.

52
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:04,795
Don't give in.
You have to fight.

53
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm a mess again.

54
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,381
- You're not.
- I am.

55
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,644
Hi, kids. Hi, Manu.

56
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,072
Hurry or we'll miss him.

57
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,943
It's only a quarter to.

58
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,158
- Is Mr Dumont in?
- No, he just left.

59
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,404
Thank you.

60
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:39,239
He didn't wait?

61
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:42,293
I said he was expecting us
to get you here.

62
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,036
Mr Dumont!

63
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:52,170
Good evening, Mr Dumont.
I'm here with Sandra...

64
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,627
Come on.

65
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,087
Hello, Mrs Bya.

66
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,173
Hello.

67
00:06:57,296 --> 00:07:00,974
We wanted to ask if we could hold
a new ballot on Monday.

68
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,559
Jean-Marc spoke to some people

69
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:07,853
and told them that you preferred
to lay off Sandra.

70
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,521
I never said that!

71
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,441
I asked him to find out if most people

72
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,146
preferred a bonus
or keeping Mrs Bya on.

73
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:19,032
We can't afford both.
That was the only question.

74
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,539
Jean-Marc said you'd rather
lay off Sandra or someone else.

75
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:24,579
He said that?

76
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:26,453
To 3 people at least

77
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:31,295
14 out of 16 opted for the bonus.
3 wouldn't change things.

78
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,748
A new ballot would be more honest

79
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:37,004
Without Jean-Marc there
in? influencing people.

80
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,348
I won't oppose a secret ballot.

81
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,345
Thank you.

82
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,307
I wanted to see you on Monday...

83
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,564
- We could...
- I'm talking to Mrs Bya!

84
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,605
Forgive me.

85
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,562
I've nothing against you

86
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:59,073
bull have to deal with competition
from Asian solar panels.

87
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,528
See you on Monday.

88
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,857
Mr Dumont!

89
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,652
Can we vote between 8 and 8:30?

90
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,323
See Jean-Marc about it.
But don't get Mrs Bya's hopes up.

91
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,539
Apart from 2 people,
they chose the bonus. It's legitimate.

92
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,129
Goodbye, Mr Dumont.

93
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,713
We've won the first round!

94
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,838
What's wrong?

95
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,585
Want to drink?

96
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,220
Here.

97
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,369
I don't know what that was.

98
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:51,622
I couldn't speak.

99
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:56,419
I wanted to tell him
I'm in shape and ready to work.

100
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:57,790
But I couldn't say a word.

101
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:01,919
It's the emotion of being back here
and seeing Dumont.

102
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:05,964
Even if you said nothing,
he backed down because you were here.

103
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,595
- You think so?
- I know so.

104
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,300
It'll be the same Monday.

105
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,635
When the others see you,
they'll forget their bonus.

106
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,555
- Can I carry them?
- Me too?

107
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,314
All right, two each.

108
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:21,774
Careful, keep them level.

109
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,645
Maxime, mind the car!

110
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,616
I'll gel the addresses from Juliette.

111
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:35,862
No.

112
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,868
Why not try?

113
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm sure it could work.

114
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,430
There...

115
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,231
If Mum loses her job,
will she get sick again?

116
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,944
She's not going to lose it.
Tell her we're eating.

117
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,744
I'll bring the last one.

118
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,498
Mum, we're eating!

119
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,332
It's really hot.

120
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,873
I'll cut it for you.

121
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,545
Hold on...

122
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,009
<i>- Bu! Mum answer you'?
- No .</i>

123
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,343
Stan eating, I'll fetch her.

124
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,062
Going to bed already?

125
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:54,477
Yes.

126
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:56,321
It's only 7 o'clock.

127
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm beat.

128
00:10:58,354 --> 00:10:59,861
At least eat with us.

129
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,736
No, I'm too beat.

130
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:04,443
You're letting yourself go.
React instead.

131
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,167
That's easy to say.

132
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,541
No one but Juliette and Robert
thought about me.

133
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,835
As if I didn't exist

134
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,463
But they're right.

135
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,762
I don't exist. I'm nothing.
Nothing at all!

136
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,312
You exist, Sandra.

137
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:40,983
I love you.

138
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,319
You exist for them too.

139
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:49,371
They hesitated
before voting for the bonus.

140
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,327
See them one by one this weekend.

141
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:54,746
You hear me?

142
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,467
I'll see them Monday.
It's the same thing.

143
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,921
No, you won't be able
to talk to each one individually.

144
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,009
Tell them you want your job,
you need your salary,

145
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,348
to be with them,
not alone on the dole.

146
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,522
I'll look like a beggar.

147
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,144
You won't.

148
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,777
Coming to eat?

149
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,183
Just a second!

150
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:28,407
It's not your fault
they lose a bonus if you stay.

151
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,532
Your boss decided that, not you.

152
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,539
I can't hear, Juliette.

153
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,126
Julien Lemmens, Villers-le-Temple.
She doesn't know what street.

154
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,544
I'll check the phone book.

155
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:47,882
Atarhouch, Hicham.
Rue de I'Echelle, number 23.

156
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:49,090
Well done.

157
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,798
See if you can find Julien Lemmens

158
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:56,716
in Villers-le-Temple. With two m's.

159
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,761
That could help her out.

160
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,725
She can ask Robert
to drive you tomorrow.

161
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:05,107
I'll take the bus.
Two or three live close by.

162
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,017
She'll take the bus
to see those near here.

163
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:12,654
Yes, midday at the restaurant,
then I'll drive her.

164
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,697
Yes, I'll put heron. Thanks.

165
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:18,370
She wants to talk to you.

166
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:21,622
I'll fetch the coffee.

167
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:25,669
We'll see.

168
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:31,467
Take care.

169
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,710
Can we go with you
before we eat at Lunch Garden?

170
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,056
It's best if Mum's alone
to talk to her colleagues.

171
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,136
I'll take you to Nonna's.

172
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,763
She'll bring you to the restaurant.

173
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:49,680
It's Robert.

174
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,225
Hello, yes.

175
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,483
You think...

176
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,988
0k, I'll note that.

177
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,115
Thanks.

178
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,788
Goodbye.

179
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,160
He says he saw Kader.

180
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,756
Wait a second...

181
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,667
Kader's on the crew
but won't be at home this weekend.

182
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,466
He told Robert I could call him
on his mobile.

183
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,594
Call him.

184
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,384
If he said that, he's willing to listen.

185
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,930
Go on.

186
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:12,051
Hello? Kader?

187
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,019
It's Sandra.

188
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:16,648
Yes, I'm fine.

189
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,977
Yes, in shape.

190
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:24,107
Robert said I could call you.
Is this a bad time?

191
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,609
It's about the ballot.

192
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:31,995
I went to see Dumont with Juliette

193
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:34,529
and he's agreed to a new vote Monday.

194
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,585
Robert told you?

195
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:43,709
So...

196
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:48,423
I wanted to ask
if you'd agree to me staying.

197
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:57,849
Yes, I know...
It's not your decision but...

198
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,147
You understand...

199
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,182
I don't want
to make you lose 1,000 euros.

200
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,351
But...

201
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,571
I just want to tell you...

202
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,992
Hold on a second.

203
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:32,042
I just want to tell you I'd like you
to vote for me to keep my job.

204
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:35,679
I need my salary.
We need it at home.

205
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:46,808
Refusing to vote...

206
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,185
wouldn't be enough.

207
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,612
I need you...

208
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,985
to agree to lose your bonus.

209
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:57,907
But don't feel obliged.

210
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,614
I know you need 1,000 euros too.

211
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,378
Really?

212
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,470
Kader...

213
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,055
Thank you so much.

214
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,640
Your kindness...

215
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,305
Thank you.

216
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:35,519
You have a good weekend too.

217
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,692
See you on Monday morning.
Thank you.

218
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,653
Goodbye.

219
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,758
<i>Yes?</i>

220
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:38,225
Hello, it's Sandra.
I work at Solwal with Mireille.

221
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,018
Could I talk to her?

222
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:41,425
<i>She isn't here.</i>

223
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,844
When will she be back?

224
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,854
<i>Around 12:30 or 1 o'clock.</i>

225
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:48,934
I'll come back.
Thank you. Goodbye.

226
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,184
<i>Goodbye.</i>

227
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:13,888
Hello.

228
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:17,641
Hello, I'm Sandra.
I work at Solwal with Willy.

229
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:21,395
Could I have a quick word with him?
It's about work.

230
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,947
Yes, he's out the back.

231
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:30,616
Willy!

232
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,208
Hello.

233
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:52,095
Robert gave me your address.

234
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:58,686
I'm here
because Juliette and I saw Dumont.

235
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,893
He's agreed to a new ballot Monday.

236
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,360
Because Jean-Marc spoke to some people

237
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:07,196
to scare them.

238
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:12,441
I wanted to ask if you'd agree

239
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,365
to vote for me to keep my job.

240
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,787
I didn't vote against you,
I voted for my bonus.

241
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,292
Dumont put one against the other,
not me.

242
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,010
I know.
It's sick forcing you to choose.

243
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,386
But I don't want to lose my job.

244
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,684
Without my salary, we can't get by.

245
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:44,186
I can't. I need my bonus.

246
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,526
We need 500 a month
for our oldest girl's studies.

247
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:51,405
600 with her room's charges.

248
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:56,440
How about the others?
What do they say?

249
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,038
Robert, Juliette and Kader

250
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:02,571
will vote for me to stay...

251
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,118
The others, I don't know.

252
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,710
You're the first I've seen.

253
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:14,383
I'll think it over.

254
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,553
What? It's all thought over.
We can't.

255
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:18,510
It's ok.

256
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,015
No, it's not ok!

257
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:24,008
I wish we could help
but I've been on the dole since February.

258
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:27,394
We salvage floor tiles
to make ends meet.

259
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:31,523
I understand. I'm sorry.

260
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:35,104
You don't need to apologise.

261
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:37,654
We just can't, that's all.

262
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:41,575
Do you have an address for...

263
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,739
Something to drink?
Orange juice or water?

264
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,413
No, thank you.

265
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,912
Dominique... Or Alphonse?

266
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,167
I can give you Yvon's address.
His son's too.

267
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:58,878
Yes, please.

268
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,176
They live...

269
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,424
at number 75,

270
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:09,638
Rue Cote d'Or.

271
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,933
That's in Sclessin.

272
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,271
Goodbye.

273
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:44,505
Mireille!

274
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,478
Hello.

275
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,018
It's been ages.

276
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:01,896
Are you better'?

277
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,611
Yes, thanks.

278
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:06,572
Can I have a quick word with you

279
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:09,984
about the vote for the bonus
and my lay-off?

280
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:13,949
Sure, but I'm in a hurry. We have to...
Go on then quickly.

281
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:16,114
I can come back later or tomorrow.

282
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,039
No, go ahead.

283
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:22,504
Juliette and I saw Dumont.
He's agreed to a new ballot Monday

284
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:27,126
because Jean-Marc told people stuff
to influence them

285
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,718
and scare them.

286
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,170
So I wanted to ask

287
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,297
if you'd vote for me to stay.

288
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,551
I'd like to do that
but I'll lose my bonus.

289
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:40,394
- I didn't decide that.
- Neither did I.

290
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:44,473
Will the others agree to lose it?

291
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:47,266
There are three for now. Juliette...

292
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,439
Juliette has it easy.
Her guy mends cars on the black.

293
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:51,777
I can't.

294
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:56,035
I've left my husband, see.
My guy and I are starting from scratch.

295
00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:00,324
Furniture, TV, bed, washing machine,
crockery. We have to buy it all.

296
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:02,283
Excuse me.

297
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:09,254
I can't afford to lose 1,000 euros.

298
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,670
Don't be mad at me but I can't.

299
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,962
I'm not mad at you.

300
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:18,931
Sorry, I really have to go.
Excuse me.

301
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,338
Goodbye.

302
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,187
Don't take it badly.

303
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,851
No, I won't. Goodbye.

304
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,544
Hello?

305
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:00,134
I saw two. They refused.

306
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:04,766
They need their bonus.
It's normal. I told you.

307
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:09,134
Thanks.

308
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,603
Yes, you take care too.

309
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,198
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

310
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:26,612
It's Sandra.
I'd like to talk to Nadine.

311
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:32,075
Are you her daughter'?

312
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:35,576
<i>Yes, but she isn't here.</i>

313
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:41,004
I work with your mum at Solwal.
When will she be back?

314
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:45,132
<i>I don't know. She didn't tell me.</i>

315
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,928
I heard you, Nadine.
Why won't you talk to me?

316
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,785
Think they could change their minds?

317
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:16,787
No.

318
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,914
If I was in their shoes...
1,000 euros...

319
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,919
Three already agree.
3 out of 6. That's half.

320
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,297
Manu!

321
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,098
I'll put the fruit salad out soon.

322
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,684
Yes, with strawberries.

323
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,435
Are you ok, Mum?

324
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,899
I won't be long.

325
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:11,957
I don't want the kids to see me crying.

326
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:18,592
Got a handkerchief?

327
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:20,637
It's clean.

328
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,015
The one that hurts most is Nadine.

329
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,025
Forget her.

330
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:35,611
We got on well
but she wouldn't speak to me.

331
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,163
I'm going home.

332
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:45,868
Let's see a couple more.

333
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,117
- It's no use.
- We'll try.

334
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,760
Are you ok?

335
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,770
I dreamt Maxime was drowning.

336
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,658
How many have you had?

337
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,360
Leave me be.

338
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:21,250
I'd like to talk to Timur.
Is he your dad?

339
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:22,579
Is he here?

340
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,293
He's at football.

341
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,040
At a game?

342
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,252
No, he's training kids.

343
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,924
Far from here?

344
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,090
No, close by.

345
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:36,258
Take that street
and you'll see the posts with the lamps.

346
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:37,972
You see?

347
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,472
Thank you. Goodbye.

348
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:02,459
Hello. I'm looking for Timur.

349
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:04,836
He's over there.

350
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:08,292
On the far pitch, training the juniors.

351
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:12,129
To get there, go back out and turn left.

352
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,965
Thank you.

353
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:30,599
Timur!

354
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,497
Hello.

355
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,633
Your daughter told me you were here.
I was round at your place.

356
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:01,970
I wanted to see you about...

357
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:05,515
the vote on the bonus
and me being laid off.

358
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:08,559
Juliette and I saw Dumont.

359
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,940
He'll let us hold another ballot Monday
because“.

360
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:15,810
Jean-Marc influenced people
by telling them

361
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:19,990
that Dumont wanted
to lay off staff anyway.

362
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:23,908
So if it wasn't me
who was made redundant,

363
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:26,989
it would be them...

364
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:28,993
So...

365
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:31,825
I wanted to ask you if...

366
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,621
if you'd vote for me to stay on Monday.

367
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:41,544
Of course I will.

368
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:57,181
I'm really glad you're here.

369
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:06,776
I'm so mad at myself
for voting for my bonus.

370
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,444
I'm sorry.

371
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:14,076
Don't be sorry.

372
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,125
I can understand.

373
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,491
1,000 euros...

374
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:21,667
No...

375
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:31,004
I'm ashamed.

376
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:35,013
I even forgot what you did for me.

377
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:40,387
Remember'?

378
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,608
When I broke those cells...

379
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,402
and you said you did it.

380
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,241
You remember'?

381
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,284
Yes, and Jean-Marc even said,

382
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,578
"Fine example to set the new guy!"

383
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:03,832
I'm really glad you came.

384
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:10,126
How many agree
to go without their bonus?

385
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:12,298
Four

386
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:16,172
There's Robert, Juliette, Kader

387
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:17,932
and four with you.

388
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:19,844
I still have nine to see.

389
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:22,017
You'll manage it, I'm sure.

390
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:25,982
Seen Miguel yet?

391
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,733
No, not yet.

392
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,271
I'll call him.

393
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,438
I have to go.

394
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:38,782
Goodbye. See you on Monday.

395
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,742
Thank you.

396
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:43,904
Goodbye.

397
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,574
Good luck!

398
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,884
Yes? Who is it?

399
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:43,263
It's Sandra.
I work with Hicham at Solwal.

400
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:52,844
I came up because the janitor said
the power is off

401
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,179
and the buzzers don't work.

402
00:36:54,303 --> 00:36:55,726
That's all right.

403
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,556
Are you Hicham's wife?

404
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,568
Yes, but he isn't here.

405
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,731
When will he be back?

406
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,240
I don't know.

407
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:08,276
Could you call him to find out
when he'll be back?

408
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,080
Or if I can see him where he is?

409
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:15,952
Sorry to insist
but I really need to see him.

410
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:19,917
He can help me to keep my job
and stay off the dole.

411
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:23,247
Aissou...

412
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:26,335
Aissou, bring me the phone, please.

413
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,592
Thank you, sweetheart.

414
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:40,601
Yes, even/thing's fine, yes.

415
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:44,318
There's a woman from Solwal
who wants to talk to you.

416
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:58,120
Can't it wait until Monday at work?

417
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:02,372
Today or tomorrow would be better.

418
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,746
She says today or tomorrow.

419
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,424
He wants to talk to you.

420
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:18,727
Yes, hi, Hicham.

421
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,066
Did Kader tell you...

422
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,322
All right.

423
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,947
Too bad for me but I understand.

424
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,250
All right. Goodbye.

425
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:03,055
Thank you. Goodbye.

426
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:12,141
Kader had called him. He said no.
He needs his bonus.

427
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:16,316
Juliette just texted me a new address.

428
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,819
I'll get water. Want anything?

429
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:23,032
No.

430
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:36,756
80 cents, please.

431
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:47,965
Thank you.

432
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:50,390
Goodbye.

433
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:54,888
Hicham?

434
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,522
Come in here.

435
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,607
I work here weekends.
My wife can't say so. It's on the black.

436
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,201
Sorry I was so curt on the phone.

437
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,660
But I can't do it.

438
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:16,579
I don't want you to lose your job
but I need my bonus.

439
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,703
It's a year's gas and electric bills.

440
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:23,673
Try to see it from my side.

441
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:25,755
I'm better.

442
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:28,890
I want to work and earn a salary again.

443
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,469
I want to be with you,
not alone on the dole.

444
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,598
Ideally, you stay and we get the bonus.

445
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,355
I told Jean-Marc that earlier.

446
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:47,981
He says Dumont can't do that.

447
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,612
You saw Jean-Marc?

448
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:51,368
No, he called me.

449
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,994
Like the others, no doubt,
so we won't change our minds.

450
00:40:58,197 --> 00:41:01,080
Why does he think it's best I'm fired?

451
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:03,583
I don't know.

452
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:05,793
It's what he thinks.

453
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:08,048
I told him he was wrong but...

454
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,084
I have to go.

455
00:41:13,795 --> 00:41:15,681
What did he say against me?

456
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,555
He thinks you can't work so well
after being sick.

457
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:24,475
I said it wasn't true.
I wasn't any weaker after my accident.

458
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:26,649
I was more motivated, remember'?

459
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,531
What's wrong?

460
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,497
What's wrong?

461
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,045
Are you ok?

462
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:04,093
Drive.

463
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,966
You don't really believe it can work.

464
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:48,138
Of course I do.

465
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:53,855
You have to believe it too
and ignore that asshole of a foreman.

466
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:01,353
He's right.

467
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:04,195
I'm not up to it anymore.

468
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,497
I can't stop crying.
I'm losing my voice now...

469
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:09,909
So?

470
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:13,575
Anyone would break down.

471
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:17,580
You're in shape to go back
and you learn you're fired.

472
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:19,381
It'd knock anyone out.

473
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,383
It'd knock me out too.

474
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,846
If they take you back,

475
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:29,890
after a few weeks with Juliette
and your friends,

476
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:31,891
you'll work like before.

477
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:34,973
Better even.

478
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,571
We'll see that guy and his son.

479
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:50,450
Rue Cote d'Or isn't far.

480
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:58,958
I wish that was me.

481
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:02,088
Who?

482
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:06,710
That bird singing...

483
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:17,472
Shall we go?

484
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:34,949
I can tell we're going to split up.

485
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,455
WW do you say that?

486
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:42,667
You don't love me anymore.

487
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,250
You pity me but you don't love me.

488
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:55,594
Doesn't it bother you
we haven't made love for four months?

489
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,135
It does.

490
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,350
But I know we'll do it again.

491
00:45:45,131 --> 00:45:46,175
Hello.

492
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,935
I'm here
because Juliette and I saw Dumont.

493
00:45:54,056 --> 00:45:56,559
He's agreed to a new ballot Monday.

494
00:45:56,975 --> 00:46:02,112
Jean-Marc influenced the vote
by saying stuff to people to scare them.

495
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:05,110
- I wanted...
- What did he say?

496
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:08,071
That Dumont wanted to lay off staff.

497
00:46:08,194 --> 00:46:10,413
If it wasn't me, it'd be someone else.

498
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,167
Who did he say that to?

499
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:14,535
Three or four people at least

500
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:17,369
I don't know who but Juliette does.

501
00:46:18,037 --> 00:46:19,839
She knows everything, that one.

502
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:27,348
I wanted to ask if you'd vote on Monday
for me to stay.

503
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:32,058
What do the others say?

504
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:36,686
Juliette, Robert, Kader and Timur
will vote for me to stay.

505
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:39,735
I still have eight to see,
you two included.

506
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:45,280
Maybe Jean-Marc called you to tell you

507
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:48,118
I couldn't work like before
after my depression.

508
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:50,367
It's not true. I'm in shape.

509
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,392
SharePirate.Com Subs

510
00:46:55,863 --> 00:47:00,288
I don't want you laid off
but my bonus is a lot of money.

511
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:01,792
I know.

512
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:06,050
I didn't force this decision on you.

513
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,221
I just want to work and earn my salary.

514
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,008
We need it at home to live.

515
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,098
We worked for that bonus!

516
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:16,135
- I know.
- Why'd we give it to you?

517
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,473
She never said that.

518
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,478
Why wouldn't we get our money?

519
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:21,930
- We can talk.
- No, we worked for it!

520
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,691
How dare you steal our dough?

521
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:26,226
- Shut up.
- No way. Piss off!

522
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:32,148
Get in!

523
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:51,749
<i>'Non...</i>

524
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,979
I saw some maniac tear off.

525
00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:06,686
What happened?

526
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:13,189
I'll get the water.

527
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,479
Sir...

528
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,448
Pour it over his head.

529
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,373
Can you see my hand?

530
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,129
How many fingers?

531
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:36,875
Three.

532
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,134
Who's this?

533
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,058
I'm her husband.

534
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:50,897
You can count on me Monday.

535
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:54,808
I caused that fight.

536
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,274
Calm down.

537
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,240
I tell you I'm fed up but you ignore me.

538
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:04,659
You don't realize!
I caused that violence. I can't stand it.

539
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,867
It's the first time.

540
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,705
No, it's every time.

541
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,913
Every time, I feel like a beggar,

542
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,785
a thief coming to take their money.

543
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,287
They look at me, ready to hit me.

544
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,298
I feel like hitting them too.

545
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,631
I'm going to bed.

546
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:25,590
We said we'd go to see Miguel.

547
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,220
I've had enough.
I'll see them on Monday.

548
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:33,556
- Five out often want you to stay!
- No, two!

549
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:36,982
I forced the others to pity me.

550
00:49:38,098 --> 00:49:41,277
If I'm taken back,
those who lose their bonus,

551
00:49:41,434 --> 00:49:45,361
how will they look at me?
How will I deal with them all day?

552
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:50,615
How'll I manage in the workshop,
on the machines, over lunch?

553
00:49:51,694 --> 00:49:54,743
I won't go Monday.
They can decide without me.

554
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:09,429
Sandra!
Juliette's calling on your phone.

555
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:11,181
I'm going to bed!

556
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:51,469
Juliette called me.

557
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,681
Timur said Miguel will vote for you.

558
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:00,469
That's six now. Only three to go.

559
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:04,392
We'll see them tomorrow.

560
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,897
I feel so alone, Manu.

561
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:19,573
We'll make it.

562
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:39,772
I saw you from the window.

563
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:43,238
I was decorating.
With the music, I didn't hear the bell.

564
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:44,445
Hello.

565
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,572
Come on in.

566
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:53,206
That's kind but I have work to do.
Well, work...

567
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:54,871
I'm here because...

568
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,952
Yes, I know why you're here.
The new ballot on Monday.

569
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:01,674
Jean-Marc called you?

570
00:53:01,788 --> 00:53:03,543
No, Nadine did.

571
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:07,344
She told you she wouldn't see me?

572
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,923
Yes. She told me
she needs the 1,000 euros.

573
00:53:12,673 --> 00:53:15,009
She could have told me herself.

574
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,850
How many are willing to lose the bonus?

575
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:24,565
Six.

576
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:29,025
I have another four to see.
Five with you.

577
00:53:33,609 --> 00:53:38,283
I spoke to my husband.
We have a lot of expenses on the house.

578
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:41,496
We need the bonus
to do a patio out back.

579
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,166
The mud washes down,
so we need a wall too.

580
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:51,215
I'm sorry.

581
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:52,925
Don't apologise.

582
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,760
It's not because of this.

583
00:53:57,923 --> 00:54:00,509
I'm a bit nervous
about tomorrow morning.

584
00:54:01,677 --> 00:54:03,064
I'll be going.

585
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:07,569
Wait, Sandra!

586
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:12,404
It bothers me saying no.

587
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,022
I don't want pity.

588
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:16,282
I don't pity you but...

589
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:19,408
I've been thinking about it
since Friday.

590
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:24,375
We need the money
but I'll talk to my husband again.

591
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:27,869
He's out on his bike until noon.

592
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:31,836
Come back or I'll call you at 1.

593
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:36,251
I'll get my phone to note your number.

594
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,241
Let me note that.

595
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:11,080
With 1W01's?

596
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:19,259
We're going to Julien's.

597
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,340
I don't know.

598
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:25,096
She'll talk to her husband.

599
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:26,632
She'll say yes.

600
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,560
He says she'll say yes.

601
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,012
I don't know. We'll see.

602
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,687
Thanks.

603
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:40,650
Enough.

604
00:55:41,353 --> 00:55:42,859
Why turn it off?

605
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:45,325
Want it back on?

606
00:55:45,482 --> 00:55:47,487
Yes, stop protecting me.

607
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:50,324
I'm not protecting you.

608
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:54,242
You are. You thought the song
was too depressing for me.

609
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:56,502
Well, it's not exactly...

610
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:59,429
Are you a Jehovah's Witness?

611
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:01,183
No.

612
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:07,267
Sorry, they usually come about now.

613
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:11,188
Hello, I'm Sandra.
I work with Julien at Solwal.

614
00:57:11,437 --> 00:57:13,240
Could I have a word with him?

615
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:17,075
He's not here. He's at the cafe
opposite the church.

616
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:19,532
Thank you. Goodbye.

617
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:43,718
He's in the café but it's packed.

618
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:47,850
We'll wait till he comes out.

619
00:57:52,016 --> 00:57:53,855
No, I'll see him Monday.

620
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:59,567
It's 12:30. Let's get some food
and eat here while we wait.

621
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,192
You're hungry?

622
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:03,576
Yes.

623
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,213
Want a turnover'?

624
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,342
No.

625
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:23,302
A mini pizza?

626
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,631
There he is.

627
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:27,473
Go on.

628
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:29,969
Go on.

629
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,349
I'll get you a mini pizza.

630
00:58:38,434 --> 00:58:39,692
Julien!

631
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:41,569
Hi...

632
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:46,656
My son, Ryan.

633
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:48,491
Hello.

634
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:53,577
I wanted to see you because

635
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:56,623
Juliette and I saw Dumont on Friday.

636
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,959
He'll hold another ballot
Monday morning

637
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,001
because of Jean-Marc

638
00:59:02,123 --> 00:59:04,971
who influenced some people by saying

639
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:09,385
if I wasn't the one laid off,
maybe they would be.

640
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,971
So I wanted to see you to ask if

641
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,513
you'd vote for me to stay.

642
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:20,146
Are many willing to lose their bonus?

643
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:21,727
Six.

644
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,528
I still have five to see, you included.

645
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,908
Tell Mum I'll be home for lunch soon.

646
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,619
The six who've agreed... Who are they?

647
00:59:45,622 --> 00:59:49,584
I can't tell you that.
It's a secret ballot.

648
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:57,262
Maybe they can manage
without the bonus but I can't.

649
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:01,728
My wife and I were counting on it.
You can't ask this of me.

650
01:00:06,558 --> 01:00:10,520
I didn't decide you'd lose your bonus
if I kept my job.

651
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:12,069
Neither did I.

652
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:14,653
Put yourself in my shoes.

653
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,157
Well...

654
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,533
Goodbye.

655
01:00:36,044 --> 01:00:37,716
Can I be frank?

656
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,972
Yes.

657
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,683
Dumont saw sixteen can do the job.
Why would he take you back?

658
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:51,894
With sixteen, Juliette told me

659
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:55,406
you have to do
three hours overtime a week.

660
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,106
What if we do it to earn more?

661
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:01,986
I don't know.

662
01:01:03,236 --> 01:01:05,075
Dumont told me

663
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:09,202
that if the majority
wanted me to stay Monday, I'd stay.

664
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,291
Good for you.

665
01:01:14,455 --> 01:01:15,582
See you Monday.

666
01:01:50,822 --> 01:01:52,661
Why are we back here?

667
01:01:52,782 --> 01:01:56,744
Maybe she hasn't called
because you gave her a wrong number.

668
01:01:56,869 --> 01:01:59,550
It's no use.
I don't want to see anyone else.

669
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,426
I want to go home.

670
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,673
I'll see the others tomorrow.

671
01:02:05,794 --> 01:02:06,838
Let's go.

672
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:11,888
Sandra, listen to me...

673
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,890
Julien's got to you.

674
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:18,189
The boss never said he'd pay overtime
rather than have you back.

675
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:21,520
He can't know.
He said it to discourage you.

676
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:23,571
To stop you seeing the others.

677
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,071
He's just afraid of losing his bonus.

678
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:31,244
Don't fall for it.
If she agrees, you only need two more.

679
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,747
You'll have seven.

680
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:34,702
That's nearly half.

681
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,911
You're not the one who has to go.

682
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:44,123
I can come with you if you want.

683
01:02:50,419 --> 01:02:51,511
That's the third.

684
01:02:51,629 --> 01:02:53,052
I need it!

685
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:17,908
I'm still talking to my husband.
He doesn't agree.

686
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,116
That's all right.

687
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:21,870
I understand, don't worry.

688
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,749
Anne!

689
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:23,625
Goodbye.

690
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,210
I'm trying to delay payment...

691
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:29,045
Forget it.
I shouldn't have come back.

692
01:03:29,164 --> 01:03:31,548
- What's going on?
- I'm talking to Sandra!

693
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:33,671
You enjoy pissing people off?

694
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:34,967
Get inside.

695
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:38,257
- Get inside!
- Cut it out!

696
01:03:49,182 --> 01:03:50,356
Are you ok?

697
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:54,741
Let's go home.

698
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:58,072
You're sure?

699
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:01,904
I'm not pissing anyone else off.

700
01:04:03,904 --> 01:04:06,704
Jean-Marc's right.
I'm not up to it anymore.

701
01:04:08,575 --> 01:04:09,868
Don't say that.

702
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:21,969
Your phone...

703
01:04:44,776 --> 01:04:45,784
Hello?

704
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,702
What are you doing?

705
01:04:52,616 --> 01:04:54,289
Yes, she's just next to me.

706
01:04:56,578 --> 01:04:58,002
It's Maxime.

707
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:09,216
That's good.

708
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:14,808
Dad will tell you.
He'll fetch you this evening.

709
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:20,188
Kiss your sister for me.
No, put her on.

710
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,154
How's it going?

711
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:35,538
I just wanted to give you a kiss
and say Dad will fetch you.

712
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:48,811
Juliette wants to talk to you.

713
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:53,774
I'm going to get sandwiches
for the kids' picnic tomorrow.

714
01:06:53,896 --> 01:06:55,403
Won't you call her'?

715
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:11,831
I'm resting.

716
01:10:11,955 --> 01:10:13,711
Just come down a second.

717
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,878
- Why?
- Come down, you'll see.

718
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:29,899
I've come to say
I'll vote for you on Monday.

719
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,023
Thank you.

720
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,452
That's seven.
Two more and you've made it.

721
01:10:53,077 --> 01:10:55,711
I just took the whole box of Xanax.

722
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:57,539
All your pills?

723
01:10:57,665 --> 01:10:58,673
Yes.

724
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,505
Call an ambulance! Quick!

725
01:11:03,879 --> 01:11:06,429
The address is number 16?

726
01:11:10,009 --> 01:11:11,183
Hold on...

727
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:23,241
Does my husband know
I'm back down here?

728
01:11:23,355 --> 01:11:26,487
He's in the waiting room.
I'll tell him.

729
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:27,950
Thank you.

730
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:31,666
Can I eat something?

731
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,121
Yes, are you hungry?

732
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:34,034
Very.

733
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:36,541
I'll have a meal tray sent in.

734
01:11:36,701 --> 01:11:39,002
Carrot soup
and cheese on toast tonight.

735
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,167
That would be kind. Thank you.

736
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:45,673
I'll leave the IV another half-hour.
See you later.

737
01:12:18,824 --> 01:12:20,663
Forgive me.

738
01:12:35,506 --> 01:12:38,804
Good evening.
You asked for a meal?

739
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:40,393
Yes.

740
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,774
I'll put it here.

741
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:46,105
Thank you.

742
01:12:50,186 --> 01:12:51,397
You're hungry?

743
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:55,035
Yes, I'd like the soup.

744
01:13:00,237 --> 01:13:01,530
Thank you.

745
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:10,669
I want to call the kids
but there's no signal.

746
01:13:10,789 --> 01:13:14,217
I already did.
I told them I'd be a bit late.

747
01:13:18,546 --> 01:13:20,765
How about Anne? Did she go home?

748
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:23,895
No, she's in the waiting room.

749
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:32,404
We'll see the last three this evening.

750
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:35,948
You feel up to it?

751
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:39,577
Yes. And you?

752
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,746
We'll drive you home first

753
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:52,287
No need. Drop me at Place Kubom.

754
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,834
No, at home.

755
01:13:53,954 --> 01:13:57,465
I'm not going home.
I've decided to leave my husband.

756
01:14:00,126 --> 01:14:02,096
- You're sure?
- Yes.

757
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:06,434
I've never decided anything
for myself before.

758
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:10,430
You can sleep at our place.

759
01:14:11,554 --> 01:14:13,689
That would be a big help tonight.

760
01:14:14,223 --> 01:14:15,314
Thank you.

761
01:14:57,221 --> 01:14:58,395
Hi.

762
01:15:00,474 --> 01:15:02,645
Sorry to come round so late.

763
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:06,441
It can wait until tomorrow.

764
01:15:06,563 --> 01:15:07,607
It's ok.

765
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:12,159
Yvon told me you'd be coming.

766
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:17,491
He's willing to lose his bonus
but I'm the only breadwinner here.

767
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:21,788
I'd love to help
but I can't make ends meet.

768
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:25,048
Sorry, that's how it is.

769
01:15:27,374 --> 01:15:30,755
I'm sorry you'll lose the bonus
if I stay

770
01:15:31,086 --> 01:15:32,758
but it was Dumont who...

771
01:15:32,879 --> 01:15:36,557
You're right to fight to stay.
I should help you.

772
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,849
It'll be a disaster for me
if the majority backs you

773
01:15:42,013 --> 01:15:44,730
but I hope for your sake they do.
Sorry.

774
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,668
After seven years,
it's tough for me too.

775
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:04,373
Excuse me...

776
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,047
Maybe we should drive you home.

777
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:19,309
No, it's tough because we just moved in
and wanted to have a baby...

778
01:16:19,423 --> 01:16:21,475
But it's better this way.

779
01:16:22,008 --> 01:16:25,852
Don't feel obliged.
I'd understand if you changed your mind.

780
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,102
I don't feel obliged.
I'm happy to support you.

781
01:16:29,599 --> 01:16:33,609
You thanked me for coming.
Thanks for coming to my place too.

782
01:16:36,063 --> 01:16:39,076
A little music? Time to rock.

783
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:41,196
- You like rock music?
- I love it.

784
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:42,654
So do we.

785
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:27,924
Good evening.

786
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:30,628
Could I have a word with Alphonse?

787
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:33,467
Someone for Alphonse!

788
01:18:39,053 --> 01:18:40,643
Sorry to disturb you.

789
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:41,640
That's ok.

790
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:45,311
I'm Sandra, I work with Alphonse.
I'd like to talk to him.

791
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:48,489
He's not here.
He's at the laundrette.

792
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:50,074
Can I take her there?

793
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:52,158
Yes, but come straight back.

794
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,695
Thank you. Good night.

795
01:19:19,966 --> 01:19:23,513
Alphonse, the sheet's stuck.

796
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:25,680
Hold on...

797
01:19:29,475 --> 01:19:30,981
Fold it.

798
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:44,498
You know,
I'd like to vote for you tomorrow.

799
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,249
It's what God tells me to do.

800
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,952
I have to help my neighbour.

801
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,463
But I'm scared of the others.

802
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:54,421
Scared of who?

803
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,046
The other workers.

804
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:01,300
That's why I didn't vote for you Friday.
It wasn't for the bonus.

805
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:04,767
I haven't been there long.
I'll only get 150 euros.

806
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,603
Jean-Marc spoke to you?

807
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,147
- Yes.
- I'm going!

808
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:10,854
See you later.

809
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,264
Goodbye.

810
01:20:13,432 --> 01:20:15,105
What did he say?

811
01:20:17,061 --> 01:20:21,901
If I wanted to get on with the others,
I should vote for the bonus

812
01:20:22,024 --> 01:20:24,408
because nearly everyone wanted it.

813
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:27,700
I wanted to vote for you
but I didn't dare.

814
01:20:29,405 --> 01:20:31,208
Sorry, that's my machine.

815
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:35,501
It'll be different tomorrow.
It's a secret ballot. No one will know.

816
01:20:38,664 --> 01:20:40,965
How many will vote for you?

817
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:44,427
If you vote for me, eight.

818
01:20:44,545 --> 01:20:48,507
Maybe nine with Charly.
I haven't seen him. He wasn't home.

819
01:21:00,893 --> 01:21:02,613
I'll vote for you.

820
01:21:06,482 --> 01:21:08,119
Thank you so much.

821
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:13,539
See you tomorrow.

822
01:21:24,332 --> 01:21:27,511
Without my vote,
you won't have a majority?

823
01:21:29,003 --> 01:21:30,213
Yes.

824
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:37,806
Jean-Marc will say you won
because of my vote.

825
01:21:38,178 --> 01:21:39,269
He won't know.

826
01:21:39,387 --> 01:21:41,024
He'll know.

827
01:21:41,306 --> 01:21:44,023
He'll ask the others, he'll ask me.

828
01:21:44,309 --> 01:21:48,021
Don't be afraid.
Half will have voted like you.

829
01:21:48,145 --> 01:21:51,360
But I'm on a fixed-term contract,
like Jerome.

830
01:21:52,024 --> 01:21:54,788
It's due for renewal
at the end of September.

831
01:21:54,985 --> 01:21:58,579
If Jean-Marc puts in a bad report
about my welding mistakes,

832
01:21:58,697 --> 01:22:01,081
my contract won't be renewed.

833
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,424
You're like me.
You're scared of Jean-Marc.

834
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:09,840
Yes.

835
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:30,362
Bye, kids. Bye, Manu.

836
01:22:30,477 --> 01:22:31,568
See you.

837
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,278
Have a good day.

838
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:34,737
You too, Mum.

839
01:22:38,776 --> 01:22:41,575
Chin up.
Call me as soon as you know.

840
01:23:05,259 --> 01:23:07,845
Seven agree not to take the bonus.

841
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:10,354
One's hesitating and there's you.

842
01:23:11,014 --> 01:23:12,272
I don't know.

843
01:23:12,766 --> 01:23:13,727
I'll see.

844
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,986
I need it but I'll see.

845
01:23:16,144 --> 01:23:19,358
1,000 euros is a lot
but I'll be losing my job.

846
01:23:19,814 --> 01:23:21,107
It's not my fault if...

847
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:23,202
We said Jean-Marc
wouldn't be here!

848
01:23:23,317 --> 01:23:25,239
- What about her?
- She's leaving.

849
01:23:25,361 --> 01:23:27,615
- I'll only vole if he stays.
- Me loo.

850
01:23:27,738 --> 01:23:29,209
Robert, I'm going.

851
01:23:29,323 --> 01:23:30,367
No, stay.

852
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:32,293
She needed to see Charly.

853
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:35,374
Being here,
she might influence the vote too.

854
01:23:35,495 --> 01:23:37,251
So Jean-Marc can stay.

855
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:40,172
We can't be free
with our boss around.

856
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:43,174
Yeah, you and that bitch
can't bullshit us!

857
01:23:43,294 --> 01:23:45,216
- Be polite!
- Shut your mouth!

858
01:23:47,632 --> 01:23:48,426
Calm down!

859
01:23:48,549 --> 01:23:50,435
Calm down, please!

860
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:56,645
I'll go out with Sandra
and no one will influence the vole.

861
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,486
How's this going to work?

862
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,893
I have the box.

863
01:24:05,065 --> 01:24:06,571
16 pieces of paper...

864
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:13,749
marked "Sandra or Bonus".
Circle one and put it in the box.

865
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,708
I suggest Julien does the count with me.

866
01:24:16,826 --> 01:24:18,036
That suits me.

867
01:24:18,494 --> 01:24:19,882
Does everyone agree?

868
01:24:31,548 --> 01:24:33,849
Happy now you've stirred up the shit?

869
01:24:37,053 --> 01:24:39,770
Friday's ballot was enough.

870
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:47,357
You shouldn't have scared them
so they'd vote against me.

871
01:24:47,563 --> 01:24:49,034
What are you implying?

872
01:24:52,651 --> 01:24:56,826
You told some of them
if I wasn't laid off, they would be.

873
01:24:56,946 --> 01:24:58,453
I never said that.

874
01:24:59,532 --> 01:25:01,039
You did.

875
01:25:02,493 --> 01:25:07,666
And you called them this weekend
to tell them not to change their minds.

876
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:09,047
What?

877
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,466
Who told you that?

878
01:25:12,711 --> 01:25:13,921
It doesn't matter.

879
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:17,768
You're heartless.

880
01:26:22,067 --> 01:26:24,155
Eight for, eight against

881
01:26:24,695 --> 01:26:26,166
You're one short.

882
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:37,041
I'll come round after work.

883
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:43,718
Those who voted for you
are in the cafeteria.

884
01:27:06,442 --> 01:27:08,328
Thank you for your support.

885
01:27:10,404 --> 01:27:12,076
I'll never forget it.

886
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:39,190
If you want to stay with us tonight,
you can.

887
01:27:39,306 --> 01:27:40,480
Thanks.

888
01:27:46,146 --> 01:27:47,652
Goodbye.

889
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:51,069
- I'll empty my locker.
- I'll help.

890
01:27:51,192 --> 01:27:53,161
It's ok. Get to work now.

891
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:54,873
See you later.

892
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:32,236
<i>Mrs Bya?</i>

893
01:28:32,981 --> 01:28:33,775
Yes?

894
01:28:33,898 --> 01:28:35,950
Mr Dumont would like to see you.

895
01:28:36,943 --> 01:28:38,070
Just a second.

896
01:29:10,724 --> 01:29:12,729
- Yes?
- Mrs Bya.

897
01:29:13,393 --> 01:29:14,865
Come in, Mrs Bya.

898
01:29:15,228 --> 01:29:16,106
Hello.

899
01:29:16,897 --> 01:29:18,984
Please have a seat.

900
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:22,287
Christiane,
ask them to explain these figures.

901
01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,790
What if they ask for you?

902
01:29:23,903 --> 01:29:26,204
I'll be free in 10 minutes or so.

903
01:29:29,575 --> 01:29:30,916
Sit down.

904
01:29:31,744 --> 01:29:33,297
No, over here.

905
01:29:35,706 --> 01:29:40,380
You convinced half the staff
to give up the bonus. Well done.

906
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:43,969
Of course, half isn't the majority

907
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:46,769
but to dispel any ill-will
among the staff,

908
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:50,311
I've decided to give them the bonus
and take you back.

909
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:54,892
I can't rehire you right away.
During your sick leave,

910
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:59,026
Jean-Marc and I saw the work
could be done by 16 instead of 17.

911
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:04,572
In September, I won't renew a fixed-term
contract and you can come back.

912
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,945
For now, you'll be temporarily laid off.

913
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,413
There.

914
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:16,379
That's my good news.
You're staying with us.

915
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:21,508
I can't let someone be laid off
so I can come back.

916
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:25,586
He won't be laid off.
His contract just won't be renewed.

917
01:30:25,919 --> 01:30:28,220
- It's the same thing.
- It isn't.

918
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:35,856
Goodbye, Mr Dumont.

919
01:30:47,356 --> 01:30:49,195
Yes, it's going to be tough.

920
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:52,446
I'll start looking today.

921
01:30:57,449 --> 01:30:58,920
At midday?

922
01:31:02,495 --> 01:31:04,298
Yes, me too.

923
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:06,504
See you later.

924
01:31:08,084 --> 01:31:09,175
Manu!

925
01:31:10,002 --> 01:31:11,046
Are you there?

926
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:14,011
We put up a good fight.

927
01:31:15,507 --> 01:31:16,978
I'm happy-

928
01:31:20,679 --> 01:31:21,936
Me too.
