1
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:18,173
Well, my lad,
they tell me you want to confess.

2
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,342
Yeah.

3
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,476
That will help the jury.

4
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:25,182
They convicted you on circumstantial
evidence. Understand?

5
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,689
Yeah, sure.

6
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,119
Public opinion. Clear that up, too.

7
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,595
Justice itself will feel easier.

8
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:35,296
I'm doing it because I'm scared.

9
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,933
It may help the big rap
when I go through that last door.

10
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,800
You might as well do a real job.

11
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,897
I have a couple of newspapermen here,
and the judge who sentenced you...

12
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:46,273
Shut that up, will you?
Can't you stop that singing?

13
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,174
Now, now. It's his turn next.

14
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,583
You confess, he sings.

15
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:55,748
Okay.

16
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:58,455
- Bring on your gang.
- Good.

17
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:00,855
- Can I do anything for you, Dan?
- Yeah, how about a drink?

18
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,052
Okay.

19
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,426
Thanks.

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,768
- Do you want to see Father Flanagan?
- Sure.

21
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,078
I asked for him. He knew me when.

22
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,163
How much time have I got?

23
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:42,689
Eternity begins in 45 minutes, Dan.

24
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,799
What happens when that door
slams shut behind you?

25
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:49,636
- A bad minute or two.
- Yeah, I know. After that?

26
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,404
Dan, that's been a mystery
for a million years.

27
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:55,571
You can't expect to crack that
in a few seconds.

28
00:03:57,182 --> 00:03:59,514
- Would you be afraid to die?
- No.

29
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,819
Why not, if you don't know what happens?

30
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,947
Well, I've made mistakes, Dan,
but I've always been sorry for them.

31
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,355
I try to make up for them.

32
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,223
If you killed a rat,
and it was coming to him...

33
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:12,490
could you find some way
to be sorry for that?

34
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:16,895
Dan, life and death should be left
to the Creator of life and death.

35
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,701
Please stay, will you?

36
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:28,339
How are you, Judge?

37
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:32,144
This is Lane Wellington. His column fought
for you. Didn't think you were guilty.

38
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,684
Sorry to let you down, pal.

39
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,312
If you'd stuck to your guns,
I'd have kept you alive for years.

40
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,356
I wouldn't try to be funny, if I were you.

41
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:40,721
This man wants to admit
his debt to the State.

42
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,454
What's that? My debt to the State?

43
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,964
If you'd have done this sooner,
the debt wouldn't be so big.

44
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:48,863
Is that what this is all about?

45
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:52,495
You're going to take my life,
because I owe the State something?

46
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,506
When I was a kid, 12 years old,
my mother died.

47
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,668
Did I go on the cuff to the State
for the gutters I slept in? Is that it?

48
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,644
That's just sniveling. The State reached
its arms out for three years...

49
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,203
Yeah, in the reformatory.

50
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,215
When I went in,
copping a loaf of bread was a job.

51
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:08,184
- When I come out, I could rob a bank!
- Holy cats!

52
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,881
Get this, big shots.
I'm going out that way in a few minutes.

53
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:13,186
So you're getting the lowdown.

54
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:17,088
Where was the State when a Ionely,
starving kid cried himself to sleep...

55
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,689
in a flophouse with a bunch of drunks,
tramps, and hoboes?

56
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,756
Is that when this debt started?

57
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,132
The only pals I had a chance at
were the kids in the alley.

58
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,637
I had to be tough to string along.

59
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:30,140
Just before we got out
of the State's arms...

60
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,735
the reformatory, we made up a gang,
six of us, and pals.

61
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:37,240
We bet our lives across the board,
and let them ride. Crooks!

62
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,840
Sure! Your mouths pop open at that one.

63
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,943
Greek to you wise guys, ain't it?

64
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,582
One of them turned rat for State's
evidence, and I killed him. But get this.

65
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,394
One friend when I'm 12 years old...

66
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:53,863
and I don't stand here like this!
Now, go on, get out of here...

67
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:56,730
you bunch of mush-brained saps! Get out!

68
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:08,470
Listen, Father. I am sorry for my mistakes.

69
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:10,778
I am sorry.

70
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:20,055
<i>12 years old. One friend.</i>

71
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,492
<i>Starving kid. Never had a chance.</i>

72
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,222
<i>Reformatory.</i>

73
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,099
Break your mugs.

74
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:38,374
Steal our food, will you?
Get in your own streets, you mugs!

75
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,604
Here. Tommy, stop it.

76
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:44,512
Come on, Tommy. Stop it.

77
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,377
Tommy, stop it!

78
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:52,514
Skinny!

79
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,795
Loafers! Police!

80
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,545
- Good morning, Dave.
- Good morning.

81
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:20,516
- Look, $80 smashed.
- It's a shame, Dave.

82
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:23,713
Father Eddie, that place of yours
draws the rats around.

83
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,757
- It's like molasses and flies.
- I suppose it does.

84
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:31,228
I sleep beside a machine gun,
while you rock-a-bye-baby the 40 thieves.

85
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,261
Read all about it!

86
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,791
Dan Farrow electrocuted!
Read all about it!

87
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,204
Where's His Reverend?
Don't we get a sermon this morning?

88
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,675
Hear ye, my friends.

89
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:51,213
Scoff your coffee while ye may,
turn up your toes...

90
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,907
call it a day.

91
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:00,418
I didn't start this place
to give you men a laugh. I really didn't.

92
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:01,857
I thought I could help you.

93
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,952
- Sorry, Father Flanagan.
- We apologize.

94
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,525
Thanks for the coffee.

95
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,998
We all love you, dominie, every one of us.

96
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,898
Well, you can pass the word
along the road...

97
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:13,904
that somebody else will be running
the place pretty shortly. I'm leaving.

98
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,837
- But, Father...
- Weasel, you're too smart.

99
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I had decided before.

100
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:23,810
I spent last night, or rather this morning,
with Dan Farrow just before he<i>...</i>

101
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,050
It was too late to do very much for him...

102
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:29,814
and I guess it's too late
to do very much for you.

103
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,119
I'm afraid you're satisfied with something
to eat and a place to sleep.

104
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,419
Father Flanagan!

105
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,221
- What is it, Skinny?
- They got Jimmy!

106
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,888
The cops got Jimmy!
Please tell them to let him go.

107
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,396
He's my brother.

108
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:43,025
- Who else have they got?
- They got Tommy and they got Steve.

109
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,728
And they told me to go home.

110
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,468
Yeah, home.

111
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,066
Where's your mother, Skinny?

112
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,344
Come on. We'll see what we can do.

113
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:57,010
Mr. Morris, do you know
who broke your window?

114
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:59,380
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Pardon me, but does it really matter?

115
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,749
It was a free-for-all.
Any one of them could have done it.

116
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,844
What do you mean, Father?

117
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:06,618
Not to obstruct justice, even if I could,
but one boy threw that stone...

118
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,387
did this special damage.
But he didn't mean to do it.

119
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,622
They were all throwing things.
They were all excited.

120
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,459
I'm trying to reduce it to a definite charge.

121
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,964
That's what I was afraid of, Your Honor.

122
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,467
- None of us want to abuse children.
- But we do, nevertheless.

123
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,527
The business of the court is to take care
of the honest citizen.

124
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,073
You. I have a high regard for you, but...

125
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:25,041
Your Honor, these boys were arrested
this morning.

126
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,907
It's now<i>...</i> It's 3:30.

127
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,347
Has anybody come forward
to say one good word for them?

128
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,043
Father, mother, uncle, sister. Anybody?

129
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,051
Well, you're saying quite a few.

130
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,612
And I'll go on, until you take back
the privilege you granted me.

131
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,180
You heard Mr. Calatieri.

132
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:41,691
- May I question him?
- Certainly.

133
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,522
- Sit down, Mr. Morris.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,085
Mr. Calatieri.

135
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:47,226
Yes, Father?

136
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,157
Tommy, stand up.

137
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,698
- Tommy came in to buy some salami.
- Yes.

138
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,337
I wrap my salami. I put him down.
He say, "Half a dozen eggs."

139
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:02,611
I turn around to get the eggs,
I come back, where is my salami?

140
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:05,082
No salami and no Tommy.

141
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,379
But you didn't really see Tommy
steal the salami, did you?

142
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,782
My nice, fresh salami. She no walk away.

143
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:15,849
And the police found the salami,
and some bread, some other things.

144
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,588
There's no doubt about their being stolen.

145
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:20,631
There's also no doubt that these boys
should be taken off the streets...

146
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:23,826
- for their own good.
- And sent to the reformatory.

147
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,431
I'm wondering if you want to do that
to a homeless boy...

148
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,474
- just on circumstantial evidence.
- Well, what do you want me to do?

149
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,477
There's the salami,
and there's Mr. Calatieri.

150
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,980
They can have my salami.
I give it to them, free for present.

151
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:43,051
But next time, please, not the imported.

152
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:47,219
- There won't be any next time.
- You should have studied law, Father.

153
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,886
Thank you, Your Honor.
Well, I guess that's<i>...</i>

154
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,522
Unless my good friend wants to identify
the boy who threw the rock.

155
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:58,194
My window was smashed.
$80 gone to someplace<i>...</i>

156
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,634
But I<i>...</i>

157
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,999
Well, I can't say who did it, positively.

158
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,310
Father Flanagan, what's in your mind?

159
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll assume full responsibility for these
boys if you'll place them in my charge.

160
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,484
I'll give them a home,
I'll see to their schooling...

161
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:17,180
and I'll guarantee their good conduct.

162
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:26,620
Well, I think you're letting yourself in
for a lot of trouble, but I'll give it a chance.

163
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,723
I release these boys into your custody.

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,000
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- And good luck to you.

165
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,060
Thank you. Come on, boys.

166
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:37,035
You're one of the finest fellows in town.

167
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,202
Why in the name of all that's holy
don't you want to meet nice people?

168
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,212
- Well, Dave, I know you.
- You<i>...</i>

169
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,948
- Father, do you want this?
- What is it, son?

170
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:48,474
It's a puzzle. You have to jiggle it around
till you get the eyes in the sockets.

171
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:50,180
Isn't that wonderful.

172
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:54,055
Thank you very much, Skinny.
I'll have a lot of fun with this.

173
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,649
Dave. Come on, boys.

174
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:58,719
Could you take the boys to your place
and keep them there a little while?

175
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,127
Sure. What?

176
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:01,793
I've got an important call to make.

177
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,458
All right, gentlemen, get in.

178
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,195
Oh, boy. A car ride.

179
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,732
Tommy, you better sit up here
in the front seat.

180
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,740
On second thought, you better all sit up
in the front seat. I feel safer.

181
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:18,645
Hold on, boys. Be careful.

182
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:21,879
- Dave, I'll see you a little later.
- Could you make it a little sooner?

183
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,478
Do you want me to drive, Mr. Morris?

184
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,719
I gave you permission three years ago
for your refuge.

185
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:32,456
You thought you could do a lot of good.

186
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,465
Well, I have the right to a mistake or two,
haven't I, Bishop?

187
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:38,195
And now you want to do something
I think is harder to do...

188
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,897
- certainly more unorthodox.
- That's true.

189
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,702
So I'm going to assign you to a parish.

190
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,244
That's good work, and you're a good man.

191
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:50,372
- Don't make the decision yet, please.
- Why not?

192
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:54,340
Why, you'd dream the best part
of your life away, if I'd let you.

193
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,216
But I'm not dreaming.

194
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,754
There's one thing I know, I really know.

195
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:02,884
And that is, that there's no such thing
in the world as a bad boy. I'm sure of that.

196
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,588
Do you realize the fight
you want to take on?

197
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,860
I know that a mother can take a whip
to the toughest boy in the world...

198
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:12,391
and he forgets it,
because he knows that she loves him.

199
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:17,374
I know the fight, and I haven't anything
to do it with, except faith.

200
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:19,768
But...

201
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,543
with your kind permission,
I would rather have it than the parish.

202
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,241
I can't help you.

203
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,649
We have no arrangement
for outside things like this.

204
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:35,421
But you have my permission.

205
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,290
How are you beginning?

206
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,523
First, I must rent a house.

207
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:42,029
No doubt, fumigate and launder it.

208
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,468
Bishop, I shall never forget this.

209
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:48,700
My blessing.

210
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,570
Hello. I thought you got lost.

211
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:57,443
No. I had a little chat with my bishop.

212
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:59,107
I rented a house.

213
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,583
- You're renting houses now?
- Yes.

214
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:05,611
Of course, I have to pay something down,
so I need a little money.

215
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,124
- A little money? Yeah.
- $100.

216
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,088
$100?

217
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:14,490
What security have you got?

218
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,329
Well, let's see here.

219
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,475
- You want $100 for this?
- Yes.

220
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,374
Look...

221
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,750
you can have any one of those
for 65 cents.

222
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,583
And any one of them is better than yours.

223
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,356
And you want $100.

224
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,222
I need the money very badly.

225
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:45,854
With merchandise like that,
I need it worse than you do.

226
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:48,629
Got anything else?

227
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,091
Wait a minute.

228
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:05,381
- That's a 10-cent toy.
- Yeah, you can have a lot of fun with it.

229
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,976
Not a $100 worth, I can't.

230
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,677
Have you got any other security?

231
00:15:12,457 --> 00:15:17,087
Every boy who becomes a good American
citizen is worth $10,000 to the State.

232
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,421
That's a fact. I have good authority for it.

233
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,389
I'm sorry,
but $100 for a bum watch like this...

234
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:25,493
and a hunk of tin
with a couple of ball bearings<i>...</i>

235
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,596
All right, Dave.
I don't blame you for turning me down.

236
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,904
Thanks just the same.
I'll try someplace else.

237
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,500
Wait a minute.

238
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:41,781
Couldn't you make a good American
for $50?

239
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,591
All right, there's your $100.

240
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,088
No. You keep the watch.

241
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,329
I'll keep this.

242
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,163
- I'll redeem that some day with interest.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,835
Here, sign this.

244
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,034
- No, don't sign it.
- Thanks.

245
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:11,410
Now, you'd better leave
before I change my mind.

246
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,276
I'm not afraid of that, Dave.

247
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,946
Now, I wonder if you could show me
some furniture.

248
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:21,116
You know, chairs and tables,
and stuff like that.

249
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,082
$100 worth?

250
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,890
I got a little list here that I made out.

251
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,058
There.

252
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,091
All right.

253
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:34,103
I suppose when your boys grow up,
they'll break bigger and better windows.

254
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,570
I'll be right with you, boys.

255
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,801
Certainly on their good behavior,
aren't they?

256
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,502
Ten chairs.

257
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,143
There's two.

258
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:47,946
- What does the whole thing come to?
- $220.

259
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,280
I'll give you $150 for the lot.

260
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:52,652
It's a deal, for $200.

261
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:55,992
Right. $160. Not a cent more.

262
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,061
Why, it cost me almost that much.

263
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,790
- Make it $190.
- No.

264
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:02,259
Say, wait a minute. What am I doing?

265
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,166
I'm bargaining with my own money.
I'm losing two ways on the deal.

266
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,669
Here's $50 down payment.

267
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,967
You're offering me $50 of my own money...

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,736
as down payment
on my own furniture. No!

269
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,809
Oh, well. All right.

270
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,903
What's the use of my taking the $50?

271
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,107
You'd only come around for it
again tomorrow.

272
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,945
Here's the address.

273
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:22,975
You mind if I throw you out?

274
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:27,855
Look, tonight, just before you go to sleep,
you're going to like yourself a lot.

275
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,786
I'll send the furniture over.

276
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:33,022
Then I'm going to a doctor
and get my head examined.

277
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:35,463
Come on, boys. We're going home.

278
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,401
- Father Flanagan?
- Yes.

279
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:45,464
I'm from the <i>Morning Herald.</i>

280
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:48,341
My editor, Mr. Hargraves, sent me over
to see what you're doing, and...

281
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:52,246
Well, right now, we're putting up
a little sign that Tommy made.

282
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,876
- We thought we might get some pictures.
- Some pictures?

283
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,750
Hey, fellows, come on.
We're going to get our pictures took.

284
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,255
Bring Father Flanagan's coat.

285
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:01,814
- All right, sure!
- Oh, boy!

286
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,053
- Hotdog!
- Take it easy, please.

287
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:05,951
Here.

288
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,933
Let's get rid of the rock.
Here, hold the rock. Hold it, don't throw it.

289
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,364
Come right in here close. That's right.

290
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,235
- Put the rock behind your back.
- Big smile now.

291
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,706
- Okay, Jimmy?
- Okay.

292
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,037
- All right, hold it.
- Big smile.

293
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,270
Still.

294
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:07,118
Here he comes!

295
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:09,625
Hey, wait a minute, fellows.
You know what we planned.

296
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:12,288
Come on, get in your places.
Come on, we gotta sing. Come on.

297
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,186
Get in line.

298
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,289
Now, altogether...

299
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,996
<i>Silent night!</i>

300
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,632
<i>Holy night!</i>

301
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:27,240
<i>All is calm</i>

302
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,606
<i>all is bright</i>

303
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,609
<i>Round yon Virgin</i>

304
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,848
<i>Mother and Child</i>

305
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:41,014
<i>Holy Infant</i>

306
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:44,619
<i>so tender and mild</i>

307
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:50,033
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

308
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:56,362
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

309
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,340
<i>Silent night!</i>

310
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,980
<i>Holy night!</i>

311
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:15,486
That was a very nice reception, boys.
Thank you very much.

312
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,794
Tommy, would you take that out
in the kitchen?

313
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,125
What is it?

314
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:23,166
It's good food.
And there's enough there for all of us, too.

315
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:24,701
- What is it?
- What's in it?

316
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:29,464
It's good cornmeal mush,
not a tummy ache in a carload.

317
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,973
What else you got in the bag?

318
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,808
Well, I don't know, exactly.

319
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:43,820
I kind of picked these things up
hither and yon.

320
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,651
Once I got a sleigh.

321
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,222
Shut up.

322
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,818
I thought you said if we were good,
everybody would help us.

323
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:54,764
Well, I did say that, Skinny. I<i>...</i> But<i>...</i>

324
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,960
Well, maybe it'll take another Christmas
to make friends for us.

325
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:01,994
Gosh, if we was in a reform school,
it ain't mush for Christmas.

326
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:05,405
Tommy, are we going to forget
what we're trying to do?

327
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:08,910
Gee, if I was home,
my old man might wallop me...

328
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,379
but we'd have turkey at Christmas.

329
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:15,114
Well, Christmas has other meanings,
hasn't it, Bob?

330
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:18,553
Listen, I can get a turkey easy.
It's a cinch. Everybody's busy.

331
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:19,748
Bob!

332
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,952
You should get down on your knees
and ask pardon...

333
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,725
for a thought like that on Christmas Eve.

334
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:35,228
<i>Jingle bells, Jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

335
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:36,864
Mr. Morris!

336
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:42,944
- Merry Christmas, Tommy!
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Morris!

337
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:48,175
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, everybody!

338
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:52,279
- Turkey and presents for everybody.
- Merry Christmas.

339
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:56,592
Am I late?

340
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,857
If ever in the world a man was on time.

341
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,994
Now, everybody sing.

342
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:06,663
<i>Jingle bells, Jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

343
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:10,173
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one horse open sleigh</i>

344
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,560
- Thank you, Father.
- Hello, Dave.

345
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:35,963
Hello, I came over as soon as I could.

346
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,124
What's up?

347
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,396
Now, let's get out of here, Dave.
It's pretty noisy.

348
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,633
Several new boys came in last week.
We're suffocating here.

349
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,697
Now, look, Eddie, just what do you want?

350
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,743
Dave, it's grand to see you.

351
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,540
You certainly have had a wonderful year,
haven't you?

352
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:51,274
It's been a wonderful year for both of us.

353
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:54,283
- Did you pay all your bills last month?
- Yes, sure. Most of them.

354
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,376
Skinny, what did I tell you
about biting your nails?

355
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:59,217
A few little odds and ends,
but I'll get the money for that.

356
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,279
That's what I was afraid of.

357
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:02,291
No, Dave,
that isn't why I wanted to see you.

358
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,487
No, I want you to take me for a little drive.
I want to show you something.

359
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:06,586
I'm a busy man.

360
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:08,996
That's just it, Dave.
Now, you've been working too hard...

361
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:12,763
with the new store and everything.
A little drive in the country will relax you.

362
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:15,804
Just what you need.
Just what we both need.

363
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,204
- Bye, Father Flanagan.
- Goodbye, boys.

364
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:20,470
Now remember what I told you.

365
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,700
Lovely country, isn't it?

366
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:47,396
Over 200 acres here of rich, fine soil.

367
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:49,166
You could really live and breathe out here.

368
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,434
- What about it?
- I want to buy it.

369
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:54,671
Now, look, Dave, I can get it cheap.
Just look at it, Dave.

370
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,540
We could build a real town
for the boys here.

371
00:23:57,614 --> 00:24:00,811
They could have gardens, dormitories,
gymnasiums, classrooms...

372
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:03,751
Mortgages, and bills, and debts!
Be reasonable.

373
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:06,915
First you started with five boys,
then it was 20, then it was 50.

374
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,822
With this place,
you'd be looking for 100 boys.

375
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:11,190
- 500.
- All right, 500. What?

376
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,860
How you going to get the money?
How you going to do it? It's crazy.

377
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,923
Well, maybe you're right.

378
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:22,695
- What did you say?
- Maybe you're right.

379
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,900
Eddie, don't you feel well?

380
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:29,078
Maybe it's just a dream
that I'll never see fulfilled.

381
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:33,074
It seems a shame though,
a lot of boys cheated out of the chance...

382
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,744
to live a nice, decent life out in the open,
where they belong.

383
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:37,047
Stop it.

384
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,549
- How many acres?
- Over 200.

385
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:41,454
But you can't handle
as big a thing as this...

386
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,390
without a lot of public support,
contributions.

387
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,394
I haven't been a bad risk so far, have I?

388
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:48,590
No, you've paid back everything.
How, I don't know. It isn't that.

389
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:50,826
But this time you're biting off
more than you can chew.

390
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,698
The newspapers aren't friendly to you,
as it is.

391
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,829
- What do you think they'll say about this?
- I know.

392
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:57,237
- What do you suggest?
- Hargraves.

393
00:24:57,307 --> 00:25:00,333
He owns the most powerful string
of newspapers in the Middle West.

394
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,174
And he's a tough nut to crack.

395
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:05,773
You get Hargraves behind you,
and maybe I can handle it.

396
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,111
That's fair, Dave.

397
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,411
All right, here you are. It's a bargain.

398
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:13,422
Nothing doing. Not till you get Hargraves.

399
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,491
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

400
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,722
- How do you do, Father?
- Good morning, Mr. Hargraves.

401
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:22,527
We haven't met before, but I know of you.

402
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,100
Well, that shortens preliminaries.

403
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,400
- Can I help you?
- Do you want to?

404
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:32,739
If you mean, do I indorse your work,
I don't, I'm sorry to say.

405
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,834
Well, that's all right.

406
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,936
But why do you go out of your way
to hurt me?

407
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:39,414
There's a feeling in official circles
that you're setting up a tacit criticism...

408
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,041
of things as they are.

409
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:44,383
There was the same feeling when Newton
suspected the law of gravitation.

410
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,686
There's also a feeling that the sooner
you're discouraged, the better.

411
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,055
For yourself, too.

412
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:53,256
- No one questions your intentions.
- But I'm paving the lower regions, huh?

413
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:57,956
Mr. Hargraves, I have 50 boys I've taken
from the slums and the streets.

414
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,629
Right now they're on their way
to becoming confident human beings.

415
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,467
I can do the same with 500.

416
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:04,734
Boys like that get their chances
in institutions.

417
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,332
You know better than that.

418
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,741
Do I, Father Flanagan?

419
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,803
You have a string of newspapers.
You get reports on human derelicts.

420
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,146
You know the percentage of boys
who survive institutions.

421
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:16,914
Surely you must know, you above all men.

422
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:20,445
And you have no right to hinder me
in helping children.

423
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,955
That's pretty stiff, Father.

424
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:25,085
What little I've done, I've done on nothing.

425
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:28,063
These boys, thieves some of them,
have gone without clothes...

426
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:30,930
they've even gone without food,
but not one of them has deserted.

427
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:34,767
Not one, because they know
what I'm trying to do to help them.

428
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:38,135
But there are some impossible
young beasts who have to be manacled.

429
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,675
Look at this.

430
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:44,406
"Eleven-year-old boy convicted.
Guilty of murder in the second degree.

431
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:47,746
"Jury renders verdict
after 35 minutes deliberation.

432
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:50,252
"Court will sentence him to life in prison."

433
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,289
A semi-equipped young savage
who's right where he ought to be.

434
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:54,756
You'll admit that, won't you?

435
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:57,589
This boy saw his mother
being brutally beaten by a drunken father.

436
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:59,356
So he took a gun and killed him.

437
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,593
Suppose a man kills because his wife's
been unfaithful: Temporary insanity.

438
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,931
But an 11-year-old: Just a savage.

439
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,402
What do you want of me?

440
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,132
I want your help for homeless boys.

441
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:11,936
I want you to let the world know
what I'm trying to do.

442
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,807
- No, I'm afraid I can't do that.
- Why not?

443
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:17,244
Because I don't believe in
what you're trying to do.

444
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:19,339
The very foundation is false.

445
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,611
"No such thing as a bad boy."

446
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:24,380
That's just a catch phrase,
sentimental nonsense.

447
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:27,821
Of course you know you're flying in
the face of the very best of public opinion.

448
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:29,620
I've seen you do that.
You lead public opinion.

449
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:30,887
On my convictions.

450
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,691
You want me to throw them
out the window.

451
00:27:33,797 --> 00:27:35,992
A whole lot of good people
feel just as I do...

452
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,193
and we're not un-Christian monsters.

453
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:42,500
Well, if I'm right, you're pretty close to it.
And so far, I've proven my case.

454
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:46,168
Mr. Hargraves, when you got into trouble
at 11 or 12 years of age...

455
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:49,838
you had your mother or you had your
father to put their arms around you...

456
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:52,143
to talk things over with.

457
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:54,446
Can you imagine the fright
and the Ioneliness of a boy...

458
00:27:54,518 --> 00:27:57,009
without that love and understanding?

459
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:58,777
This poor kid...

460
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,753
in prison for life.

461
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,789
I want a home for them,
where they can stay...

462
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,658
and where they can learn.

463
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:09,495
A town for boys...

464
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,794
governed by boys.

465
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:16,465
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

466
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:19,737
Your sincerity is worth a shot.

467
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,075
Father, I'm not going to fight a plan
as unselfish as yours.

468
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,080
But understand, when you fail...

469
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,016
I'll use you for a lesson in horse sense
to the world at large.

470
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,110
Fair enough.

471
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:42,616
There we are, Dave.

472
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,787
We've got three fine new buildings.
A grand beginning.

473
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:49,491
Yes, sir. And three fine mortgages
might make a grand finish.

474
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,864
- We've had mortgages before.
- Yes, little ones.

475
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:54,733
Look at the sweating you've done
to raise nickels, dimes, quarters...

476
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:56,067
penny contributions.

477
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:58,767
Now you've got to get dollars,
hundreds, thousands.

478
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:01,709
Wait a minute, Dave, wait a minute.
This doesn't have to be paid today.

479
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:03,302
- No, but the day will come.
- Dave.

480
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,940
Now, Eddie, I know.
I know you've always been in debt.

481
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:08,951
Debts up to your knees.
This time it's up to here.

482
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,247
It might not be as bad as that.

483
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,756
You've got to stop thinking from here,
and think from here a little bit.

484
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:16,793
Now, Eddie, come on.
Let's look at the figures, averages...

485
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,885
and see what we can set aside.

486
00:30:18,962 --> 00:30:21,453
Father, we'll have to go now
if you're going to make that train.

487
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,022
My goodness, I forgot all about it.
I'll be right with you, Paul.

488
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,932
Now where are you going?

489
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:29,366
A boy in the State Penitentiary
wants to see me. He's in for life.

490
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,805
Yes, and you're in for life, too.

491
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:36,543
Thank you.

492
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,215
- Goodbye, Mo.
- Goodbye, Father.

493
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,579
- Have a nice trip, Father.
- Thank you.

494
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,675
- Goodbye, boys.
- Bye, Father.

495
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,584
Pee Wee.

496
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:46,349
Are you going to be a good boy
while I'm away?

497
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:49,017
Can I get my candy when you're away?

498
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,786
Freddie, everyday Pee Wee gets
a piece of candy in my office...

499
00:30:52,863 --> 00:30:54,194
if he's a good boy.

500
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:58,261
Of course, if he isn't a good boy,
then he won't expect it.

501
00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:01,771
Because Pee Wee is an honorable man,
aren't you, Pee Wee?

502
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:04,869
- Goodbye, boys.
- Bye, Father.

503
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,644
- Nice trip.
- Bye, Father.

504
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:12,144
- Father Flanagan.
- Warden.

505
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,945
This is Joe Marsh.
He leaves for a federal prison today.

506
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:16,383
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi.

507
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:18,978
- I'm letting you use my office, Father.
- I appreciate that.

508
00:31:19,055 --> 00:31:20,818
The guard will let you know
when the time is up.

509
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:24,190
- Would you like them to stay?
- No, I don't think that's necessary.

510
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:25,751
See you later.

511
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:32,326
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner,
but I was up to my ears in work...

512
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:33,562
when your letter came.

513
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:36,333
Yeah. Nursemaid for a couple of hundred
kids ain't no cinch.

514
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:37,805
That's right, no cinch.

515
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:40,399
Look, I didn't want to see you
for none of them phony prayers.

516
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,570
Nothing like that.
I got something else on my mind.

517
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,079
All right, go ahead, shoot.

518
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:46,672
Get this, I ain't sorry for nothing.

519
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,983
Well, everybody has a right
to look at things in their own way.

520
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:54,046
You bet. I went my own way,
and I got to be headman, didn't I?

521
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:55,887
Guys took off their hats
when I told them to...

522
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:59,793
and there's plenty of them still scared
that maybe I might bust out of this joint.

523
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:03,299
Well, now, look, you didn't have me come
all the way from Boys Town...

524
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,766
just to lord it over me, did you?

525
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:08,128
What's on your mind?

526
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,797
I got a kid brother, Whitey.

527
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:13,036
I've been taking care of him
ever since my old lady died.

528
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:16,010
Well, he's batty about me.
You know, thinks I'm aces.

529
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,876
Wants to be number one, like me.

530
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:19,381
But he ain't got what it takes.

531
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:22,316
He'd turn out to be a five-and-ten mug.
That's where you come in.

532
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,785
- You want me to take him to Boys Town.
- That's it.

533
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:28,347
The warden's got $280 I had on me.
It's all yours.

534
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,689
He'll tell you where to find Whitey.
He's here in Lincoln.

535
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,025
Well, we're overcrowded,
but I guess I can find room for one more.

536
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,690
He's pretty tough.
You may have to kick him around.

537
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,256
I doubt that.

538
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:40,729
Sorry, time's up.

539
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:43,306
- Goodbye, Joe.
- So long.

540
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,709
Wait here, I'll be right down.

541
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:01,917
- Hello, son.
- Hello, Father.

542
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,356
- Ante two.
- Two?

543
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:08,555
You heard it.

544
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,098
Gee, I haven't had a hand yet.

545
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:13,135
I'm sitting in a rummy seat
myself over here.

546
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,796
Keep your hands to yourself, Shorty.

547
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,567
See who it is.

548
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,735
- What's it worth?
- Two.

549
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:24,643
That's all it's worth.

550
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:27,012
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, boys.

551
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,209
Hello, sir.

552
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:29,513
Hi, Doc.

553
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:33,587
Which one of you is Whitey Marsh?

554
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,958
I've got a message for Whitey.
I'd like to deliver it to him alone.

555
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,996
Hey, wait a minute. I'm out about $1.10.

556
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,724
Come on back here.

557
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,846
There, that's better.

558
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:02,947
I'm Father Flanagan.

559
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:06,446
I saw your brother Joe
just a little while ago.

560
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:09,150
We had a long talk about you, Whitey.

561
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:11,758
Joe wants you to come with me
to Boys Town.

562
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:14,023
You've got a swell chance taking me
to that joint.

563
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,359
That's right, a swell chance.

564
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:18,595
I've got $280 your brother gave me
to take care of you.

565
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,636
I don't care if he gave you a million bucks.

566
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:23,867
What am I going to do
in a broken-down nursery like Boys Town?

567
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,875
There are a lot of things you could do.
We've got machine shops...

568
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:30,140
carpenter shops.
We've got printing presses, farming.

569
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:32,708
I think you might like farming.
It's good for you.

570
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:35,080
Keep you out in the open,
put hair on your chest.

571
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:39,087
If you think you'll make a plow jockey
out of me, you got another thing coming.

572
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,723
Now, look, Whitey, in a pinch
I can be tougher than you are...

573
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:44,316
and I guess maybe this is the pinch.

574
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:45,691
You're coming with me to Boys Town...

575
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,957
because that's the way
your brother wants it.

576
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:50,261
And that's the way I want it.

577
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:58,002
My arm!

578
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:01,770
My poor arm. You broke my arm.

579
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,479
You better get me to a hospital.
I can't go nowhere.

580
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:09,782
My arm, poor broken arm.

581
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,814
- Well, let's see. Where does it hurt?
- Take it easy.

582
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:15,187
- Where is it? Right here?
- Yeah, right there.

583
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:17,556
Well, I guess we can fix that...

584
00:35:21,364 --> 00:35:24,561
Now, why don't you stop
acting like a kid, Whitey?

585
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,157
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Mo. Hello, Paul.

586
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:52,592
- Hello, Father.
- How's everything, Mo?

587
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:55,756
- It couldn't be better. Everything's jake.
- Good, that's cheerful.

588
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:58,460
Whitey, this is Mo Kahn,
our second baseman and barber.

589
00:35:58,535 --> 00:35:59,661
Mo, this is Whitey Marsh.

590
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,670
- Hello.
- Hi, eagle-beak.

591
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:04,163
I'm going to have trouble.

592
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:05,736
Say, where are you from?

593
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:09,438
You probably got that big schnoz
sticking it into somebody else's business.

594
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:12,345
- It's coming.
- Come on, boys. Come on now. Hurry up.

595
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:27,722
- Say, how far is this place from Omaha?
- About 10 miles.

596
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:28,889
Ten miles?

597
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:32,128
What? Are we stuck out at this place
all the time? We never get into town?

598
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:36,639
Once in a while, a football game,
or baseball game. Some special occasion.

599
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,672
This is Birchwood Drive.

600
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,268
This is the main road leading to the home.

601
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:44,404
It leads out, too, don't it?

602
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,266
Boys, this is Whitey Marsh.

603
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:07,496
How are you?

604
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,538
Whitey, I won't introduce you
to all these fellows.

605
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:11,369
You probably couldn't remember
their names.

606
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:14,001
Okay by me. Got a lunch counter?
When do we eat?

607
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,066
When the bell rings.

608
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:16,806
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Freddie.

609
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,541
Whitey, this is one boy you have to meet.

610
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,344
This is Freddie Fuller,
the Mayor of Boys Town.

611
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,179
- Hello, Whitey.
- Hiya.

612
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:25,445
- I'll put him in your charge.
- Yes, Father. This way, Whitey.

613
00:37:25,522 --> 00:37:26,546
Okay.

614
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:31,060
I don't like a lot of kids looking at me
like I was a freak or something.

615
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:35,725
Come on, gangway in here.
Come on, open it up, buddy.

616
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,931
Boys, something tells me we're gonna
have to use a lot of patience with Whitey.

617
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,768
But I don't think he's half as tough
as he thinks he is.

618
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,832
Hey, Red.
Take this bag of Whitey's, will you?

619
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:48,471
Service, huh?

620
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:52,337
<i>Mammy. Mammy.</i>

621
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,681
Now I'll show you around.

622
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:58,653
- Do you have to do that?
- That's what we do.

623
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:06,591
- Hello, Pee Wee.
- Grab them kind of young, don't you?

624
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:09,664
- Hey, what's your name?
- Go on, beat it, kid.

625
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:12,030
This is Pee Wee.
He's sort of a mascot around here.

626
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:13,295
Everybody likes Pee Wee.

627
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,827
Yeah, I know, except I don't like kids
hanging around me.

628
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:18,806
- What's your name?
- His name's Whitey.

629
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,365
Hello, Whitey.

630
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:23,870
Here, cut yourself a pair of diapers.

631
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,415
Gee, for me? That's swell.

632
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:30,650
Over there's the band room
where the fellows practice.

633
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,655
- Got any poker players in the mob?
- No smoking, Whitey.

634
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,748
Just plain, nice boys, huh?

635
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:39,059
Hey, Whitey, I bet you can't do this.

636
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:44,221
Yeah, watch this, kid.
Step back, will you? Give me room.

637
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:49,899
You're wonderful.

638
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,905
What? Are you kidding?

639
00:38:57,313 --> 00:38:58,905
Hey, what's the skyscraper over there?

640
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:01,416
That's our own branch
of the United States Post Office.

641
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:05,079
Well, what do you know about that?

642
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:07,887
Mo, I'm tired.

643
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:09,681
Listen, Pee Wee, why don't you stay here...

644
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:11,317
and play mumblety-peg
with your new knife?

645
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:12,486
I can't carry you.

646
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:16,430
Mo, come on. I'm tired.

647
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:19,593
All right. Okay, here we go.

648
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,033
Up. Attaboy.

649
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:22,093
Sucker.

650
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,138
On a clear day,
you can see Omaha from here.

651
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,575
Yeah? Then what you got?

652
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,081
That's our baseball field over there.

653
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:36,209
One of our players has just been signed
by the St. Louis Browns.

654
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,481
- I like the Yankees.
- You would.

655
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:41,022
Hey, how did you get to be Mayor?
Did Flanagan make you Mayor?

656
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,923
No, Father Flanagan didn't.
I was elected by ballot.

657
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,392
We have an election every six months.

658
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:49,192
- I voted for you, Freddie.
- I know you did, Pee Wee. Thanks.

659
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,789
Just like playing house, huh?

660
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,495
Say, Whitey, you carry me for a while,
will you?

661
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:54,729
No, I might drop you.

662
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,136
There must be a lot of kids
taking on the lam around here...

663
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,230
with no fences or anything.

664
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:01,072
No, there never was a wall or a fence
around this place.

665
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:02,372
Father Flanagan once told us...

666
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:05,209
that a fence can't keep a fellow in
if he don't want to stay in.

667
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:07,249
- It's all worked on the honor system.
- Honor system?

668
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:10,184
A guy'd be a dope to try to do anything
around here with 200 spies...

669
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:11,550
ready to run and tell teacher on him.

670
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,748
There's no squealing.
Whenever you do anything wrong...

671
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,814
you go to Father Flanagan
and squeal on yourself.

672
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,588
Hey, you wanna know something?
I think you and Father Flanagan...

673
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:19,923
and this whole joint is screwy.

674
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:20,985
Now, get this, Whitey.

675
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:23,589
You think you're a lot different
from the rest of us. You're not.

676
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,293
We've got a lot of tough guys in this place.

677
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:28,030
Guys that'll take you apart
and put you together again like a watch.

678
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:29,935
Any time you get an idea like that,
let me know.

679
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:31,303
You can depend on that, Whitey.

680
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,432
When I get the idea, I'll let you know.

681
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:37,172
Say, Whitey, Father Flanagan
wants to see you in his office, right away.

682
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:39,476
I was having such a good time.

683
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:42,109
Well, see you later, Mayor.

684
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:45,815
Come in.

685
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:59,701
All right, Pee Wee, go.

686
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,735
You're cold, Pee Wee.

687
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:05,063
Getting colder.

688
00:41:07,143 --> 00:41:10,442
Warm. You're red hot, Pee Wee.
You're red hot.

689
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,448
You took the biggest piece, didn't you?

690
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,487
So you've been a good boy,
have you, Pee Wee?

691
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:19,543
Yes, Father.

692
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,988
Do you know what I think?
I think you've been extra good...

693
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:25,516
and that makes a great deal of difference
around here when you're extra good.

694
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:28,325
Then everybody's happy,
aren't they, Pee Wee?

695
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:31,694
There, now you think that's enough
for a really good boy?

696
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:33,463
Yes, Father. Thank you.

697
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,766
- Can I sit in the leather chair, Father?
- You bet your life.

698
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,831
I'd love to have you sit in the leather chair.
Go ahead, Pee Wee.

699
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,318
Well, how do you like the place, Whitey?

700
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:53,253
The more I see of it,
the more I don't like it.

701
00:41:53,322 --> 00:41:54,721
Well, you will like it.

702
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,986
I'm clearing out of here
the first chance I get.

703
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,119
There's a chance for that
any hour of the day or night.

704
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,992
My hunch is, though, you won't take it.

705
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,361
I'll give you odds on that.

706
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,332
If I was a betting man,
I'd take you up on that.

707
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,425
- Is that all?
- That's all.

708
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:14,908
I like Whitey, Father.

709
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:17,172
You and I, we like everybody,
don't we, Pee Wee?

710
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,874
- He give me this.
- He gave you that.

711
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:22,474
Yes, he gived it to me.

712
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:23,849
Goodbye, Father.

713
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:27,755
- Hello, Mr. Morris.
- Hello, Pee Wee.

714
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:30,292
- What you got, the mumps?
- No, candy.

715
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,884
- Say, what's your name?
- This is Mr. Burton, Pee Wee.

716
00:42:32,962 --> 00:42:35,522
Hiya, Burt... Mr. Burton.

717
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:38,123
He's the chairman
of Father Flanagan's board.

718
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:40,294
I'm gonna be Mayor someday.

719
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:54,807
Eddie, there's a little matter of red ink
in the financial statement.

720
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:56,749
In other words, a deficit.

721
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,116
You have a rather bad situation here.

722
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:01,418
Yes, we have a boy in trouble.

723
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,089
Something new?

724
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,786
There's always a boy in trouble.

725
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:08,854
If we don't attend to this,
there'll be a lot of boys in trouble.

726
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,626
Have all that stuff laid out
in the gymnasium, and...

727
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:13,828
Hey, look.

728
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:25,171
Hello, kitchen?
Mr. Brown, how soon will lunch be ready?

729
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:28,248
Well, ring the bell right away,
will you, please?

730
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:31,309
And give it two or three extra rings. Right.

731
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,180
Hello, Your Honor. Finished your tour?

732
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,186
The bell saved you, didn't it, buddy?

733
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:40,449
Whitey, you're sitting beside me.

734
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:42,820
All right, half-pint.

735
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:59,003
We thank Thee, Lord, for these,
Thy gifts, which we have received...

736
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,235
through Your merciful bounty.

737
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:02,641
Heavenly Father,
I thank Thee for this food.

738
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:11,050
Gracious God, may the food that we are
about to receive strengthen our bodies.

739
00:45:13,456 --> 00:45:15,947
What's the matter,
can't you all learn the same words?

740
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:18,687
Don't have to.
You say the kind of grace you want to say.

741
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:23,130
At Boys Town everybody worships as they
please, think the way they wanna think.

742
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,463
Sure. Some of us
don't have to go to chapel.

743
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:29,436
If you're a Catholic, or a Protestant,
you can go right on being one.

744
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:32,770
- Well, I'm nothing.
- Then you can go right on being nothing.

745
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:34,469
And nobody cares.

746
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:36,638
Thanks.

747
00:45:37,813 --> 00:45:39,940
Hey, who's the swell mob
in the back there?

748
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:42,381
- They're the Commissioners.
- In the gravy, huh?

749
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:45,981
How'd they get there?
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo?

750
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:48,656
No, elections. We vote for them.

751
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:52,223
How cute.
Wonder how they'd like to move over?

752
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:55,492
Don't reach for that one, fellas,
it's a mile over your heads.

753
00:45:55,765 --> 00:46:00,725
<i>But might I of Jove's nectar</i>

754
00:46:02,405 --> 00:46:07,399
<i>sup, I would not</i>

755
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:14,472
<i>change for thine</i>

756
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:22,613
<i>The thirst that from</i>

757
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:27,661
<i>the soul doth rise</i>

758
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,129
Let him sing. He's doing all right.

759
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:38,162
<i>Doth ask a drink divine</i>

760
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:46,937
<i>But might I of Jove's nectar</i>

761
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:49,712
He's nobody's fool.

762
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:55,180
<i>Sup, I would</i>

763
00:46:57,293 --> 00:47:02,253
<i>not change for thine</i>

764
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:22,445
- Here, let me help you, gimpy.
- No, that's all right. I can do it alone.

765
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:23,576
- Come on...
- Let me alone.

766
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:26,621
I don't need any help, I tell you.
I can manage.

767
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:29,783
What's the matter with that lug?
I was only trying to help him.

768
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,850
For a smart guy, you're an awful sap.

769
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:35,192
- Whitey, gimme a piggyback?
- I ain't helping nobody.

770
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:48,607
He didn't mean any harm, Tony.

771
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:50,905
I know that, Father.

772
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:59,845
That's a good idea.
I do it myself sometimes.

773
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,420
Do you suppose I'll ever have any sense?

774
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:06,692
Why, sure, Tony, you've got a lot of sense.

775
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:09,993
Of course, you have to exercise it,
so it'll grow.

776
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,963
People will always be trying to help me.

777
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:16,261
- I want to do things myself.
- And why not?

778
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:19,568
I'm counting on you to be
the Mayor of Boys Town.

779
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,434
No.

780
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,703
They want a fellow
who's good at football and baseball.

781
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:29,151
Somebody they can cheer.

782
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:33,583
Tony, there's a true story about a man...

783
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:36,090
who was very ill for a long time.

784
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,891
But he had courage, he got well.

785
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:42,221
People began to cheer him
for a lot of things.

786
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,833
And he became
the President of the United States.

787
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:50,870
And I only want to be
the Mayor of Boys Town, someday.

788
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:56,506
- Good night, Tony.
- Good night, Father.

789
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:10,824
- Hiya, Tony.
- Hello, Mo.

790
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,290
Hey, Hillbilly, everything's set.

791
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,555
- Kid stuff.
- Good night, Pee Wee.

792
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:19,995
Here he comes now.

793
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:28,541
Who's the smart guy
that doused the lights?

794
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:35,444
A bunch of wise guys in here, huh?

795
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:04,277
Very funny, boys, very funny.

796
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:12,572
Come on, White-Wings,
I want to get trimmed.

797
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,547
Okay. Trimmed is right.

798
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,115
Yes, sir. Snappy, says I.
Nice and neat now, my man.

799
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:27,889
None of that egghead business, get me?

800
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:30,664
By the way, how did you enjoy your golf?

801
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:32,700
That joke died last night. Leave it lay.

802
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:34,997
What shall we discuss, Your Lordship?

803
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:37,537
This great little metropolis, Boys Town.

804
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:40,665
- I'm afraid I'm beginning to like it here.
- Goody.

805
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:43,074
Yes, sir. In fact, I think I might even stay.

806
00:50:43,177 --> 00:50:46,544
- A light trim. How's about it?
- Not bad.

807
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:50,383
No, sir, not bad at all.

808
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:52,619
Now, give me a massage.

809
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:54,312
I thought you were kidding.

810
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,584
I ain't kidding.
The works, baby, the whole works.

811
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:58,022
Going down.

812
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:03,528
Okay, boss.

813
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:06,431
- I'm going to give you...
- I ain't crazy about barbers gabbing.

814
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:09,095
- All right, close your eyes.
- I got big problems to figure out...

815
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,798
tremendous ones.
So button it up and do your stuff.

816
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,409
Now you just ruminate
about those big plans.

817
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:20,545
You just grow up to be one of them
big, strong, silent type of men.

818
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:23,709
You know, things ain't going to stay dead
around this place, not for long.

819
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:27,016
I'm looking the gang over
to see who's all right for my big plans.

820
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:29,955
I believe in organization.
And when I start picking my gang...

821
00:51:30,024 --> 00:51:33,050
you'd better hop on the bandwagon,
White-Wings.

822
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,355
There's roll call.

823
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,296
- Roll call? Where's that?
- Right back at the dormitory.

824
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:39,799
- I'll finish you later.
- All right.

825
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:43,771
Here, buddy, keep the change.

826
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,972
- Morris!
- Here, sir!

827
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:52,307
- Murphy!
- Here, sir!

828
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,540
Marsh!

829
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,273
Whitey Marsh!

830
00:51:58,586 --> 00:51:59,746
Marsh!

831
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,258
Whitey Marsh.

832
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,128
- Here.
- Here, sir.

833
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,797
Here, sir.

834
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:20,674
Why, that<i>...</i>

835
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:03,179
- Mr. Mayor, if it please the court.
- Yes, Father Flanagan.

836
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:07,312
Whitey, the laws of Boys Town are made
by this body and enforced by this body.

837
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:10,323
The law doesn't require anything of a boy
that isn't good for all of us.

838
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:13,087
We have to respect each other
if we're going to like each other...

839
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:14,560
and living here together as we all do...

840
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:18,030
we have to like each other
if we're going to get along.

841
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:20,761
We've been years building up the rules
that we live by...

842
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:24,703
and if you break them, you have to answer
for it here, in our court.

843
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:27,206
You cannot escape it in Boys Town.

844
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:29,401
Okay.

845
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,741
Mo, there was a fight
in your barber shop this morning.

846
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:32,938
Yes, sir.

847
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,879
- That was no fight.
- I'll get to you in a minute.

848
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:35,973
Mo?

849
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,678
- Well, he came slamming in my shop...
- Who struck the first blow?

850
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:41,916
The first blow? What, are you kidding?
There was only one blow.

851
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,481
Careful, Whitey. There are extra charges
for contempt of court.

852
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,584
Okay.

853
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:47,685
Mo?

854
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:50,287
He started riding me
the second he struck here.

855
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:52,764
Last night in the dormitory, he<i>...</i>

856
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,425
Well, he kept on doing it.

857
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,697
Then this morning he comes into my shop,
and he says:

858
00:53:56,771 --> 00:53:59,433
"Hey, White-Wings,
gimme a haircut, a massage...

859
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:01,566
"the whole works, baby,
the whole works."

860
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,439
He sent me out
looking like a mammy singer...

861
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,172
and I don't take that from anybody.

862
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:06,338
That's why I sloughed him.

863
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:08,609
- Any questions?
- No questions.

864
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:11,583
- Did you ever milk a cow?
- Did I ever what?

865
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,745
It'll take him a day or so to learn.

866
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:18,216
For a month you will milk one cow a day,
night and morning.

867
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:19,782
You mean that I'm gonna have to...

868
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,226
The second month, two cows a day.

869
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:25,024
That's for contempt of court.

870
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,595
May I suggest that for the fight
they seem equally guilty?

871
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:32,535
What's the moving picture
for tomorrow night?

872
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,598
<i>- Buck Rides Again.</i>
- Gee whiz.

873
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,233
You will both attend the movie.

874
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,368
Hot dog.

875
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:40,175
You will stand in front of the hall
with your backs to the screen...

876
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:42,216
while we watch the show.

877
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,875
Mr. Mayor, before you dismiss them...

878
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:47,750
come on now, boys, no hard feelings.
Shake hands.

879
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:51,855
Okay. Shake the hand
that's going to milk 90 cows, kid.

880
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:52,915
Next case.

881
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,824
Goodnight, gentlemen.

882
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:01,467
I seen that picture, anyway.
I seen it in Madison.

883
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:02,559
- No good?
- Terrible.

884
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:05,538
Buck rides over the hill, shoots a bandit,
rides back over the hill...

885
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:08,336
scoops up the gal,
they all live happy ever after, nothing to it.

886
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,434
Hey, a pool room.
Come on in, I'll shoot you a game.

887
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:13,912
No, you can't. That's for the Mayor
and the Commissioners.

888
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,109
Those guys got it pretty soft, ain't they?

889
00:55:17,218 --> 00:55:18,913
Say, I think I'll run for mayor.

890
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,886
Why don't you? I'll vote for you.

891
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:23,480
- Check.
- And you can vote for yourself, that's two.

892
00:55:23,557 --> 00:55:26,287
Look, you and me, we're supposed
to be pals, you understand?

893
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,225
Me, too, Whitey.

894
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:30,495
Can he vote, too?

895
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,129
- Honest?
- Yeah, but only once.

896
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:36,336
You know what I'd make you
if I was elected Mayor?

897
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:37,996
- What?
- Finance Commissioner.

898
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:39,130
Yeah?

899
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,038
- What'll I be, Whitey?
- The forgotten man.

900
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:45,374
- Would I show them an election.
- Yes, siree.

901
00:55:45,446 --> 00:55:46,879
My friends...

902
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:50,145
- comes the election, we'll all play pool.
- Yippee!

903
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:14,871
Leave it pretty long
so it'll cover that roller skate.

904
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,466
Hi, Tony. Been scouting around for you.

905
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:19,672
Look, you ain't kidding yourself about
you got a chance for Mayor, are you?

906
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:22,910
- Well, I have some friends in school...
- Sure, I know, but use the noodle.

907
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:24,848
You got to get around
if you're going to be Mayor.

908
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:26,079
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.

909
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:27,484
I'll shove you in as a Commissioner...

910
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:29,989
then you won't feel like you bit off
more than you could chew.

911
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:32,651
There's only six Commissioners.
You've promised 10 that I know of.

912
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:34,354
There's no hard feelings after election.

913
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:36,123
You're a boss then. They got to take it.

914
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:39,428
Forget yourself, for the good of the school.
Tell your friends to vote for me.

915
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,195
That's the big deal. I'll treat you right.

916
00:56:41,302 --> 00:56:43,167
You've given me an idea, Whitey.

917
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:45,102
- I'll think it over.
- Atta-kid.

918
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:46,833
- Hi, Whitey.
- Mousehead.

919
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:47,931
Hiya, big shot.

920
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:48,997
Hey, Freddie.

921
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,634
There ain't no reason
why fellows running...

922
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,645
against each other for election
can't be friends.

923
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:54,647
You've been Mayor
for about six months now.

924
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:57,183
Don't be sore if the fellows think it's time
they had a new one.

925
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,719
It's all right with me,
so long as it isn't you.

926
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:12,093
Rather staggering, no doubt about that.

927
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,131
We've seen them like this before,
haven't we, Dave?

928
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:17,432
- Well, what?
- There's a way out.

929
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:21,236
You refused admission last year
to over 800 boys, no room.

930
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:22,866
That's true, unfortunately.

931
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,946
Did it ever strike you
how many of that 800 offered to pay?

932
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:28,445
- No. How many?
- At least a third.

933
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:33,249
And your dormitories so full of boys
who can't pay, you couldn't take those in.

934
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:36,887
With that kind of school,
you could be financed, comfortably...

935
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:40,017
by parents who will pay you
to straighten out their boys.

936
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,822
- These figures...
- Figures.

937
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,988
I've made liars out of figures all my life.

938
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:47,033
If I hadn't, there wouldn't be one stone
on top of another in Boys Town.

939
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,661
Hundreds of boys have been here.
They're out in the world now...

940
00:57:49,737 --> 00:57:51,967
with their heads up. They're making good,
every one of them.

941
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:55,537
That's serving my Creator and my country.

942
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:59,807
In 30 days, Father Flanagan, they'll be
obliged to take this place away from you...

943
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,438
unless you change your mind.

944
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,608
No use, Burton.
He'll do what he thinks is right...

945
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:04,844
if the heavens fall down.

946
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:07,319
You know figures are the most<i>...</i>

947
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:09,585
Later on, youngster.

948
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:11,786
Pee Wee.

949
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,284
This is Boys Town.

950
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:16,687
All right, Pee Wee, go.

951
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,696
You're as cold as Greenland.

952
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,359
Getting colder.

953
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,838
Now you're getting warm, Pee Wee.

954
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,508
You're burning up, Pee Wee.
You're red hot.

955
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:32,068
There you are.

956
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:34,813
Hey, Pee Wee...

957
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:37,344
did you brush your teeth?

958
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:40,752
I lost my toothbrush.

959
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,852
You lost your<i>...</i> When, Pee Wee?

960
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,583
A couple of days.

961
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,059
A<i>...</i>

962
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,759
Paul, come in here.

963
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,664
A couple of<i>...</i>
Pee Wee, I'm sorry about that.

964
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:57,169
Now that's my fault.

965
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:59,502
Paul, how in the world
could we let Pee Wee go...

966
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:02,371
for two whole days without a toothbrush?

967
00:59:05,479 --> 00:59:09,540
Pee Wee, you've got to have
some more candy to make up for that.

968
00:59:09,617 --> 00:59:11,141
Paul, I want you to go right down...

969
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:13,743
to the storeroom,
and get him a brand new toothbrush.

970
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:16,790
And you ask the Commissioner
of his dormitory how a thing like that...

971
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:19,951
could ever happen, 'cause he's a good boy,
and we've been neglecting him.

972
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:23,224
He wouldn't think of coming in here
for candy if he hadn't been a good boy.

973
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:26,596
Take care of that right away, Paul,
and make a big fuss about it. It's a shame.

974
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:29,192
I'm awfully sorry this happened.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

975
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,172
Maybe I can find my toothbrush.

976
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:36,710
You mean, maybe someplace
you haven't looked?

977
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,542
Yes, Father. It might be there.

978
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:41,742
Pee Wee.

979
00:59:42,316 --> 00:59:45,183
You know, Pee Wee, when you don't
look at me straight in the eyes...

980
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,584
I think maybe you don't like me.

981
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:23,515
- You said 30 days, Mr. Burton?
- Right.

982
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:27,621
The only solution you have to offer
is to turn away the boys who cannot pay...

983
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:28,957
and take in the boys who can.

984
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:32,192
Every man on your Board of Directors
feels the same way.

985
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,966
I'm afraid we'll have to think
of something else...

986
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:37,867
because that cannot be done.

987
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:40,670
Will you leave me alone with the problem?

988
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:42,140
What are you going to do about it?

989
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:45,110
Something I do very privately,
say a prayer.

990
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,473
We've been through some
pretty tough spots together, haven't we?

991
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,950
I can't send boys away, not any of them.

992
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:56,856
Eddie, if you can pray your way out of this,
I'll join the school.

993
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,311
And another thing...

994
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:32,789
I'm not going to say anything personal
about one of the candidates.

995
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,885
I'll say that only to him.

996
01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:39,223
Don't forget, a lot of us were pretty
rough stuff when we came here, too.

997
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:42,063
But he's run a campaign
rotten with lies and mud...

998
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:45,572
and promises that he knew were lies
when he made them!

999
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,474
I'm finished, Father.

1000
01:02:30,551 --> 01:02:32,542
Boys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1001
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,617
Now, as usual, I take no side.

1002
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:36,622
The election is your business.

1003
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:39,084
All right, Whitey, it's your turn.

1004
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,803
- Friends of Boys Town.
- Take off your hat!

1005
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,738
Excuse me, Father.

1006
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,977
Well, fellows, here we go.
Tomorrow's the big day.

1007
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,818
I'm not much for making long speeches,
but it looks to me...

1008
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:08,582
like you've been singing the same old tune
around here all the time.

1009
01:03:08,655 --> 01:03:09,679
But believe me...

1010
01:03:09,757 --> 01:03:12,282
if you vote right tomorrow,
we'll be swinging that old tune.

1011
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,623
Yes, sir, fellows, we'll be swinging it.

1012
01:03:14,695 --> 01:03:16,686
And may the best man win.

1013
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:25,795
And now, boys, we'll hear
from our other candidate, Tony Ponessa.

1014
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:37,211
I've been in Boys Town about five years.

1015
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:40,816
I've always hoped
I might be Mayor sometime.

1016
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:43,413
But there's something I want
more than that.

1017
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:47,621
Boys Town must always be
just what Father Flanagan made it.

1018
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:51,195
Must have a purpose, high ideals.

1019
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:56,031
Well, I'm not sure of myself...

1020
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:59,830
but one of the candidates has proven
he's the right man.

1021
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:05,309
So I retire from the race.

1022
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:11,746
I ask my friends to support
Freddie Fuller for re-election.

1023
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:15,343
Of all the double-crossing tricks.
And the day before election!

1024
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,787
Go on, the rest of you.

1025
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,487
Quiet, boys, quiet.

1026
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,490
Now, we have various ways here...

1027
01:04:24,565 --> 01:04:27,363
of letting new boys find out
how things are done.

1028
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:31,464
I hope some of you haven't forgotten
how long it took you.

1029
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:34,197
Fellows. Now, listen to me.

1030
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:37,672
Whitey and I have been battling for votes
for ourselves...

1031
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:40,212
and Tony thought of nothing
but Boys Town.

1032
01:04:40,814 --> 01:04:43,681
If you want a standing vote right now,
Tony has it, hands down.

1033
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,274
You mean "hands up," don't you?

1034
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:48,617
If you want Tony for Mayor,
raise your right hands.

1035
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:56,694
Well, boys, this is very unusual.

1036
01:04:57,831 --> 01:05:00,026
And a very great honor, Tony.

1037
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,027
You tried to give it away,
and they gave it back to you.

1038
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,904
Wait a minute.

1039
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:10,637
We haven't heard
from the other candidate.

1040
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:12,611
And I got plenty to say, too.

1041
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:15,573
I think you and Tony
are a pair of dirty, double-crossing guys.

1042
01:05:15,649 --> 01:05:18,743
I told you any time I had the idea
I could take you apart, I'd let you know.

1043
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:20,309
- Yeah?
- Well, I got the idea.

1044
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:22,617
Any time's all right for me.
You know that, don't you?

1045
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:23,781
Boys.

1046
01:05:25,993 --> 01:05:29,053
Well, it looks like this battle is inevitable.

1047
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:30,753
All right, Whitey...

1048
01:05:30,964 --> 01:05:34,365
but all fights here are according to Hoyle,
and they're in the ring.

1049
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:35,423
Okay!

1050
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:37,264
Is that all clear, boys?

1051
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:38,896
Now, you break when I tell you.

1052
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:41,236
The rounds will be two minutes,
one-minute rest.

1053
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:43,970
Half a round, and a good long rest for him.

1054
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:45,773
Go to your corners.

1055
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:56,515
Fight.

1056
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:00,522
Attaboy, Whitey!

1057
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:02,186
Come on, get up there.

1058
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:11,894
One, two.

1059
01:06:33,694 --> 01:06:35,127
One, two...

1060
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,629
three, four, five.

1061
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,101
Whitey!

1062
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:56,815
One, two, three.

1063
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:06,221
All right, Whitey, you've had enough.

1064
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,507
It's in the middle drawer, Pee Wee.

1065
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:12,091
There's Whitey. Where's he going?

1066
01:08:13,827 --> 01:08:15,021
Whitey!

1067
01:08:21,635 --> 01:08:23,398
Wait for me, Whitey!

1068
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,066
Whitey, wait for me. Whitey!

1069
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:33,840
Hey, where you going?

1070
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:35,347
Go on, beat it, will you?

1071
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:37,906
- You going away?
- Sure, I'm blowing the plant.

1072
01:08:37,984 --> 01:08:40,714
Go on back, will you, Pee Wee?
Where you belong. That's a good kid.

1073
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,186
On your way.

1074
01:08:42,823 --> 01:08:45,257
But you and me's pals, ain't we?

1075
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:51,323
Go on and beat it, will you? Go ahead.

1076
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,360
I'm your pal, Whitey.

1077
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:54,661
Take me with you.

1078
01:08:54,734 --> 01:08:56,759
No. I can't be bothered.

1079
01:08:56,837 --> 01:08:58,099
Go on and beat it, will you?

1080
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:00,639
No, I want to go with you!

1081
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,506
Go on, beat it.

1082
01:09:02,576 --> 01:09:04,043
No, I want to go with you.

1083
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:06,909
Go on back and scram, will you?

1084
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:23,590
Pee Wee!

1085
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:33,430
Speak to me. Pee Wee.

1086
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,071
I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't.

1087
01:09:41,915 --> 01:09:43,439
Speak to me, Pee Wee!

1088
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,944
Oh, God. I'll do anything,
anything at all, Pee Wee.

1089
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:51,880
I'll ride you piggyback. Go speak to me.

1090
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:03,568
- I'll carry him, Father.
- No, I'll take him.

1091
01:10:05,972 --> 01:10:07,234
Pee Wee.

1092
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:38,130
No one is allowed.

1093
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:34,154
...Christ, Our Lord. Amen.

1094
01:13:01,948 --> 01:13:03,279
Joe Marsh!

1095
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,214
Joe, it's me, Whitey!

1096
01:13:16,029 --> 01:13:17,053
Come on, let's get outta here.

1097
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,154
Yeah, come on.

1098
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,562
Take the car. Wait at Bogg's Tavern.

1099
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:21,293
- But how about you?
- You heard me. Get going.

1100
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:22,858
I'll meet you later.

1101
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:25,661
Sorry, kid. I didn't know it was you.

1102
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,172
- Where'd he get you?
- Right here.

1103
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,571
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

1104
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:29,699
Come on. We gotta get outta here.

1105
01:13:29,776 --> 01:13:30,765
Let's go.

1106
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:05,876
It's not bad. You'll be okay. Just lie still.

1107
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:08,839
What are you doing out of school?

1108
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:10,075
I walked out.

1109
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:12,084
You walk back, get me?
You're going straight.

1110
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:13,949
That's why I put you there.

1111
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,052
Stay right here till I send for you.

1112
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,921
- How'd you escape, Joe?
- Never mind that.

1113
01:14:19,993 --> 01:14:21,585
Listen, Whitey, no squawking or squealing.

1114
01:14:21,661 --> 01:14:22,650
No.

1115
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,321
Don't talk until you're dead sure
I got away.

1116
01:14:24,397 --> 01:14:26,661
- All right, Joe.
- Keep that leg quiet.

1117
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,498
Forget me, kid. My road's a lot too tough.

1118
01:14:31,404 --> 01:14:34,498
- So long.
- Joe, don't go.

1119
01:14:41,881 --> 01:14:44,611
Unless there's a concussion,
he'll be all right.

1120
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:47,148
Take a little time, though.

1121
01:14:49,622 --> 01:14:53,058
Pee Wee, lad, I'll keep the candy on tap.

1122
01:14:57,397 --> 01:15:00,696
- You're wanted on the telephone, Father.
- Thank you, Sister.

1123
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:05,899
- Hello?
- Father Flanagan...

1124
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:07,367
Whitey's hurt.

1125
01:15:07,707 --> 01:15:09,038
- He's hurt?
- Yeah.

1126
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:11,474
He's over in a church at 19th and Dodge.

1127
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:13,906
Hello?

1128
01:15:19,052 --> 01:15:20,781
...and I pray for Pee Wee.

1129
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:25,951
It was all my fault, but I didn't mean it.
Honest, I didn't mean it.

1130
01:15:26,893 --> 01:15:28,360
Let him live.

1131
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,186
Please make him get well.

1132
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:36,893
Are you hurt badly, Whitey?

1133
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,699
- Who told you?
- I don't know.

1134
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:40,500
- Do you?
- I ain't talking.

1135
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,677
- How's Pee Wee?
- He's all right. He'll pull through.

1136
01:15:45,178 --> 01:15:47,612
- Can you walk at all?
- Sure.

1137
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:52,680
Here, put your arm over my shoulder.

1138
01:15:55,688 --> 01:15:56,814
Good evening, Father.

1139
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,790
Boys, you should be in bed, shouldn't you?

1140
01:15:58,858 --> 01:16:01,326
- Whitey's up there, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

1141
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:03,586
There's trouble, and we know it.

1142
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:18,042
Evening, Father.

1143
01:16:18,111 --> 01:16:19,806
Did one of your boys
come home wounded?

1144
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,278
Yes, Whitey Marsh.

1145
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:23,941
There was a bank robbery.
The night watchman was killed.

1146
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:25,245
Robbery?

1147
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:28,278
Well, what has that got to do
with Whitey?

1148
01:16:28,354 --> 01:16:29,446
I found this cap.

1149
01:16:29,522 --> 01:16:31,956
- And who are you?
- Reporter, <i>Morning Dispatch.</i>

1150
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:33,424
The boy's name is in it, Father...

1151
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:34,721
and Boys Town.

1152
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:36,887
I'm afraid there's something to it
this time.

1153
01:16:36,963 --> 01:16:39,261
- Where did you find this?
- In the alley near the bank.

1154
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:42,995
There was a trail of blood to a church.
But we were a little late, he'd gone.

1155
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,366
Yes, I got him.

1156
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:46,666
- Where is he?
- In the infirmary.

1157
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:47,831
Well, I'll have to take him in.

1158
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:49,568
He's been wounded.
He shouldn't be moved.

1159
01:16:49,642 --> 01:16:52,270
- I can't help that.
- Sheriff, I'm the head of a community...

1160
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:56,008
with complete autonomy
and a better record than any in the State.

1161
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:01,710
I'll be responsible for Whitey
until he's able to be questioned.

1162
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:06,086
Well, if the boy's hurt,
I'll take your word, of course.

1163
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:09,154
But I'll have to leave a deputy.
Tim, you stand by.

1164
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:10,593
I'll call later.

1165
01:17:21,841 --> 01:17:24,571
The wound is superficial, Father.
Nothing to worry about.

1166
01:17:24,644 --> 01:17:26,635
Leave us alone, please, Sister.

1167
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:37,620
All right, Whitey, let's have it.

1168
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,590
- What?
- The whole story.

1169
01:17:40,326 --> 01:17:42,556
- There ain't nothing to tell.
- Stop that.

1170
01:17:42,629 --> 01:17:43,891
They found your cap near the bank...

1171
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:46,989
and they followed your trail to the church,
where I found you.

1172
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:48,192
Why don't you leave me alone?

1173
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:51,236
If I hadn't gotten there first,
you'd be in jail now.

1174
01:17:51,938 --> 01:17:54,873
Whitey, I don't believe you're guilty.

1175
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:58,974
You might as well save your breath.
I ain't talking.

1176
01:18:00,747 --> 01:18:02,738
It was a bad day when I brought you here.

1177
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:05,443
I've always said there was no such thing
in the world as a bad boy.

1178
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:07,247
I've built my life on it.

1179
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:12,080
You're the only boy in all these years
that hasn't had a heart somewhere...

1180
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:14,786
that I could reach, somehow, sometime.

1181
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:19,459
Whitey, over 200 boys have a home here,
but tomorrow night...

1182
01:18:19,532 --> 01:18:22,092
they won't have any home.
And that's up to you, Whitey.

1183
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:25,535
Because I never worked as hard
with any boy in my life. I never had to.

1184
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:27,903
I don't know nothing to tell,
nothing to tell nobody.

1185
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:31,535
Were you mixed up in robbing this bank
and killing that watchman?

1186
01:18:31,744 --> 01:18:35,441
I heard some shots. I got scared,
and I ran out to the alley...

1187
01:18:35,581 --> 01:18:36,673
and I got plugged.

1188
01:18:36,749 --> 01:18:39,741
Then somebody picked me up and took me
to the place where you found me.

1189
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:41,377
- That's all I know.
- You're lying!

1190
01:18:41,454 --> 01:18:42,751
You know a lot more than that.

1191
01:18:42,822 --> 01:18:44,687
I just got through telling you all I know!

1192
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:46,748
Who picked you up in the alleyway
and carried you?

1193
01:18:46,826 --> 01:18:48,123
You're shielding someone.

1194
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:51,254
Are you going to see these boys
turned out into the streets, into alleys...

1195
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:53,628
into reformatories, and worse?

1196
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:55,725
Lose their home?

1197
01:18:59,806 --> 01:19:03,264
All right, Whitey, that licks me.

1198
01:19:06,612 --> 01:19:09,479
Yes, it was a sad, bad day
when I brought you here.

1199
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:11,173
It was, indeed.

1200
01:19:14,887 --> 01:19:19,824
The Sheriff left a deputy to watch you.
I'll turn you over to the police tomorrow.

1201
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:33,030
He doesn't feel like talking tonight.

1202
01:19:39,979 --> 01:19:42,573
Well, my friend,
you're sticking to the finish, huh?

1203
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:47,051
Eddie, come on down and see Hargraves.
They're getting out extras, bad ones.

1204
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,087
They've got the case tried...

1205
01:19:49,155 --> 01:19:52,613
and they've got you hung,
unless you can do something about it.

1206
01:19:54,994 --> 01:19:59,021
- Is this it? Is it Boys Town?
- Yes.

1207
01:19:59,365 --> 01:20:02,459
- I got here, didn't I?
- Have you come far?

1208
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:04,636
- Are you Father Flanagan?
- Yes.

1209
01:20:05,371 --> 01:20:06,668
How far, son?

1210
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:09,731
I hitchhiked, maybe a week, but I got here.

1211
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:12,572
I suppose you're hungry?

1212
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:13,905
Yes, sir.

1213
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,346
Eddie, please. We have to get downtown.

1214
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,681
- Freddie!
- Yes, Father.

1215
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:23,883
Freddie, see that he has a bath,
and some food, and a place to sleep.

1216
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,690
- What's your name, son?
- Charley Haines.

1217
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:29,351
All right, Charley,
tomorrow we'll talk things over.

1218
01:20:29,428 --> 01:20:31,089
Thank you, Father.

1219
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,611
What's the matter?

1220
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,617
I'm going.

1221
01:20:56,923 --> 01:20:57,947
It's all over.

1222
01:20:58,024 --> 01:20:59,218
What's the matter, kid?

1223
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:01,556
I want to make a confession.

1224
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:04,719
A what? All right, let's have it.

1225
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:06,958
No, you got to get Father Flanagan.

1226
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,099
Don't want to talk to nobody else.

1227
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:10,567
Okay.

1228
01:22:12,131 --> 01:22:14,258
Beat it, Mo. I'll wait here.

1229
01:22:16,636 --> 01:22:18,399
It's my kid brother.

1230
01:22:24,076 --> 01:22:25,065
How'd you find us?

1231
01:22:25,144 --> 01:22:26,702
I heard you tell these guys where to go.

1232
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:28,303
What are you doing?
Steering the cops here?

1233
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,315
- Nothing like that.
- Lay off that stuff, Rod.

1234
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:31,714
Listen, Joe, you gotta make a break.

1235
01:22:31,784 --> 01:22:33,718
I kept my mouth shut, see,
told nobody nothing.

1236
01:22:33,786 --> 01:22:35,754
But I'm as good as arrested
for that job down there.

1237
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:37,550
I had to even make a sneak to get here.

1238
01:22:37,623 --> 01:22:38,885
- Why, you...
- Paul!

1239
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,687
Wait a minute. Let's get this.

1240
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,820
That school, with those kids.
They're gonna be closed up tight.

1241
01:22:43,896 --> 01:22:45,989
Those kids sent to reform school.

1242
01:22:46,098 --> 01:22:48,123
It's taken away from Father Flanagan.

1243
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:50,199
I don't care what they do to me...

1244
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:52,533
but I ain't going to see those kids
tossed out like that.

1245
01:22:52,605 --> 01:22:54,664
Joe, I can't do it.

1246
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,807
I'm telling you straight.
Get out, take your chances...

1247
01:22:57,877 --> 01:23:00,107
because the minute I get back,
I'm gonna spill the beans.

1248
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:03,444
I don't wanna do it, Joe, but I gotta do it.
I gotta.

1249
01:23:06,152 --> 01:23:08,120
It's okay with me, kid.

1250
01:23:08,187 --> 01:23:10,052
On your way. We'll make a break.

1251
01:23:10,122 --> 01:23:11,419
Joe!

1252
01:23:12,258 --> 01:23:15,125
Stay where you are.
We break when we said we would.

1253
01:23:15,194 --> 01:23:18,322
Before daylight, and the kid sticks
until we're well on our way.

1254
01:23:18,397 --> 01:23:19,591
Get it?

1255
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:25,863
- Here you are. Get your paper!
- Papers!

1256
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:27,567
Paperboy.

1257
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,540
"Authorities threaten
to close Boys Town."

1258
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:31,405
- Sorry, Father.
- Thanks.

1259
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:35,808
Extra! Boys Town suspect.
Murder at bank robbery! Extra!

1260
01:23:35,881 --> 01:23:38,076
Night watchman killed! Extra!

1261
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:40,909
- Hello, Father. I came as soon...
- Mr. Hargraves.

1262
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:43,581
What kind of Christian logic can allow you
to destroy us...

1263
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,783
before anybody gets to the bottom
of tonight's business?

1264
01:23:45,858 --> 01:23:47,485
That sounds pretty terrible as you put it.

1265
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,460
I don't know how much
this boy had to do with it.

1266
01:23:49,528 --> 01:23:50,552
I can't get him to talk.

1267
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:52,256
But I have a hunch he's not guilty.

1268
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:54,458
I think you should pull your punches
until somebody...

1269
01:23:54,533 --> 01:23:56,125
finds out something, and does it definitely.

1270
01:23:56,202 --> 01:23:57,226
Now I really do.

1271
01:23:57,303 --> 01:24:00,864
Father, I left this office an hour ago,
because women's clubs, societies...

1272
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,239
- everybody was calling me.
- All I'm asking for is a little time.

1273
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:06,301
My friendship for you is definitely known.

1274
01:24:06,379 --> 01:24:10,679
If I pull any punches, they'll say I forgot
my duty as a newspaperman for you.

1275
01:24:10,816 --> 01:24:12,113
- I can't stand for that.
- All right.

1276
01:24:12,184 --> 01:24:14,209
Suppose tomorrow you find out
the whole thing is wrong.

1277
01:24:14,286 --> 01:24:16,049
Suppose you find out the boy isn't guilty...

1278
01:24:16,122 --> 01:24:18,420
and that my record is clean and clear
of anything like this.

1279
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:19,981
How will you feel then?

1280
01:24:20,059 --> 01:24:22,892
You are my friend.
Now tell me, how will you feel?

1281
01:24:23,562 --> 01:24:27,828
All I want is a little time
to let the thing clear itself. That's all.

1282
01:24:29,969 --> 01:24:31,300
Excuse me.

1283
01:24:34,974 --> 01:24:37,101
Yes? Police Headquarters?

1284
01:24:42,214 --> 01:24:44,808
Your friend, Whitey Marsh, has escaped.

1285
01:24:44,884 --> 01:24:47,011
Two of the other boys went with him.

1286
01:24:47,086 --> 01:24:49,213
I believe you made yourself responsible
for him.

1287
01:24:49,288 --> 01:24:52,257
That means something like
"accessory after the fact."

1288
01:24:52,425 --> 01:24:54,256
Well, I'm afraid that's all.

1289
01:24:54,427 --> 01:24:56,418
Sorry, Father. Goodnight.

1290
01:24:57,763 --> 01:24:59,128
Hello, Reynolds?

1291
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:01,632
That boy, Whitey Marsh,
escaped from Boys Town.

1292
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,894
Two of the other boys went with him.

1293
01:25:02,968 --> 01:25:04,902
Put that where the public can see it.

1294
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,062
And, Reynolds...

1295
01:25:06,138 --> 01:25:10,234
feature an editorial against sentimental
rubbish about juvenile derelicts.

1296
01:25:14,547 --> 01:25:16,606
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1297
01:25:16,682 --> 01:25:18,741
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1298
01:25:19,685 --> 01:25:21,414
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1299
01:25:21,487 --> 01:25:22,476
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1300
01:25:25,057 --> 01:25:26,046
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1301
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:27,781
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1302
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:41,531
Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern.

1303
01:26:05,831 --> 01:26:07,594
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night.

1304
01:26:12,204 --> 01:26:13,694
Freddie! Tony!

1305
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:19,208
Sister, what's happened?
The boys, they're all gone.

1306
01:26:19,278 --> 01:26:20,802
I don't know, Father.

1307
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,174
I do, Father.

1308
01:26:22,715 --> 01:26:25,775
They're going to Bogg's Tavern,
after Whitey.

1309
01:26:26,252 --> 01:26:27,514
Bogg's Tavern?

1310
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:30,317
Please find Whitey, Father.

1311
01:26:30,789 --> 01:26:33,656
All right, Pee Wee. You go to sleep now.

1312
01:27:02,488 --> 01:27:04,183
Freddie, Mo, Tony.

1313
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,785
Haven't I troubles enough
without all of you going crazy?

1314
01:27:06,859 --> 01:27:08,156
We're not crazy, Father.

1315
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:10,161
Whitey's with his pals.
We're going to get them.

1316
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,254
You'll do nothing of the kind.
They may be murderers.

1317
01:27:12,331 --> 01:27:13,355
There's been a man killed.

1318
01:27:13,432 --> 01:27:15,457
They can't kill all of us, Father.

1319
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:17,934
So that's the way you feel about it, huh?

1320
01:27:18,837 --> 01:27:20,998
Keep out of it, Father, will you, please?

1321
01:27:21,073 --> 01:27:22,062
No.

1322
01:27:23,876 --> 01:27:25,275
Bless your hearts.

1323
01:27:25,678 --> 01:27:28,010
Turn out those lights. Let's go.

1324
01:27:50,269 --> 01:27:51,793
Here they come.

1325
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,240
Don't move.

1326
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:20,087
Hey! Wait a minute, fellows,
give me a chance!

1327
01:28:20,165 --> 01:28:22,463
Won't somebody give me a chance?

1328
01:28:22,534 --> 01:28:24,661
Give me a chance to explain!

1329
01:28:27,906 --> 01:28:29,305
Clear a way, there.

1330
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:31,542
We're coming through, Father.

1331
01:28:35,114 --> 01:28:36,103
Get him!

1332
01:28:42,221 --> 01:28:44,314
Quiet, boys!

1333
01:28:47,793 --> 01:28:50,353
Now there's just one thing I want to know.

1334
01:28:50,429 --> 01:28:51,657
The rest is for the police.

1335
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,630
Wait a minute. Don't hand the kid over.

1336
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:55,098
Hey, Whitey, come here and tell him.

1337
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:57,328
Let him go.
Come on, Whitey, spill everything.

1338
01:28:57,403 --> 01:28:59,200
I couldn't tell you nothing before.

1339
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:01,262
I didn't have no part in robbing the bank.

1340
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:04,605
I couldn't tell you,
because I couldn't give my brother up.

1341
01:29:05,277 --> 01:29:07,142
I didn't come here
to make a sneak with them.

1342
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:10,648
I came here to tell Joe that I wasn't going
to see Boys Town smashed.

1343
01:29:10,716 --> 01:29:11,910
That's what I came here for.

1344
01:29:11,984 --> 01:29:14,452
I told him I wasn't going to give him up,
Father. That's all.

1345
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,080
I told him I was going straight back to you
and tell the truth.

1346
01:29:17,156 --> 01:29:21,388
But these other two guys, they held me
here. They wouldn't let me go.

1347
01:29:21,694 --> 01:29:22,718
Quiet.

1348
01:29:22,861 --> 01:29:24,453
That's the truth about tonight.

1349
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:28,330
I've been good and rotten at Boys Town,
but that's the truth about tonight, Father.

1350
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,425
I couldn't squeal on my brother.

1351
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:41,441
Eddie, shut your eyes.

1352
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,472
Now open them again.

1353
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:46,518
And this hand is paralyzed
from signing for registered letters.

1354
01:29:46,585 --> 01:29:47,847
$50,000.

1355
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,514
And that gorgeous color, black.

1356
01:29:50,589 --> 01:29:51,817
You win.

1357
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:56,817
What would it cost to build a dormitory
for 500 boys?

1358
01:29:57,129 --> 01:29:59,324
One quarter of a million dollars.

1359
01:30:03,602 --> 01:30:05,092
Come on, sit.

1360
01:30:12,544 --> 01:30:15,741
Boys, I have a startling thing
to say to you.

1361
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:21,376
In our midst is a lad
who has refused to act as an official here.

1362
01:30:22,254 --> 01:30:24,279
Now that is reprehensible.

1363
01:30:24,957 --> 01:30:28,586
He is notoriously shy, a shrinking violet.

1364
01:30:29,395 --> 01:30:30,384
But...

1365
01:30:30,929 --> 01:30:35,559
no excuse is good enough
for refusing duty when Boys Town calls.

1366
01:30:36,735 --> 01:30:39,169
The present Mayor, Tony Ponessa...

1367
01:30:39,238 --> 01:30:42,173
and the rest of the candidates
agree with me.

1368
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:45,308
