What about penguins?

They mate for Iife.

- No.

FeeIings for my husband are different.

you become tongue-tied.

I had a career.
I gave up a career to marry you.

180
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,677
What career? You were
a smaII-town girI from a CathoIic schooI...

181
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:16,362
- I was working.
- You were struggIing...

182
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,158
- ..to break into the fashion industry.
- I was struggIing because I was young.

183

You were so pretty.

I had no idea what anything even meant.
I was taIking about reeds.

299
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,304
- CoItrane. Who's CoItrane?
- What is that?

300
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,659
- That's what I wanna know.
- You probabIy read it.

301
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,144
I was so forward, too. I can't beIieve it.

302
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,305
CompIeteIy obnoxious.

303
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,386
Yes, but he was responsive.

304
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,149
Yes, but I'm teIIing you,
it was Iike I was possessed.

305
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,945
ReaIIy. I'm saying ''A whoIe new worId
of harmonics opened up for me.''

306
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,742
- Harmonics?
- Harmonics.

307
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,940
What do I know about harmonics?

308
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,538
WeII, is he nice?
What did you find out about him?

309
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,025
- WeII, he's not married.
- Good.

310
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,620
He's in rehearsaI
at somepIace caIIed Park East.

311
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,707
- Uh-huh.
- Sound East.

312
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:24,585
And he's rehearsing something,
kind of a Duke EIIington tribute.

313
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:28,306
What have I done?
I can't meet a strange man at the zoo.

314
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,387
- Why not?
- I'm not Iike Jane.

315
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,583
- I'm not Iooking for a roII in the hay.
- What are you Iooking for?

316
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:36,623
Listen, not a word of this.
You mustn't breathe a word.

317
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,824
- Of course not. I promise.
- God, I have nothing to wear.

318
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:43,581
- I've gotten so fat. This is not for me.

Nancy BriII has been made
a big deaI on a TV show.

327
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:18,705
She buys scripts now. I sent her fIowers.

328
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:22,668
I'm happy for her cos she's a friend,
but I must admit I'm a IittIe envious.

329
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:25,752
Oh. AIice, we discussed this.
I thought we agreed.

330
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:30,994
I know. How about if I took some kind
of a course or a cIass or something?

331
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,150
- You mean in schooI?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,583
- Like what?
- I don't know.

333
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,515
Now I regret I never went to coIIege.

334
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:41,990
At Sacred Heart I was good at EngIish.

335
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:47,745
Oh, speaking of Sacred Heart, we've
been invited to an evening next month...

336
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,831
..in honour of Mother Teresa.

337
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:54,346
ReaIIy? Mother Teresa?
You think she'II be there in person?

338
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,910
I expect some of her cronies wiII show up.

339
00:25:57,036 --> 00:26:00,233
I wanna bring the kids.
I taIk so much about Mother Teresa.

340
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:03,951
- I don't know about that.
- Mother Teresa! She's my idoI.

341
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,909
We have to bring them.
It'd be a great experience.

342
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:08,628
- We'II see.
- Yeah.

I can't do it to my husband.

346
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:08,391
AII this taIk Iast night of Mother Teresa
just made me feeI so guiIty.

347
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,670
I beIieve in fideIity. It's my upbringing.

348
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,952
I'm not gonna commit aduItery.
I just can't do it.

349
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,200
And who is this guy anyway, you know?
Some horn pIayer? A divorcé?

350
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,515
He's a compIete stranger.

351
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,108
I've been married 16 years, Dr Yang.

352
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,959
I can't just go out and commit aduItery.

353
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,993
Not that I'm so sure he even wants me,
you know? I'm getting oIder.

354
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:36,909
And what wouId happen
if I feII in Iove with him? This is...

355
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,354
- I'm just so mixed up.
- Mrs Tait's feeIings in titanic confIict.

356
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,075
But Dr Yang has prescription.

357
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:49,433
Oh, you know, yesterday's herbs
made me feeI a IittIe strange.

358
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:53,396
These herbs are different. Very vaIuabIe.

359
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:57,117
- DifficuIt to obtain.
- Are aII these compIeteIy safe?

360
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,518
Best way to get to know strange man
is to observe.

361
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,598
Yeah...

362
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,038
It's bitter. What wiII this do?

363
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:09,518
EnabIe Mrs Tait to observe
without being observed.

364
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,998
What... what is this?

365
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:18,115
- Where am I going? I can't beIieve this.
- Do not worry.

366
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:20,996
- InvisibiIity wiII wear off shortIy.
- I'm invisibIe!

00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:24,001
I'm compIeteIy gone. I don't beIieve it.

368
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:26,956
I never saw anything Iike this.
Dr Yang, is this safe?

369
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,597
Mrs Tait knows where man can be found.

370
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:32,682
- It's crazy.
- If she wants to Iearn more about him,...

371
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,283

Uh-huh. So what's your idea?
Because the truth is, I'm backed up today.

- Hi. How are you?
- Great.

881

Perry wouId Iike to invite Shana to
the movies in his dad's screening room.

882
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:15,674
<i>- They're showing The Little Mermaid.
- Sure.</i>

883
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:19,510
He's reaIIy sorry for the Iast time.
He didn't mean to vomit on her coIIage.

884
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:21,791
- I've gotta run. CaII me.
- I'II caII you.

885
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:23,912
Bye-bye.

886
01:06:25,002 --> 01:06:28,199
Listen, I'm reaIIy sorry about Iast night.

887
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,711
No, it's OK.
Can we taIk in private for a minute?

888
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:32,798
Yeah. Yeah.

889
01:06:34,362 --> 01:06:38,321
I was thinking, maybe I shouId
just back off for a IittIe whiIe.

890
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:41,791
- ReaIIy?
- WeII...

891
01:06:41,922 --> 01:06:46,120
- I can't bear to be the source of troubIe.
- Oh, no. It's not you at aII.

892
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:50,998
No, it's me. It's... it's just who I am,
who I've been.

893
01:06:51,123 --> 01:06:53,717
I'm just trying to figure out who that is.

894
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,596
That's why I don't wanna be an obstacIe.

895
01:06:56,723 --> 01:07:00,682
ReaIIy? So you think...
you think we shouIdn't meet any more?

896
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,599
Maybe it's for the best.

897
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:07,954
Gee, I was gonna take you
to a neat restaurant for Iunch tomorrow.

898
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:10,837
- You were?
- Not if... not if...

899
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:21,559
Listen, we better get the kids.

900
01:07:25,605 --> 01:07:27,914
- Hi. Hi.
- AIice, hi. God. Come on in.

901
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:31,594

- I was working on a brief, but...

902
01:07:31,725 --> 01:07:35,479
- ..I'm so happy to be taken away from it.
- I was a coupIe of bIocks away, so...

903
01:07:35,605 --> 01:07:40,201

to teII you that I feeI bad about this.

I'm... I shouId be kind, and I'm sorry.

906
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:52,044
- Do you want some tea?
- Um... No, no thank you.

907
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,919

- You were right.

908
01:07:55,046 --> 01:07:59,164
- Who am I to be judgmentaI of your Iife?
- Listen, be quiet for just a second.

909
01:07:59,286 --> 01:08:03,245
I was... I was wrong. You know, I was...

910

There's something disgusting about aII
the stuff I buy the kids and I buy myseIf.

911
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:12,795
- AII of that. You were right.
- But it's your Iife, you know? Who am I?

912
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,361
You're my sister,
and I care about what you think.

913
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,923
- Yeah?
- And I miss being cIoser, you know?

914
01:08:19,047 --> 01:08:22,926
When you guys moved to the city,
I was hoping that wouId happen.

915
01:08:23,048 --> 01:08:25,243
I was hoping that too, you know?

916
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:29,327

to see how you've changed.

- You knew Doug was very weaIthy.

918
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:36,687
Yeah, of course I knew that,
but when I waIked in, you know, that...

919
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:41,836
Oh, God, your cIoset. CIothes,
and a hundred shoes and aII that stuff.

920
01:08:41,969 --> 01:08:44,164
- It was hard for me. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

921
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:46,325
You know, you're just very...

922
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:49,919
You're different. You have different ideas
than when we were kids.

923
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:54,042
I know that. I know that.
I know that. You're right.

924
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:57,241
But don't you think I wanna be cIose?

925
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:59,325
I do.

926
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,606

You know? It was amazing.
I was... I was weeping.

932
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:05,084
The kids were cute though. Dennis,
I think, was just thriIIed to be up so Iate.

933
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:08,922
But I reaIIy think Katie had a feeI
for what was going on, you know?

934
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:12,125
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not. Why do you say nervous?

935
01:10:12,253 --> 01:10:14,767
You keep taIking.
I've heard this three times.

936
01:10:14,893 --> 01:10:17,327
ReaIIy? WeII, you know,
this is a big step for me.

937
01:10:17,454 --> 01:10:22,289

more graduaIIy or something?

938
01:10:22,414 --> 01:10:25,724
- It hasn't exactIy been rushed.
- Rushed? I don't know.

939
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:29,085
It feeIs rushed. It feeIs rushed.
I've been married 1 5 years.

940
01:10:29,214 --> 01:10:31,170
ProbabIy I'm just out of practice.

941
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:33,808
It's not Iike juggIing.
You don't have to practise.

942
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:37,722
I mean, Doug and I do have sex, but...
but not the way we used to.

943
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:42,292
Which is probabIy my fauIt. Somewhere
aIong the Iine I just Iost interest.

944
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:45,327
Then he seemed to.
But probabIy because I did.

945
01:10:45,455 --> 01:10:49,130
But I don't know why I did.
Anyway, we rareIy seem to do it.

946
01:10:49,255 --> 01:10:51,644
- Maybe he Iost interest first.

- ReIax.

948

God, I prefer it when it's dark.

Yes.

956
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:37,375
DiaIogue in fiction has two functions.

957
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:42,811
In the noveI, to be read
to oneseIf as voices in the mind.

958
01:11:42,938 --> 01:11:46,294
And in scripts and in pIays,
to be read out Ioud.

959
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:50,417
So that what we're reaIIy
taIking about here is...

960
01:11:50,538 --> 01:11:54,417
..the two aspects
of the consciousness of words.

961
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:58,817
InternaI and meditative in the noveI,...

What I mean is,
don't ever count on Nancy BriII.

- She's not gonna give you a break.
- No.

- That's technique.

990
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:07,413

inspiration. That's where I come in.

- No.

994

It's the reason he teaches.
FemaIe pupiIs.

995
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,419
No. He's very deep. He's not Iike that.

996
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:23,663
Yeah. Very deep is exactIy

- Now, what about your mother?
- What, Mom?

998
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:30,703
Your mother. She was a movie actress for
a whiIe. Her story might be a good pIot.

999
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:33,660
She was just in the movies
for a very, very short time.

1000
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:36,824
And she never made it.
Losers are much more interesting.

1001
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:40,223
- Mom's not a Ioser.
- Look how defensive you are.

1002
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:44,625
It's a good story. I know you idoIised her,
but be reaIistic. This is important.

1003
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:49,025
She was in the movies. She made two
or three movies, and then she met Dad.

1004
01:14:49,148 --> 01:14:53,107
And... Dad persuaded her to retire.

1005
01:14:53,228 --> 01:14:57,665
No, AIice.
I was never more than a pretty face.

1006
01:14:57,788 --> 01:15:01,497
And when it began to wrinkIe,
the studio stopped caIIing.

1007
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:04,506
No, there was much more to you
than your Iooks.

1008
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:08,780
- You couId have done more with your Iife.
- You fIatter me.

1009
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:13,346
After the studio didn't want me,
I was Iucky your father came aIong.

1010
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:16,859
I was so used to having
someone Iook after me.

1011
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:20,698
I wouId have kiIIed myseIf
if it wasn't for him.

1012
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:25,698
That's why it's so important

But then when Dad died, you drank
yourseIf to death with margaritas.

1015
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,538
I couIdn't heIp it, darIing.

It's been on my mind for a Iong time.

1158
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,816
Anyway, I've... I've reaIIy decided.

1159
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:32,890
- So, I just thought you'd wanna know.
- Um... AIice...

1160
01:25:33,021 --> 01:25:35,455
Yeah?

1161
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:37,537
When you phoned,...

1162
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:43,098
..I was pacing up and down in front
of the mirror, rehearsing a speech.

1163
01:25:44,142 --> 01:25:46,702
Because I wanted to taIk to you.

1164
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:48,778
- Yes?
- The other day,...

1165
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,940
..you know, when we spIit up
on Madison Avenue,...

1166
01:25:53,062 --> 01:25:55,622
<i>..after we both got invisible.</i>

1167
01:25:55,742 --> 01:25:59,098
<i>l guess l was a little drunk, and l...</i>

1168
01:25:59,222 --> 01:26:03,261
<i>..l did something
l've always wanted to do.</i>

1169
01:26:03,383 --> 01:26:05,453
<i>l went to 96th Street.</i>

1170
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:11,692
<i>And at four o'clock l entered the office
of Dr Lerner, Vicki's psychoanalyst.</i>

1171
01:26:11,823 --> 01:26:17,659
<i>Well, l listened to her private thoughts
for nearly an hour.</i>

1172
01:26:17,783 --> 01:26:23,574
<i>And it turns out that, down deep,
she's still in love with me.</i>

1173
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:29,223
<i>And she regrets
having instigated our break.</i>

1174
01:26:30,224 --> 01:26:32,180
The point I'm getting at is...

1175
01:26:34,984 --> 01:26:38,613
..I think I shouId take
that chance with her.

1176
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:41,019
We were together for six years.

1177
01:26:41,145 --> 01:26:43,705
And we have a chiId whom we both Iove.

1178
01:26:47,585 --> 01:26:51,294
I don't know what eIse to say except...

1179
01:26:51,425 --> 01:26:56,215
..that, under everything...
I stiII care for her.

1180
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:03,502
<i>(Alice sighs)</i>

1181
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,942
WeII.

1182
01:27:08,706 --> 01:27:11,345
Yes.

1183
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:13,422
WeII.

1184
01:27:28,387 --> 01:27:32,175
<i>(Dr Yang) Mrs Tait, come in.
PIease excuse appearance.</i>

1185
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:35,504
- Dr Yang Ieaving.
- You're going away?

1186
01:27:35,627 --> 01:27:39,222
Yes. Must go to Tibet for a period of time.

1187
01:27:39,348 --> 01:27:43,057
Ancient scroIIs discovered.
New remedies.

1188
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:46,942
Dr Yang must aIways continue education.

1189
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:51,778
Good for my patients,
and keeps Dr Yang young.

1190
01:27:52,828 --> 01:27:56,025
But teII Doctor, what is probIem?

1191
01:27:56,148 --> 01:28:00,300
WeII, I've experienced a doubIe bIow.

1192
01:28:00,429 --> 01:28:05,662
A husband who Ioved me once,
I know that he no Ionger does.

1193
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:09,577
And a man I met recentIy
and deveIoped strong feeIings for...

1194
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:12,428
..now doesn't seem to want me.

1195
01:28:12,549 --> 01:28:17,065
Love. Love is most compIex emotion.

1196
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:20,067
Human beings unpredictabIe.

1197
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:22,226
No Iogic to emotions.

1198
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:25,422
Where there is no Iogic,
there is no rationaI thought.

1199
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,259
Where there is no rationaI thought,
there can be much romance,...

1200
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,904
..but much suffering.

1201
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:36,945
Gee, I... I feeI Iike I'm adrift,
Iike I've been cut Ioose.

1202
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:41,144
A whiIe ago I had a routine Iife,
with feeIings I understood.

1203
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:43,227
A husband, a home.

1204
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:46,343
Mrs Tait had iIIusion of happiness.

1205
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:52,910
Upon cIoser observation, not very honest
husband, not very honest with seIf.

1206
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:56,819
- I'm frightened.
- Freedom is frightening feeIing.

1207
01:28:56,952 --> 01:28:59,147
Can you heIp me before you go?

1208
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:01,228
Here, Mrs Tait.

1209
01:29:01,352 --> 01:29:04,150
SpeciaI herbs, very speciaI herbs.

1210
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,866
Found onIy in HimaIayas.

1211
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:10,302
- What wiII these do?
- Is strong Iove potion.

1212
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:15,586
DissoIve into drink.
He who drinks wiII Iose heart to Mrs Tait.

1213
01:29:15,713 --> 01:29:18,864
So... so these wiII
make Joe Iove me again?

1214
01:29:18,993 --> 01:29:21,985
Or your husband Iove you again
as he once did.

1215
01:29:22,113 --> 01:29:27,028
- ReaIIy?
- Herb is potent. Choice is yours.

1216
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,189
Use wiseIy.

1217
01:29:29,313 --> 01:29:31,349
Choice?

1218
01:29:31,473 --> 01:29:37,742
I think Mrs Tait has better idea of who
she is than before she came to Dr Yang.

1219
01:29:37,874 --> 01:29:40,707
Who her friends are, or are not.

1220
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:45,191
Who is husband, Iover, sister, mother.

1221
01:29:45,314 --> 01:29:49,102
What are her needs, her Iimits, her gifts.

1222
01:29:49,234 --> 01:29:53,193
What are her innermost feeIings.

1223
01:29:53,314 --> 01:29:58,434
May not know aII answers,
but has better idea. No?

1224
01:29:59,555 --> 01:30:02,115
Yes. Yes, it's true.

1225
01:30:02,235 --> 01:30:06,387
Now must decide
which road her Iife wiII take.

1226
01:30:11,915 --> 01:30:13,871
Whoa! Sorry.

1227
01:30:15,236 --> 01:30:18,592
AIice. I didn't think you couId make it.

1228
01:30:20,076 --> 01:30:22,226
- Uh-oh. What's wrong?
- I'II come back.

1229
01:30:22,356 --> 01:30:26,110
Don't be siIIy. Come in.
There are a Iot of peopIe you know here.

1230
01:30:27,436 --> 01:30:29,427
- Is that AIice?
- Hi.

1231
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:32,593
- Where's Doug?
- He's... he's busy.

1232
01:30:32,717 --> 01:30:36,232
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

1233
01:30:36,357 --> 01:30:40,714
- I'm a IittIe shaken up.
- Yeah, I see that. Let's go into the kitchen.

1234
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:46,147
What is it? What?

1235
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:51,230
OK. I have to make a decision
between Doug and Joe.

1236
01:30:51,357 --> 01:30:53,427
Oh, God. WeII...

1237
01:30:54,678 --> 01:30:57,397
- AII right. What are your feeIings?
- I don't know.

1238
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:59,509
I have feeIings for both of them.

1239
01:30:59,638 --> 01:31:02,277
AIice, is it that simpIe?
You just pick the one you want?

1240
01:31:02,398 --> 01:31:04,548
It's a Iong story, but yes, yes, I can.

1241
01:31:04,678 --> 01:31:08,751
- You're the one to make this decision.
- Come on, you two. Join the party.

1242
01:31:08,878 --> 01:31:12,917
It's prime time.
PeopIe are gonna begin Ieaving soon.

1243

<i>(* ''Will You Still Be Mine''

1244

That's great. Look at these peopIe go.

1245
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:23,708

- The party's a big hit. So's the eggnog.

CocktaiI franks and bicarbonate of soda.

What's... what's with AIice?
She Iooked so upset when she came in.

1248
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,389

- Come on, teII me.

1249
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,476
Dorothy?

1250

Excuse me. AIice?
CouId I have a word with you?

1251
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,875
- Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

1252
01:31:52,001 --> 01:31:54,640
Thanks. He was getting a IittIe repetitious.

1253
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:56,717
What is this?

1254
01:31:56,841 --> 01:31:59,639
I'm so gIad you and Dorothy
are seeing more of each other.

1255
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:01,877
Thank you. I'm gIad, too.

1256

- Thank you. I've aIways Iiked...

1257
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:09,393
Have I got something there?
I'm gIad you guys moved to New York.

No, I mean, I reaIIy Iike you.

Thank you. I reaIIy Iike you, too.

- What's that? A mistake?

1261
01:32:18,002 --> 01:32:22,871
Yeah. Marrying Dorothy. You're the one
I Iove. AIways have, aIways wiII.

1262
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:25,755
What are you saying?
What, are you kidding?

1263
01:32:27,002 --> 01:32:28,958
I don't know. Maybe I'm drunk.

1264
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:32,837
Maybe you're drunk. I don't think
you shouId be saying things Iike that.

1265
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:35,841

Good to see you. Who's that?

1268
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,479
It doesn't matter, anyway.

1269
01:32:47,443 --> 01:32:49,479
- HeIIo. Hi.
- HeIIo.

1270

- Excuse me. I'm AIice Tait.

1271
01:32:53,804 --> 01:32:58,514
You'II think I'm very forward, but you're
the IoveIiest creature I've ever seen.

1272
01:32:58,644 --> 01:33:00,839
Thank you.
That's very sweet. Thank you.

1273
01:33:00,964 --> 01:33:04,115

- This is my night. I'm not at aII offended.

1274
01:33:04,244 --> 01:33:07,395

I want you to know I...

1279
01:33:19,765 --> 01:33:22,837
I know enough to know

- Who are you?
- My name is AIice Tait.

1284
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,404

- Dorothy's sister. I was Iooking for her.

The herbs. A bag,
did you see a brown bag around here?

1290
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:56,719
- The nutmeg. I put that in the eggnog.
- Nutmeg? Oh, no. Isn't there any Ieft?

1291
01:33:56,847 --> 01:33:59,805
- It was a smaII bag.
- It's not nutmeg. Get the eggnog, pIease.

1292
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:02,441

Excuse me. You're gonna think this is
very sudden. I Iove you. Let's get married.

1297

- AIice?
- Can you feeI? Can you...?

1300
01:34:25,769 --> 01:34:29,728
Why don't you back off a second, OK?
Let me taIk to her. Give me one second.

1301
01:34:29,849 --> 01:34:31,805
<i>(* ''O Tannenbaum'' by Liberace)</i>

1302
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:57,048
- CIaire had so much Iiposuction done.
- Yes?

1303
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:00,685
I ran into her in PaIm Beach
and again at the kinesioIogist's.

1304
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:04,849
I think she wants to have an affair
with her dog-waIker.

1305
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:07,849
<i>- (man) Taxi!
- Is it five or six Pekingese she has?</i>

1306
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:10,849
- Six, I think. Is he cute?
- Mm... Mezzo, mezzo.

1307
01:35:20,171 --> 01:35:22,127
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1308
01:35:22,252 --> 01:35:25,005
- We have to taIk.
- Yeah. I think we do need to taIk.

1309
01:35:25,132 --> 01:35:28,886
AII right. I've fooIed around a IittIe
over the years. I'm not perfect.

1310
01:35:29,012 --> 01:35:31,685
- Neither am I.
- No, you are.

1311
01:35:31,812 --> 01:35:34,167
No, Doug. I've Iied. I've cheated.

1312
01:35:34,292 --> 01:35:37,762
- I've done things I didn't think I had in me.
- You have?

1313
01:35:37,892 --> 01:35:41,123
I have, I have. We haven't had
a reaI marriage in so Iong, if ever.

1314
01:35:41,252 --> 01:35:43,925
In what way did you Iie and cheat?

1315
01:35:44,053 --> 01:35:48,205
AII I know is, I don't Iike the way I feeI
about it. I think it's time to change that.

1316
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:52,246
Look, I don't wanna bIow this
out of proportion, OK? What's past is past.

1317
01:35:52,373 --> 01:35:56,002
Nothing has to be different. We can
get things back to the way they were.

1318
01:35:56,133 --> 01:35:58,328
I know I can. I know I can.

1319
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:01,126
- But I'm not going to.
- What does that mean?

1320
01:36:01,254 --> 01:36:05,088
It... WouId you excuse us, pIease, HiIda?
Just for a moment, pIease.

1321
01:36:05,214 --> 01:36:09,651
I'II teII you what it means. I'm tired
of aII this. I'm tired of pedicures,...

1322
01:36:09,774 --> 01:36:14,370
..and face-Iifts, and shopping
and gossip about who's in bed with who.

1323
01:36:14,494 --> 01:36:17,804
- I'm tired of the whoIe thing.
- There's more than that. The chiIdren.

1324
01:36:17,934 --> 01:36:22,769
Yes, exactIy. I want them growing up
with deeper vaIues, with something eIse.

1325
01:36:22,895 --> 01:36:26,012
- Don't give me a Iecture.
- That is something I don't need any more.

1326
01:36:26,135 --> 01:36:27,807
- What is it?
- For your own interest.

1327
01:36:27,935 --> 01:36:30,847
You wanted to take a writing course.
I said OK.

1328
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:34,650
Did you aIso have an affair with
Nancy BriII? I wouIdn't be surprised.

1329
01:36:34,775 --> 01:36:38,609
- I don't Iike you this way.
- I can't write. And if I couId...

1330
01:36:38,735 --> 01:36:42,284
- It's good to know that.
- ..I'm incapabIe of more than a TV pIot.

1331
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:44,691
- We need to go to the Bahamas.
- It's pathetic.

1332
01:36:44,816 --> 01:36:49,128
- Unwind, sunbathe, unIoad this.
- I'm going further than the Bahamas.

1333
01:36:49,256 --> 01:36:52,612
- OK. What? Where are you going?
- I'm going to CaIcutta.

1334
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,727
- You're going where?
- CaIcutta.

1335
01:36:54,856 --> 01:37:00,010
- To try and work with Mother Teresa.
- Do you have your ticket?

1336
01:37:00,137 --> 01:37:04,176
I want the chiIdren
to have a different kind of Iife.

1337
01:37:04,297 --> 01:37:07,494
- To know something different.
- Mother Teresa? Are you serious?

1338
01:37:07,617 --> 01:37:10,609
- I'm serious.
- You're serious about this?

1339
01:37:10,737 --> 01:37:14,446
- When did this amazing thought pop up?
- It doesn't matter when.

1340
01:37:14,577 --> 01:37:16,886
It does to me.

1341
01:37:17,017 --> 01:37:22,011
One minute without your charge pIates
and masseuse and you wouId be Iost.

1342
01:37:22,138 --> 01:37:25,050
Yeah, I know. You're probabIy right.

1343
01:37:25,178 --> 01:37:30,172
- But it's not gonna be that way any more.
- ReaIIy? What's it gonna be? CaIcutta?

1344
01:37:30,298 --> 01:37:33,449
You're going off to CaIcutta?

1345
01:37:33,578 --> 01:37:37,537
Do you know they have
10,000 unIisted diseases in CaIcutta?

1346
01:37:39,539 --> 01:37:42,099
I don't beIieve... What are you saying?

1347
01:37:44,019 --> 01:37:46,579
The second you see
an ad for a diamond earring...

1348
01:37:46,699 --> 01:37:51,136
..or get a craving for a caviar bIini,
you'II be back, if indeed you go.

1349
01:37:51,259 --> 01:37:53,614
You're not going with my chiIdren.

1350
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,979
<i>(Nina) Did you hear about Alice Tait?
She left her husband.</i>

1351
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,056
<i>- (Penny) No!
- (Sue) That's old news.</i>

1352
01:38:11,175 --> 01:38:13,609
<i>- What do you mean?
- The big news is, she went to lndia.</i>

1353
01:38:13,729 --> 01:38:16,880
<i>- Really?
- lt's incredible. She met Mother Teresa.</i>

1354
01:38:17,001 --> 01:38:20,437
<i>But now she's back and l heard
she's doing some kind of volunteer work.</i>

1355
01:38:20,553 --> 01:38:23,306
<i>- She always had that Catholic streak.
- True.</i>

1356
01:38:23,426 --> 01:38:28,102
<i>She not only left her husband, she left
her cook, her chauffeur and her maid.</i>

1357
01:38:28,215 --> 01:38:30,331
<i>She's living downtown with the kids.</i>

1358
01:38:30,449 --> 01:38:33,725
<i>You're not gonna believe this.
She does everything herself.</i>

1359
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,800
<i>Penny Gates said she spends all her free
time with her kids, and she looks great.</i>

1360
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:40,948
<i>No cook or maid?
Did she have a mental breakdown?</i>

1361
01:38:41,064 --> 01:38:45,023
<i>- That's my thought.
- Someone said she's a changed woman.</i>

1362
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:48,285
<i>Speaking of changed women,
Gloria Phillips had face work.</i>

1363
01:38:48,406 --> 01:38:51,000
<i>She's having an affair
with her astrologer, isn't she?</i>

1364
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,078
<i>But she's a changed woman
because you can't tell it's Gloria.</i>
