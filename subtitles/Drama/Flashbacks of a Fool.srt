0
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,325
He's got no stamina.

1
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,087
- I love your nose.
- Thanks, Apple.

2
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,601
I wanted to get my nose done
since I was ten,

3
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,203
but it wasn't as simple as thought.

4
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:42,124
The doctors found out I didn't have
any cartilage in the tip of my nose,

5
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,165
so then we had to do that.

6
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,125
My nose was too long,
so we had to shorten it.

7
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:53,408
And then it was too wide,
so we had to thin it.

8
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,963
And it was just a lot more complicated
than I thought.

9
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:01,280
My nose was just an insane amount
of money.

10
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,166
I mean, I was shocked.

11
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,606
I thought that a nose job
was only, like, three or four grand,

12
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,600
but I was wrong.

13
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,602
Mine was, like,
three times that amount.

14
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,045
I mean, my girlfriend's
breast enlargement

15
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,405
was, like, four or five grand.

16
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:26,605
I mean, it's not like
I ever felt them, but...

17
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,325
They actually look kinda real,
you know?

18
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,878
<i>So your own wife, who's hot,</i>
<i>by the way, with big jugs,</i>

19
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,322
<i>won't even go down on you?</i>

20
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,917
<i>You can call my girlfriend</i>
<i>and she'll tell you,</i>

21
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,204
<i>and I've been with her</i>
<i>for quite a while,</i>

22
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,043
<i>and she will tell you she goes down</i>
<i>on me every time we're together.</i>

23
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,043
You're a disgrace to white folks.

24
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,002
Christ!

25
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,279
Where's my wallet?

26
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,722
Where's my wallet?

27
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,403
- On the dresser.
- Hi, Sister Jean, it's Joe.

28
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,248
Sure.

29
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,164
How can you spend a thousand bucks
on a 976 line?

30
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,400
I don't get it. You're Joseph Scott,
who every woman wants,

31
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,445
and you waste your money
on a 976 line.

32
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,044
Cos I can pretend to be someone else.

33
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,361
Not you, Sister Jean, someone else.
I need some tickets.

34
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,566
I'm at home. Now?

35
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,200
Great, thank you.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye. Bye.

36
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,441
Don't you have any philosophies
in life apart from self-indulgence?

37
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,248
You're the most self-indulgent fool
I've ever met.

38
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,207
- I thought you'd given up.
- I did give up.

39
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,163
And then I started again. Feel this.

40
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,759
- What?
- Feel this. It's a lump.

41
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,248
Feel that lump? You feel it?
There? There!

42
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,240
It's cancer.

43
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,928
Breast cancer.
Can men get breast cancer?

44
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:19,679
Do they give men mastectomies?
I've got something down there as well.

45
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,159
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes, and he's a fucking idiot!

46
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,001
It's cancer.

47
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:29,882
- So where is it?
- What?

48
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,164
- My wallet!
- On the dresser.

49
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,921
- No, it isn't.
- It is.

50
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,639
What the fuck is that?

51
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:40,278
- That would be a dog.
- Why the fuck is it in my house?

52
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,648
Apple!

53
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,759
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Apple.

54
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,079
- <i>Hi, Joe.</i>
- Why did you leave your dog here?

55
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,966
- <i>You said I could.</i>
- No, I didn't.

56
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>Yes, you did. I'll pick him up at the</i>
<i>restaurant after your lunch meeting.</i>

57
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,004
I'm not taking that dog to lunch
with me.

58
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,206
<i>Don't bring him into the restaurant.</i>
<i>Leave him in the car.</i>

59
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,086
<i>I'll be there at two.</i>

60
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,161
You better.

61
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,683
Is it cocktail hour yet?

62
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,843
Well, it is somewhere!

63
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,807
I'm handing in my notice.

64
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,448
Why?

65
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,799
It's so much fun here.

66
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,201
How much?

67
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:04,008
- It's not about the money.
- How much?

68
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,126
When I show up here,
I never know what to expect.

69
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,248
Whether you've eaten mushrooms
or acid or coke or all of the above.

70
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,639
You know what they call you?
Captain Wacky.

71
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,640
Captain Wacky.

72
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:20,517
You know, I really don't like
looking at myself through your eyes.

73
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,321
Another 500.

74
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:26,883
I'm not happy.

75
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,926
Your happiness doesn't interest me.
Mine does.

76
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,642
600.

77
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,041
700.

78
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,442
- OK.
- That's a month, not a week.

79
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:35,957
Yes?

80
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,439
- Yes?
- <i>Hi!</i>

81
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:56,642
Hi! You look terrific.

82
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:59,801
So do you. Welcome. Come in.
Nice to see you.

83
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,166
My apartment block was shaking
last night. Did you feel it?

84
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,046
No.

85
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,360
I thought it was gonna fall in
and I was gonna die.

86
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,287
Five, right?

87
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,247
You have the fires and you have
the floods and you have the riots...

88
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,728
And then you have
the drive-by shootings.

89
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,244
Fires, floods, earthquakes, riots.

90
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,206
I drove by a body on my way here
just lying on the sidewalk.

91
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,087
We don't need to go to the movies.
We live in a movie.

92
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,278
We do!

93
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,645
I live here, but I can't find
a good thing to say about it.

94
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:43,757
If I close my eyes and picture it,
all I see is one big varicose vein.

95
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:50,807
You got yourself a dog!

96
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,528
It's good to have animals.

97
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,807
I have two dogs, two cats
and a green lizard.

98
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,279
I had two boa constrictors
that I got when they were babies.

99
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,724
They were always
getting out of their tank.

100
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,848
When they got to about six foot,
one wrapped itself around the treadmill.

101
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,602
- I turned it on and it got flattened!
- No!

102
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:13,726
I've had so many animals,
you wouldn't believe it.

103
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,162
Snakes, eh?

104
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,719
Well, I'd better be going.

105
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,247
You're not into smack?
I got some straight off the boat.

106
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,603
No.

107
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,884
Smack junkies
never seem to get bored.

108
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:33,201
They can look at their shoes for eight
hours and still have a good time.

109
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,245
I envy that.

110
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,524
Well, it's nice to see you, Joe.

111
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,328
Nice to see you, Sister Jean.

112
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:49,080
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem. I'll see you soon. Bye.

113
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:50,966
Bye-bye now.

114
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,803
Will you help me with this dog?

115
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,844
What do you mean "help"?

116
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,318
If people see me with it,
they'll think I'm gay.

117
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,048
- See? That was easy.
- Why didn't you do it yourself?

118
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,201
I'm meeting an important director.
I don't want hairs on me.

119
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,284
- Oh, Christ!
- Oh, my God!

120
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,882
- Christ!
- Can we help?

121
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,166
I'm sorry! Fucking dog! I'm so sorry.
We're fine, thank you.

122
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,967
I was talking to the lady!

123
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,882
If you need a witness
to that assault, I'd be...

124
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:25,042
What are you talking about? It wasn't
an assault, it was an accident.

125
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,519
That was no accident. It was
an unprovoked, vicious attack!

126
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,645
I'm calling the police right now!

127
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,084
It was an accident!
I wouldn't hit her.

128
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,957
I saw you and I know you.
I know all about you, Joe Scott.

129
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,564
Put your cellphone away.
It was an accident, not an assault.

130
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,209
You ladies are old enough
to know the difference.

131
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:46,008
If you don't get outta here,
there will be an assault!

132
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:50,401
We were trying to help! He shouldn't get
away with it! You should report him!

133
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:53,959
You saw what you wanted to see!
Get outta here! You understand me?

134
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,486
God!

135
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:06,161
Put that on your nose.

136
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:09,487
Come and sit down.

137
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,045
Step in.

138
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:21,161
There you go. Steady.
Put your head back. There you go.

139
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,803
I... I'll make you some tea, shall I?

140
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,164
You don't know how to make tea.

141
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,397
- You're gonna leave me, aren't you?
- What?

142
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:40,843
You're gonna leave me.

143
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:43,523
Are you gonna stand there
with your thumb up your ass

144
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,167
or are you gonna get the phone?

145
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:49,037
Is that a roundabout way of saying
you don't wanna discuss it right now?

146
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:50,957
- Hello?
- <i>Joe?</i>

147
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,040
- Hi, Mum.
- <i>You picked up the phone!</i>

148
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,597
- <i>Where's Ophelia?</i>
- Busy. Can I call you back?

149
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:59,364
- I'm in the middle of something.
- <i>Joe, I've got some bad news.</i>

150
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,360
- What, are you OK?
- <i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

151
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,441
- Is Peggy OK?
- <i>No, Peggy's fine.</i>

152
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,724
<i>I hate to tell you this</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

153
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,447
Just tell me!

154
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,283
Mum?

155
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:16,800
- Mum, are you there?
- <i>Oh, dear...</i>

156
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:19,801
- For God's sake, tell me!
- <i>Joe, I'm so sorry.</i>

157
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,039
Just tell me, Mum, please.

158
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,199
<i>Boots has died.</i>

159
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,041
What?

160
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,807
<i>Boots has died.</i>

161
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,926
When... Boots has died?

162
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:38,319
- When?
- <i>Yesterday. It happened yesterday.</i>

163
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,445
<i>I'm so sorry, Joe.</i>

164
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,117
How?

165
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:48,047
<i>They're not sure yet.</i>
<i>There has to be an autopsy.</i>

166
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,960
<i>Joe?</i>

167
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,324
Yeah. Yeah, Mum, I'm here.

168
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:02,006
<i>They're holding the funeral</i>
<i>at Saint Joseph's.</i>

169
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:06,526
<i>Ruth would love you to come,</i>
<i>but she understands if you're too busy.</i>

170
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,602
<i>Joe, it's been such a shock to her.</i>

171
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:15,079
<i>He wasn't even ill. There was no</i>
<i>warning that this was coming.</i>

172
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,802
<i>I feel terrible telling you this</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

173
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,169
<i>I know you haven't seen him for years,</i>

174
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:30,446
<i>but I know how much you meant</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

175
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:35,000
<i>He was so proud of you</i>
<i>and all that you've achieved.</i>

176
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,403
- Can you get me a Bloody Mary?
- Certainly, sir.

177
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,957
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The traffic was dreadful.

178
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,325
Joe Scott, Hollywood's hottest
young director, Ritchie Smith.

179
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:03,640
How are you doing? The script
is fantastic. Congratulations.

180
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:06,402
Mannie says you've directed
some music videos.

181
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,287
Did you look at 'em?
Fuckin' awesome, ain't they?

182
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,644
- You didn't send them to me.
- We didn't?

183
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,162
No.

184
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:17,599
Excuse me. Hello?

185
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:22,126
Yeah. What do you mean? I've been
trying to get hold of you for days.

186
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,007
Yes, I have! Now is not a good time.

187
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,486
Don't call me when
I'm in a fucking lunch meeting!

188
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,479
I am serious! I'll talk to you later.

189
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:36,357
- Can I get another one?
- Why didn't you call the office?

190
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:40,806
That's the place to call, not when
I'm having lunch, OK? Call me later.

191
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,527
Sure. Bye.

192
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:48,441
Sorry about that. There'll be a tape
at your house when you get home, OK?

193
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,645
OK, let's order some food!

194
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,205
OK. This stuff looks good, huh?

195
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,287
I had a big breakfast.
I'm just gonna have a salad.

196
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,848
Yeah, so am I.

197
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,281
Hello?

198
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:09,565
Dave! How are you, my man?

199
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,203
No, that's great.

200
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:28,566
Sure, we'll talk later. OK, bye.

201
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:33,165
Let's order! Excuse me?

202
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,282
- I'm gonna have a green salad.
- Yeah, for me as well.

203
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,407
- Ritchie, want anything?
- Burger.

204
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,923
- Burger.
- How would you like that?

205
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,887
- Rare?
- He'd like it rare.

206
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:51,484
- Anything else I can get you?
- Ritchie, anything else?

207
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,605
No. No, thank you.

208
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:57,645
Thank you.

209
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,558
Sorry.

210
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,443
I have to go to the bathroom.

211
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,008
Sure.

212
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:12,804
OK.

213
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:17,808
Business. Things have developed a lot
since we last spoke, OK?

214
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,325
And since Ritchie started casting
seriously, he...

215
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,724
Since Ritchie started casting seriously,

216
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,721
he realises your character
isn't going the way he wants.

217
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,960
You know how things are.
You start casting, things change,

218
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,688
- dynamics change...
- Dynamics?

219
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,728
Yeah. You know, dynamics.
Dynamics between characters.

220
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,522
He wants to go younger.

221
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,443
Hello?

222
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,967
George!

223
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,080
How are ya?

224
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,043
That's great!
I tell you what you do, though.

225
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:59,246
You take the $35 million,
you go to Brazil.

226
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:03,208
You keep $34 million for yourself
and spend $1 million on a picture.

227
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,328
Only don't spend it on this one. This...
What the fuck are you doing?

228
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,799
- Are you trying to humiliate me?
- That's my fuckin' phone!

229
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,198
Why didn't you say on the phone?
Why am I here?

230
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:17,840
I... Goddamn it, when did you become
such an asshole? What date exactly?

231
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,762
I thought Ritchie might give you
another part.

232
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,682
- Have you read the script?
- Course I read the script.

233
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,646
- Have you read the script?
- Yes.

234
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,685
If you'd read the fuckin' script,

235
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,444
you'd know there are only
four characters and three are women!

236
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:35,522
So which other fucking part
do you think I might be right for?

237
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:37,679
No other fuckin' part!

238
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,648
I don't think there's any part
in any script for you, anywhere!

239
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,765
No one's interested any more, Joe!

240
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:49,127
And you know why not?
Because you're not interested any more!

241
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:53,202
You have squandered every fuckin'
opportunity you've ever been given!

242
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,645
Take a look in the mirror next time
you're snorting off it,

243
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:58,685
because you are a mess!

244
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,239
I am tired of pretending otherwise,
so I'm giving it to you straight.

245
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:05,480
It is over. You are over.

246
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:08,037
People are tired
of your pathetic behaviour.

247
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:10,802
They don't wanna be around it
any more. Neither do I!

248
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,723
So you know what I suggest? I suggest
you get yourself a new agent!

249
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,287
Cool dog!

250
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,007
- What?
- Brussels Griffon.

251
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,080
- Brussels what?
- Brussels Griffon.

252
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,400
- The Jack Nicholson dog.
- Yeah, the fucking dog. Thanks.

253
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,569
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Where are you, Apple?

254
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,605
<i>Hi, Joe!</i>

255
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:07,761
Can you explain to me
why your dog is still in my car?

256
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,965
- <i>I need a big favour.</i>
- No.

257
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,008
- <i>Would look after him for a few days?</i>
- A few days? Are you insane?

258
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,568
<i>I have to go away.</i>

259
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:19,198
- You are not dumping your dog on me.
- <i>I'm not dumping him on you!</i>

260
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,325
- <i>Just a few days.</i>
- What's that smell?

261
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,518
Jesus!
Your dog has done a shit in my car!

262
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,327
<i>Joe?</i>

263
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,684
- No...
- <i>Joe?</i>

264
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,680
- Don't hang up!
- <i>I'm losing you.</i>

265
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,282
Don't hang up on me. Please!

266
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,042
- <i>Can't hear you.</i>
- Don't hang up!

267
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,165
Fuck! Fuck!

268
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:46,408
You like the dog?
Keep the fucking dog.

269
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,121
Hey, Joe?

270
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,963
You know David Bowie
believes in aliens?

271
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:17,607
Yeah, I know.

272
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,523
You stink! You need a bath.

273
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,406
I had a bath.

274
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,808
When?

275
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,368
I...

276
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:30,237
Exactly. You never take a bath.
You stink.

277
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:35,322
Well, how often do you have a bath then?

278
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:37,600
- Every day.
- Every day?

279
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:41,204
- Yes, every day.
- What, does your mum make you?

280
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,849
No, I just like to be clean.

281
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,285
Every day's not clean.
Every day's weird.

282
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,328
- D'you remember that ginger girl?
- Shut up!

283
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,728
Come on.

284
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:22,157
Hang on, I can't even see!

285
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:23,648
Joe!

286
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:25,957
Joe!

287
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,641
Wait here.

288
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:28,764
Alright?

289
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,840
Go round the side.

290
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,202
- Wotcher.
- Wotcher.

291
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:36,441
Hello. You're late.
You missed lunch.

292
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:40,122
- Who are you?
- I'm Boots.

293
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,927
What kind of name is that?

294
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:48,604
I know you. You're the one who had
the epileptic fit at the cinema.

295
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:53,124
- Is that a glass of selfish, Joe?
- What?

296
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,404
- Boots, would you like a drink?
- Please.

297
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,798
- Milk?
- Yeah, please.

298
00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:02,167
Joe, pour Boots a glass of milk
before you finish the bottle.

299
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,888
What film was it
made you have the fit?

300
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:07,085
<i>Ring of Bright Water?</i>

301
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,729
- The one about the otter.
- Yeah.

302
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,283
- Don't do that, Joe!
- What?

303
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,519
Put the empty bottle back in the fridge.

304
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,043
- Do you still have 'em?
- What?

305
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:25,087
- Fits.
- I haven't for a long time.

306
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,718
Well, you will. Once an epileptic,
always an epileptic.

307
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,603
Come on.

308
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,678
Kids grow up too quick these days.

309
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,045
Good God, is that child trying
to scrape the paint off the walls?

310
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:42,166
- What does "cunt" mean?
- I told you not to say that word!

311
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:43,477
- You say it!
- I do not!

312
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,605
Say it again and you'll get a hiding!

313
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:47,964
- What the hell does it mean?
- Shut up!

314
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,325
If I tell you, do you promise me
you won't say it again?

315
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:54,844
It's a very bad word for your vagina.

316
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,080
- What's my vagina?
- The proper word for your moo-moo.

317
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,729
Go outside,
or I'll make you both into piccalilli!

318
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,285
- You off already, Boots?
- Yeah.

319
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:07,281
- How's your mum?
- She's alright.

320
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,564
- Give her my love, won't you?
- Yeah.

321
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,557
- Well, bye, then.
- Bye.

322
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:18,727
I don't trust that boy.
Always looking out the sides of his eyes

323
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,279
like some old dog
waiting to steal a bone.

324
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,807
Boots!

325
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:32,680
Is that woman still 'ere?

326
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,522
- Who?
- Mrs Rogers?

327
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,128
Bye.

328
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,608
Oh, God...

329
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,165
So they had to give me
one of them enemas.

330
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:51,958
Well, I was blocked up
like an old crypt.

331
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,609
And d'you know what they found?

332
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:59,160
A plastic toy animal. Probably been
stuck in me bowels for over 20 years.

333
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:02,207
- Oh, dear.
- I must have eaten it!

334
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,043
But, you know, I can't taste a thing,
not since I hit my head.

335
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,564
I always wonder what old people
looked like when they were young.

336
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:21,765
It just makes me sad.

337
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:25,841
Cos it's all gone,
and you think, "How cruel."

338
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,808
I suppose if you
really concentrated...

339
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,928
...you might be able to imagine
the old people you know as young.

340
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:38,443
But it's really hard.

341
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:42,727
Cos all I can see
is that they're old, ill, ugly...

342
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:45,685
And their life's over.

343
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:58,487
When you watch
an old person sleeping...

344
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,843
...especially if they're very old...

345
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,442
...you think,
"Will they ever wake up again?"

346
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,678
Then they wake up very suddenly.

347
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,681
One second,
they're sleeping and lifeless.

348
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:27,488
Next second, they're turning on
the telly for the news.

349
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:32,324
"Have I missed the news?
Have I missed the news?"

350
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:44,527
When does a person stop keeping up?

351
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:01,160
Why don't you make a move, Joe?

352
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:06,441
What do you mean?

353
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,086
Don't you fancy me?

354
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,919
You can touch if you like.

355
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,320
My mum's next door.

356
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:31,005
She'll be busy.

357
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,685
She won't be in.

358
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:59,645
Are you gonna help me
with all them vegetables?

359
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,685
Or do I have to chop 'em all meself?

360
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,363
Yeah, I'm coming.
We were just talking.

361
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,961
I better go back.

362
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,766
See you later, Joe.

363
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:34,960
I hate holidays as I much as I hate
sport, and that's saying something.

364
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:39,645
I'm gonna have to go, Grace.
I might come by later.

365
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,000
- Bye.
- Bye, then.

366
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,958
I think this is ready for pouring.

367
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,086
Evelyn should keep that child
locked up at home.

368
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,523
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

369
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,283
Stop!

370
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,758
That was a good day's work.

371
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,398
I enjoy the satisfaction
of doing small things well.

372
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,439
Goodbye, Peggy Tickell!

373
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,089
Goodbye, Peggy Tickell!

374
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,644
Off already, Mrs Rogers?

375
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,124
Yes. I don't like to overstay
my welcome.

376
00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:00,608
I know when I'm wanted. Make it
pretty bloody obvious, don't they?

377
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:03,487
I've spent all day
doing their bloody cauliflower!

378
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,478
Joe?

379
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,643
Joe!

380
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,042
What?

381
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:15,040
I want you to do something for me.

382
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:18,928
Can you take these over to Evelyn,
please?

383
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:21,203
OK.

384
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,280
Say thank you to her for me.

385
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,122
Hi, Joe.

386
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,643
I was about to get in the bath.

387
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:46,119
- Mum asked me to bring these round.
- Come in.

388
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,967
Go through.

389
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:07,086
I was being a terrible tease earlier on.
You don't mind, do you?

390
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:08,602
No.

391
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:12,560
Did you like kissing me?

392
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:16,207
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

393
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:21,519
Would you like to do it again?

394
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:27,925
You look like you would.

395
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,562
Yeah.

396
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,680
Would you, Joe?

397
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:39,406
Your mum'd kill me if she found out.

398
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:41,286
She wouldn't find out.

399
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,840
I suppose she wouldn't.

400
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:58,448
You are very, very naughty.

401
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:26,484
Hey, you two, what's going on?

402
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:29,083
Quick, it's Jack!
Do your trousers up!

403
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:34,359
Quickly! Come on! Come on, out.

404
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:38,408
Out, come on! Get out!
Shit! He's back early!

405
00:41:40,169 --> 00:41:43,127
Come here, my beautiful girl!

406
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,485
- What's happened?
- Jesse thumped Jane.

407
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:50,206
Jesse, you can't go around
thumping people, you know.

408
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:52,519
- She hit me first!
- I did not!

409
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,088
Alright, that's enough.

410
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:57,320
Joe, how are you?
Haven't seen you for a while.

411
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:58,967
- OK, let me take her.
- No.

412
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,040
She's fine now.

413
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,245
Mum asked me to bring some piccalilli.

414
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:04,887
Piccalilli! Lovely.

415
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,564
- You gonna stop for a cuppa?
- No, I've got to take Jesse back.

416
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:11,004
Say thanks to your mum
for the piccalilli.

417
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,444
Shall we go and find you
some sweeties? Yeah?

418
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:23,041
How long did God take
to make the world?

419
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:26,280
Six days, and he rested on the seventh.

420
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:31,477
He should've taken longer.
He would have done a better job.

421
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:33,605
I could've done better.

422
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,885
Come on, I'll race you.

423
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:47,839
<i>85, 86, 87, 88, 89,</i>

429
00:43:08,249 --> 00:43:09,648
You bastard!

430
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:14,919
106 seconds.
That's 50 pence you owe me, Hubble.

431
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:17,919
I hope you die next time.

432
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,401
How come you can do 106 seconds
and I can't even do 30?

433
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:23,559
God-given talent I didn't ask for.

434
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,884
It's Ruth Davies.

435
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,407
Oi, Ruth!

436
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,081
I really wanna fuck you!

437
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:38,127
Well, if you do, Kevin Hubble,
and I ever find out...

438
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:42,287
She wants me.

439
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,883
- This is boring!
- What?

440
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:49,478
Fuck!

441
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:55,528
Wotcher, Ruth.

442
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:58,408
Hi, Joe.

443
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:01,879
Shit!

444
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:05,283
You look tired.

445
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:07,678
- Do I?
- Yeah.

446
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:11,157
Well, I keep dreaming
that I can't sleep

447
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,319
and I wake up exhausted.

448
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:16,398
Fuck!

449
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,805
See what you made me do?

450
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,762
I'm gonna go.

451
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,928
See ya.

452
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:32,082
Do you wanna come?

453
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,918
- What, me?
- Yeah.

454
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:38,237
OK.

455
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:44,038
Joe! I thought
we were going to the pictures.

456
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,597
Slight change of plan.

457
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:51,005
Jammy bastard!

458
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:03,320
<i>Oh, the Jean Genie lives on his back</i>

459
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,924
<i>The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks</i>

460
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:10,524
<i>He's outrageous,</i>
<i>he screams and he bawls</i>

00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:14,807
<i>The Jean Genie, let yourself go</i>

Who do you like more, Bowie or Roxy?

463
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:22,361
I can't choose,
cos they're both brilliant.

464
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,883
- You have to.
- It's impossible to choose.

465
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:27,563
If you asked me Bowie
or Deep Purple

466
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:30,402
or Roxy and Black Sabbath,
then I could choose.

467
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:33,765
But not Bowie and Roxy.

468
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:48,005
Thanks, but I don't smoke.

469
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:51,484
Right.

470
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:56,278
Here, try this on.

471
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:03,964
So do you know
what this song is about?

472
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:07,085
No.

473
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:13,846
It's about Jean Genet.
He's a French writer.

474
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,807
See, Jean Genie,
it's just a clever wordplay.

475
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:20,518
"He says he's a beautician and sells
you nutrition." He sells drugs.

476
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:23,248
"The Jean Genie lives on his back."
He's a poof.

477
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:27,038
"The Jean Genie loves
chimney stacks." He loves cocaine.

478
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:29,279
- What?
- He loves chimney stacks.

479
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,929
- What goes up chimneys?
- Smoke.

480
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:34,648
- And what makes smoke?
- Coal.

481
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:38,517
Yeah. And coke.

482
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,363
"He's walking on snow white."
It means he's walking on cocaine.

483
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,280
How do you know
that's what he means?

484
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,041
I read it in <i>NME.</i>

485
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:51,768
Boots chucked his girlfriend because
she couldn't sit through a Bowie album.

486
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,122
- He likes Bowie?
- He loves Bowie.

487
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,279
Boots is a nose-picker.

488
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,487
The kind who wipes his hand under
the seat if there isn't a tissue handy.

489
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:07,881
- Or even if there is.
- How do you know that?

490
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:10,199
I'm a good judge of character.

491
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,679
I'm not saying I mind.
I'm just saying I know.

492
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:19,443
Come on,
let's get another drink.

493
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:33,237
Red or white?

494
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,038
- White.
- Why are you whispering?

495
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,726
Relax. There's no one here.

496
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:45,524
- Can I have a look around?
- Sure.

497
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:23,438
- What are you doing?
- This carpet is unbelievable.

498
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:27,647
- How do you keep it so clean?
- No one's allowed in this room.

499
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:30,918
- Sorry.
- I don't care.

500
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,520
You can lay on it all you want.

501
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,206
This feels good.

502
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:58,478
I read that book by whatshisname.

503
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,487
- William Burroughs
- Yeah. <i>Junkie.</i>

504
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,720
Did you like it?

505
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,720
No, not really.

506
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,283
So it's back to <i>The Hobbit,</i> then.

507
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,844
How fantastic is this song?

508
00:49:26,649 --> 00:49:30,847
How could you choose between
Bryan Ferry and David Bowie?

509
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,521
They're gods.

510
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,203
Come on.

511
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:40,361
You do the backing vocals
on the next verse.

512
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,167
- What?
- Come on.

513
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:45,848
OK.

514
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,362
This is what you do.

515
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:57,482
Think Roxy girl.

516
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:02,686
I'm gonna be Bryan.

517
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:40,959
When will I see you again?

518
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:44,325
<i>When will we share</i>
<i>precious moments?</i>

519
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:51,078
- How about tomorrow?
- OK.

520
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:54,206
- We could go to the pictures.
- OK.

521
00:51:54,289 --> 00:51:58,202
- I'll meet you at the arcade at seven.
- OK.

522
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,567
Can I kiss you?

523
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:03,883
OK.

524
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:18,087
Tomorrow, then.

525
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:20,927
Seven o'clock.

526
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:47,882
We're not gonna catch anything
if those prats are splashing about.

527
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:54,602
You never see kestrel any more.

528
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:57,920
You used to be able to look up,
catch 'em on the wind.

529
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,121
Now you'll be lucky.

530
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:08,520
Hey, Joe, remember when we used
to go fishing with your dad?

531
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,884
He snared hundreds of pikes, Joe's dad.

532
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:15,121
Didn't even use a rod. He used,
like, this old leather bootlace.

533
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:17,325
He'd see a pike
laying in the riverbed,

534
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:20,446
and he'd take this old lace
and make it into a loop.

535
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,520
He'd hang the loop from a pole

536
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:25,999
and gradually, gradually just
lower it down in front of him.

537
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:29,320
He'd go into the slipknot
and onto the bank. Caught hundreds.

538
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:32,765
- Can you give me a hand?
- <i>(Kevin)</i> Oi, Joe!

539
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:36,888
"Well, if you do, Kevin Hubble,
and I ever find out!"

540
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:40,803
"Don't hurt me, Joe. Please don't
hurt me! I've never done it before."

541
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:44,120
- "I'm a virgin."
- You're such a moron, Hubble.

542
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:46,040
Wanker!

543
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:48,927
- You know Erich Conrad's a poof?
- No, he's not.

544
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,807
He is. He told his brother
and his brother told me.

545
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:55,598
He realised he was a poof when
he was watching wrestling on the telly

546
00:53:55,689 --> 00:53:57,247
and he got an erection.

547
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,320
Erich Conrad's a poof.

548
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,526
I knew that. He got a hard-on
while watching the wrestling.

549
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,601
You know Billie Jean King?
She's a lesbian.

550
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:07,759
Joe's Aunt Peggy's a lezzer.

551
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:08,964
No, she's not!

552
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:11,438
Why does she look like a bloke, then?

553
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:13,247
You're a fucking retard, Hubble!

554
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:14,842
He's trying to fuck me!

555
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:19,126
- He's trying to fuck me!
- Come back here.

556
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:22,599
My granddad just visited
a German concentration camp.

557
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:24,680
Said it was the most horrible place.

558
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:28,887
Everyone on the tour was crying.
Everything there is kept original.

559
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,927
He said Germans eat twice as much
as we do in England.

560
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:36,082
And the men, they walk around with
great big arses on 'em like women.

561
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:39,878
Old people loved the war. They
always cheer up when it's mentioned.

562
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:42,483
My grandma doesn't like foreigners.

563
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:45,169
She thinks of Indians and Africans
as animals.

564
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:48,639
She saw a man in a turban
and said, "If they live in this country,

565
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:51,323
they should be forced
to wear civilised clothes."

566
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:54,481
Well, she's right, ain't she?
Fucking niggers and Pakis!

567
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:58,528
- Coming over here, taking our jobs.
- Shut up, Hubble, you prat.

568
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:03,608
It's boring here.
I'm off to the arcade. Coming, Hubble?

569
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:07,523
No. I think I'm gonna catch some sun
and watch these losers catch a cold.

570
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:10,487
- Alright. See you later, mate.
- See you later, mate.

571
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:54,806
- What are you girls up to?
- Hello.

572
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,438
Don't you say hello to me,
you horrible girl.

573
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,726
You say,
"Good afternoon, Mrs Rogers."

574
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:06,164
It's heartbreaking the way
your mother lets you run wild.

575
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:10,367
- Good afternoon, Mrs Rogers.
- These girls shouldn't run wild.

576
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:12,326
They should be at school!

577
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:15,207
- It's summer holidays, Mrs Rogers.
- Holidays!

578
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,599
There are too many holidays! Holidays.

579
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:22,079
When I was a girl,
we didn't have all these holidays.

580
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:25,286
We had Christmas holidays.
That was all we had.

581
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,757
- I hate her.
- Just ignore her.

582
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:32,444
- She's a miserable old lady.
- She murdered her children.

583
00:56:32,529 --> 00:56:34,645
- She did!
- Did she?

584
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:36,242
She poisoned them.

585
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:39,924
Yeah. And then she chopped them up
and put the bits in the sea.

586
00:56:40,009 --> 00:56:43,445
You'd better behave, then,
or she might just do the same to you.

587
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:12,087
I wish that boy wouldn't sing.
He's gonna sour the milk.

588
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:15,237
Jane, eat it up.
You haven't touched a thing.

589
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:18,685
- I don't bloody like it!
- Jane, don't swear!

590
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,603
Don't pay any attention. She's been
swearing like a trooper all week.

591
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:26,398
- She's just testing.
- You mixed everything up together.

592
00:57:26,489 --> 00:57:29,367
I can't undo it
and put everything back into piles.

593
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,280
Just try a little bit.

594
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:33,564
Nice crop of tomatoes this year.

595
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:35,844
Was there anything else you'd like?

596
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:39,046
- Fishfingers.
- I don't think we've got any.

597
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:42,439
You know, one of those
Jehovah's Witnesses came by today.

598
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:44,724
Told me that me and my garden
will go to hell.

599
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,165
Your mum'll have to cook you something
when you get home.

600
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:50,558
I don't think
we've got anything you like.

601
00:57:50,649 --> 00:57:52,719
- Hello?
- Hi!

602
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:55,441
- You look nice
- Do I?

603
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:57,406
Sit down. I'll give you a cup of tea.

604
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:26,240
Joe, are you in there?

605
00:58:32,529 --> 00:58:34,599
I'm sorry, I need the loo.

606
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,207
Hi.

607
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:41,961
You smell nice.

608
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:45,562
- Have you got a date?
- Yeah.

609
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:48,607
Come to my house
before you meet your girlfriend.

610
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:50,998
- I don't...
- You won't be sorry.

611
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,045
Jack's at his mother's.

612
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:11,804
<i>Warnings of gales in Viking,</i>
<i>Forties, Cromarty, Forth...</i>

613
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,607
Hold on.

614
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:17,721
- Let me look at you.
- Look at my little Elvis!

615
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,402
Can I go now?

616
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,442
Yeah, go on.

617
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:26,883
- Don't be late.
- <i>... high, becoming rough.</i>

618
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:29,608
<i>Showers, moderate or good.</i>

619
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:30,838
<i>Dogger, Bailey...</i>

620
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:41,842
- Joe?
- I'm late already.

621
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:44,602
Don't be silly. I won't keep you long.

622
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:46,645
- Come in
- But I'm really late.

623
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:49,243
Just for a minute.

624
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:51,797
Anyway, it's good
to keep a girl waiting.

625
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,807
Joe!

626
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:38,080
Take your shirt off.

627
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:40,488
Undo me.

628
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:31,083
Go faster! Go faster, Joe!

629
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:50,686
Don't worry about Joe.
He's always late.

630
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:54,043
He'll be late for his own funeral.

631
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:58,641
Go on.

632
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:10,086
Sorry I'm late.
I had to do something for my mum.

633
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:11,682
Couldn't get away.

634
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,163
Do you find this approach
usually works?

635
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,038
What?

636
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:19,643
Let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

637
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:20,798
What?

638
01:02:20,889 --> 01:02:26,247
Your neck's covered in love bites!
You really surprise me, Joe Scott.

639
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:31,038
Fuck!

640
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,081
Fuck.

641
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:38,608
Fucking hell!

642
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:41,446
Did Evelyn do that?

643
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:44,846
It was Evelyn, wasn't it?

644
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:47,845
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

645
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:51,524
- What d'you mean, nothing happened?
- Nothing happened!

646
01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:55,488
What are you gonna do about Ruth?
Didn't look happy, did she?

647
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:59,163
You think if I'm out the way,
you stand a chance.

648
01:02:59,249 --> 01:03:01,365
Well, you don't. Not with Ruth.

649
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:03,599
Just fucking calm down, for fuck's sake!

650
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:12,441
- Hit him!
- Shut up, Chillo!

651
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:15,407
- You're supposed to be mates!
- Go on, Joe!

652
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:18,357
Go on!

653
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:21,845
Yes, Boots! Go on, mate!

654
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:23,683
Come on!

655
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:26,920
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

656
01:03:27,009 --> 01:03:30,365
- Get off me!
- If I get off, you'll calm down?

657
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:32,803
Just get off!

658
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:35,688
Hit him, Joe!

659
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:40,041
Fuck off!

660
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,567
You fucking deserved that, Joe!

661
01:03:51,689 --> 01:03:54,886
Looking good, Joe. Looking good!

662
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:20,325
I like a storm,
but this is more than enough.

663
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:22,764
We can go beachcombing tomorrow.

664
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:25,966
You always get something good
washed up after a storm.

665
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:30,918
God!

666
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:45,922
What's wrong with him?

667
01:04:50,089 --> 01:04:51,522
Have you been in my room?

668
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,848
I tidied it up.

669
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,523
Did you enjoy
looking through my things?

670
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:00,726
- I always do!
- Just stay out of my room!

671
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:08,917
I don't think his date went very well.

672
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,007
Hi, Joe.

673
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:44,119
- Is something wrong?
- No.

674
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:47,161
Are you sure?

675
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:50,162
Look what you did.

676
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:52,717
- Did I do that?
- Yeah, you did.

677
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:54,606
Well, I didn't mean to.

678
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,327
I didn't know what I was doing.
I really didn't mean to.

679
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:02,602
I didn't, Joe.

680
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:09,003
It was so amazing,
I didn't know what I was doing.

681
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:17,805
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

682
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:30,767
Jack's at work.

683
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:35,121
If you wanna come back.

684
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:17,885
Just gotta get Jane out.

685
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:22,520
- Out.
- I don't want to go out!

686
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:26,124
- Out!
- But I want to watch <i>The Clangers!</i>

687
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:29,485
You watch too much TV. If you go out
I'll buy you an ice cream.

688
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:32,527
- I don't want to go out!
- Do as I say! Now get out!

689
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:35,362
- I hate you!
- Yeah, and I hate you, too!

690
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:19,008
Thumbs into the hole.

691
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:32,040
That's a good girl.

692
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:33,202
Jane!

693
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,807
Jane! Come away!

694
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:39,480
Come away, Jane!

695
01:10:43,049 --> 01:10:45,927
Jane! It's a mine!

696
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:49,285
Jane!

697
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:52,645
Come away! It's a mine!

698
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:54,048
Grace!

699
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,359
Peggy! Grace!

700
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:01,806
Peggy, come here!

701
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:08,443
Jane, come away!

702
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:11,805
- It's a mine!
- It's mine!

703
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:14,478
Jane!

704
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:01,203
Mrs Rogers, are you alright?

705
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:05,441
I tried to save her, but I couldn't.

706
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,406
That poor girl!

707
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,207
That poor wee girl.

708
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:11,849
Who?

709
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:15,527
I shouted to her. "Come away!"

710
01:12:15,609 --> 01:12:16,928
"Come away!"

711
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,727
Who?

712
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:22,563
Evelyn's little girl, Jane.

713
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:25,168
Oh, my God!

714
01:12:32,169 --> 01:12:35,559
I saw her from my window.

715
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:38,322
Grace, take Jesse
back up to the house.

716
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:41,162
One of them sea mines from the war.

717
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:43,126
Mrs Rogers, are you alright?

718
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:45,165
Washed up by the storm.

719
01:12:45,249 --> 01:12:48,605
Mrs Rogers, you stay right there.
I'm gonna be right back.

720
01:12:51,849 --> 01:12:54,682
- What happened?
- Go take care of Mrs Rogers.

721
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:56,919
- What happened?
- Just do what I say!

722
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,287
Who will tell Jack?

723
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:43,203
He already knows.
The police phoned him at work.

724
01:13:45,569 --> 01:13:47,127
He'll blame me.

725
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:50,599
He won't blame you.
It's not your fault.

726
01:13:50,689 --> 01:13:53,362
He will. He'll blame me.

727
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:57,365
He thinks I never loved her.

728
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:01,765
I'm sure he doesn't think that.

729
01:14:03,769 --> 01:14:05,680
She never liked me.

730
01:14:09,129 --> 01:14:11,848
Not since the day she was born.

731
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:18,403
- She cried every time I held her.
- Evelyn, don't do this to yourself.

732
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:20,081
It's true.

733
01:14:20,809 --> 01:14:23,801
I tried, I really did.

734
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:28,366
But it was almost
a physical thing.

735
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:36,520
I always envied the way
your kids were with you.

736
01:14:38,009 --> 01:14:40,523
Of course Jane loved you.

737
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:44,921
It's just kids are strange. They have
funny ways of showing love sometimes.

738
01:14:49,129 --> 01:14:50,767
Can you go now?

739
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:55,606
- Are you sure?
- I wanna be by myself.

740
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:02,644
- If you're sure. I just...
- Go.

741
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:06,123
Please.

742
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:14,320
If you want anything...

743
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:17,121
Anything at all...

744
01:15:26,649 --> 01:15:30,881
I want my baby!

745
01:16:29,849 --> 01:16:33,205
Bodies used to be kept
in the house for 12 days.

746
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:35,723
Everyone kept the body
as long as they could.

747
01:16:35,809 --> 01:16:38,482
They didn't dare part with it.

748
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,799
Now you can't get rid of it
quick enough.

749
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:45,360
You see, they were afraid
the corpse might still be alive.

750
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:48,839
That was the real reason
for hanging on to it.

751
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:52,604
People now have
a postmortem, glory be,

752
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:54,645
and it's all settled in a minute.

753
01:16:54,729 --> 01:17:00,361
But years ago, there were some folk
who got buried alive.

754
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,804
Have you seen Jesse anywhere?

755
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,766
O-Out on the porch.

756
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:06,601
And Joe, is he ready?

757
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:09,724
Joe? Joe?

758
01:17:09,809 --> 01:17:13,119
People used to leave an instruction
in their will

759
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:16,087
to have a vein cut,
just to be on the safe side.

760
01:17:17,569 --> 01:17:21,562
Come on. Got to be there in
ten minutes. Can't keep them waiting.

761
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,607
You go on. I'll be there in a minute.

762
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:29,728
No, you come with us now!
I don't want you to be late.

763
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:34,362
I don't know
why they're having a funeral.

764
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,679
There's no body in the coffin.

765
01:17:36,769 --> 01:17:40,921
It's important to say goodbye.
It's a symbol. Now, come on.

766
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:44,160
I'm not ready!
You go. I'll be there in a minute!

767
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:48,325
This isn't about you, Joe.

768
01:17:50,369 --> 01:17:52,519
This is about Jack and Evelyn...

769
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:56,801
...and the terrible loss
they've suffered.

770
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:00,562
Please.

771
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:04,239
Please don't let them down.

772
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:09,285
Oh, my God, it's you!

773
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:20,686
Where's Peggy?

774
01:22:41,809 --> 01:22:44,369
You've been late your whole life, Joe.

775
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:47,327
I'm sure Ruth'll be touched
that you even turned up.

776
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:49,127
I just can't believe I missed it.

777
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:54,363
I can't believe you're here
at all! It was a lovely service.

778
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:56,519
And such a turnout.

779
01:22:56,609 --> 01:22:59,442
They couldn't get everyone
in the church.

780
01:22:59,529 --> 01:23:04,205
You should've seen the flowers.
More than Lady Di.

781
01:23:04,289 --> 01:23:08,680
Poor Ruth. She saw it happen.
Dropped down dead in front of her.

782
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:10,919
One minute chatting away happily,

783
01:23:11,009 --> 01:23:13,603
the next thing she knew
he was dead on the ground.

784
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,647
Terrible. They said it was an aneurysm.

785
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:20,203
Left four kids to bring up on her own.

786
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:24,521
They're hardly kids.
Joe must be 15 now.

787
01:23:24,609 --> 01:23:27,521
Good God, is he really?
Seems like yesterday.

788
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:31,318
Luke, who's 14, Max, who's 12,

789
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:35,925
and then there's a lovely girl,
Angelica, she must be ten.

790
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:39,366
Boots was a wonderful father.

791
01:23:43,729 --> 01:23:46,038
Hopeless with money, though.

792
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:48,689
In hock up to his eyeballs.

793
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:54,968
I reckon Ruth will lose the house
and the land.

794
01:23:55,049 --> 01:23:57,643
She had no idea how bad things were.

795
01:23:57,729 --> 01:23:59,924
Silly man hid it all from her.

796
01:24:00,009 --> 01:24:02,648
She really is in serious trouble.

797
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,921
Thank you.

798
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:11,806
Would you like some cake, Joe?

799
01:24:11,889 --> 01:24:13,527
Thanks.

800
01:24:31,129 --> 01:24:34,007
So what do you think of Graceland,
Joe?

801
01:24:37,049 --> 01:24:39,244
It's alright, isn't it?

802
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,047
Thanks to you, Joe.

803
01:24:43,169 --> 01:24:46,081
I bet Elvis was never as cosy!

804
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,447
This is my room.

805
01:25:18,209 --> 01:25:20,484
This is Peggy's.

806
01:25:20,569 --> 01:25:24,005
Took me a while
to get used to sleeping in my own room,

807
01:25:24,089 --> 01:25:27,525
but must say, I quite like it now.

808
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:31,722
This is yours.

809
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:37,163
I didn't like to throw anything away.

810
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:45,962
Good night, dear.

811
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:44,199
- Wakey-wakey!
- Fucking hell!

812
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:47,204
- Morning!
- Hi, Jesse.

813
01:26:47,289 --> 01:26:49,280
Oy, bear's breath!

814
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:54,808
- So, what are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you, too.

815
01:26:54,889 --> 01:26:57,847
Well, it's quite a surprise.
There you are.

816
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,362
I'm here for the funeral.

817
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:04,838
If we'd known,
we could've put him on ice.

818
01:27:06,209 --> 01:27:10,725
Don't feel bad. Ruth will be glad
you came. At least, I think she will.

819
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,401
You think she will?

820
01:27:13,809 --> 01:27:16,607
Get yourself ready.
I'll take you over to see her.

821
01:27:20,009 --> 01:27:24,366
- You think she will?
- It's been a long time.

822
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,405
It's been a lifetime.

823
01:27:28,249 --> 01:27:29,887
Welcome home, Joe.

824
01:27:58,409 --> 01:28:02,368
<i>Look, I feel really weird about this,</i>

825
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:07,239
<i>so why don't you go in first</i>
<i>and tell her that I'm here?</i>

826
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:08,842
<i>She might not want to see me.</i>

827
01:28:08,929 --> 01:28:11,841
<i>She knows you're here.</i>
<i>I've told her already.</i>

828
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:13,248
<i>What did she say?</i>

829
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:16,446
- <i>Not very much.</i>
- <i>She must have said something.</i>

830
01:28:17,769 --> 01:28:20,602
What would she say?
You haven't seen her for 25 years.

831
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:24,045
Think she'll get down on her knees
and thank God you're back?

832
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:27,405
She just lost her husband,
the man she's loved all her life.

833
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:31,960
Jeez! This might come as a surprise,
but she's not thinking about you.

834
01:28:32,049 --> 01:28:33,482
Christ!

835
01:29:33,169 --> 01:29:37,242
She's at the cemetery.
She's collecting the sympathy cards.

836
01:29:57,609 --> 01:30:02,239
When I was a child, I thought being
brave meant that you had to take action.

837
01:30:03,769 --> 01:30:07,159
That to have a dream or get forward
in life, you needed courage.

838
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:14,364
But the only thing you need courage for
is for standing still.

839
01:30:39,729 --> 01:30:41,560
She's over there.

840
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:53,637
Come on, then!
What are you waiting for?

841
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,962
- Aren't you coming?
- No, I'll be over here.

842
01:31:52,569 --> 01:31:54,002
Hello, Joe.

843
01:31:54,929 --> 01:31:56,601
Hello, Ruth.

844
01:31:57,769 --> 01:31:59,680
I came for the funeral.

845
01:32:01,969 --> 01:32:03,641
You're a bit late.

846
01:32:05,249 --> 01:32:10,721
Still, it's reassuring to know
that some things never change.

847
01:32:15,609 --> 01:32:18,248
I heard it was wonderful. I mean...

848
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:21,399
Yeah. It was wonderful.

849
01:32:23,809 --> 01:32:25,561
It was good of you to come.

850
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:31,160
How are you?

851
01:32:31,249 --> 01:32:33,717
Fucking stupid question. Sorry.

852
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:36,762
Yeah.

853
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:43,327
- I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say.

854
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:47,245
My ears are ringing with sympathy,
but it's not...

855
01:32:49,049 --> 01:32:50,960
It's not gonna bring him back.

856
01:32:56,009 --> 01:33:01,129
He had a rare gift, Joe.
He knew his place in the world.

857
01:33:02,449 --> 01:33:05,122
He found wonder in simple things.

858
01:33:07,009 --> 01:33:09,807
He lived in the moment like a child.

859
01:33:12,209 --> 01:33:14,723
That's a rare gift in a man.

860
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:25,803
Do you know what
the strangest thing is?

861
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:29,047
I can't cry.

862
01:33:30,169 --> 01:33:34,082
It's the saddest moment in my life
and I can't cry!

863
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:39,244
I mean, I wish I could cry.

864
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:45,047
There must be something
terribly wrong with me.

865
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:47,281
If there's anything I can do...

866
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:49,485
No.

867
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:05,204
I was so afraid to come back.

868
01:34:08,529 --> 01:34:10,440
You were right to leave.

869
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:15,563
It allowed you to do what you wanted.

870
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:18,117
Or maybe what I thought I wanted.

871
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:29,088
- I should be getting back.
- Yeah. OK. Sure.

872
01:34:30,769 --> 01:34:34,682
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm sorry I was late.

873
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:39,004
He would have laughed.

874
01:34:41,529 --> 01:34:42,962
Well...

875
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:45,880
Goodbye, then.

876
01:34:45,969 --> 01:34:47,448
Goodbye, Ruth.

877
01:35:16,889 --> 01:35:18,845
- How was it?
- Weird.

878
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,526
- This is Jane's grave?
- Yup.

879
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:32,764
And this one is Evelyn's.

880
01:35:33,569 --> 01:35:34,843
Evelyn died?

881
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:37,682
I hope so.
She's in trouble if she didn't.

882
01:35:37,769 --> 01:35:39,566
How did? Mum didn't tell me!

883
01:35:39,649 --> 01:35:41,560
Well, there's a story!

884
01:35:41,649 --> 01:35:44,368
She was drawn to trouble
like a drunk to the bottle.

885
01:35:44,449 --> 01:35:46,485
If she couldn't find it, she'd make it.

886
01:35:46,569 --> 01:35:49,288
Jesus, you get more like
Peggy Tickell every day!

887
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:53,487
- I'm not like Peggy!
- Just tell me what happened!

888
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:56,960
Are you wearing make-up?

889
01:35:58,049 --> 01:36:01,166
- Fuck off!
- Alright, alright.

890
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:06,441
Well, soon after Jane died,
Jack and Evelyn split up.

891
01:36:06,529 --> 01:36:09,805
He never got over Jane's death,
and the final straw was,

892
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:11,925
do you remember Kevin Hubble?

893
01:36:12,009 --> 01:36:13,522
Yeah.

894
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:16,487
Jack found Evelyn in bed with him.

895
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:19,683
She married him!

896
01:36:21,369 --> 01:36:22,643
Much to her regret.

897
01:36:22,729 --> 01:36:25,880
He was a monster.
He made her life a living hell.

898
01:36:25,969 --> 01:36:27,925
And she stuck it out for years.

899
01:36:28,009 --> 01:36:31,558
It was as if she felt she deserved it.
He beat her, tormented her.

900
01:36:31,649 --> 01:36:33,401
He was a real bastard.

901
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:36,686
Anyway, so she finally leaves him.
Steals his car.

902
01:36:36,769 --> 01:36:39,283
I don't know why. It was a wreck.

903
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:43,282
Broke down on the motorway,
got out, and was hit by a lorry!

904
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:45,929
- Oh, God!
- Her head was chopped straight off.

905
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:49,399
And the strangest thing was,
they never found it!

906
01:36:49,489 --> 01:36:51,400
Well, what happened to it?

907
01:36:51,489 --> 01:36:55,960
Well, they thought a fox
might've taken it.

908
01:36:56,049 --> 01:36:58,847
They don't know
and I don't suppose they ever will.

909
01:37:09,169 --> 01:37:11,922
- Are you wearing make-up?
- No, I'm not wearing!

910
01:37:12,009 --> 01:37:13,965
Well, it's concealer.

911
01:37:15,609 --> 01:37:17,600
- You are wearing make up!
- Fuck off!

912
01:48:55,169 --> 01:48:57,080
