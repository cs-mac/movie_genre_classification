1
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,271
And it is written 
that in the year 63 B.C...

2
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,313
...the Roman legions,
like a scourge of locusts...

3
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,821
...poured through the east...

4
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,575
...laying waste the land of Canaan
and the kingdom of Judea.

5
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,910
Rome's imperial armies,
a tumult in the hills...

6
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,497
...struck Jerusalem's walls
in a three-month siege.

7
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,836
Breaching the gates, these legions laid
the dust of battle with a shower of blood.

8
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,680
Under the eye of General Pompey,
the Holy City fell...

9
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,358
...her people strewn like wheat
in the harvest time of Rome.

10
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,172
While Pompey, triumphant...

11
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,380
...dared take the last high place...

12
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,715
...the still-living heart 
of the city...

13
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,430
...the Temple.

14
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,974
Here, on this most sacred ground
in all Jerusalem...

15
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,439
...now Pompey's horse took its way.

16
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,128
Where no pagan had ever set foot,
in the court of the priests...

17
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,290
...most irreverent Pompey 
stood himself down.

18
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,497
At last, here was the fruit 
of the harvest.

19
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,250
Here, it was said,
lay the treasure house of Jehovah...

20
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:59,836
...great statues of gold,
as bright as the sun in this ancient land.

21
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,555
So Pompey, burning for the touch 
of precious metals...

22
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,966
...entered the sanctuary.

23
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,695
But entering, Pompey found
only a scroll of parchment...

24
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,911
...a covenant with the one God,
handed down by Moses...

25
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,327
...and venerated through the years.

26
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,454
Thus, for more than 50 years
after Pompey's invasion...

27
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,756
...the history of Judea could be read
by the light of burning towns.

28
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,098
If gold was not the harvest...

29
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,760
...there was a richness of people
to be gathered.

30
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,141
The battalions of Caesar Augustus
brought in the crop.

31
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,072
Like sheep from 
their own green fields...

32
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,526
...the Jews went to the slaughter.

33
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,130
They went from the stone quarries
to build Rome's triumphal arches.

34
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,554
But Caesar could find no Jew
to press Rome's laws...

35
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,060
...on this fallen land.

36
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:05,230
So Caesar named one Herod the Great,
an Arab of the Bedouin tribe...

37
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,862
...as the new, false,
and maleficent king of the Jews.

38
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:19,532
But from the dust at Herod's feet,
rebellions of Jews rose up.

39
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,497
And Herod, in reply, 
planted evil seeds...

40
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,962
...from which forests of Roman crosses
grew high on Jerusalem's hills.

41
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,635
And Herod the Great, 
passing pleased...

42
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,139
...bade the forest multiply.

43
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,268
Yet, trapped in this darkness,
the Jews survived...

44
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,558
...by one promise.

45
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,900
God would send the Messiah
to deliver them forth.

46
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,371
And it came to pass in those days...

47
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,204
...that a decree went out
from Caesar Augustus...

48
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,710
...that all the world 
should be taxed.

49
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,543
And all went to be taxed,
everyone into his own city.

50
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,129
So it was that Joseph, 
a carpenter...

51
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,590
...went up from Galilee, 
unto Bethlehem...

52
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,676
...to be taxed 
with his espoused wife, Mary...

53
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,933
...who was with holy child.

54
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,222
He found his own city
much corrupted by Rome.

55
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,998
Are you the innkeeper?

56
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,046
There is no room. No room. 
Not even for a fly to squeeze in.

57
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,467
Please, it's not for me. 
It's for my wife. She's expecting a child.

58
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,174
You can find a place in the street.

59
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,264
She's expecting her child tonight.

60
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,887
Maybe I can give you 
a stall in the stable.

61
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,524
We will have to spend 
the night in the stable.

62
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,748
Now, when this holy child
was born in Bethlehem of Judea...

63
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,289
...three wise men 
came from the east.

64
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:37,131
These were Caspar, 
Melchior and Balthazar...

65
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,967
...of Mesopotamia, 
Persia and Ethiopia.

66
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,823
A king of Judea, born in a stable?

67
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,908
What kind of mockery is this?

68
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,831
Herod is the only king in Judea.
Who is this pretender?

69
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,368
Is there something 
in your scriptures...

70
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,662
...about a new messiah 
being born at this time?

71
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:40,550
False messiahs are born
under every cloud, Your Majesty.

72
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,337
What shall we do, my son?

73
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,518
You are my king, Father.
It is for you to command.

74
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,723
Lucius...

75
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:58,735
...order all newborn male children
in that town put to the sword.

76
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,779
That is my command, Lucius.

77
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,279
I am a Roman soldier.

78
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,445
I do not murder children.

79
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,911
You are in my service 
by command of Caesar.

80
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,999
Dare you disobey Caesar?

81
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,938
Mary, Mary...

82
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,573
...while I slept, 
I heard a voice saying:

83
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,736
"Take the child and his mother,
flee into Egypt...

84
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,781
...and stay there 
until you are told to return."

85
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,500
Then we will go.

86
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,678
And so, when Joseph and Mary 
fled into Egypt...

87
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,439
...Herod's men, 
seeking all newborn sons...

88
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,897
...did slaughter 
the innocents of Bethlehem.

89
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,205
Not my son!

90
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,706
Help me!

91
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,656
I cannot breathe.

92
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,199
Help me to my throne.

93
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,296
A king who cannot walk to his own throne
is no longer a king, Father.

94
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,058
Put me on my throne.

95
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,224
I will not die on my knees.

96
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,745
So Herod the Great,
crushed by his many murders...

97
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,002
...self-crucified, fell dead.

98
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:50,258
And Herod Antipas 
took murder for his crown.

99
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,004
And so it was 
that with Herod's death...

100
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:59,392
...Joseph brought his family out of Egypt,
and betook them to Nazareth...

101
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,722
...where the years passed, 
numbering 12.

102
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,861
- You are Joseph, the carpenter?
- Yes.

103
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,694
My camel litter needs repair.

104
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,733
I'll look at it.

105
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,862
- Peace be to you.
- And to you.

106
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,702
- Refresh yourself.
- Thank you.

107
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,997
- Your son?
- Yes.

108
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,209
And does he like being a carpenter?

109
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,087
Yes, he does.

110
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,008
There's a big world outside this garden,
do you want him to see it?

111
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,098
He will see it soon enough.

112
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,769
Let me take him with me. 
I'll pay you well.

113
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,979
I could use a lad like that
to help me with my caravan.

114
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,741
No. Someday he will leave me...

115
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,989
...but someone else will call him.

116
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,323
And who will that be?

117
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,907
My son will know him when he comes.

118
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,877
- I can mend it by tomorrow.
- Good.

119
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,342
Have no fear.

120
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,755
We're simply checking the census
against the tax rolls.

121
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,382
Now, you are...

122
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,762
...Joseph.

123
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,392
- And you live here with your wife, Mary.
- That is so.

124
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,938
Who's this boy?

125
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,566
My son, Jesus.

126
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,529
I have no record of his birth.
When was he born?

127
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,032
Twelve years ago.

128
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,488
- Where?
- In Bethlehem.

129
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,085
Bethlehem.

130
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,471
Count those in the next house.

131
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,691
See that the boy is registered
before the year is out.

132
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:22,285
Thus, Joseph's family
were once more forgotten.

133
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,946
Twenty years passed.

134
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,912
And Pontius Pilate, 
new governor of Judea...

135
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,953
...brought fresh armies 
south and east.

136
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,508
But in the hills,
10,000 rebel Jews lay hidden.

137
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,966
Their leader, Barabbas,
wanted as criminal and killer...

138
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,223
...now baited his traps 
for the Roman wolves.

139
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,073
There's too many of them, Barabbas.

140
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,154
We will divide them.

141
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,594
- There's a water sign on the hill.
- Make sure it's safe.

142
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,802
There's fresh water ahead, sir.

143
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,715
- Shall I give the men a rest?
- Not too long.

144
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,384
Take one column to the waterhole.

145
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,928
Column 1, follow me.

146
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,604
Columns, rest!

147
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,648
Give me some wine.

148
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,194
How much farther is Jerusalem?

149
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,067
Another day's journey.

150
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,029
You should drink water, my husband.
Wine only increases the thirst.

151
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,199
I enjoy it.

152
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,873
Judea. A fine wedding present
your father gave me.

153
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,842
My dear Pontius...

154
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:30,056
...it is said whoever can govern Jerusalem
can govern anywhere, even Rome.

155
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,890
Do you think Tiberius really has me
in mind as his successor in Rome?

156
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,189
I wish I knew my father's mind...

157
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,443
...as well as I know 
my husband's ambition.

158
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,329
And Herod Antipas rode out 
to meet Pontius Pilate...

159
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,456
...and show him 
the way to Jerusalem.

160
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,919
Another troublemaker. 
Who is this one?

161
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,083
This one is called John the Baptist.

162
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,925
He preaches to the people to repent
before the coming of the Messiah.

163
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,681
I baptize you with water.

164
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,969
But one mightier 
than I shall come after me.

165
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,561
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

166
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,070
One more messiah on the way.

167
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,153
Will these Jews never tire
of inventing deliverers?

168
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,075
I have heard that name, 
John the Baptist.

169
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,336
I hear he speaks evil things of me
wherever he goes.

170
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,169
His heart should be ripped 
from his body.

171
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,879
Your daughter, Herodias,
grows more like her mother day by day.

172
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,132
Do I not please you?

173
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,603
My stepdaughter
pleases me very much, Salome.

174
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,026
Lucius, keep your eye on this man.

175
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,025
One day you'll have to arrest him.

176
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,532
- On what grounds?
- On my orders.

177
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,626
I'm bound only to take orders 
from the Roman governor when he arrives.

178
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:26,038
Tell me, Lucius,
what manner of man is Pontius Pilate?

179
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,299
How should I treat him?

180
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,500
What is his weakness?

181
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,295
Same as any man. Vanity.

182
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,343
Call the others to return!

183
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,185
Legions, all stand!

183
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
Forward!

184
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,081
Barabbas! Barabbas!

185
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,707
Barabbas!

186
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,656
- Who are these men? Bandits?
- They call themselves patriots.

187
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,665
A man named Barabbas leads them.

188
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,584
Have you captured him?

189
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,041
This land is filled with caves
and hidden valleys.

190
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,707
It'd take half the legions of Rome
to ferret them out.

191
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,217
I want him in chains
before the end of the year.

192
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,094
Putting him 
in chains would be easy...

193
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,130
...but putting our hands on him...

194
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,220
...that's what's difficult.

195
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,687
I baptize you with water.

196
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,275
But one mightier than I shall come.

197
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:44,065
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

198
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:50,992
Are you Elijah?

199
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,620
No, I am not.

200
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,368
Are you the Messiah?

201
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,956
No, I am not.

202
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,464
I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.

203
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:08,180
The Messiah is one 
who will come after me.

204
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,212
You are welcome.

205
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,633
Peace be on this house.

206
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,972
What would you have of me?

207
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,388
I seek your son.

208
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,228
My son has gone into the desert.

209
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,978
Why did he come to the river?

210
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,319
For you to baptize him.

211
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,157
He is without sin. 
How could I baptize him?

212
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,424
I preach in the wilderness...

213
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,927
...but the Word 
must be brought to Jerusalem.

214
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,430
Yet I know I am not 
the one to deliver it.

215
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,092
Only he can.

216
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,309
When his time comes...

217
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,853
...he will be there.

218
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,443
You say that with sadness.

219
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,446
And joy.

220
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,316
And Jesus, baptized...

221
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,282
...returned from Jordan,
and went into the wilderness.

222
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,660
And with the baptism,
the Holy Spirit came upon him...

223
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,201
...and a voice said to Jesus:

224
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:28,497
"Thou art my beloved son,
in thee I am well pleased."

225
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,171
And Jesus knew the wilderness...

226
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,506
...its day of heat...

227
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,054
...its night of cold and solitude.

228
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,844
And stayed himself there
to commune with God...

229
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,764
...and strengthen himself
for the times to come.

230
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,059
And ate nothing and hungered.

231
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,104
And brought his soul forth 
in the light...

232
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,238
...to be seen of himself and known.

233
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,038
And was 40 days 
tempted of the devil.

234
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,414
Behold. I am here.

235
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,008
Come. I command you.

236
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,593
Come. Be tried and found wanting.

237
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:25,808
If you are the Son of God, command
these stones that they be turned to bread.

238
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,818
Man does not live by bread alone...

239
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,526
...but by every word of God.

240
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,524
Behold.

241
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:17,030
I show you all the kingdoms of the world,
in a moment of time.

242
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,619
All this will I give you,
and the glory of them.

243
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,498
If you will worship me, 
all shall be yours.

244
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,585
Lo! Come to this high place.

245
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:24,802
If you are the Son of God,
cast yourself down from here.

246
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:29,470
For will not His angels save you
from falling and prevent your death?

247
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,476
Come to the high place.

248
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,063
Be gone!

249
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,449
I worship the Lord my God...

250
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,120
...and only to Him do I do service.

251
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,204
Come!

252
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,078
Come, if you will...

253
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:00,463
...but I shall not call upon
the Lord my God to stop you.

254
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,969
You shall not force me to put
the Lord my God to the proof.

255
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,984
And when the devil had ended
all his temptations, he departed away.

256
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:32,870
And Jesus came out of the wilderness,
and was seen by men.

257
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,587
There is your new rabbi.
He is the Lamb of God.

258
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,144
And Jesus called those 
of his choice.

259
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,777
And two of the chosen
were John and Andrew...

260
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,358
...and they followed where he led.

261
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,948
And Jesus took himself down
by the Sea of Galilee.

262
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:14,958
And there did name his third apostle,
and summon him forth on land.

263
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,914
Simon! Simon, you have been chosen!

264
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,218
You are Simon.

265
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,720
You shall be called Peter, 
the rock...

266
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,308
...upon which I will build.

267
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:42,898
What will you have me do, Rabbi?
I am just a fisherman.

268
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,156
Come with me...

269
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,902
...and I will make you 
a fisher of men.

270
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,503
Attention.

271
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,611
I have just made a tour of the city.

272
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,448
I found no statues, no banners...

273
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,235
...no emblems of Caesar anywhere.

274
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,074
Where are they?

275
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,749
The Jews have only one god.

276
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,829
Their law forbids 
the presence of any image.

277
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,540
Where are the chests
I brought from Rome?

278
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,551
Open them.

279
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,742
A good likeness of Tiberius, 
is it not?

280
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,578
Surely they dare not object
to the emperor's image.

281
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,461
These people can.

282
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,372
Their law is their religion.

283
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,586
Place them on the pillars 
of their Temple.

284
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,095
Behold. The sign of the pagan.

285
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,470
As God overthrew 
Sodom and Gomorrah...

286
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,435
...so shall He send hosts
to destroy the idol-worshipers.

287
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,814
The day is coming when the sword
shall descend upon her legions.

288
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,398
Her mighty kings and princes
shall grow feeble.

289
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,488
Her stolen treasures made worthless.

290
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,029
Her cities shall crumble into dust.

291
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,958
We shall raise our voice...

292
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,289
...and be heard.

293
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,875
- Take down the plaques!
- Take down the plaques!

294
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,416
Take down the plaques!

295
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,754
Take down the plaques!

296
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,759
When he comes,
he will clear the threshing floor...

297
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,845
...and gather the grain 
into his barn.

298
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,759
But the chaff...

299
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,146
...he will burn 
with unquenchable fire.

300
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,816
The shepherds who lead 
their flocks astray...

301
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,023
...shall be cast out.

302
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,114
The high shall fall...

303
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,446
- Make him stop.
- ...and the fallen shall rise.

304
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,610
Draw the curtains.

305
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,246
The cry of the wicked 
shall fall upon...

306
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,577
It's a very strange voice. 
Who is that man?

307
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,833
Just another prophet.

308
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,211
An agitator.

309
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,170
Must he agitate beneath 
your palace window? Send him away.

310
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,505
The harangue 
is directed against you...

311
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,342
...for mounting graven images
on our Temple walls.

312
00:45:56,504 --> 00:46:00,805
- The incidents in Caesarea were bad.
- The plaques stay.

313
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,431
Do something about this man.

314
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,809
He is harmless.

315
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,146
He gives the people
the type of entertainment they want.

316
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,310
It is not wise to molest him.

317
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,320
My husband 
is afraid of that madman.

318
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,026
He thinks he's a holy man.

319
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,194
A holy man who speaks 
words of treason.

320
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,035
Caiaphas, you are the high priest
in that man's house of God.

321
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,699
Do you not punish such conduct?

322
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:29,959
Punishment does not dampen their ardor,
rather it increases their wrath.

323
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,050
We have found it wiser to ignore
the ravings of these false prophets...

324
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,051
...than to persecute them.

325
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,172
In my opinion,
this man seeks martyrdom.

326
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,099
I will put a stop
to his voice tomorrow.

327
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,387
Tomorrow. You've been saying that
ever since he came from Jerusalem.

328
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,555
I have given my word.

329
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,733
The word of a king or a puppet?

330
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,738
...and strip the clothes of the slaves,
and make them go naked.

331
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,406
Men groan...

332
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:02,029
- ...and the souls of the oppressed...
- Go away, you vile man!

333
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,742
Daughter of adultery...

334
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,378
...there is but one 
that can save you.

335
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,581
Go seek him out.

336
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,920
Kneel at his feet and ask forgiveness
for the sins of your mother.

337
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,465
That man is no prophet.
He wears the rags of a beggar.

338
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,929
- It is best to ignore him.
- Ignore him?

339
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,265
There is only one way 
to deal with a beggar.

340
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,272
You! You, there! Speaker!

341
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,308
Step forward!

342
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,410
You have your alms. 
Now, be gone!

343
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,586
Bring the beggar in.

344
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,811
When your legions under Pompey
invaded our land...

345
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,146
...they slew all the priests 
in the temple.

346
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,813
Since then, we have received
our priesthood appointments from Rome.

347
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,359
The people have little love
for any man appointed by your emperor.

348
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,540
At night the thief goes out...

349
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,590
...in darkness 
he digs under the house...

350
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,888
Stop! Hold your peace.

351
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,355
- Come with me.
- Take me...

352
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,517
...but you cannot stop him 
who comes after me.

353
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,654
We will worry about that when it happens.
Come, you foolish man.

354
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,046
Tell me, what is your occupation?

355
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,892
I do the bidding 
of the Lord, my God.

356
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,978
Judging from your appearance...

357
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,391
...your god seems to be
a rather unprofitable master to serve.

358
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,812
I do not seek my reward
in the world you live in.

359
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,531
Nevertheless, 
you will find one here.

360
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,703
Yes, we do live 
in a very wicked world.

361
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,916
You frighten me, you angry man.

362
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,498
Salome, come back!

363
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,542
This beast amuses me.

364
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,676
Make him dance...

365
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,803
...on a bed of hot coals.

366
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,135
It were better to cut
his vicious tongue from its roots.

367
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,228
Woman...

368
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:18,103
...is not your cup 
of abominations full enough?

369
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,773
You dare to say that to my face?

370
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,570
Get down on your knees
and beg my forgiveness!

371
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,450
You, woman?

372
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,496
Who has given herself
to the captains of Assyria?

373
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,332
To the young men of Egypt?

374
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,912
Who has deserted the bed
of her first husband...

375
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,127
...to live in incestuous lust 
with his brother?

376
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,344
Is there blood in your veins...

377
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,600
...or poison?

378
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,642
Lucius, break his skin 
with your sword.

379
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,862
I want to see.

380
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,150
Our supper grows cold.

381
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,819
Do you intend to do nothing 
with this man?

382
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,908
Herod, Pilate has asked you 
a question.

383
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,671
Lucius...

384
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,674
...take this man to the dungeon.

385
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,148
Would you like me to come
and visit you in your new cave?

386
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,864
You are the seed of evildoers...

387
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,786
...the child of corruption.

388
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,657
Leave this house of darkness.

389
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,377
Find your way into the light
while there is yet time.

390
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,547
But if some were imprisoned 
in this day...

391
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,010
...yet many another was set free
from the illness of their bodies.

392
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:18,387
It was the time of miracles,
and Jesus put forth his hand...

393
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,853
...and cleansed those who were vexed
with unclean spirits.

394
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,729
For there went virtue out of him,
and healed them all.

395
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,803
I thought you would leave me 
here to starve.

396
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,686
What took you so long?

397
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:13,524
A new prophet 
has come to Jerusalem.

398
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:17,189
He has the same first name
as yourself: Jesus.

399
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,660
We need more fighters 
and fewer prophets...

400
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,289
...except for John the Baptist.
If I had that man on my side...

401
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,246
...I could wake up the people,
and we would rid ourselves...

402
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,910
...of Antipas and the Romans.

403
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,830
This man is greater 
than John the Baptist.

404
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,253
In what way?

405
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,543
I talked with one of his disciples.

406
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,970
This Jesus...

407
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:46,181
...was proclaimed by John the Baptist
as the man he was waiting for.

408
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,606
I need a prophet
to help me win over the people.

409
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,940
Can we convince this man?

410
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,823
His disciple says 
he speaks only of peace.

411
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,658
Peace?

412
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,580
There will be no peace in Jerusalem,
unless it is won by the sword.

413
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,471
It's not safe for you 
on the street.

414
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,475
I must speak with this man.

415
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,321
What does a man profit,
if he shall gain the whole world...

416
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,157
...and lose his own soul?

417
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,570
Could you explain the parable
of the tares of the field?

418
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:50,662
He that soweth the good seed
is the Son of Man.

419
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,543
And the field is the world.

420
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:02,462
We are strangers in your city.
We seek one called John the Baptist.

421
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,463
Can you tell us where to find him?

422
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,107
She's evil! Stone her!

423
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,776
- Stone her!
- She's a harlot! She must die!

424
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,656
She's evil! Stone her!

425
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,699
- Let her be stoned! She must die!
- She's an adulteress!

426
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,492
What has this woman done?

427
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,129
She's been caught in adultery, 
and she must be stoned according to the law.

428
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,048
She's a harlot! She must die!

429
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:43,461
- Let her be stoned!
- She must die!

430
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,176
- She's a harlot! She must die!
- She must die!

431
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,343
Then let him who is without sin
amongst you cast the first stone.

432
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,720
Woman, where are they now 
who condemned you?

433
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,438
Then neither will I condemn you.

434
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,438
Go and sin no more.

435
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:56,412
If you would find John the Baptist,
he lies in the palace dungeon.

436
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,249
- What was his crime?
- He told the truth.

437
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,417
He may be the one 
we have waited for.

438
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,424
I must speak with him.

439
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,326
And, Barabbas, so near to Jesus...

440
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,580
...now turned and fled 
from the Roman guards.

441
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,368
Leaving behind a man
seeking answers from one stone...

442
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,084
...whether to run with Barabbas,
the messiah of war...

443
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,342
...or walk with Jesus,
the new messiah of peace.

444
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,676
What is it?

445
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,513
Another one wants 
to see John the Baptist.

446
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,398
- Send him away.
- He will not go.

447
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,151
I mean, I do not know
how to send this one away.

448
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,277
Show him in.

449
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,501
The prisoner, John, 
is not allowed visitors.

450
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,296
If you wish to send him a message,
leave it with the guard.

451
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,378
I would see John.

452
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,130
Why?

453
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,673
I come to free John.

454
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,054
And just how do you propose
to break him free from his cell?

455
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,187
I come to free him within his cell.

456
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,530
Freedom? Behind stone walls?

457
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,902
You are free to come 
and go as you please...

458
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,112
...and yet you are still a prisoner...

459
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,658
...because you place no faith
in anything but your sword.

460
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,050
Who are you? 
Where do you come from?

461
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,057
My name is Jesus. 
I come from Nazareth.

462
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,430
Nazareth?

463
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,438
I have not been there 
for many years...

464
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,267
...yet your face is familiar.

465
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,773
You once came to our house
and spoke to my mother.

466
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,863
The house of the carpenter?

467
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:46,962
For some reason unknown to me,
I have favored your mother once before.

468
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,754
I will give you a moment
with the prisoner, John.

469
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,798
But remember this:

470
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,811
As you have your duty to your god,
so do I to my emperor.

471
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,142
Break Caesar's law...

472
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,934
...and you shall find in me
the most merciless of all men.

473
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,437
Ichebious.

474
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,155
Let him take a look at the baptizer.

475
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,469
John.

476
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,711
Give me your blessing.

477
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,480
The name of Jesus
moved through the land...

478
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,515
...and yet others 
came to walk with him.

479
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,686
And they were Philip and Bartholomew.

480
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,526
And one more joined them 
near the city.

481
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,619
Take me with you, Rabbi.

482
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,956
Come.

483
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,251
What is your name?

484
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,665
Judas.

485
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,299
- And yours?
- John.

486
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,798
He's mad!

487
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,304
He's a madman! Madman!

488
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,495
You are his mother?

489
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,998
Yes. Who has sent you?

490
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,377
I have journeyed from Jerusalem
to see where he lives.

491
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,670
Come, I will show you.

492
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,343
I am alone now. Share my table.

493
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,224
I am a woman of sin.

494
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,314
You will share my table.

495
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,236
I have done much evil.

496
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:31,455
Child, God knows evil exists,
as well as good.

497
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,916
Just as there is light and darkness.

498
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:39,671
Evil exists that we may be
the better for it.

499
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,423
Will you speak to your son for me?

500
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,092
Intercede.

501
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,194
Has not my son said:

502
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:08,700
"What man having 100 sheep,
if he lose one of them...

503
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,032
...does not leave the 99 
in the wilderness...

504
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,369
...and go after that which is lost,
until he find it?

505
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:21,713
And when he has found it,
he lays it upon his shoulders, rejoicing.

506
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:30,468
And when he comes home, he calls
his friends and neighbors together...

507
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,803
...and sayeth unto them:

508
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,472
'Rejoice...

509
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,063
...for I have found the sheep...

510
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,728
...which I lost.'"

511
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,322
You would not have sought out this house
if God had not wanted you to.

512
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,276
Come.

513
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,619
Share my table.

514
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,429
"Noble Pilate,
the day before the ides of April...

515
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:15,684
...the man Jesus left Jerusalem,
accompanied by five of his disciples:

516
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,437
Peter, Andrew, John, Philip...

517
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,270
...and Nathaniel.

518
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,188
Outside the walls of the city...

519
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,198
...they were joined 
by a sixth disciple...

520
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,828
...a man called Judas Iscariot.
They traveled north.

521
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,989
The fourth day 
after the nones of May...

522
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:42,036
...the man Jesus and his disciples
entered the town of Capernaum.

523
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:47,294
There Jesus laid hands on a madman
and cast out the demon in him.

524
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,842
The same evening, the man Jesus
brought a dying child back to health.

525
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,681
Two miracles in one day."

526
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,387
But, Lucius...

527
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,720
...these things...

528
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,306
...can they really be true?

529
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,735
I do not know, my lady.

530
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,146
I, myself, 
have never seen a miracle.

531
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,692
There are no such things 
as miracles.

532
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,237
Only fools who believe in them. 
Continue.

533
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,576
"The day after the nones of June...

534
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,741
...at the crossroads of Tabiga...

535
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:25,754
...a Roman tax collector
by name of Matthew saw Jesus pass...

536
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,290
...and promptly left
his tax-collecting duties...

537
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,881
...and has joined up with the man Jesus
and become the seventh disciple.

538
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,597
A harlot from Jerusalem
by the name of Magdalene...

539
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,884
...is also residing 
in the same house."

540
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,595
Tax collectors and harlots.

541
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,889
"The day before the nones of July...

542
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:50,187
...the man Jesus spoke to a crowd of over
5000 people at the foot of Mount Tabor...

543
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,401
...near Lake Galilee.

544
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,941
It has been reported 
that with a basket containing...

545
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,782
...two fish 
and five loaves of bread...

546
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:01,323
...the man Jesus 
fed the entire multitude."

547
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,451
I never heard 
such absolute nonsense.

548
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:11,633
"The day after the ides of July, Jesus was seen 
to walk on the water of Lake Galilee."

549
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,091
Ridiculous.

550
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:21,351
"That evening a storm ravaged the lake,
threatening the lives of fishermen.

551
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,682
The man Jesus raised his arm...

552
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:27,099
- Does our Lucius mock me?
- ...the wind died, the storm ceased."

553
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,652
So it is reported.

554
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,836
Then Lucius, thinking on Nazareth, 
the long years...

555
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,628
the mother, the child, 
and the miracles...

556
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,262
...did go to see John the Baptist.

557
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,726
You have treated me well.

558
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,989
I should like to ask 
just one more kindness.

559
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,649
Ask.

560
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,990
Before I leave this world...

561
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,160
...I would send a message to Jesus.

562
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:28,959
What is the message?

563
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,173
Ask of him, in these words:

564
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,716
"Was it your coming that was foretold...

565
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,299
...or are we to expect another?"

566
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,000
- You doubt him?
- No...

567
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,015
...I do not doubt him.

568
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:56,734
But I would like to hear it
from his own lips.

569
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,133
You are always looking at her.

570
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,634
You are sick with jealousy.

571
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,158
Dance for me, Salome!

572
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,870
Salome.

573
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,494
Drink a little wine.

574
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,497
Taste this...

575
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,631
...so that I may drain the cup.

576
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,085
I am not thirsty.

577
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,134
Come and sit next to me.

578
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:52,099
I will give you 
the throne of your mother.

579
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,103
You are not enough of a king.

580
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,769
You keep the man who reviled 
my mother in a dungeon...

581
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,155
...when he should have died months ago.

582
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,156
Why do you let him live?

583
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,912
I have had talks with him.

584
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,994
John is a very great prophet.

585
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:15,160
He's a madman, 
and you are afraid of him.

586
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,670
I am afraid of no man.

587
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,012
Salome, dance for me.

588
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,181
I command you to dance.

589
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,551
I will not dance.

590
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,183
You cannot refuse me.

591
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,020
Salome will now dance for us.

592
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,401
I do refuse.

593
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:46,525
Salome, I beg of you.
I will give you anything you want.

594
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,410
- Anything?
- Even unto the half of my kingdom.

595
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,576
Do you swear?

596
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:57,668
By my life, by my crown,
and before the governor of Judea.

597
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,665
Whatever it is you want,
I will give it to you...

598
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,715
...even if it is 
the throne of your mother.

599
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,262
You have given your word.

600
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,681
I'm the slave of my word...

601
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,027
...and my word
is the word of a king.

602
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,545
Anything I want?

603
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,752
Now, Salome, what would you have 
for your dance?

604
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,137
I want...

605
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,764
...on a silver platter...

606
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:01,352
What on a silver platter?
A ruby? A diamond? A pearl?

607
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,728
I want the head 
of John the Baptist.

608
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,242
Have you gone mad?

609
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,291
What can you want 
with the head of a man?

610
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,286
I want to look at it.

611
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,341
Salome, listen to me.

612
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,719
I have jewels 
hidden in this palace.

613
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,347
Jewels that thy mother even 
has never seen.

614
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:40,633
Jewels that are marvelous 
to look at.

615
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,301
Great topazes.

616
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:46,314
Opals that burn 
with a fire as cold as ice.

617
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,108
Give me the head 
of John the Baptist...

618
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,146
...or let it be known
to everyone here...

619
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,485
...that the word of the king 
is worthless.

620
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,362
Give her what she asks.

621
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:05,685
John the Baptist
has sent a message to ask me:

622
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:12,100
"Is it your coming that was foretold,
or are we to expect another?"

623
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,146
My answer to John 
is your testimony.

624
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,691
What you people here 
have witnessed.

625
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:22,235
How the blind see once more.

626
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,153
How the lame walk.

627
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,745
The lepers are made clean.
The deaf now hear.

628
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,122
I say to John,
"What was it you expected to see...

629
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,583
...when you went out 
into the desert?"

630
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,669
Was it a reed trembling 
in the wind?

631
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,757
No, that is not 
what you expected to see.

632
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:44,598
Was it a man, 
clad in fine garments?

633
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:51,105
No. You must look in king's palaces for men 
that go proudly-dressed and live in luxury.

634
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,687
Why, then, did he go out?

635
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,774
To see a prophet?

636
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,987
I say to John the Baptist:

637
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:05,953
"Blessed is he who keeps his faith."

638
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,031
And I further say to all of you:

639
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,161
"God has raised up
no greater son of woman...

640
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,122
...than John the Baptist."

641
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:02,627
All over Galilee, the disciples of Jesus 
are calling for a gathering to hear him speak.

642
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:06,343
This new prophet, Jesus,
he speaks like John the Baptist.

643
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,473
How do we know 
it's not the same man?

644
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,511
Perhaps John 
has risen from the dead.

645
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,312
Why did I do it?

646
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,517
I am not an evil man.

647
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,648
Why did I do it?

648
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,859
You should've done it
the first day you imprisoned him.

649
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:26,150
He is John the Baptist.
He has come back in the form of Jesus.

650
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,159
Superstition. 
Tell him it is not true.

651
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:31,740
I knew John the Baptist
and I have met Jesus.

652
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,907
They are not the same man.

653
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,372
Stop him. Call your soldiers.

654
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:37,627
Arrest him.

655
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,499
And start a rebellion?
All Rome wants is peace and taxes.

656
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,885
I don't intend to spend the rest 
of my life in this miserable country.

657
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,137
Where is this gathering
taking place, Lucius?

658
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,298
A mount in the hills of Galilee.

659
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,010
Have you any suggestion?

660
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,850
Not until I hear
what the man speaks.

661
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,941
Go to this meeting, Lucius.

662
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,774
Let the man talk. Listen to him.

663
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:06,361
If he utters a single word
treasonable to Rome...

664
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,032
...you'll have to act.

665
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:15,165
I tell you, 
it is John the Baptist rising again.

666
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:24,837
And so much was the fame
that went abroad of Jesus...

667
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,425
...that there was a gathering of people,
like flocks from the hills.

668
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:31,591
Great multitudes came 
out of all Judea and Jerusalem...

669
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,635
...and from the sea coast 
of Tyre and Sidon...

670
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:38,271
...which came to hear him, 
and to be healed.

671
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,230
My lady, it is not safe
for Pilate's wife to be here.

672
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,518
I must hear this man.

673
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,357
Will you stay with me, Lucius?

674
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:59,429
They have all gathered,
and are awaiting your word.

675
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,353
Blessed are you who are poor...

676
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,725
...for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven.

677
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:35,233
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

678
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,613
Blessed are you who do hunger 
and thirst after righteousness...

679
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,782
...for you shall be filled.

680
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:48,796
Blessed are those who are merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

681
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,801
And blessed are those who are mourners,
for they shall be comforted.

682
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:59,139
Blessed are those 
who are pure in heart...

683
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,804
...for they shall see God.

684
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:06,097
And blessed are you
who are the peacemakers...

685
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:09,267
...for you shall be called 
the children of God.

686
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:15,777
And blessed are you who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake...

687
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,945
...for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven.

688
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:30,083
- Give us a sign from heaven!
- Prove to us who you are!

689
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:34,003
Blessed are you 
when men shall curse you...

690
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:38,171
...and separate you from their company,
and reproach you...

691
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,632
...and cast out your name as evil...

692
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,306
...for the Son of Man's sake.

693
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:48,643
When? When is the Kingdom 
of God coming?

694
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,233
Watch as you may, 
you will not see it come.

695
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,151
No one will say,
"Here it is," or, "There it is."

696
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,864
For the Kingdom of God 
is within you.

697
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,824
Rabbi!

698
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,455
What must I do 
to inherit eternal life?

699
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,368
What is written in the law:

700
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,212
To love the Lord, your God,
with all your heart...

701
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,463
...with all your soul...

702
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,971
...with all your power 
and all your mind.

703
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:25,096
And love your neighbor 
as you love yourself.

704
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,061
Do that and 
you shall live eternally.

705
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,266
I'm a camel driver. 
Who can I call neighbor?

706
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,652
He to whom you show mercy 
and compassion...

707
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,234
...whether you know him or not.

708
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,358
Are you the Messiah?

709
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,403
I am the good shepherd.

710
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,243
The good shepherd lays down 
his life for his sheep.

711
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:50,413
Do you speak against
the law of the prophets?

712
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:54,170
I come not to destroy
the law or the prophets...

713
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,839
...but to fulfill them.

714
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,836
For I say unto you:

715
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:05,557
Love your enemies,
bless them who curse you...

716
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:11,185
...and pray for those
who despise and persecute you.

717
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,566
For if you love 
only those who love you...

718
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,398
...what reward shall you have?

719
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,272
If you are a holy man...

720
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:24,238
...why do you eat and drink
with sinners and tax collectors?

721
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:29,285
The healthy have no need of a physician,
but the sick do.

722
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,872
I come not to call the righteous,
but sinners, to repentance.

723
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,536
I am a tax collector.

724
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,752
I worship in the Temple every day,
yet they hate and despise me.

725
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,416
What can I do?

726
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,886
No man can serve two masters.

727
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,672
Either he will hate the one
and love the other...

728
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:48,137
...or he will cling to the one
and despise the other.

729
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,224
You cannot serve God and Mammon.

730
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,434
And I say unto you:

731
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,942
Be not anxious for your life...

732
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,649
...for the food you eat...

733
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:04,992
...or for your body 
or the clothes you wear...

734
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,162
...for is not life
greater than food?

735
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,665
And your bodies 
more than the clothing?

736
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,254
Behold the birds of the sky.

737
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:25,213
They neither sow nor reap,
nor take their harvest to the barns.

738
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,302
And yet God feeds them.

739
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,473
And how much more are you than they?

740
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:37,186
Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow.

741
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,852
They toil not, 
neither do they spin.

742
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:45,779
And can any one of you, 
by worrying...

743
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:49,195
...add a moment to your years?

744
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:57,203
My wife and I believe in you,
but we are poor.

745
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:01,465
We have nothing to give.
How can we show you our faith?

746
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,133
You have, by what you have said.

747
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:15,396
Come to me, all of you who labor 
and are heavy-laden...

748
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,722
...and I will refresh you.

749
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,225
Rabbi.

750
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,275
Rabbi, I believe you're the Messiah.
How can I serve you?

751
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:28,908
The Son of Man comes to serve,
not to be served.

752
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:34,581
Whoever among you who would be great
must be a servant.

753
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:40,045
And whoever will be first
must be the slave of all.

754
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,378
We have heard the voices
of false messiahs before.

755
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:47,381
How do we know 
you are not sent by Satan?

756
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:53,893
If a kingdom is divided against itself,
the kingdom cannot stand.

757
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:59,182
If Satan also be divided against himself,
how then can his kingdom stand?

758
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,563
How can Satan cast out Satan?

759
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:13,363
I see before me flesh and blood.
You are only a man.

760
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,951
Why do you make yourself
out to be the Son of God?

761
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:22,129
If I am not doing the deeds of My Father,
do not believe me.

762
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:27,008
But if I am doing them
and you will still not believe in me...

763
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,627
...believe in the work I do.

764
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,137
If you can do miracles,
call upon God to send hosts...

765
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,223
...to destroy the Romans
and free our people from bondage.

766
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,389
Thou shalt not tempt 
the Lord, thy God.

767
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,275
The Romans are conquerors.

768
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,479
To conquer them would make you
no different than they.

769
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:50,733
Rabbi, what is faith?

770
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:56,451
If you have faith that is no greater
than this grain of mustard seed...

771
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:01,042
...and you say to the mountain,
"You shall move"...

772
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,583
...the mountain will move.

773
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,169
Nothing is impossible.

774
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:09,630
How judge a transgressor?

775
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,675
Judge not, lest you be judged.

776
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:17,593
For you will be judged by the standards
you yourself shall apply.

777
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,855
Why do you note the speck
in your brother's eye...

778
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,981
...and take no notice
of the beam in your own eye?

779
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:33,443
You hypocrites, first remove the beam 
from your own eye...

780
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:39,206
...and then you will see clearly enough
to remove the speck from your brother's.

781
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,370
Give not that 
which is holy to dogs.

782
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:51,551
Neither cast your pearls before swine,
lest they trample them under their feet...

783
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:54,588
...and then turn 
and tear you to pieces.

784
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:03,188
Ask, and you shall receive.

785
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:06,228
Seek, and you shall find.

786
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,815
Knock, and the door
shall be opened unto you.

787
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:16,243
For everyone who asks, receives.

788
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,363
And every seeker finds.

789
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:24,289
And to all those who knock,
the door is opened.

790
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,455
Is there a man among you...

791
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:32,585
...who would hand his son a stone
if he asked for bread?

792
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,595
Or a serpent 
if he asked for fish?

793
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:41,389
If, then, you who are evil...

794
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:45,188
...know how to give 
your children what is good...

795
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,565
...think how much more 
your Heavenly Father...

796
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,898
...will give good things 
to those who ask Him?

797
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:56,115
Therefore, treat your fellow man
as you would have him treat you.

798
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:02,573
For this is the law 
of the prophets.

799
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:16,462
Teach us to pray.

800
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:45,703
Our Father, who art in heaven...

801
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:49,161
hallowed be thy name.

802
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:53,206
Thy kingdom come.

803
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,594
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

804
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:03,851
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...

805
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,971
...as we forgive those 
who trespass against us.

806
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:13,568
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

807
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:21,367
For thine is the kingdom...

808
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:26,865
...and the power, and the glory...

809
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,622
...for ever and ever.

810
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,546
Amen.

811
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,289
Words.

812
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,256
The Rabbi is calling you.

813
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:32,097
Your friend is one of those
who did not understand.

814
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,797
What did the man say?

815
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:11,804
He spoke of peace...

816
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,347
...love...

817
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,933
...and the brotherhood of man.

818
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:20,152
Is that all?

819
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,572
That is all.

820
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:34,996
What is the matter?

821
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:38,000
The look on Lucius' face.

822
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:41,962
He had a long journey. 
He looked tired.

823
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,295
He looked more 
than tired to my eyes.

824
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,852
Good night, Caiaphas.

825
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,684
- Do you believe in him?
- I do.

826
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,849
Self-appointed saviors 
like your Jesus...

827
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:00,393
...might stir the people up 
against the Romans.

828
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,315
- But he is a good man.
- You are a fool, Nicodemus.

829
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,698
Good or bad, he's a threat.

830
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:09,828
If Pilate could use Jesus 
and his followers as an excuse...

831
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:12,330
...he would massacre our people.

832
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,661
What do you intend to do, Caiaphas?

833
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:18,874
For the present, 
we will bide our time.

834
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:29,180
And then Jesus called
unto him his disciples, the chosen 12...

835
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:31,181
...whom he also named apostles...

836
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,342
...and led them 
into the wilderness.

837
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:38,564
And these were Simon, called Peter,
and Andrew...

838
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,021
...James and John, 
the sons of Zebedee...

839
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,903
...Philip and Bartholomew, 
Matthew and Thomas.

840
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,234
And James, the son of Alphaeus.

841
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,742
Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite.

842
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:53,947
And among them, Judas Iscariot.

843
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,753
Now, none of these chosen 
were most learned.

844
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:04,507
None was a teacher of great truths.
None was rich and powerful.

845
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:08,420
They but knew the waters of Galilee,
the shores and the fields beyond.

846
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:11,931
But knowing this, they were most rare 
and simple and precious.

847
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:16,219
For they were the pure in heart
and but needed instruction.

848
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,435
For Jesus saw 
his own disciples doubt him.

849
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:25,979
Awed by his miracles, 
faithful to him.

850
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:28,273
Yet still they wondered 
why the Messiah...

851
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,989
...could not raise up miraculous armies
to strike Judea free.

852
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:36,827
Could simple love and brotherhood
be weapons against Rome?

853
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:43,000
For the disciples, 
like the multitudes...

854
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,961
...were troubled 
by the Sermon on the Mount.

855
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:49,127
They had come seeking
earthquakes and whirlwinds...

856
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,921
...the word of Jesus 
to smite the heavens...

857
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:54,841
...and drop fiery swords
in their upraised hands...

858
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:57,977
...drown Caesar's 
Chariots in the sea.

859
01:40:58,427 --> 01:41:00,646
This, then, was Jesus' task:

860
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:03,775
To keep his disciples
from the doubting cities.

861
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:07,983
And to give them fresh wisdom wherewith
to cleanse themselves, as with water.

862
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:10,068
To make them men of God.

863
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,651
Peace and love he taught them,
in many tongues.

864
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,243
And the days passed,
and the time of teaching was at an end.

865
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:21,497
And those we help, 
how shall they reward us?

866
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:25,501
You receive without payment,
give without payment.

867
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:30,009
And take neither gold, nor silver,
nor copper under your belts.

868
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:32,337
Nor staffs.

869
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:35,719
You send us out 
sheep among wolves.

870
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:39,260
Then be as wise as the serpent...

871
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,850
...and as harmless as the dove.

872
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:47,527
And at the appointed time,
I will join you in Jerusalem.

873
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:52,069
And he blessed them and sent them 
two by two before his face...

874
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:56,327
...into every city and place to heal the sick,
to preach the Kingdom of God...

875
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:59,204
...and to have authority over evil.

876
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,550
Yes, there is rust.
And the water is too warm.

877
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:15,050
It can only mean one thing
Someone is forging weapons.

878
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,929
Blacksmiths are only licensed
to operate in the western end of the city.

879
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:23,187
These waters come from
the underground cellar in the eastern end.

880
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,394
Can you locate this cellar?

881
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,854
The eastern end
is honeycombed with cellars.

882
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,519
Some we could never find.

883
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:33,906
You should not 
have killed this man.

884
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:36,033
You should have saved him 
for questioning.

885
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:28,169
Go on. Make more weapons 
to kill more people.

886
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:29,670
That is what I intend.

887
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:32,833
But while the metal cools, think.

888
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:36,844
- You saw Jesus, you heard him speak.
- He speaks only of peace!

889
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:42,133
I am fire. He is water.
How can we ever meet?

890
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:48,140
The day after the next Sabbath,
Jesus comes here to join his disciples.

891
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:51,401
- Here, in Jerusalem?
- In Jerusalem.

892
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:54,608
To preach at the greatest temple
in all the land!

893
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,115
Such crowds will gather
that the Romans will not dare touch him.

894
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,826
Then, Barabbas, then is the time.

895
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:04,990
Move your men to stand by Jesus,
but keep their swords sheathed.

896
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:07,659
Let your strength be known, 
but silent.

897
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,002
Let Jesus speak.

898
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:13,040
And when his message of peace
sweeps the city...

899
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:16,884
...let the people 
proclaim him King of Judea.

900
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:20,296
How can he refuse?

901
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:29,772
If he can free the Jews
without spilling blood...

902
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:32,349
...he deserves the crown.

903
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:38,030
I'll shape the crown myself,
and place it on his brow.

904
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:48,950
You will stand beside him
in the temple, then?

905
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,914
You will give him time to speak?

906
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,506
Yes.

907
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,682
That will be a day 
to be remembered.

908
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:12,519
It will be remembered.

909
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:15,104
Barabbas!

910
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:18,521
Judas dreams.

911
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:23,781
And all dreamers are fools.
This is the hour that we have waited for.

912
01:45:23,943 --> 01:45:25,240
Yes.

913
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:29,748
Jesus comes to the Temple. Let him.
He brings us our audience.

914
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:32,410
We'll borrow them.

915
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:36,088
We'll run them through the streets
to the fortress.

916
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:37,294
This way, and that.

917
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,217
- Your people, Seth, will storm the gates.
- Yes.

918
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:42,925
- Yours, Enoch, will breach the north wall.
- Right.

919
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,340
I, myself, 
will scale the wall to the south.

920
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:49,056
Quickly done and over,
we will lend the crowd back to Jesus.

921
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:54,099
- Is that fair or not?
- Yes, fair.

922
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,225
No one but Barabbas
would attempt such a thing.

923
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:51,316
You speak of Barabbas 
with respect?

924
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:54,611
I always respect the enemy.

925
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:57,902
Men like Lucius 
keep our empire together.

926
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:01,451
Your tour of duty in Jerusalem
ended years ago, Lucius.

927
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,954
- Why do you stay here?
- Where else would I go?

928
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:07,666
But Rome is brilliant.

929
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:11,090
I seem to have a talent
for surviving small wars.

930
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:14,297
Politics and brilliant society
would destroy me.

931
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:17,087
Personally, I suspect you found
our Roman gods too cruel.

932
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:21,760
Are you also awaiting the coming
of the local Messiah?

933
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,269
To believe in the Messiah,
one must believe in God.

934
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:33,734
What I've witnessed in my years on this earth
is proof enough to me there can be no God.

935
01:51:34,396 --> 01:51:35,943
How many followers has he?

936
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,659
Who? God? Jesus? Or Barabbas?

937
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,077
Barabbas.

938
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,910
How many dissatisfied Jews
are there in Jerusalem?

939
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:50,420
Have you considered the possibility
of the followers of Jesus and Barabbas...

940
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:51,705
...joining forces?

941
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:53,624
I have.

942
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,542
Where would it happen?

943
01:51:57,085 --> 01:52:00,305
Since we are here, here.

944
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,604
And for many months
Jesus preached through Judea...

945
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,273
...and angered the scribes 
and the Pharisees...

946
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:21,034
...who thought how they might kill him,
and numbered his days.

947
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,036
And knowing the sum thereof...

948
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:26,495
...Jesus came to spend time 
with his mother.

949
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:58,856
Blessings on this house.

950
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:02,151
Welcome, Peter, John.

951
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:07,323
We have done all that you asked.
It is time we leave for Jerusalem.

952
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,203
The chair will have to wait 
until I return.

953
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:14,212
The chair will never be mended.

954
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:32,063
I am going with you.

955
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:37,478
Now the Jewish Passover was near...

956
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,272
...and many went up 
from the country to Jerusalem...

957
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:43,363
...to purify themselves 
and make holiday.

958
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:51,708
He's coming.

959
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:57,628
And Jesus, come from Bethany
and the Mount of Olives...

960
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:01,760
...did enter Jerusalem on that day
to preach in the Temple...

961
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:04,421
...for the Temple was Judea.

962
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:07,224
His words, spoken here...

963
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:10,431
...would echo in Tiberias,
Samaria and Caesarea.

964
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:14,269
From here he might speak to the world,
if the world might listen...

965
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:17,150
...and the waves be still.

966
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:32,495
As the city prepared
for the Passover killing of the lamb...

967
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:36,628
...the men of Barabbas
planned stranger celebrations.

968
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:40,007
Made ready 
more terrible sacrifices.

969
01:55:45,647 --> 01:55:47,365
And Jesus went into the Temple...

970
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:50,198
...and the great doors 
shut up one multitude...

971
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,328
...and within was peace...

972
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:57,413
...while outside was the sea 
that would not be stilled.

973
01:55:57,576 --> 01:56:00,750
The tongue which spoke not peace,
but the sword.

974
01:56:03,498 --> 01:56:05,216
Long live Judea!

975
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:34,154
Judea!

976
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,081
Come.

977
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:06,611
Get back!

978
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:13,072
Now!

979
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:21,493
Here! Come on!

980
02:01:27,906 --> 02:01:29,328
Help me.

981
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:39,839
We will never rise again.

982
02:01:40,752 --> 02:01:43,380
The glory of Judea is dead.

983
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:46,720
The Romans were waiting for us.
We had no chance.

984
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:48,726
So many of us dead, for nothing.

985
02:01:49,093 --> 02:01:51,141
We must escape 
into the desert and hide.

986
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:57,816
It was you. You who told Barabbas that
the new Rabbi would show us the way.

987
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:00,400
He does nothing 
but pray in the Temple.

988
02:02:01,648 --> 02:02:02,865
The Rabbi will help us.

989
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:05,902
How will he help us?

990
02:02:08,112 --> 02:02:09,864
He has the power of miracles.

991
02:02:10,031 --> 02:02:12,659
He will not use his power,
except to heal the sick.

992
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:16,876
He can call down hosts
to destroy the fortress of Pilate.

993
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:18,790
He preaches against violence.

994
02:02:18,957 --> 02:02:23,758
He can, with a look, rock the foundations
of Herod Antipas' palace...

995
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,389
...and bring the Walls down
on the tyrant's head.

996
02:02:27,257 --> 02:02:30,557
He has never done these things before.
Why will he change now?

997
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:34,021
I will force his hand.

998
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:35,773
Not with us!

999
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:40,820
I will force his hand.

1000
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:47,824
Once he feels the Roman sword 
at his throat...

1001
02:02:48,736 --> 02:02:53,458
...he will strike them down
with the wave of one arm.

1002
02:03:02,542 --> 02:03:05,466
Now came the days 
of unleavened bread.

1003
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:06,720
And Jesus...

1004
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,133
...knowing these to be
his final hours on earth...

1005
02:03:09,799 --> 02:03:12,803
...did send to prepare
a Passover feast.

1006
02:03:13,052 --> 02:03:17,432
And there, a last time,
stood with and among his disciples.

1007
02:03:18,266 --> 02:03:21,861
And gathered them in, all 12.

1008
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:51,016
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the Universe...

1009
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:55,019
...who bids us eat bitter herbs.

1010
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:07,031
Tonight, one among you 
will betray me.

1011
02:04:12,487 --> 02:04:14,285
What you must do, do quickly.

1012
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:45,903
I will be with you 
for only a short time.

1013
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:47,905
Where are you going?

1014
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:51,576
Where I go, you cannot go,
but you will follow me afterwards.

1015
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:53,702
We'll follow you 
to the ends of the earth.

1016
02:04:53,861 --> 02:04:56,785
Tonight you will all lose courage
and desert me.

1017
02:04:56,948 --> 02:04:58,450
Impossible.

1018
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:00,705
I would not desert you.

1019
02:05:00,868 --> 02:05:03,087
I would go to prison.
I would die for you first.

1020
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:07,046
Believe me, Peter, this night,
before the cock crows twice...

1021
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:09,085
...you will deny 
knowing me three times.

1022
02:05:11,129 --> 02:05:13,632
- Never!
- No! Impossible!

1023
02:05:13,798 --> 02:05:15,266
We'd never desert you.

1024
02:05:16,092 --> 02:05:17,685
Never.

1025
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:20,896
My last wish...

1026
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:26,398
...is that you love one another
as I have loved you.

1027
02:05:27,311 --> 02:05:31,566
The greatest gift a man can give
is to lay down his life for his friends.

1028
02:05:32,608 --> 02:05:35,236
And when I am gone, 
you will be grieved.

1029
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:38,540
But your grief will turn into joy.

1030
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:42,077
A woman in childbirth feels pain.

1031
02:05:42,243 --> 02:05:45,998
But when her child is born,
she does not remember the pain.

1032
02:05:47,081 --> 02:05:49,300
For a child has been born 
into the world.

1033
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:55,091
And one day I will see you again,
and when I do...

1034
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:58,643
...your joy will be such...

1035
02:05:59,802 --> 02:06:02,305
...that no one can take it from you.

1036
02:06:04,599 --> 02:06:06,727
For you have the faith.

1037
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:13,317
And you believe in me and in Him,
from whom I was sent.

1038
02:06:25,161 --> 02:06:29,211
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the Universe...

1039
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,674
...who brings forth bread 
from the earth.

1040
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:47,017
Take.

1041
02:07:04,867 --> 02:07:06,369
Eat.

1042
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,218
For this is my body.

1043
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:26,314
Do this in remembrance of me.

1044
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:52,215
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God...

1045
02:07:53,332 --> 02:07:55,380
...King of the Universe...

1046
02:07:56,419 --> 02:07:58,842
...who creates 
the fruit of the vine.

1047
02:08:04,385 --> 02:08:05,932
Drink.

1048
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:10,066
For this is my blood of the covenant,
which is shed for you...

1049
02:08:12,185 --> 02:08:13,778
...and for many...

1050
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,000
...for the remission of sins.

1051
02:09:12,536 --> 02:09:15,380
- I wish to see the High Priest Caiaphas.
- It is late.

1052
02:09:15,539 --> 02:09:16,586
He will see me.

1053
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:18,672
So Judas Iscariot went his way...

1054
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:22,179
...to betray Jesus 
to the chief priests and the captains.

1055
02:09:22,338 --> 02:09:24,466
To say how Jesus and Barabbas...

1056
02:09:24,632 --> 02:09:27,727
...were the left and the right hands
of the same body.

1057
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:30,354
Thus Judas thought
to test and prove forever...

1058
02:09:30,513 --> 02:09:33,357
...the divine power of the Messiah.

1059
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:38,112
Then Jesus went forth
to the Mount of Olives...

1060
02:09:38,271 --> 02:09:41,024
...and the garden 
called Gethsemane.

1061
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:43,909
There to await 
the dark night ahead.

1062
02:09:44,068 --> 02:09:47,197
There to consider 
the dark days to follow.

1063
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:51,163
There to prepare 
for his trial and his death.

1064
02:10:25,818 --> 02:10:27,365
Keep watch and pray.

1065
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,953
Why must we wait?

1066
02:10:34,285 --> 02:10:35,958
What can I say?

1067
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:39,131
"Father, save me from this hour"?

1068
02:10:41,083 --> 02:10:44,178
It is for this very reason
that I am coming to this hour.

1069
02:11:25,252 --> 02:11:27,129
My Father.

1070
02:11:47,274 --> 02:11:48,992
My Father.

1071
02:11:51,362 --> 02:11:54,081
All things are possible to You.

1072
02:11:57,868 --> 02:12:00,667
Take away this cup from me.

1073
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,341
And yet...

1074
02:12:49,211 --> 02:12:51,430
...not as I will...

1075
02:12:57,052 --> 02:12:58,895
...but as You will.

1076
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,357
You were with the man Jesus.

1077
02:14:29,812 --> 02:14:34,363
You are wrong, woman.
I... I do not know the man Jesus.

1078
02:15:03,637 --> 02:15:05,685
Are you one of the disciples?

1079
02:15:06,807 --> 02:15:08,434
No, I am not.

1080
02:15:12,396 --> 02:15:15,775
- How long will Jesus be in there?
- I don't know.

1081
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:23,916
You're a disciple.
I saw you in the olive grove.

1082
02:15:24,074 --> 02:15:27,544
No, I am not. 
I was not in the olive grove.

1083
02:15:49,099 --> 02:15:50,851
I could swear 
you were with this man.

1084
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:57,407
I do not know 
what you are talking about.

1085
02:15:58,525 --> 02:16:01,074
I am not a follower of this man.

1086
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:05,476
You have just been 
interrogated by Caiaphas.

1087
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:08,934
They've been judged you guilty on two counts.
Blasphemy and Sedition.

1088
02:17:09,096 --> 02:17:11,599
This court takes no cognizance
of your blasphemy.

1089
02:17:11,765 --> 02:17:14,468
But the charge of Sedition
is a major offense.

1090
02:17:14,643 --> 02:17:16,987
The rules of Roman law will prevail.

1091
02:17:17,146 --> 02:17:19,148
I, Pontius Pilate, 
governor of Judea...

1092
02:17:19,314 --> 02:17:23,100
...by grace of the Emperor, 
the devine Tiberius of Rome, will judge your case.

1093
02:17:23,318 --> 02:17:25,491
No matter what you've done
up to this moment...

1094
02:17:25,654 --> 02:17:29,500
no matter what others have accused you of doing,
I, and I alone, have the authority...

1095
02:17:29,658 --> 02:17:32,377
...to sentence you
to be crucified or flogged...

1096
02:17:32,536 --> 02:17:33,662
...or to set you free.

1097
02:17:34,329 --> 02:17:37,003
How you conduct yourself here and now
will determine your fate.

1098
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:38,884
Do you understand?

1099
02:17:43,672 --> 02:17:46,892
I am offering you an opportunity
to state your defense.

1100
02:17:53,182 --> 02:17:56,402
Silence can only serve
to militate against you.

1101
02:17:57,186 --> 02:17:59,188
I'm now offering you 
a second opportunity.

1102
02:18:05,569 --> 02:18:08,618
In view of the continued and obstinate 
silence on the part of the accused...

1103
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:11,660
...the court appoints Lucius Catanus
advocate of the defense.

1104
02:18:11,825 --> 02:18:16,046
I wish it emphasized in the record that
the accused is not without representation.

1105
02:18:28,884 --> 02:18:32,855
I cannot undertake your defense
unless you are willing to confide in me.

1106
02:18:33,764 --> 02:18:36,483
Does the accused desire 
to confer with his advocate?

1107
02:18:45,317 --> 02:18:46,569
The trial will proceed.

1108
02:18:50,072 --> 02:18:52,200
For the benefit of the accused...

1109
02:18:53,575 --> 02:18:56,749
...so that he comprehends
the gravity of his case...

1110
02:18:57,246 --> 02:18:59,920
...I request that the charge 
against him be repeated.

1111
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,470
The defendant is accused of claiming
to be the leader sent by their god...

1112
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:08,303
...to liberate the Hebrew nation.

1113
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:20,436
The accused, 
by neither deed nor word...

1114
02:19:20,602 --> 02:19:23,606
...has ever challenged
the jurisdiction of Rome.

1115
02:19:23,772 --> 02:19:25,149
During the past three years...

1116
02:19:25,315 --> 02:19:28,034
...the accused has by repeated
acts and speeches...

1117
02:19:28,777 --> 02:19:30,279
...disturbed the people...

1118
02:19:30,445 --> 02:19:34,495
...condemned the payment of tribute,
and claimed himself king.

1119
02:19:35,242 --> 02:19:37,791
And spread the word 
that his kingdom...

1120
02:19:37,953 --> 02:19:40,422
...has precedence over and above
Roman jurisdiction.

1121
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:43,004
The defendant has only spoken
of the Kingdom of God.

1122
02:19:43,166 --> 02:19:46,561
He's never attempted to usurp
Roman jurisdiction over the kingdom of Judea.

1123
02:19:46,753 --> 02:19:50,800
The implication nevertheless is the same. 
There can be no division on authority in Judea.

1124
02:19:50,966 --> 02:19:52,809
A nation can have only one master.

1125
02:19:52,968 --> 02:19:54,345
I repeat, my lord.

1126
02:19:54,511 --> 02:19:56,684
The defendant's claim
to a divine mission on earth...

1127
02:19:56,847 --> 02:19:59,475
...does not challenge 
the authority of Rome.

1128
02:19:59,975 --> 02:20:04,151
Also, the performance of miracles
is beyond the jurisdiction of this court.

1129
02:20:05,606 --> 02:20:08,735
The accused does not stand trial
for the performance of miracles...

1130
02:20:08,901 --> 02:20:10,448
...but for setting up a kingdom.

1131
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:14,286
Advocate for the defense
will confine his argument to the issue.

1132
02:20:17,075 --> 02:20:19,328
The charge is a secular issue.

1133
02:20:19,494 --> 02:20:21,838
By treaty with Judea,
Rome has obligated itself...

1134
02:20:21,997 --> 02:20:24,341
...not to interfere 
in religious matters.

1135
02:20:24,499 --> 02:20:26,467
The court is fully aware 
of this evidence.

1136
02:20:26,627 --> 02:20:29,005
The court is also aware
of the unlawful assembly...

1137
02:20:29,010 --> 02:20:31,838
...the accused created when he delivered
his sermon on the Mount in Galilee.

1138
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,433
I was present at that sermon.

1139
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:36,220
I've submitted to the court
a full report of the defendant's statements.

1140
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,516
Not once did he speak a word
that would incite violence.

1141
02:20:40,682 --> 02:20:43,686
On the contrary, 
he spoke only of peace.

1142
02:20:44,645 --> 02:20:47,194
The court has also read
the report of the sermon.

1143
02:20:48,023 --> 02:20:51,323
The accused advised the people to dispose
of all their possessions and follow him.

1144
02:20:51,485 --> 02:20:54,830
How can Rome levy taxes on the people
if they follow his teaching?

1145
02:20:54,988 --> 02:20:57,741
Then the charge should be reduced
to one of evading the tax.

1146
02:20:57,908 --> 02:21:00,627
The charge stands as read.

1147
02:21:02,412 --> 02:21:03,709
Are you a king?

1148
02:21:07,709 --> 02:21:10,383
It is your own lips
that have called me king.

1149
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:13,348
My kingdom is the Kingdom of God.

1150
02:21:14,925 --> 02:21:16,768
Then you are a king.

1151
02:21:19,304 --> 02:21:23,354
I was born and came into this world
to give testimony to the truth.

1152
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:27,195
Whoever believes in the truth
will listen to me.

1153
02:21:30,065 --> 02:21:31,237
What is truth?

1154
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:37,535
Everyone that is of the truth
heareth my voice.

1155
02:21:38,573 --> 02:21:41,326
Different people 
have different feelings.

1156
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:44,083
Can there not be 
more than one truth?

1157
02:21:45,455 --> 02:21:49,426
There is only one truth,
and it is written in the Commandments:

1158
02:21:49,751 --> 02:21:51,219
"Be true to God."

1159
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:55,140
Now my lord, the court is deviating from the issue.
Truth is not on trial here...

1160
02:21:55,298 --> 02:21:58,017
...but a man named Jesus, 
from Nazareth.

1161
02:21:58,343 --> 02:22:00,061
Nazareth.

1162
02:22:00,220 --> 02:22:02,268
You are a Galilean, then?

1163
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:05,105
In that case, it is Herod Antipas
who has jurisdiction over you.

1164
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:06,999
He's just returned to Jerusalem.

1165
02:22:07,010 --> 02:22:08,528
Send this man 
to Herod Antipas for judgment.

1166
02:22:08,645 --> 02:22:11,740
If my lord, please, Herod Antipas
is prejudiced against this man.

1167
02:22:11,898 --> 02:22:13,775
He could not be tried fairly there.

1168
02:22:13,942 --> 02:22:18,618
It is so ordered by this court.
The trial is ended. Caesar is satisfied.

1169
02:23:12,501 --> 02:23:16,005
Are you John the Baptist, 
come back to life?

1170
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:19,050
Can you not see 
he is not John the Baptist?

1171
02:23:19,216 --> 02:23:21,514
Let him speak for himself.

1172
02:23:23,386 --> 02:23:26,515
I have heard you are
a very great miracle-worker.

1173
02:23:27,307 --> 02:23:31,187
I would be very happy to witness
a simple demonstration of your power.

1174
02:23:40,153 --> 02:23:42,326
Here is a vase of clay.

1175
02:23:44,116 --> 02:23:46,869
It's only a small vase.

1176
02:23:49,037 --> 02:23:51,039
Turn it into gold.

1177
02:23:54,835 --> 02:23:58,760
Surely that is not a great feat
for a man of your powers.

1178
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:14,900
Still made of clay.

1179
02:24:17,816 --> 02:24:20,410
Perhaps that was 
too difficult for you.

1180
02:24:21,611 --> 02:24:24,239
Shall I ask of you 
something simpler?

1181
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:26,332
Make thunder.

1182
02:24:27,951 --> 02:24:30,500
It should be very easy 
for a messiah.

1183
02:24:32,205 --> 02:24:33,957
Make thunder.

1184
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:55,441
I hear nothing.

1185
02:24:57,772 --> 02:25:00,616
Seems that the great miracle-worker
has lost his touch.

1186
02:25:03,278 --> 02:25:07,499
Do not let it be said that Herod
does not know how to receive royalty.

1187
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:26,552
There.

1188
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:29,604
Does he not look like a king?

1189
02:25:35,268 --> 02:25:38,488
Take this faker back to Pilate.

1190
02:25:40,899 --> 02:25:43,994
Tell him Herod was not pleased
with his performance.

1191
02:25:57,999 --> 02:26:01,754
Scourge him! Loosen his tongue!
Make him confess!

1192
02:26:08,551 --> 02:26:11,179
What would you want him 
to confess, Pilate?

1193
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:15,230
- His conspiracy.
- What conspiracy?

1194
02:26:16,434 --> 02:26:18,107
Take the miracles.

1195
02:26:18,812 --> 02:26:20,155
And what is his crime there?

1196
02:26:23,275 --> 02:26:27,280
He is different and refuses 
to behave like the others.

1197
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:30,373
Pilate.

1198
02:26:33,159 --> 02:26:38,711
And if he can influence 
even Caesar's daughter, he is dangerous.

1199
02:27:49,235 --> 02:27:50,327
What do you want?

1200
02:28:20,892 --> 02:28:23,441
A king should wear a crown.

1201
02:28:59,013 --> 02:29:01,607
If only the sun would set quickly.

1202
02:29:01,808 --> 02:29:04,311
What difference does it make?

1203
02:29:07,522 --> 02:29:09,775
The Passover begins at sunset.

1204
02:29:10,150 --> 02:29:13,029
They cannot crucify us 
during the holy days.

1205
02:29:13,194 --> 02:29:16,118
I would rather 
get it over with today.

1206
02:29:27,917 --> 02:29:31,592
How does it feel
to be about to die, Barabbas?

1207
02:29:34,174 --> 02:29:37,769
I only object to the company
that I will have to keep.

1208
02:29:40,221 --> 02:29:43,646
We are only thieves. 
You're a murderer.

1209
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,231
It is we who should object 
to your company.

1210
02:29:46,394 --> 02:29:47,896
Let him be.

1211
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:12,929
So I have been given
the honor of going last?

1212
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:16,591
You know the man named Jesus, 
from Nazareth?

1213
02:30:17,550 --> 02:30:18,597
I know the man.

1214
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:21,850
Does he deserve to die?

1215
02:30:22,013 --> 02:30:23,890
No more than I!

1216
02:30:30,271 --> 02:30:33,866
You compare yourself 
in the same breath?

1217
02:30:35,109 --> 02:30:37,487
We both seek the same thing.

1218
02:30:37,779 --> 02:30:39,952
Freedom!

1219
02:30:41,699 --> 02:30:43,872
Only our methods differ!

1220
02:30:47,038 --> 02:30:50,713
The freedom he spoke of
is not the same you killed for.

1221
02:31:00,426 --> 02:31:02,929
When is the man Jesus to die?

1222
02:31:04,931 --> 02:31:07,650
He carries his cross now.

1223
02:31:11,688 --> 02:31:13,816
Now, why do you tell me all this?

1224
02:31:14,274 --> 02:31:17,653
Why don't you take me with him?
Get it over with.

1225
02:31:21,573 --> 02:31:23,826
Go. You're free.

1226
02:31:35,837 --> 02:31:39,387
The man Jesus 
is dying in your place.

1227
02:31:40,592 --> 02:31:44,438
One prisoner is freed each year
at this time.

1228
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:48,479
Pilate offered that mob a choice.

1229
02:31:51,561 --> 02:31:55,236
Me? They chose me?

1230
02:31:57,275 --> 02:32:00,154
Your followers yelled the loudest.

1231
02:32:00,862 --> 02:32:05,333
Go. Look at him 
who is dying for you.

1232
02:34:21,627 --> 02:34:24,301
You. Cyrenaican. Take the cross.

1233
02:35:27,735 --> 02:35:29,908
Do not weep for me.

1234
02:37:16,093 --> 02:37:18,471
That man is dying in my place.

1235
02:37:19,472 --> 02:37:21,270
Why should he do that?

1236
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,688
I never did anything for him.

1237
02:37:47,833 --> 02:37:53,806
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.

1238
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:10,489
If you are the Messiah...

1239
02:38:10,982 --> 02:38:14,907
...then save yourself and us.

1240
02:38:15,569 --> 02:38:18,038
Have you no fear of God?

1241
02:38:18,364 --> 02:38:19,866
We are guilty.

1242
02:38:20,449 --> 02:38:23,373
But this man has done no wrong.

1243
02:38:25,413 --> 02:38:30,260
Remember me, when we have come
into the glory of your Kingdom.

1244
02:38:32,837 --> 02:38:34,635
I promise...

1245
02:38:36,132 --> 02:38:38,385
...you will be with me...

1246
02:38:39,218 --> 02:38:41,767
...this day, in paradise.

1247
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:53,783
Woman...

1248
02:38:55,276 --> 02:38:57,074
...behold your son.

1249
02:40:09,558 --> 02:40:11,356
My God.

1250
02:40:13,687 --> 02:40:17,408
My God, why have You forsaken me?

1251
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:34,843
It is finished.

1252
02:40:43,384 --> 02:40:44,727
Father...

1253
02:40:47,555 --> 02:40:51,105
...into Your hands 
I commend my soul.

1254
02:41:26,927 --> 02:41:29,271
He is truly the Christ.

1255
02:42:33,786 --> 02:42:38,633
And the body of Jesus
was begged from Pilate, and given over.

1256
02:43:22,584 --> 02:43:27,340
And in the place where he was crucified,
there was a garden.

1257
02:43:27,548 --> 02:43:31,223
And in the garden a new sepulcher,
hewn from stone.

1258
02:43:32,553 --> 02:43:35,181
And Jesus was placed there.

1259
02:45:33,674 --> 02:45:35,267
Sir.

1260
02:45:36,051 --> 02:45:37,724
Sir.

1261
02:45:40,431 --> 02:45:42,433
Sir, have you hidden him?

1262
02:45:42,599 --> 02:45:45,193
Tell me where, 
and I will take him away.

1263
02:45:45,352 --> 02:45:46,854
Woman, why do you weep?

1264
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:50,490
Because you have taken away my Lord.
I know not where.

1265
02:45:55,028 --> 02:45:57,122
- Magdalene.
- Master.

1266
02:45:57,281 --> 02:46:01,036
Touch me not, for I am not yet 
ascended to my Father.

1267
02:46:01,201 --> 02:46:03,374
But go to my disciples.

1268
02:46:04,121 --> 02:46:08,376
Tell them I ascend to my Father
and your Father.

1269
02:46:09,585 --> 02:46:13,340
To my God and your God.

1270
02:46:14,047 --> 02:46:16,800
But first, 
I go before them into Galilee.

1271
02:46:17,968 --> 02:46:20,062
There shall they see me.

1272
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:34,197
He is arisen.

1273
02:46:46,997 --> 02:46:51,423
And when the tomb was found empty, 
some days passed...

1274
02:46:51,793 --> 02:46:56,674
...and Christ was seen 
at Emmaus and in Jerusalem.

1275
02:46:57,257 --> 02:47:01,637
And those who saw him
knew he was the Lord God.

1276
02:47:02,596 --> 02:47:05,566
And then a final time he came
among his disciples...

1277
02:47:05,724 --> 02:47:07,601
...by the shore of Galilee.

1278
02:47:07,768 --> 02:47:10,112
Do you know and love me?

1279
02:47:12,564 --> 02:47:16,319
Feed my sheep,
for my sheep are in all the nations.

1280
02:47:17,402 --> 02:47:20,070
Go you into all the world
and preach the Gospel...

1281
02:47:20,072 --> 02:47:22,495
...to every creature who hungers.

1282
02:47:23,367 --> 02:47:25,495
I am with you always.

1283
02:47:26,286 --> 02:47:29,290
Even until the end of the world.
