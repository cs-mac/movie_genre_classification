1
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,474
Don't be scared.

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,434
Don't be scared.

3
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,940
I'm not into scaring.

4
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:28,113
Trust is the key to S&M play.

5
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,451
Trust me. I won't hurt you.

6
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:39,666
Someone like you...
What was your name again?

7
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,251
My name is Ai.

8
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:45,922
Someone as pure
and courageous as you, Ai,

9
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,341
is the only hope
for this rotten Japan.

10
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,885
I worship you.

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,930
You know how it is,

12
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,726
sluts who screw
around during college

13
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:01,479
and then end up marrying
doctors and bureaucrats.

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,985
I call those sluts "whores".

15
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:12,573
You're great.

16
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,452
Do you understand?
Great.

17
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,205
You are great.

18
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,251
No blindfolds, please.

19
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,463
Trust me.
Have trust in me.

20
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,237
Don't move!

21
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,115
The needle breaks
and then you die.

22
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:49,175
Tokyo Decadence

23
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,323
Hello?

24
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,533
Yes.

25
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,745
The New Prince Hotel.
7 p.m.

26
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,416
A Mr. Ishioka under
the name of Sato...

27
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:01,422
No, I'll kill time and go there.

28
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,045
Please.

29
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:50,096
Your fortune requires
you to follow three rules.

30
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:58,471
First, place a telephone
directory under your TV.

31
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,984
- The telephone book under the TV?
- Yes.

32
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:08,823
Second, don't go to
an art gallery in the east.

33
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:14,579
There’s a thick
mist in that direction

34
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:18,875
and a woman alone
will be lost in it forever.

35
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,042
Yes.

36
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,130
And third,

37
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,301
find a pink stone,

38
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:32,889
make a ring out of it and
wear it on your middle finger.

39
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:39,854
You follow these three rules
and God says you will be happy.

40
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,607
Can you do that?

41
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,068
Yes, I can.

42
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,549
Thanks for waiting.
Please take a seat.

43
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:14,180
I looked through
what we recommended

44
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:19,018
and I recommend
this pink imperial topaz.

45
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,513
I'm Ai.

46
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,010
Yes, I've just arrived.

47
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,806
He wants me
for three hours now.

48
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,033
I'm ready, sir.

49
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,369
Come over here.

50
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,791
- On your knees.
- Yes, master.

51
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,173
Cut the "master" crap.

52
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:40,219
We're not in some
stupid high school play.

53
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,222
Yes, I understand.

54
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:13,127
Good. A woman's
hair is a woman's life.

55
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:18,382
I understand why
the Nazis cut women's hair.

56
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,596
Stand on the window ledge.

57
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,650
Please draw the curtain.

58
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:43,908
The point is, I get pleasure
out of humiliating you.

59
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,869
- Got that?
- Yes.

60
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:55,377
Wiggle your ass slowly as
you pull down your panties.

61
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,299
Slowly.
Five millimeters at a time.

62
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:12,353
Not like that.
Like a horny businesswoman.

63
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,608
You know, the ones
who are dying for a fuck.

64
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,112
Look around you.
They’re everywhere.

65
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,448
Stupid horny businesswomen.

66
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:32,748
The ones who are
starved for stiff cocks.

67
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,880
You'll do it over
and over until you're wet.

68
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,644
What is that?

69
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,204
Don't laugh.

70
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,375
- Don't laugh.
- Ouch!

71
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,754
- Don't ever laugh.
- I won't.

72
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,343
You're just a
cunt living for a fuck.

73
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:30,347
You're a bitch in heat.

74
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,809
A bitch doesn't laugh
out of embarrassment.

75
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,269
Stupid bitch.

76
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,105
I got it, sir.

77
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,983
I promise I won't laugh.

78
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,291
- No, do it again.
- Yes.

79
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,591
No.

80
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:20,397
Yes.

81
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,026
No.

82
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,455
No.

83
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,335
Good.

84
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,381
No, no.

85
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,264
More.

86
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,890
Yes.

87
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,934
You're all wet.

88
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,436
Feeling good?

89
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,272
This what you wanted?

90
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,612
Say,
"I'm a horny businesswoman."

91
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,074
I'm a horny businesswoman.

92
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,284
Louder.

93
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,747
I'm a horny businesswoman.

94
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,874
Louder.

95
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,377
I'm a horny businesswoman.

96
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,753
Louder.

97
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,380
I'm a horny...

98
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:50,209
What? Now?
Wait, I'll ask her.

99
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,755
It's my woman.
She's a little weird herself.

100
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,633
She wants to come up here.
Do you mind?

101
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:03,180
A threesome? It'll cost you
ten-thousand more per hour.

102
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,183
Sure. So it's all right.

103
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,484
Come on over.

104
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,283
What were you doing just now?

105
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,118
Nothing.

106
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,871
Wasn't that sign language?

107
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,501
You do social work?

108
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:38,298
Only occasionally.
I go and visit little children.

109
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:44,179
But I study it because
I think it's beautiful.

110
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,979
- You want me like this?
- No, I want you naked.

111
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,731
- I'll go take a shower.
- Wait a minute.

112
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,524
Sit down.

113
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,827
- How old are you?
- I'm twenty-two.

114
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,037
Twenty-two...

115
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,043
So you've been alive
for twenty-two years?

116
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,795
Obviously.

117
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:26,555
Truth about yourself.

118
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:37,399
It's not as complicated as the
earth's axis or the structure of DNA.

119
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,067
It's more about yourself.

120
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:47,117
I've discovered that
I have no talent whatsoever.

121
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,177
I've lived for forty-four years.

122
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,679
I've done a lot of things.

123
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,349
All sorts of things.

124
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,102
Many things.

125
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,358
And there's only one thing.

126
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,319
I'm certain about.
Just one thing.

127
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,364
You know what that is?

128
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,207
It's the fact that
I'm a horny bastard.

129
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,552
Go take a shower.

130
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,404
Yeah, it's me.

131
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,409
You heard?

132
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,414
They’re mad as hell over
the Yamato Enterprise deal.

133
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,419
Yeah, they got Yoshizaki.

134
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,673
Don't start whining now, you idiot.

135
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,888
Yeah, I called Yuko over.

136
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,018
Close the Singapore account.

137
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,899
They cut Yoshizaki's face.

138
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,946
Yeah, close the account.
Get every penny out.

139
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,907
Send your family
away somewhere.

140
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,786
Yeah.
See ya.

141
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,326
My woman.
She's downstairs.

142
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,328
Talk to her.

143
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,420
What's happening?

144
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,674
Tell her.
She's into it too.

145
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,057
A vibrator is...

146
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,642
Getting it with a vibe?

147
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,395
On your knees?

148
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,272
Yes.

149
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,194
And fastened by a rope?

150
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,909
Does he have a hard-on?

151
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,247
Well, he...

152
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:31,127
I bet he doesn't.
I bet he's coked up.

153
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,424
I can hear the vibrator.

154
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,762
I'm going up there.

155
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,975
You'll lick us there while we fuck.

156
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,731
You'll like us where we joined.

157
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:48,580
Press your ass against the mirror.

158
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,007
Shake your ass back and forth.

159
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,893
More.

160
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,493
You're a sex-starved bitch

161
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:14,791
who's so low no one
would even touch you.

162
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:22,131
So you do it with the
mirror while we watch you.

163
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,554
Isn't he vulgar?

164
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,823
You want it too, don't you?

165
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,790
Don't you?
Don't you?

166
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,295
It feels so good.

167
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,841
You want it, don't you?

168
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,551
Answer her.

169
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:49,927
Don't you?

170
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,061
You're going to lick us there.

171
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,345
I'm going.

172
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,732
'Til next time.

173
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,943
You paid me too much.

174
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,320
Never mind.

175
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,993
Wait.

176
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,287
Listen.

177
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,169
Don't think you've no talent.

178
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,174
That’s a cop-out.

179
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,470
Take care.

180
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,696
Mr. Ishioka.

181
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,741
Mr. Ishioka.

182
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:35,903
What 'll I do?

183
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,666
You dropped something.

184
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,586
On your knees. Lick my feet.

185
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,546
- Stop it.
- Call me "Mistress."

186
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,090
Stop it, Yoko.

187
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,552
Mr. Satoh is not in.
May I take a message?

188
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:30,930
Has he checked out?

189
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,725
- No, he hasn't.
- Thank you.

190
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,074
Are you an S or an M, sir?

191
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,287
Both? An S and an M?
Fine.

192
00:40:56,288 --> 00:41:01,168
And you're new to our club?

193
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:16,434
That "Fats Only" girl,
it's her birthday today.

194
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:31,323
Why such an expensive ring?

195
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,661
340 thousand?

196
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,915
All gone in one night.

197
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:49,341
You should have bought
one at a night market.

198
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:54,013
I thought a cheap
one wouldn't work.

199
00:41:57,183 --> 00:42:00,936
I hate gloomy stories like this.

200
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:11,572
Ai, Miyuki, it's a threesome.
All right?

201
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,449
Which hotel?

202
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:16,243
The New Prince. 1-1-2-4.

203
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,288
Hello?
Yes?

204
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,168
They'll be there
in thirty minutes.

205
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:28,506
Your room number again?
1-1-2-4? Good.

206
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:41,935
Go on ahead.

207
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,321
Wait!

208
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,118
Leave her!

209
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,954
I'll go there with you later.

210
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,835
I can always call
the police on my cellular.

211
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:15,589
Thank you.

212
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:24,306
I've got a beard rash all over me.

213
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:30,312
Mistress! Mistress Ai!
I want to come again.

214
00:45:31,689 --> 00:45:32,981
Give it a rest.

215
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,360
You can't get it up anyway.

216
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:42,324
I can too. Just one
more time. Pretty please.

217
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:50,082
You strangle me and up I go.

218
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,167
Strangle you?

219
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:57,631
Precisely... Prick-cisely.
Cunt-cisely.

220
00:46:01,844 --> 00:46:06,473
Strangle me and jerk me off.

221
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:27,453
Ready, set, go!

222
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:40,507
I'm Kermit the Frog. Stop it.

223
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:44,928
Don't stop.

224
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:49,141
When I say stop,
squeeze harder.

225
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,655
Stop it.

226
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:07,492
Stop it.

227
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,051
No, he's quite young.

228
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,766
He's all doped up.

229
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,853
Yeah, crack.

230
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,484
Pupils?

231
00:47:45,823 --> 00:47:46,903
The black part of his eyes?

232
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,953
The black part of his eyes...

233
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,373
They're dilated.

234
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,719
We run.

235
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:15,310
Don't forget anything.

236
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,134
My my.

237
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:54,641
I met my mother who died last year.

238
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:04,026
She said to me,
"Go away, you fool!"

239
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,486
Did I squirt my juice?

240
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:54,575
Here.

241
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,414
Thanks.

242
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:03,877
The ring is too big, isn't it?

243
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:09,383
Take it back and
have it made smaller.

244
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:47,462
This is Shida.

245
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,051
I'm in front of the new Tokyo
Metropolitan Government Office.

246
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,595
Pan the camera, please.

247
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:58,305
Isn't it gigantic?

248
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:03,270
Is it time?
Back to the studio then.

249
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,065
Are you ready, Miss Sanae?

250
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:12,487
Here's Miss Sanae's
"Super-cool Guys."

251
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:30,881
More and more of our artists
are working outside Japan.

252
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:35,052
Mr. Sudoh is one of them.

253
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,387
You're a voluntary exile?

254
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:39,931
Well, only half of the year.

255
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:45,062
So there are things you
can only do in London.

256
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:47,814
Yes, in the "hard" technology.

257
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,816
What's that?

258
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:53,904
I use a lot of acoustic instruments.

259
00:51:54,488 --> 00:51:58,575
There aren't too many
studios left in Japan for that.

260
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:03,163
And they have better
mixing technicians there.

261
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:09,753
- So that's why, Mr. Sudoh...
- Stop this Mr. Sudoh business.

262
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,339
Talk to me like you usually do.

263
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,132
You'll be in Japan for a while?

264
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:19,721
During my son's entrance exams.

265
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:24,935
You're staying in your Beverly
Hills mansion in Yokohama.

266
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:28,271
You know it's no mansion.
My flat in London's more...

267
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,873
Miyuki comes in late today,
so there's only you.

268
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,669
Are you sick or something?

269
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,172
He's a good client.

270
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,760
I'm begging you, Ai.

271
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:02,973
If he likes you, he'll pay
you double, maybe triple.

272
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:08,186
He's not into hard stuff.
He likes talking to girls.

273
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,730
He's a nice guy.

274
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:54,566
I come here three times a week.

275
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,917
Go on, dig in.

276
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:28,642
You know, these restaurants with
movie star clientele are so pretentious.

277
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,019
Really?

278
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:36,107
How's the wine?

279
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:38,318
It's good.

280
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:42,447
Chateau Mouton, Rothschild '79.

281
00:54:44,783 --> 00:54:46,618
I only drink this here.

282
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:53,375
That means I drink this
three times a week.

283
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,212
An obvious deduction.

284
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,138
Was that last year?

285
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,518
Suzanne Mildonian's harp...
it was something else!

286
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:16,523
Suzanne Mildonian's harp concerto.

287
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:22,362
It was in a small hall in
Vienna's Opera Theater.

288
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:28,827
It was wonderful. You can't
beat the real thing.

289
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,383
Would you like to
order anything else, sir?

290
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:45,593
No, no. We're fine.

291
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:49,639
All I want now is a beauty's smile.

292
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,227
Where's the manager today?

293
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,730
In Singapore, on business.

294
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:16,833
Oh, Mt. Fuji, thou
holiest of mountains.

295
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:27,052
My dream is to rape a dead woman.

296
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:32,015
It's called necrophilia.

297
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:37,312
It's the most beautiful
form of sex in the world.

298
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,609
I want you to play the
part of Umeko Yoshida.

299
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:46,780
Who was raped near
Mt. Fuji on April 19, 1957.

300
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:57,082
She was murdered,
then raped by Toshio Yasaka,

301
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:00,335
an unemployed man
from Iwate Prefecture.

302
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,425
I'll strangle you lightly,
so pretend to die.

303
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:18,178
I'll examine you first,
then I'll rape you.

304
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,901
I'll pay you extra for the rape.

305
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:39,624
Are you ready to be raped, Umeko?

306
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:44,129
Right here in this forest,
under Mr. Fuji?

307
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:47,507
Umeko!

308
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:01,229
Sorry, but I'm leaving.

309
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:08,153
Give me back my money, then.

310
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,262
You saw him on TV?

311
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:41,686
First time in six months.

312
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:50,904
It's hard to date someone famous.

313
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:58,786
But you looked really happy then.

314
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,045
I want to go see him.

315
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,384
I shouldn't?

316
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,470
Don't do it.

317
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:21,976
But he never told me it's over

318
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:25,480
or that he doesn't like me.

319
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:30,485
He thinks he's being kind.

320
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:35,365
Sorry to bother you now,
but we got an M client.

321
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,575
You'll take him?

322
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,832
I'll go.

323
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,169
I'm fine.

324
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:13,236
Please don't leave
during the session again.

325
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,240
- Your name?
- Ai.

326
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,034
I'm Saki.

327
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:05,913
Aren't you glad
she's pretty, Turtle Face?

328
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:09,375
Call him Turtle Face, Ai.

329
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:14,047
Looks like a turtle, doesn't he?

330
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:17,884
I didn't know it was a threesome.

331
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:22,764
I'm sorry

332
01:01:23,056 --> 01:01:28,019
but this one insisted
on having another Mistress.

333
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:34,692
We won't do
anything you don't like.

334
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,241
Go take a shower then.

335
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:47,622
There’s a dress in there.
Put it on.

336
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,957
And the hat too.

337
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,072
How's your business going?

338
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,493
I heard the real estate
market is in a slump.

339
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:27,787
Yes, Mistress Saki.

340
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,208
But my company's motto
is "sound management,"

341
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,544
so we're doing all right.

342
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:37,046
Glad to hear that.

343
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:45,346
How beautiful.

344
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:48,599
It suits you.

345
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:08,911
Do you like the dress, Ai?

346
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:11,414
It's pretty.

347
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,377
Please sit down here.

348
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:32,894
Look, Turtle Face, you've
finally found a Mistress

349
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:38,065
who looks good in
an art deco dress.

350
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:42,862
Greet your Mistress.

351
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:50,161
Dear Mistress Ai.
Train me good and hard.

352
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:57,251
And what's your first request,
Turtle Face?

353
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:03,382
I'd like to kiss her feet.

354
01:04:05,468 --> 01:04:06,928
Kiss her feet?

355
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,971
Yes.

356
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:19,649
What do you think of
his capricious wish, Ai?

357
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:21,984
Will you grant it?

358
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:26,906
You got your permission.

359
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,327
Just the sole's fine.

360
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:11,768
You're going too far, Turtle Face.

361
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,163
Come over here.

362
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:21,252
Sorry about this.
Have a drink and relax.

363
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:24,964
You're pathetic.

364
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,472
Give me your neck.
Come closer.

365
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,311
Good.

366
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:46,569
Who said you could
lick between my legs?

367
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,195
Say, "I'm sorry."

368
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:51,324
And look at me.

369
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:52,992
Forgive me!

370
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,243
Say, "I'm sorry."

371
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:57,288
Forgive me.

372
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:59,665
- I'm sorry.
- Forgive me.

373
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,208
Say, "I'm sorry," dammit.

374
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:04,587
Forgive me.

375
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,006
I'm sorry.

376
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:10,134
I'm sorry, Mistress Saki.

377
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:14,722
I'm sorry.

378
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,854
I'm through playing with you.

379
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,565
Crawl backwards.

380
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:27,234
Stay still there.

381
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,946
Be still like a piece of stone.

382
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,406
Lift your bottom.

383
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:24,852
What are you doing?

384
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:14,819
You're bad. Come here.

385
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:01,407
Ai.

386
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:06,579
He's really a baldy!

387
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:10,833
How embarrassing.

388
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,902
You're all wet.

389
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:42,823
Feels good?

390
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:49,079
Go on, let's go.

391
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:57,379
Good, now pee.

392
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,450
It'll feel good.

393
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,544
Get the bed pan.

394
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:40,349
All right, Turtle Face.
Get the bed pan and crawl backwards.

395
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,447
Go back.

396
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,950
Further back.

397
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,956
Don't be a turtle. Get moving.

398
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:02,963
Don't spill a drop.
You're fine there.

399
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:17,686
Now, Turtle Face,
drink every drop of it.

400
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:23,942
I can't. I can only drink yours.

401
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:28,697
I only drink yours, Mistress Saki.

402
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:30,741
Mercy!

403
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:35,496
If you drink all of it, I'll reward you.

404
01:13:36,372 --> 01:13:40,000
Now drink up.

405
01:13:50,386 --> 01:13:52,596
All of it.

406
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:01,605
Every drop.

407
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,288
Here's your reward.

408
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:27,256
Raise your ass.

409
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,531
No, it hurts.

410
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:54,533
You like it, don't you?

411
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:58,579
You love it, Turtle Face.

412
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:13,010
You come. I'll kill you.

413
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,562
See you later.

414
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:56,845
Good evening, Miss.

415
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:14,071
Yes, what else?

416
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:17,908
And?

417
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:23,121
I see. All right.

418
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:28,085
I'll have the asparagus
and the smoked salmon.

419
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:31,296
And some pasta.

420
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:35,425
Yes, and make it quick.

421
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,850
- Is it good?
- Yes.

422
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:42,135
Hold the smoke between your legs.

423
01:18:49,059 --> 01:18:50,227
It's sweet.

424
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:54,481
For a non-smoker,
you're good at it.

425
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,528
You must be wealthy.

426
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:05,534
Not really.

427
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:08,870
It's Japan that's wealthy.

428
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:12,457
But it's wealth without pride.

429
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:15,877
It creates anxiety, which
drives our men into masochism.

430
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:21,466
I've made my
living out of these men.

431
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,177
Well, here I go.

432
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:41,778
All I can do is sigh.

433
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:05,677
Your sweet kiss.

434
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:10,557
Makes my virgin heart

435
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:19,767
dream sweet dreams of love.

436
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:25,572
Here, on this golden beach,

437
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:30,494
on this burning sand.

438
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:36,208
Let's love nakedly

439
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:40,962
like two mermaids.

440
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:46,718
We pressed our tanned cheeks together

441
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:51,473
and whispered our vow.

442
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:57,270
Let's keep it our secret forever.

443
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:01,399
Oh how it makes me sigh!

444
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:06,029
Ah, the joy of love.

445
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:11,117
The rose-colored days.

446
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:16,790
The first time I met you

447
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,628
was my love holiday!

448
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:00,542
So much!

449
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:24,524
Yes?

450
01:22:26,902 --> 01:22:29,487
There’s something I can't forget.

451
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:37,871
You want advice? Sure.

452
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:45,879
I want to go see him,
but he's married.

453
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:47,631
I feel scared.

454
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,971
Clarify your situation.

455
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:58,600
Learn to hate ambiguity.

456
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,940
That’s my advice, always.

457
01:23:05,357 --> 01:23:10,445
The answer is always one and the same.

458
01:23:12,364 --> 01:23:15,700
Clarify your situation.

459
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:24,709
Blow up the earth,
whatever, but do that.

460
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,539
This blood...

461
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:50,503
is the same blood as the blood

462
01:24:51,963 --> 01:24:56,926
that the first fish that
crawled onto land shed.

463
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:02,265
I want to evolve too.

464
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:08,855
I want to be able to live in a
totally different world.

465
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:14,944
Thanks for everything.

466
01:25:17,489 --> 01:25:19,074
I'll go now.

467
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,245
Goodbye.

468
01:25:32,879 --> 01:25:34,297
Wait.

469
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:50,939
This will give you courage.

470
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:53,399
It will make you superhuman.

471
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:55,819
For me?

472
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:06,663
Goodbye.

473
01:26:07,497 --> 01:26:08,873
Take care.

474
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:00,902
It's a bit complicated.

475
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,197
Follow the road
beside the kindergarten.

476
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:06,991
You want a map?

477
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:20,171
Is there a port near here?

478
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,134
Can't you hear the foghorns?

479
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:27,720
Are you drunk?

480
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:29,889
No.

481
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:36,144
Thank you.

482
01:30:45,942 --> 01:30:47,318
Mr. Sudo.

483
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:03,538
What are you doing here?

484
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:14,423
Grandma, call the police.

485
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:17,468
Call them. Now!

486
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:48,035
Mr. Sudoh...

487
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:57,461
Miss Sakakibara?

488
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,257
You are Miss Sakakibara?

489
01:36:05,428 --> 01:36:07,430
You came to see him?

490
01:36:14,854 --> 01:36:17,148
As you well know,
he's on a journey

491
01:36:19,275 --> 01:36:20,776
of no return.

492
01:36:21,402 --> 01:36:24,071
You came to hear me sing.

493
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:31,078
I'm so happy.

494
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:36,459
We were once rivals.

495
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:42,131
We're true friends now.

496
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:45,676
I'll sing then.

497
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:48,179
This bench is my stage.

498
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:54,310
I'm so happy to have
so many people here.

499
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,273
Hello!

500
01:37:01,484 --> 01:37:02,485
Hello.

501
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:05,321
Louder, please.

502
01:37:05,488 --> 01:37:09,408
All together now. Hello!

503
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:12,244
Hello.

504
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:15,498
With more spirit.

505
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:18,959
Hello!

506
01:37:19,752 --> 01:37:21,921
Yes, hello.

507
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,341
They'll blame me, Missus.

508
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:29,929
Let's go back, please.

509
01:37:36,018 --> 01:37:38,479
True friends, right?

510
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,072
Where's Mr. Sudoh?

511
01:39:02,813 --> 01:39:04,106
Mr. Sudoh!

512
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:49,294
What happened?

513
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:51,380
Your name?

514
01:40:57,553 --> 01:41:00,681
Where are you from?

515
01:41:00,848 --> 01:41:02,599
She didn't enter the house.

516
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:07,604
- Look at this!
- Is this yours?

517
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:10,858
She tried to climb the stairs and fell.

518
01:41:11,859 --> 01:41:14,778
Are you hurt?

519
01:41:16,321 --> 01:41:17,698
Answer us properly.

520
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,874
Who are you?

521
01:41:27,082 --> 01:41:29,710
- She smells of alcohol.
- She's weird.

522
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:37,718
Wait!

523
01:41:39,595 --> 01:41:41,722
She is my friend.

524
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:44,433
Let her go.

525
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:53,942
She's that vocalist.

526
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:11,502
She's a bit...

527
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,128
So is her husband.
