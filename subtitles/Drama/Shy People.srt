1
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:26,663
Dad, the food is ready.

2
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:44,663
Okay, let's eat.

3
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:55,663
How does it taste?

4
00:00:58,563 --> 00:00:59,633
It's good.

5
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,833
That's a relief.

6
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,263
Gosh.

7
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:15,363
Dad, can't you stop pretending everything's okay?

8
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:18,063
I really think it tastes okay.

9
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,403
No, it doesn't.

10
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,033
Oh, I might be late for work.

11
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:36,833
Are you going to continue to work there?

12
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:42,333
You started with bad intentions.

13
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,793
Ji Hye led me there.

14
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,733
Can you buy these for me?

15
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:58,993
I have a really important audition after this performance.

16
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,863
If I wear this necklace to the audition,

17
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,633
people will recognize my worth.

18
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,663
I finally found...

19
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:13,633
people and a place that recognize my worth.

20
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:16,893
It's all thanks to Ji Hye.

21
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,333
That's what I believe.

22
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,133
But Ji Hye didn't...

23
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:24,463
leave the necklace for you.

24
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,763
Still, I got an even prettier one.

25
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:44,463
Gosh, that's blinding.

26
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:46,733
Is that a tray or a mirror?

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,393
You're going to make a hole in it.

28
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:55,763
What's wrong?

29
00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:58,463
You're not here to do dishes.

30
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,463
You came to talk, didn't you?

31
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,093
Well...

32
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:10,293
Go ahead.

33
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,363
Are you going to keep your mouth shut?

34
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:18,633
You make people feel alienated when you do that.

35
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,063
Really?

36
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,363
Are you joking?

37
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,933
Do you think I only want to be understood?

38
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,833
I want to understand you too.

39
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:30,463
Enough with seeing through other people.

40
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,363
Show me who you are inside.

41
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,663
I can't see through anything.

42
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:43,093
It's true. I thought that it was easy at times.

43
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:48,063
I could see through and read what people were thinking.

44
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,533
But I was wrong.

45
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:57,063
To think that you know and to think that you understand...

46
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:01,333
is a very dangerous thing.

47
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,533
What do you mean?

48
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,363
I'm talking about Ji Hye.

49
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,263
I think...

50
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:14,163
it happened because of me.

51
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:02,033
What? That's...

52
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,103
Boss.

53
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:17,463
I was worried about you. Where have you been all day?

54
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,993
I told you. No more locking doors.

55
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,733
No more secrets.

56
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:26,463
That was not too long ago. Why are you still being secretive?

57
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,733
Boss?

58
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,063
What's wrong?

59
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,633
Did something happen?

60
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,033
Why is it...

61
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:51,663
that there are so many reasons why we can't be together?

62
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,933
Pardon?

63
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:18,193
(Episode 15: A Reason Bigger Than 99 Other Reasons)

64
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,863
Mr. Eun Hwan Gi.

65
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,193
That's you, right?

66
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,363
Yes.

67
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:29,963
Who are you?

68
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,963
I'm just Ro Woon's neighborhood friend.

69
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:39,963
I see.

70
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,833
Do you think it's over?

71
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:46,893
You seem to be relieved.

72
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:49,733
But guess what?

73
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,933
You don't have the right to smile so happily...

74
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,633
beside Ro Woon.

75
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,263
Pardon?

76
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,733
There's something you don't know about.

77
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,163
Ji Hye was watching...

78
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,433
you, not Kang Woo Il.

79
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:19,533
Pardon? What are you talking about?

80
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,633
Of course you didn't know.

81
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,963
You probably never gave her a glance.

82
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,433
I think you have it wrong.

83
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,763
I don't know how she ended up getting involved with him.

84
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:34,033
It took me by surprise.

85
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:37,563
However, all of this started because of you.

86
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,363
She wanted to hear about you from your friend.

87
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,433
Should I ask Mr. Kang to do me a favor...

88
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:12,693
and give this to Mr. Eun?

89
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,293
I didn't get to give him the drawing in the end.

90
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,533
The woman he's seeing...

91
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:27,663
is a curator who only deals with professional paintings by artists.

92
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:29,793
But I'm...

93
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,093
My drawing is...

94
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,963
That's enough. You can't even drink.

95
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,533
I don't hate her, though.

96
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,263
Thanks to her,

97
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:48,163
I got to go on a fake date with him.

98
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,033
I was so nervous.

99
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:00,663
- Pardon? - Thank you for your help.

100
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:17,663
Hey, don't you know no one likes bad guys anymore?

101
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,463
He's not a bad guy.

102
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,963
He's sweet.

103
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:25,363
If a guy is mean to you nine times and he's nice once, you're moved.

104
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,833
If a guy's good to you nine times and he makes a mistake once,

105
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,363
you say that he changed.

106
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,863
Do girls have a problem counting?

107
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,663
One is good to you nine times while the other is good to you once.

108
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,533
The answer is obvious.

109
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,293
Are you all that dumb?

110
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,893
It's true. I'm dumb.

111
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,733
I know it will never work between us,

112
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,663
but I can't help looking at him.

113
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,063
I'm suffering the more I look at him,

114
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,703
but I can't stop myself.

115
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:58,593
Then just go up to him and tell him you like him.

116
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,733
If I do that, I won't be able to see him anymore.

117
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:03,293
I can't live without seeing him.

118
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,093
It's a mere crush.

119
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,093
Why is it such a big deal?

120
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,463
(Mr. Kang Woo Il)

121
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,993
Yes, sir.

122
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,593
Right now?

123
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,703
Yes. I'll be right there.

124
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:31,963
- Okay. - Hey.

125
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,993
It's after hours. Why is he calling you in?

126
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,033
He's abusing his power.

127
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,663
It's not him.

128
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:42,163
You just said, "Yes, sir".

129
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,703
You really are dumb.

130
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,833
I'm sorry. I'll take care of the tab.

131
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,203
Hey. Ji Hye.

132
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:55,663
Don't go.

133
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,333
Thank you for listening to me.

134
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,663
I'm lucky I have someone to talk to.

135
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,593
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,233
You should have given her a glance.

137
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:34,393
You should have...

138
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,333
listened to her at least once.

139
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:42,163
She was so desperate as she looked towards you.

140
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,163
How could you be so cruel and ignore her like that?

141
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:53,293
More than anyone else,

142
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:57,033
you hurt her the most.

143
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,093
More than anyone else,

144
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,263
you're responsible.

145
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,633
But...

146
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,293
how can you be beside her sister?

147
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:20,933
Reporter Woo...

148
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,163
tried really hard...

149
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:29,233
to reveal the truth three years ago.

150
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,563
But his higher-ups stopped him.

151
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,093
Then he got fired from the newspaper company he used to work for.

152
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:40,063
But he has never said anything like that about Ji Hye to me.

153
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,593
He probably wanted to...

154
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,293
respect her feelings.

155
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,533
Maybe he wanted to bury it all.

156
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,163
Then...

157
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,663
what distressed Ji Hye...

158
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,163
was not...

159
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:03,593
getting abandoned by Mr. Kang.

160
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,563
It was the thought...

161
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,933
that she wouldn't be able to face you again.

162
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,093
That she couldn't turn back.

163
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:18,593
That's probably...

164
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:21,793
what devastated her.

165
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,393
Please...

166
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,563
Please...

167
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,063
Please pick up.

168
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:43,033
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.

169
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,363
Please...

170
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:47,463
Please leave a message...

171
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:50,933
Mr. Eun.

172
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:53,533
The person who should own Ji Hye's drawing.

173
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,333
It wasn't Mr. Kang.

174
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:00,863
It was you.

175
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:11,833
What are you drawing?

176
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,863
Of what someone is always looking at.

177
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:24,863
Mr. Kang is always surrounded by a lot of people, you know.

178
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,693
I thought that's why she drew a building filled with people.

179
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,063
But I was wrong.

180
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,663
Mr. Eun.

181
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:53,993
What are you doing?

182
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:58,733
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

183
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:03,403
I was trying to see if these windowsills are dusty,

184
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,533
but they're not. They're clean.

185
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:07,993
I do the cleaning.

186
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:10,593
You don't need to worry about it.

187
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,563
My apologies.

188
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,863
What you see from the window you always look out of.

189
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,663
The flower shop and the bakery on the main floor.

190
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,633
The cafe on the second floor.

191
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:30,663
The hair salon on the third floor.

192
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,663
Right?

193
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,693
I think she wanted to fill...

194
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,333
the concrete building with people.

195
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,793
You're alone all the time,

196
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:54,633
so she was probably hoping you can always have warm people around you.

197
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:03,563
Here.

198
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,163
Take it.

199
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:25,593
The drawing has finally found its owner.

200
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:35,363
Why do you look at me like that?

201
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:40,793
It's just... You look different.

202
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,863
You never looked this relaxed even at home.

203
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,663
Are you disappointed?

204
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:51,633
I'm sorry.

205
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:54,293
This is who I really am.

206
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,333
I'm not disappointed. You look very comfortable.

207
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:02,793
I am.

208
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,233
I'm stuck at home all the time. I never have to dress up.

209
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,763
I don't have to force myself to speak anymore.

210
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:15,063
I don't need to put on fake smiles for other people's sakes either.

211
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,193
Do you stay at home all the time?

212
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:22,933
Mom and Dad told me to.

213
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,093
They must be ashamed of me.

214
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,363
That's absurd.

215
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:29,693
They must worry about you.

216
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:33,233
Anyway, I'm not supposed to be outside. I should get back soon.

217
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:37,293
Why did you want to see me?

218
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:46,993
I've been thinking about you.

219
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:51,563
I thought you had everything.

220
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:57,233
I didn't feel like there was anything I should do for you.

221
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:02,833
I took it for granted that you always put me before yourself.

222
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,363
Sometimes,

223
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,293
I even thought it was boring.

224
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,593
I had no idea I was hurting you so much.

225
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:22,693
It makes me sad.

226
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,893
Forget it.

227
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:30,693
It's not your fault.

228
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:33,763
There you go again.

229
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:36,563
You're just saying that for my sake.

230
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:39,293
You said you feel comfortable being yourself.

231
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,163
You look more beautiful now...

232
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,393
than ever.

233
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:49,993
So stop holding it back.

234
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:52,993
Say what you want to say.

235
00:24:58,193 --> 00:24:59,293
You're right.

236
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,763
It's all your fault.

237
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,133
I hate you.

238
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:09,093
I like that.

239
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,593
But I think it's too mild.

240
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,263
I don't want you to be happy without me.

241
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:21,863
I hope you'll become a big failure.

242
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:23,193
Is that it?

243
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:25,193
That still sounds too moderate.

244
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:27,093
Take it a little further.

245
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,263
You're a jerk. You're the worst.

246
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:36,963
You're a jerk.

247
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:43,663
There you go.

248
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,763
That's the least you should say.

249
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,563
I thought I'd never see you again.

250
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:06,433
I thought you'd run away once you see who I really am.

251
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:09,933
I thought it'd be the end of everything.

252
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,093
Oh, my.

253
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,593
Are you sick again?

254
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,993
You should take better care of yourself to stay competitive.

255
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,263
I'm not sick. It's for weight loss.

256
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,463
Who are you trying to impress this time?

257
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:44,963
It's not like that.

258
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:48,133
I'm going to change.

259
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:51,893
I'll take better care of myself and love myself from now on.

260
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:57,933
What are you doing tonight?

261
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:01,133
- I'm... - You probably don't have any plans,

262
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,193
do you?

263
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,933
When couples go around arm in arm,

264
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:08,133
you read about them on your phone at home.

265
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:12,663
Gosh, I'm doing you a big favor.

266
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:14,433
Here.

267
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,933
What is this?

268
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:20,093
It's a concert Brain is promoting.

269
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:22,533
Go to the concert. I can accompany you.

270
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,663
Aren't I such an amazing colleague?

271
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:31,563
I appreciate your kindness, but I already have plans.

272
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,463
With who?

273
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:37,133
With myself.

274
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:39,593
Sorry?

275
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,233
I'm attending a lecture on PR this evening.

276
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,863
Since when do you attend those lectures?

277
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,333
Starting now, as I already said.

278
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,863
I'm going to take better care of myself and love myself.

279
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,893
Let's do it some other time.

280
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,333
Well...

281
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,863
Hello.

282
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:10,302
Be kinder to her.

283
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:14,742
Gyo Ri is soft-hearted. She must be attracted to kind guys.

284
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,072
What are you talking about?

285
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,772
Don't tell me you believe...

286
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:23,102
being manly means being cold on purpose.

287
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,772
That's just pathetic.

288
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:28,002
You're mistaken.

289
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,242
Enjoy the concert.

290
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:35,702
These are concert tickets. Oh, my.

291
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:38,972
Thank you. I think I'll go with my husband.

292
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:40,272
What is this?

293
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,372
It's weight-loss pills.

294
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,372
About the lecture...

295
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,402
Can I go with you?

296
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:55,902
Do you want to?

297
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:59,302
I'll buy you dinner in return.

298
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:02,542
Sure.

299
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,072
Let's go.

300
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:13,272
- Gosh. - What did I tell you?

301
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:14,842
You're so stupid.

302
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:16,672
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:20,172
- Have some chocolate. - I don't like sweets.

304
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,042
Have some sweets and wake up.

305
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,672
- Stop it. - Wake up.

306
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:36,072
Thanks to you, I could remind myself of the role of PR.

307
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,002
You dozed off the whole time.

308
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:42,702
What's wrong with me?

309
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:47,972
All the other team members seem to be progressing.

310
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,542
I only get in trouble.

311
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:53,402
You said you have a different dream.

312
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,272
- You want to become a celebrity. - Still,

313
00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:59,302
I feel...

314
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:04,972
a bit left out and distant from the others.

315
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:10,102
These days, you feel like a much mature person than I am.

316
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:16,242
Once you start pursuing your real dream,

317
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:18,102
you'll change.

318
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:22,002
What is this? Are you trying to send me away?

319
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:24,302
Do you feel no attachment to me?

320
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:26,542
Don't say that.

321
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:30,042
- I liked you. - So...

322
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:32,942
What did you just say?

323
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,142
Do you want to see where I live?

324
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:40,672
What? Now? Your parents must be there.

325
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:46,472
Well...

326
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:08,042
I knew you'd make that face.

327
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:11,302
After seeing where I live, you feel sorry for me, right?

328
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,672
Me? Not at all.

329
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,472
You live on a rooftop, the symbol of dreams.

330
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:20,842
Youths who have nothing but dreams and passion...

331
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:24,042
live either in the basement or on the rooftop.

332
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:25,902
I've always wanted to try it.

333
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:27,442
You're just saying that.

334
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:30,142
This is why...

335
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,272
I couldn't tell you how I felt.

336
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,372
I'm sorry.

337
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:37,872
I didn't know.

338
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:40,302
Don't be. I'm the one that's sorry.

339
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,772
When you asked me to act like we're dating,

340
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,802
I shouldn't have continued to grow my feelings for you.

341
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:51,702
I'll give back the clothes you bought for me.

342
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,302
Why?

343
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:55,142
Take them.

344
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,072
Now it's really over.

345
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:05,642
You're not even going to try?

346
00:32:05,872 --> 00:32:08,142
Although our relationship was fake,

347
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:10,502
thank you for everything.

348
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:28,842
I finally confessed.

349
00:32:28,872 --> 00:32:31,572
Now I don't have any lingering feelings.

350
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:35,502
Goodbye.

351
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,702
Hwan Gi stole all my dishes last time.

352
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:05,502
Now it's you?

353
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,602
I didn't come here to see you, so don't mind me.

354
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:10,472
I came to volunteer.

355
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,372
I have a heartache because of someone.

356
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:14,642
That's cold.

357
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,842
Sorry, were you standing there?

358
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:24,512
I'm worried about Hwan Gi.

359
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,012
He'll be fine.

360
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:29,102
He has someone beside him...

361
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:32,942
that keeps on knocking at his door to drag him out.

362
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:34,742
Unfortunately,

363
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:37,512
that won't be easy anymore.

364
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,642
We were all fools.

365
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,902
Not a single person...

366
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,972
was able to confess their feelings properly.

367
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:55,302
You're right.

368
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,072
Too bad for you, though.

369
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,272
What?

370
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,272
What do you mean?

371
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:06,472
Think about it.

372
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,972
Ji Hye was looking at someone else three years ago,

373
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,672
when you misunderstood her and wasted your time.

374
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,012
Come on.

375
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,672
I'm not sure if I can say this,

376
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:19,742
but you deserve it.

377
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,442
You're being harsh on me. I'm starting to find you scary.

378
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:28,402
Good. You shouldn't have told me everything then.

379
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,772
I'm sure Hwan Gi feels the same.

380
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:37,402
An open door won't be easy to close.

381
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,072
You fool.

382
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:44,842
Try me. Keep going.

383
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:55,542
This is Reporter Woo. He's been attacking you constantly.

384
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,642
He used to work for a major press.

385
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:01,402
He was best friends with that secretary from three years ago.

386
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:05,402
Also, I found this out while researching around him.

387
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:09,012
The dead secretary's little sister currently works for Brain.

388
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,072
What?

389
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,142
She must have given Reporter Woo information...

390
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,572
since Mr. Eun's power abuse scandal.

That's enough.

393
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:32,012
There's no more space.

394
00:38:35,242 --> 00:38:39,042
Even if you do this, Ro Woon won't change her mind.

395
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:51,802
Come in.

396
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:17,442
I thought I should tell you in advance...

397
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,802
that there's no use in visiting anymore.

398
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:25,302
I'll be closing the shop soon.

399
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:26,542
Pardon?

400
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,772
Why all of a sudden?

401
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,772
The landlord changed,

402
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,142
and they hiked up the rent by a lot.

403
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:37,172
He doesn't have as my customers anymore.

404
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:40,472
He was here for 30 years.

405
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,142
How can they do that?

406
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:53,542
I don't know why Ro Woon locked herself in,

407
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:59,512
but I don't think you two were meant to be.

408
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,842
You should get over her.

409
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:42,272
Now I get it. You were blinded by a woman.

410
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,872
Did she tell you to kick Woo Il out for what he did to her sister?

411
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,342
She didn't tell me anything nor kick Woo Il out.

412
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:54,842
You're so high-maintenance.

413
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:58,542
Was it you...

414
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:01,772
that took over New York Barbershop?

415
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:11,702
Why did you do that?

416
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,742
They don't have anything left. Was it necessary?

417

- You saw how Yi Soo broke down. - Yes.

Hello, I'm Seo Yun Jung.

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me.

425

I'm an impatient man.

You didn't know I was coming?

Hey, you should've told me that you've been seeing her.

431
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,672
Why did you have to make me get involved?

432
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:07,512
You know how shy Hwan Gi is.

433
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,772
I should have reached out to you first.

434
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:13,042
So you two met in university?

435
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:15,402
No, we don't have that kind of relationship.

436
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:19,802
Yes. I've been wanting to be the one by his side since then.

437
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,012
I like him a lot.

You're so straightforward. I love it.

439

I'd love for you to become my daughter-in-law right away.

Even just the thought of it makes me happy.

- Well, it's... - I'm sorry though.

444

You're not exactly my type.

00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:50,172
What?

446
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:54,572
I like how prudent Hwan Gi is.

447

He can be a bit slow, but he's thoughtful and considerate.

That's...

But I see that you're a little different.

450
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:07,872
You're outgoing, impatient, and driven.

451
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,972
I'm like that, so people in that category don't appeal to me.

Thank you for thinking highly of me and arranging this,

453
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:24,972
but I thought you would've at least given Hwan Gi a heads up.

454
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:30,572
Judging from how pushy you are, I'm assuming you've already vetted me.

Well, that's...

00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:18,869
Please visit us!

503
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:34,309
I can let myself go,

504
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:37,369
but I cannot defy time.

505
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,339
Here. Drink it.

506
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,339
"Drink it"?

507
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:48,409
You said you're Se Jong. Can I not talk casually to you?

508
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:53,369
Stop putting on an act, Boss.

509
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:56,509
You must be exhausted. Take that off, will you?

510
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,309
Come on! Gosh, seriously.

511
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,369
Stop moving.

512
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:09,769
Reveal your face already. Goodness.

513
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:15,769
What are you doing?

514
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:18,209
Let go of me, Boss.

515
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:20,139
I'm sorry.

516
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:27,239
Can you just pretend that I'm someone else?

517
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:31,769
I just...

518
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:35,909
want to see your face once.

519
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:43,509
You're already here. Please let me see your face.

520
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,839
I've missed you so much.

521
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:03,909
Mom. When someone falls in love with a bear,

522
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:06,709
will a hero be born?

523
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:09,539
- What are you talking about? - Let's go, Ro Ah.

524
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,139
You have to leave after eating this.

525
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,069
You said you've missed me.

526
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,839
That's a separate matter.

527
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,069
What can't be done cannot be done.

528
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,509
Here. I'm on an extremely tight budget,

529
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:43,709
so this is all I can give you.

530
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:46,909
Anyway, thank you for your help.

531
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:51,909
You don't need to thank me.

532
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:55,539
Your dad's business is suffering...

533
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,439
because of my father.

534
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,309
Sorry?

535
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,169
How...

536
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:06,009
I'm sorry.

537
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:10,109
Now, there's another reason I can't be the one for you.

538
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:13,909
But I came.

539
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:16,309
You're saying it can't be done,

540
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:20,539
but I've decided to pursue it.

541
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,209
But this won't change anything.

542
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:31,309
Until now, you always ran to me.

543
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,539
You trust me having no idea what I had done.

544
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:38,839
After finding out, you forgave me right away.

545
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,139
You can...

546
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,869
lock yourself up now.

547
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:48,209
Just like you did,

548
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,239
I'll knock on the door, look into the room,

549
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:54,609
and try to drag you out.

550
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:58,809
I'll do that from now on.

551
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:07,769
I wouldn't be able to face my sister.

552
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:10,469
We shouldn't do this.

553
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,969
I'll do it.

554
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:17,109
I'll shamelessly insist on staying with someone I shouldn't be with.

555
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,309
I'll do it.

556
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:22,369
Still, I can't do this.

557
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:27,669
Making the impossible possible is the spirit of the special forces.

558
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:29,909
Special forces.

559
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,709
Let me help your father's shop.

560
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:36,639
It's all my father's fault.

561
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:38,539
Okay?

562
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:42,609
Let me do it.

563
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:44,939
I don't know.

564
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:49,139
Please.

565
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:00,669
Gosh.

566
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:07,969
It's just like three years ago.

567
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:20,809
I shout my heart out, but no one listens.

568
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:23,539
One thing has changed.

569
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:25,169
What is that?

570
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:27,509
You're not alone anymore.

571
00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:30,239
Gosh, that's cheesy.

572
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,869
Do you want one more reason why you can't be with me?

573
00:52:32,939 --> 00:52:34,209
I'm not talking about myself.

574
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:59,309
My goodness.

575
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:01,469
Gosh.

576
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:04,969
I knew you'd be using elementary methods like this.

577
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,139
Don't tell anyone you've worked at Silent Monster.

578
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:10,009
Sun Bong.

579
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:14,069
He's right. You have a lot to learn. Who said you could leave?

580
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:16,069
Yoo Hee.

581
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,769
You should have told us.

582
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:22,709
We're all here to help you, Ro Woon.

583
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,309
Thank you so much,

584
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,809
everyone.

585
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:42,469
As you already know,

586
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:44,839
the market is now dominated by hair salons.

587
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:48,039
If you simply beg customers to visit a barbershop...

588
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:51,509
that has been forgotten, you'll only look pitiful.

589
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:52,969
Then what should we do?

590
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,839
Don't blame the world for never changing.

591
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:59,369
It's faster and more effective to change yourself.

592
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:06,169
- Excuse me. - Do you like red ginseng?

593
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:07,439
Try it.

594
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:11,369
Could you answer this questionnaire?

595
00:54:11,409 --> 00:54:13,469
Hello, could you answer this questionnaire?

596
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:15,809
- Hello. - Hello.

597
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:18,369
- Try some red ginseng. - Please answer this questionnaire.

598
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:20,039
Don't feel burdened.

599
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:22,439
Try some red ginseng too.

600
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,309
Here's the questionnaire.

601
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,239
- Yoo Hee, here's one for you. - For me?

602
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,369
- If you're bored... - It's a bit bitter.

603
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,309
For an innovation, do thorough market research first.

604
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,369
It tastes good, right?

605
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,169
Please take this.

606
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:42,139
Try white.

607
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:47,309
- Pink. - It looks good.

608
00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:51,709
It's nice.

609
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:58,809
It looks great.

610
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:07,239
- You look like an actor. - That's absurd.

611
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:15,409
You look amazing.

612
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:17,409
- It looks great on you. - You look great.

613
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,809
You look 10 years younger.

614
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:20,969
You look amazing.

615
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:25,309
Are you really my dad?

616
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:28,539
You look fantastic. You look like a different person.

617
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:31,839
Why don't you change all the towels as well?

618
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,939
The interior design and the signs too.

619
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:37,569
You could change the name of the shop as well.

620
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,569
The floor, the ceiling, and the walls will look better this way.

621
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,669
Oh, my.

622
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:47,239
I don't know how to pay you back for your efforts.

623
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:52,969
Still, all this feels strange and uncomfortable to me.

624
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:56,569
You need to change to be loved.

625
00:55:56,569 --> 00:55:58,609
If I'm going to change everything,

626
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:01,469
what's the point of staying at the same place?

627
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:06,769
You've worked so hard. I'm so sorry.

628
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,109
Don't say that.

629
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:10,369
- It's okay. - We understand.

630
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,969
It's okay.

631
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:15,669
Dad.

632
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:32,339
Well then...

633
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:34,539
I'll get going.

634
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:36,339
Get home safely.

635
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,809
I can't believe him.

636
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:47,169
He never gets out of his comfort zone.

637
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:51,369
We shouldn't have urged him to change against his will.

638
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:54,909
We should find a way he can stay the way he is.

639
00:56:57,969 --> 00:56:59,339
Would that be possible?

640
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:02,869
It's what someone told me before.

641
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:08,109
I'm sure there's a method of communication that suits you.

642
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:10,039
Let's find it.

643
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,309
Don't change.

644
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,139
I'll make sure to find it.

645
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:26,839
Don't worry too much. You should get going now.

646
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:30,409
- I'll get going then. - See you.

647
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,239
I'm reporter Han Seok Jun.

648
00:57:45,439 --> 00:57:47,639
- The 38th... - Seok Jun?

649
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,709
Please do me a favor.

650
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:57,469
He's so popular as a host.

651
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:00,539
I can't promise you anything.

652
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:03,409
- You know that, right? - Yes. Thank you.

653
00:58:03,669 --> 00:58:05,839
Please ask him to look through the material.

654
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:06,939
(New York Barbershop)

655
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:11,439
Do me a favor in return.

656
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:14,339
Pretend to be my boyfriend just once.

657
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:16,109
What?

658
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,309
You know that he's my first love, right?

659
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:22,509
I was an unattractive girl with braces back then.

660
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:25,309
I want to show him that I've completely changed.

661
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:28,639
But why me?

662
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:31,439
I pretended to be your girlfriend in front of your father too.

663
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:33,639
Can't you do it for me just this once?

664
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:37,539
- Still, I... - You don't want to?

665
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:45,369
I didn't say that.

666
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:47,539
Just take it.

667
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:50,309
You're doing it, okay?

668
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,869
I like the concept.

669
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,839
Can I just say hi and leave?

670
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:08,069
Yes, give me a kiss too.

671
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:09,569
Okay. What?

672
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:12,209
I have a sad history.

673
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:15,139
While keeping me on the hook,

674
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:17,569
he kissed my best friend.

675
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:20,069
Help me recover from my trauma.

676
00:59:20,439 --> 00:59:23,869
Still, I can't kiss you.

677
00:59:23,909 --> 00:59:26,809
It's just a little peck. Is it that hard?

678
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:31,639
I can't do that.

679
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:34,309
I can't do this either then.

680
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,239
Wait.

681
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,639
It'll be a peck on the cheek.

682
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:46,309
- On the lips. - On the cheek.

683
00:59:47,969 --> 00:59:49,169
Fine, on the cheek.

684
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:51,539
Let's go.

685
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:54,569
It'll be on the cheek.

686
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,639
- Hi, it's been a long time. - Hi, Yun Jung.

687
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:08,239
Have you been well? Who is this?

688
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:11,069
This is Hwan Gi, the CEO of Silent Monster.

689
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:12,109
I see.

690
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,109
He's my boyfriend.

691
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,539
Hello.

692
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,239
Nice to meet you.

693
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,239
- He wanted to meet you. - I see.

694
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:30,769
Honey, you can go now.

695
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,369
- Should I go? - Yes.

696
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:35,239
Right now?

697
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:59,339
Thank you. Bye.

698
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:44,769
- All right, it's finished. - Thank you.

699
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:54,169
I heard other people tell me that my stylist must hate me...

700
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,709
because I got trendy haircuts that didn't suit me.

701
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:58,809
However, the New York Barbershop...

702
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,739
has kept their place for 30 years for a reason.

703
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:03,439
They have a huge presence.

704
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,239
Thank you so much.

705
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:19,009
You should thank Hwan Gi.

706
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:20,569
All I did was help with the contact.

707
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:24,339
Also, New York Barbershop is a good item by itself.

708
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:26,369
The producers could see that it was worth covering.

709
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:33,209
I'm leaving for the US tonight.

710
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:34,369
Pardon? The US?

711
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:36,169
It's going to be a long trip this time.

712
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,669
Don't be too happy.

713
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:41,409
Why all of a sudden?

714
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:45,039
So that people miss me more.

715
01:02:46,939 --> 01:02:48,909
I didn't tell Hwan Gi yet.

716
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,809
I hope he gets upset and misses me.

717
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:54,469
You should still say goodbye.

718
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,539
I got to say my goodbye.

719
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:04,339
Please take good care of him.

720
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,469
I...

721
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,909
I know. Still, please take good care of him.

722
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,209
Take care.

723
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:33,239
Come visit me.

724
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:38,809
Please line up.

725
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:42,239
- Don't cut in line. - What's going on?

726
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,039
- Here you go. - Okay.

727
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,139
- Sure, take a picture. - You can take me.

728
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:50,109
I'm his closest friend.

729
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:58,809
You have a lot of customers.

730
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:00,569
Oh, hello.

731
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:02,469
- Please sit here to wait. - Okay.

732
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:04,539
You have to line up here.

733
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:07,539
Hey, you're here.

734
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:10,669
- Come here. - Sure, okay.

735
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:12,409
Almost done.

736
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:14,539
What is all this?

737
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:23,539
98...

738
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:26,669
Gosh, rent isn't the issue anymore.

739
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:28,869
You'll become a landlord at this rate.

740
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,839
It'll only be temporary.

741
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:34,239
Don't be blinded. You should always be consistent.

742
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:37,409
Gosh. All right.

743
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:39,869
2,000.

744
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:43,239
(Yoo Hee)

745
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:47,469
Yes, Yoo Hee.

746
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:51,839
Pardon?

747
01:04:54,209 --> 01:04:58,669
Last year, corruption behind a huge construction was revealed.

748
01:04:59,139 --> 01:05:04,039
That was also the time a famous celebrity's scandal broke out.

749
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:07,839
The one that provided the information about the scandal...

750
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:10,369
was Silent Monster.

751
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:13,939
The power abuser Eun Hwan Gi helped another power abuser...

752
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:17,039
regain his good image. Rose Airlines' Mr. Park.

753
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:19,169
Birds of a feather flock together.

754
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:21,709
There is something more beyond that.

755
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:24,869
For Congressman Eun's election within the party,

756
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:29,239
Mr. Park's in-laws have a key vote.

757
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:33,469
Congressman Eun has a great network in the press and in politics.

758
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,439
He's talented in dealing with issues.

759
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:39,939
Gosh.

760
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:43,969
Someone fell to her death at the company,

761
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:47,339
but he covered it up and not a single line was published.

762
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:53,439
I'm Mr. Eun Hwan Gi's secretary.

763
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:58,109
When he was talked about regarding his abuse of power,

764
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:00,739
they were able to deal with the crisis and get out of it.

765
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:04,909
They buried truths that put them at a disadvantage.

766
01:06:05,569 --> 01:06:08,939
Congressman Eun would emphasize advantageous issues.

767
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,239
The one that executed everything...

768
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,209
was Brain. And also,

769
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,379
Silent Monster.

770
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,339
Reporter Woo, how can you do this without telling me?

771
01:06:22,339 --> 01:06:25,469
Did you know Congressman Eun is trying to kick your father out?

772
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:27,609
I know that.

773
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,239
But you got one thing wrong.

774
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,939
Boss and Silent Monster are...

775
01:06:34,939 --> 01:06:36,809
The truth is relative.

776
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:38,709
I'm sorry.

777
01:06:39,439 --> 01:06:40,809
But...

778
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,339
Why can't you leave?

779
01:07:03,379 --> 01:07:05,939
Exactly what was that about?

780
01:07:17,009 --> 01:07:18,139
Ji Hye...

781
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:25,469
used to like him.

782
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:28,169
What?

783
01:07:28,439 --> 01:07:30,569
That's why she suffered.

784
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:37,379
It was because she couldn't tell him how she felt.

785
01:07:38,379 --> 01:07:39,469
Then...

786
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:44,379
how can I...

787
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:48,109
accept him?

788
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:51,379
I...

789
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,669
There is a way out for us.

790
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:04,939
We can say...

791
01:08:06,339 --> 01:08:08,739
that Woo Il did it out of excessive loyalty.

792
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,509
- Father. - He's already gone.

793
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:16,379
We can say that we found out and fired him in advance.

794
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:17,769
Please stop it!

795
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:53,309
(My Shy Boss)

796
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:55,939
There is only one person I want to be with.

797
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:59,439
I was always stuck in one spot, but she made me run.

798
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,439
She also ran towards me.

799
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,839
How long are you going to stay here by yourself?

800
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,379
- I can't sleep anyway. - Porn?

801
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:07,709
Isn't that sexy?

802
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:10,009
- Go wash up. - Should I take a shower?

803
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:11,939
From head to toe?

804
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,839
Tell me. What are you unhappy with? Just go ahead.

805
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:16,469
Don't see me, or don't ask me.

806
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:18,139
No, just don't be curious.

807
01:09:18,139 --> 01:09:20,139
I'm by myself again. Boss!

808
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:21,539
Let's grant the wish of the winner.

809
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:23,909
- I got my wish. - What was your wish?
