00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:57,241
Mr. Dimitar Jelev
is running for mayor of Triaditsa.

2
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,762
Hello, Mr. Jelev.

3
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,479
You still here?

4
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,436
I talked to people in the neighborhood.

5
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,165
Don't you hear me?
Why aren't you at school?

6
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,238
I have class this afternoon.

7
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,522
I have also come to realize

8
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,479
that people need change.

9
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:38,765
Come on, I'm sick of waiting for you.

10
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,439
Too cool, you shaved it.

11
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:48,482
Man, I can't do it.

12
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,525
I gotta go to school.

13
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,166
Are you kidding me?

14
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,602
No, I have a test today.

15
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,086
You're crazy.

16
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,477
Kitty, you want a drag?

17
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,837
How long are we gonna wait?

18
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,445
What did he say?

19
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,725
You know why...

20
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,919
there are no Arabs in Star Trek?

21
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,076
Why?

22
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:35,076
'Cause it takes place in the future.

23
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,805
You get it?

24
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:40,638
Yeah.

25
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,955
You never laugh!

26
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,636
Lvan got kicked out last night.

27
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,526
My wife voted as well.

28
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:44,723
I told her it was so damn stupid.

29
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,004
Why do you send text messages?
The results are rigged.

30
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,525
Fucking Music Idol!

31
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,998
Beans and a beer.

32
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,678
For me, beer,

33
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,439
chicken soup and bread.

34
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,766
Hi, ltso.

35
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:00,841
Hello.

36
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:02,921
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,440
With Georgi.

38
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,957
Georgi, from the neighborhood.

39
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,480
From the block.

40
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:13,281
Yeah, you know him.

41
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,198
We have to join them at the "Rally".

42
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,686
Who was it?

43
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:22,962
Drega.

44
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,164
See how I got fucked up.

45
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,684
Some rednecks from the provinces!

46
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,601
I got drunk and woke up

47
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,997
with these guns and flags on me.

48
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,845
Fucking assholes,

49
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,885
they really fucked me up!

50
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:48,238
Don't look at that, it's crap.

51
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:49,476
Why? This is cool.

52
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,286
Cool? No one's gonna get that.

53
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:56,042
I think it's cool.

54
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,765
Get an eagle

55
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,720
or a dog with a cross.

56
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,125
What kind of dog?

57
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:05,755
A dog or two, or three.

58
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,758
With some crosses, I don't know...

59
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,002
Come on, let's go.

60
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,237
Ok, if you don't want to do it.

61
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,961
You guys want your dicks pierced?

62
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:46,721
Ltso!

63
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,360
How you doing, buddy?

64
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,119
It's been a thousand years!

65
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,196
What's up?

66
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,635
I'm ok.

67
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:56,958
It's been ages!

68
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,719
Since the Art Academy.

69
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:01,436
You working?

70
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,757
Yeah, making furniture.

71
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,246
I mean, on your own stuff.

72
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,604
Let's go and see it.

73
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,918
I was gonna have a beer, but, ok.
It's a five minute walk.

74
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,123
We'll grab a beer later.

75
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:20,077
Why'd you come back?
Don't you like living in Holland?

76
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,158
I wanna try my luck here.

77
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,966
In Bulgaria? Are you crazy?

78
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:28,355
I'm divorced. I have two daughters.

79
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,402
Rumpy is a total mess.

80
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,196
I asked him to lend me 50 leva.

81
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,961
He was dropping cigarette ash
all over his car.

82
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:43,517
He almost crushed a fag
on my forehead.

83
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,356
Come on in.

84
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:53,642
What's up?

85
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:54,876
Hi.

86
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,876
Roommates... It's the worse.

87
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,524
Very cool.

88
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,762
This is my heart.

89
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,958
There's another one over there.

90
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:27,043
Adam and Lilith.

91
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:37,840
Great!

92
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,400
Bravo.

93
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,638
Let's do something together.

94
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,519
Sure.

95
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,756
In Holland.

96
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,481
Forget about Holland. Let's do it here.

97
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:53,406
Hurry up. It's getting late.

98
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,080
I fucked up!

99
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:57,841
Why did they wrap you up
with that plastic?

100
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,760
So you fucked up, big deal!

101
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,602
Come on!

102
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,042
- I'm going home.
- Why?

103
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,277
'Cause my father'll get pissed off.

104
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,039
Are you crazy?

105
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,683
What do I tell Drega?

106
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,965
That your dad doesn't want you out at night?

107
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,446
Whatever.

108
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,602
What's up?

109
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,041
What's up?

110
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:57,965
You tell me.

111
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:00,797
Who's that?

112
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,439
Georgi, from the hood.
Don't you remember?

113
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,640
You remember?

114
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:10,717
Yeah.

115
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,526
You look like Rambo with that haircut.

116
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:15,839
Rambo has long hair.

117
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,555
Look at his fingers.

118
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,078
Are you a piano player or what?

119
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,162
No.

120
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,959
What? A tennis player?

121
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:36,556
Kinda.

122
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,119
You know that guy...

123
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,405
Ivo the Cork?

124
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:49,960
Lvo the Cork.

125
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,481
I know a guy named lvo, but he's tall.

126
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,678
They don't call him the Cork

127
00:12:57,847 --> 00:12:59,439
'cause he's short, but...

128
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,287
'cause he shoved a champagne cork

129
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,358
up a transvestite's arse.

130
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:07,516
For real?

131
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,643
That's what they say.

132
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:12,281
Have you tried with a cork?

133
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,358
No, but I think I know the guy.

134
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,803
Who? The transvestite or the Cork?

135
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,202
The Cork.

136
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:23,875
Can you find him for me?

137
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,167
I can try.

138
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,722
It's nice and quiet here.

139
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,159
It's boring.

140
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,317
It's boring, but there's no one around.

141
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:45,681
It's great.

142
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,199
Baking their asses.

143
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:56,007
While I bust my ass in that woodwork shop.

144
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,598
Let's find a workshop
and do something together.

145
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,996
Come on!

146
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll call the others.

147
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,725
It'll cost a lot of money.

148
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,406
We'll split the rent

149
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,996
I'm all for it.

150
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,116
I really wanna do it.

151
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,355
Hi!

152
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,165
This is Niki.

153
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:28,516
Sex!

154
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,361
What?

155
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:33,676
Nikolina. Niki.

156
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:34,843
Nice to meet you.

157
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:36,676
Itso...

158
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,121
A friend from the Academy.

159
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,157
No. Design.

160
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,715
It's the same.

161
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,964
I knew you'd say that.

162
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,119
I want a beer too.

163
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,118
Can't you talk?

164
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:54,996
One beer.

165
00:14:58,407 --> 00:14:59,556
What do you do?

166
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,924
I study theater
with professor Danailov.

167
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:06,245
She talks like a radio show host.

168
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,800
- Cool. Which year?
- Second.

169
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,322
It's very cool. We do fragments.

170
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,798
Fragments? What's that?

171
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,798
She can't really express herself.

172
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,002
Itso!

173
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,603
What about you?

174
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,439
- He already told you: Design.
- Yes, design.

175
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,403
I'll ask some friends.

176
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,363
Perfect.

177
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,087
But don't count on it in the city.

178
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,841
It can be elsewhere.

179
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,206
That's a great idea!

180
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:41,243
Awesome.

181
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,967
Itso dreams of making a living off his art

182
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,966
instead of working with those toxic sprays.

183
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:49,561
He probably told you.

184
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,483
Thanks.

185
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,520
What do you do?

186
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,122
Design.

187
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,118
Between 2003 and 2005,

188
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,399
92 acres of state forests were cut down.

189
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,484
Since 2005,

190
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:28,276
that surface has been multiplied by 100.

191
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,683
Why are you back so late?

192
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,041
Young man, I don't approve this.

193
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,116
Wait.

194
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,557
The Prime Minister announced

195
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,922
that all Sapard projects would be verified.

196
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,485
Goshe, is that you?

197
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:17,039
Stop calling him Goshe.

198
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:18,242
What?

199
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,965
Georgi!

200
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,685
We aren't gonna wait for you.

201
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,198
What happened to your hair?

202
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,846
You look like a monkey.

203
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:35,639
I asked him the same thing.

204
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,317
But he won't say anything.

205
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:40,398
As if I were to blame.

206
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,762
When did you ask me?

207
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,317
There's no salt.

208
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:46,961
Why are you so late, you little shit?

209
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,121
You know what time you need to be home.

210
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:04,155
You need a good thrashing to grow up.

211
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:07,000
Goshe, how was school today?

212
00:18:58,127 --> 00:18:59,560
Ltso. Hi.

213
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,001
How are you?

214
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,159
Super, but I'm late for work.

215
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,158
- What was your number?
- 187.

216
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,357
I'm thinking of cutting it down, but...

217
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,437
You should.

218
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,962
I gotta talk to the doctor first.

219
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:22,163
I can't pee.

220
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,760
Just a little bit.

221
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,566
- Could you let the water run.
- Ok. Come on.

222
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:44,921
That'll do.

223
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,846
Is that you?

224
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,162
Hi!

225
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,480
What's up, ltso?

226
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,761
I'm bored.

227
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,006
Let's go out.

228
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,120
Why not?

229
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,959
Obviously, you forgot.

230
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:21,555
What?

231
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,521
Today's my birthday.

232
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,878
I'm such an idiot.

233
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,201
I wish you the best.

234
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:42,997
Thanks.

235
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,321
And get rid of that clown.

236
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,795
What clown?

237
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,884
What are you talking about?

238
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,435
Christo...

239
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,399
Are you listening to me?

240
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:14,083
I'm talking about me.
You need someone better.

241
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:18,999
I reserved a table for dinner
and I want to enjoy the evening.

242
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,323
Not fight with you, for once.

243
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,036
OK.

244
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,643
Good evening. Are you ready to order?

245
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:02,916
Beer.

246
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,486
- What kind?
- Bulgarian

247
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,046
We don't have Bulgarian.

248
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,876
- You got Swedish?
- Yes, we do.

249
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,605
A Swedish beer?

250
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,198
Any kind.

251
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:17,717
What about you?

252
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,276
Don't you want to eat something?

253
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,802
I can't read the menu. It's in English.

254
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,075
And bread!

255
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,635
Is it good?

256
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,006
There's no salt.

257
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:10,197
Itso, people go to restaurants
to eat and to talk.

258
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,761
Clearly, we've run out of things to say.

259
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:20,916
What?

260
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,436
Talk.

261
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:27,086
What is wrong with you?

262
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,484
What are you missing?

263
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,236
Salt.

264
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:36,880
And pepper.

265
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:53,443
Why do we have to have fun?

266
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,042
Because it's my birthday.

267
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,686
Big deal!

268
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:17,886
One more beer!

269
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,526
Goddammit!

270
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,364
The prices seem ok.

271
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,358
What are you having?

272
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:42,280
I don't know, maybe a salad.

273
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,802
- Are we having wine?
- I'm not drinking.

274
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,603
I'll have a glass of red wine.

275
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:58,564
It's nice here.

276
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,760
And the people look ok.

277
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:02,724
It's a quiet city.

278
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:04,798
Compared to Istanbul, everywhere is.

279
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,083
'Cause you've never been to China.

280
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,643
Please, don't talk to me about China.

281
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:12,760
You know the Chinese eat everything.

282
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,719
They even eat Tibetans!

283
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,684
One country conquering another?

284
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:25,995
Don't be so naive. It suits everyone.

285
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,438
Who is everyone?

286
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,603
The big players.

287
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,683
The States can't do much

288
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:35,036
without China.

289
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:36,720
Let's change the subject.

290
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,320
How's your dish?

291
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:41,757
It's delicious.

292
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:43,918
I wonder what

293
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:46,078
the ordinary Chinese thinks of Tibet?

294
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,441
Is it black pepper?

295
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,643
I don't know.

296
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,125
It's delicious.

297
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:55,396
Let's go.

298
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:18,043
Hello, Kerem!

299
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:20,840
It's the answering machine.

300
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:25,036
Kerem! We're spending the night in Sofia.

301
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:29,603
Expect us in Berlin by Monday.

302
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:30,916
Lots of kisses.

303
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:37,396
You don't need to lose weight, Dad.

304
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,319
Of course not!

305
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,721
Mother, why didn't you wear
the sandals I bought you?

306
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,202
Shut up, bitch!

307
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:00,959
Look at these Turks on our streets.

308
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:02,321
Are you a tough guy?

309
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,398
What're you waiting for?

310
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,479
He's yours.

311
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,600
Fish! Go and watch that corner.

312
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,204
You, go to the other side.

313
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:58,805
He's fallen asleep.

314
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:06,204
What's happening here?

315
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,241
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

316
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,236
Georgi!

317
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,196
Georgi!

318
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,566
Georgi, come on!

319
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:03,721
Hello!

320
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,962
Could you send an ambulance

321
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,680
to Dondukov Street?

322
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,996
I think it's the second one after Levski.

323
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:51,516
Isil.

324
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,601
Christo.

325
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:02,202
You don't recognize me or what?

326
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,595
Hi.

327
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,406
Come on, sit down.

328
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,841
Get me a glass.

329
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,675
Cheers!

330
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,637
Thanks for the fork.

331
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,201
Here you are.

332
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:54,724
Silence is golden!

333
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:05,044
Do you have a girlfriend?

334
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,316
Yes, I do.

335
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,879
Several.

336
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:16,243
And that stupid place you work in...

337
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:18,398
What do you know about it?

338
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,286
What do I know? I know you earn 300 leva.

339
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:22,766
Isn't that so?

340
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,799
Or he's on the computer, chatting...

341
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,320
"Home"?

342
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,321
You call this your home?

343
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:39,002
This is not your home. Is it clear?

344
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:43,080
"Georgi"! All the time "Georgi"!

345
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:49,637
- What's wrong with me?
- What?

346
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:52,640
All you know is
Big Brother and Music Idol.

347
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:55,880
Why are you so interested
in other people's money?

348
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:59,642
Always asking
how much people make?

349
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,119
What do you do all day long?

350
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,357
Buy washing machines...

351
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,358
That's not true! I'm a hairdresser!

352
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,205
- Will you shut up?
- No. I won't.

353
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,641
You will.

354
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:11,203
That's it.

355
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:14,038
- Where'd she come from?
- Hold it...

356
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,278
I have a question for you.

357
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,883
Are you still doing drugs?

358
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:22,322
Give me a break.

359
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:25,206
What kind of example
are you for your brother?

360
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,516
Dad, please.

361
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:28,996
Have you seen yourself in the mirror?

362
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:30,806
Cut the crap.

363
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:32,526
Don't talk to me like that!

364
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:36,639
You've been either stoned or drunk.

365
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,121
It's all the same.

366
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,005
If you're here for money...

367
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,763
- Money?
- I ain't got money!

368
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,641
I came here...

369
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,486
for your spoiled chicken

370
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:51,080
and to finish your beer.

371
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,087
That woman's totally insane.

372
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:20,526
Want a smoke?

373
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:21,676
No.

374
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't smoke.

375
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,365
Where did you find those morons?

376
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,881
Why are you hanging out with them?

377
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,160
Don't you get it?

378
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:15,040
The fat politicians

379
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,165
use those dumb arses and their violence.

380
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:27,918
You shaved your head.

381
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,320
Give me a smoke.

382
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:38,918
I thought you didn't smoke.

383
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:50,083
- I have mine.
- You have yours?

384
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,842
A non smoker, my ass!

385
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,205
How are they?

386
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:05,921
Ok.

387
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,476
It looks better and better around here.

388
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:21,238
Buildings, everywhere.

389
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:28,519
This whole field will be a business center.

390
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:33,001
They demolished the houses over there.

391
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:37,596
Soon, there'll be towers all around.

392
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,806
Perfect.

393
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:42,762
We'll merge with Plovdiv city soon.

394
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:46,565
How is Mum?

395
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,365
Have you seen her recently?

396
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:10,043
Georgi, where are you going?

397
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,117
Wait!

398
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,686
73 football fans from CSKA and Levski

399
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:23,277
were arrested for engaging
in fighting before and after the game.

400
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:27,804
23 of them have criminal records.

401
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,639
Prior to the game,

402
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:33,237
CSKA fans attacked
tourists from Kosovo.

403
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,284
The window of a trolley bus was broken,

404
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:38,638
wounding a 43-year-old person...

405
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,040
Yes, he's here.

406
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,485
I heard it was a good game.

407
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:55,325
Even though we lost.

408
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:56,836
Let me talk to him.

409
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,807
It was a good game even though we lost.

410
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,923
We kicked their asses!

411
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,406
He says they kicked their asses.

412
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:10,483
Tell him there's already a lot of us.

413
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:13,043
He says theres already a lot of them.

414
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:15,317
Tell him to stop showing off.

415
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,000
Mister big boss.

416
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,036
Ok, give him the money.

417
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,521
Of course.

418
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,398
Your father wants to see you.

419
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:53,639
Just a second, Mom.

420
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,320
Why are you acting like this?

421
00:42:58,527 --> 00:42:59,642
Come on.

422
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:16,956
Don't talk to these people.

423
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:18,715
What people?

424
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,084
Stay away from these Bulgarians.

425
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:23,839
"These Bulgarians"?

426
00:43:24,207 --> 00:43:25,401
Don't talk like that.

427
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,159
I'm asking you...

428
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:30,443
to stop seeing this guy.

429
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,677
How can you talk like that?

430
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,439
Can't you see he's different?

431
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:36,325
End of discussion.

432
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:38,682
Dad, it could have been worse.

433
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:44,638
You're turning into one of them.

434
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:48,601
Isil, please let your father rest.

435
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:40,002
Fish, what happened to Rambo?

436
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,635
I don't know, he always disappears.

437
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:31,044
What now?

438
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:40,884
Why won't you answer your phone?

439
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,523
You don't listen to what I say.

440
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:47,405
Listen to what?

441
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:51,756
You don't pick up your phone,
how can I hear you?

442
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,964
What's the point of suffering?

443
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,038
But I'm not suffering!

444
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,638
I want to be with you.

445
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,718
Stop talking nonsense, please.

446
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:11,875
Christo...

447
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:16,123
You are everything to me in this life.

448
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:24,797
And how's that supposed to matter?

449
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:42,875
Rambo...

450
00:46:43,407 --> 00:46:45,796
What's up? I haven't seen you for a while.

451
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:49,085
What's your problem?

452
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,041
Blow me.

453
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:54,364
Are you a fag or what?

454
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:56,196
What?

455
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,916
I said are you a fag?

456
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:02,081
An insecure fag.

457
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,835
We must strictly enforce

458
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,043
the laws of our country...

459
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:28,206
You too?

460
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:33,319
We will reach this goal with the police,

461
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:36,280
the gendarmerie and the city.

462
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,043
Unemployed gypsies will not be allowed

463
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:43,239
to leave their designated areas.

464
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,918
Caravans will be barred

465
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:48,203
from the streets of Sofia.

466
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,883
Let's have a walk.

467
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:02,245
Maraba, my love.

468
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,397
Go.

469
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,280
Where to?

470
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,522
Just drive. I'll tell you...

471
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:18,960
later.

472
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:21,206
Where do you want to...

473
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:18,400
Where are you from?

474
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:39,320
Take this ball.

475
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:44,842
For the girl from the Sun. A gift.

476
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:50,722
A ball.

477
00:53:56,887 --> 00:53:58,400
For rolling.

478
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,642
Methadone treatment, but...

479
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,243
it doesn't really work.

480
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:22,842
I started drinking alcohol.

481
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,003
A couple of shots in the morning,

482
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,964
then at lunch

483
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:32,400
and after work.

484
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,882
And I want to drink even more.

485
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:46,560
How did I become an alcoholic?
I don't understand.

486
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,522
Where have you been? I was worried!

487
00:56:03,087 --> 00:56:04,361
I went out for a walk.

488
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,995
Didn't your father tell you not to go out?

489
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,041
Ltso...

490
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,122
What again?

491
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,357
I'm so happy to see you.

492
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:37,837
Last night I realized
we could be just friends...

493
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:41,643
and share our secrets.

494
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:43,446
Let's go and see a movie.

495
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:01,201
There you are.

496
01:01:01,847 --> 01:01:02,882
Thanks.

497
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:19,324
I'm gonna see the psychiatrist.

498
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,886
All right.

499
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:22,366
There's nobody waiting.

500
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,961
Please, don't mix up the bottles.

501
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:26,321
Don't worry.

502
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:43,399
I guess...

503
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:46,761
I left my soul in the fridge.

504
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,163
Yes, you can have that feeling.

505
01:01:54,487 --> 01:01:56,239
But I think that, with time,

506
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,602
we can overcome this.

507
01:02:00,527 --> 01:02:02,085
Slowly, but surely.

508
01:02:04,447 --> 01:02:06,517
I almost want to smile!

509
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:10,126
I hope so.

510
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,637
I still believe we can make it.

511
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:18,596
It may take a little while.

512
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,725
I'm so nervous.

513
01:02:21,887 --> 01:02:23,400
Yes, I can sense that.

514
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:27,047
Quickly, slowly, forward, backward,

515
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:29,641
upward, downward...
Nervous all over.

516
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:34,323
Sounds like you have nothing to hold on to.

517
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,162
I feel like I've reached...

518
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,320
the bottom.

519
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:46,284
Like I'm flat on my back.

520
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:47,920
Smashed.

521
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:51,280
And you have no strength
to pick yourself up.

522
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:56,760
I have the strength,
just nothing to hold on to.

523
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,724
I don't need a cane.

524
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,276
I need some kind of a truth to believe in.

525
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,516
Exactly.

526
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:08,365
I don't remember if we discussed this...

527
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,837
A study shows

528
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:14,283
that among the best scientists,

529
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:23,918
Yes, I know.

530
01:03:24,287 --> 01:03:27,563
At the end of his life, Einstein

531
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,843
proved the existence of God.

532
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:31,645
Yes, my boy.

533
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,839
Isaac Newton explained

534
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:39,079
his law of energy at the Sorbonne.

535
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:43,206
He said: "I've brought you a new law,

536
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:45,244
"a law of energy.

537
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:49,483
"It is just transformed."

538
01:03:49,647 --> 01:03:52,161
Scientists asked him:

539
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:55,524
"How did you discover this?"

540
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,845
And he said: "Believe it or not,

541
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:02,283
"God wrote me the answer
in red letters on the wall.

542
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,438
"And the letters were on fire."

543
01:04:07,687 --> 01:04:11,521
So we should never
lose faith and keep hoping.

544
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:12,961
Never.

545
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:17,802
I don't know about hope,
but I like the letters on fire.

546
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:18,922
It's true.

547
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:23,080
I feel more attracted
by fire than by hope.

548
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:27,404
Try thinking of everything good in yourself.

549
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:31,276
I really want to find that little piece

550
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,559
of goodness.

551
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:37,201
But where is it?

552
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:39,483
Maybe it's in my heel.

553
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:47,797
Do I have to take a big needle,

554
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,676
suck it out from here and inject it there.

555
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:52,836
No, my boy.

556
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:56,204
Slowly you'll come back to reality.

557
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:01,158
You'll do it, little by little.

558
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:04,523
I don't want to be real.

559
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,126
I want to be crystal.

560
01:05:09,287 --> 01:05:11,562
I want to radiate light.

561
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:14,878
I want to love all human beings.

562
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:17,799
I want to embrace them.

563
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:20,527
But it doesn't work. Goddammit!

564
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:12,640
Do you have a lover?

565
01:06:12,807 --> 01:06:13,762
No, no.

566
01:06:14,447 --> 01:06:17,200
I assure you. I don't have a lover.

567
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:19,958
Neither do I.

568
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:25,921
That I will never love again

569
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:28,396
and that I will become a philosopher.

570
01:07:30,527 --> 01:07:31,721
Bye, ltso.

571
01:08:49,887 --> 01:08:52,799
On a bed I laid ill

572
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:55,800
White room with no stars

573
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,720
Oranges on the floor

574
01:08:58,887 --> 01:09:01,879
I have neither brothers nor sisters

575
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:19,724
Fears I pin with needles

576
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:22,242
And the salt I eat with a spoon

577
01:09:22,887 --> 01:09:25,720
My body has no skin

578
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,879
You are away - Im mute

579
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:41,120
Inject! Inject!

580
01:09:42,687 --> 01:09:45,485
Inject me with love

581
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:13,082
Tiny snakes I stick with my fingers

582
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:15,562
And I drown in wells

583
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:18,525
The devils are believers

584
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:21,724
And spin the souls around

585
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,843
I went blind from too many words

586
01:10:41,007 --> 01:10:44,443
I went deaf from too much dark

587
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,043
My body is too tight for me

588
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:53,327
I'm gonna fold into a little dot

589
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:30,926
Hey, boy!

590
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,119
Come and help me.

591
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,719
Please, come and help me.

592
01:12:36,887 --> 01:12:38,843
With that cardboard?

593
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:40,201
Take that bag.

594
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:56,519
Do you live closeby?

595
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:57,961
Very close.

596
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:19,198
On the second floor.

597
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,239
Leave the bag over there.

598
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:30,998
I felt so warm.

599
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:36,156
I fell asleep.

600
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:44,321
I feel like I've been here before.

601
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:47,918
It feels like home.

602
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:03,879
It's you? Come in.

603
01:17:04,607 --> 01:17:06,563
Can I spend the night?

604
01:17:08,047 --> 01:17:09,605
Come on in.

605
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,001
I mean...

606
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:15,678
- What is it?
- I'm not alone.

607
01:17:17,527 --> 01:17:18,516
Hi.

608
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:19,842
Hi.

609
01:17:27,847 --> 01:17:29,280
I'm Angela.

610
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:30,323
Christo.

611
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:36,041
But there's just one bed.

612
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:40,280
So?

613
01:17:45,367 --> 01:17:47,119
Your bag... Are you in trouble?

614
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:50,796
I can't stand those two at home anymore.

615
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:54,843
Why don't we have a beer?

616
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:04,758
What are these bushes?

617
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:05,723
Herbs.

618
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,076
Angela, Angela

619
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,478
A child from the wild desert of Love

620
01:18:48,967 --> 01:18:50,958
Angela!

621
01:18:52,247 --> 01:18:54,966
You are the only one I love

622
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:01,516
What?

623
01:19:03,647 --> 01:19:05,842
I want you to teach me to draw.

624
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,440
On a Sunday?

625
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:09,799
Let's have a beer first.

626
01:19:09,967 --> 01:19:11,559
Shit. I'm out.

627
01:19:13,767 --> 01:19:15,200
Is there any coffee?

628
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:16,163
We'll find some.

629
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:20,039
You snore like a bear.

630
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:21,877
Ah, Sashe!

631
01:19:22,727 --> 01:19:24,240
My brother and...

632
01:19:24,647 --> 01:19:26,046
his girlfriend.

633
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:27,956
Who's that?

634
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,600
My roommate.

635
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:52,842
Where did Angela go?

636
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,518
She went home.

637
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:52,277
