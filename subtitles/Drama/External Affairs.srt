isn't dead yet.

16
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,836
Yesterday, Yemeni
Prime Minister A'zam Halabi

17
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:26,405
suffered a heart attack.

18
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,607
State is allowing him
to enter the U.S.

19
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,941
for medical treatment only.

20
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:31,610
He's currently en route
to the Mayo Clinic,

21
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:33,679
where he will undergo surgery
later today.

22
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,648
This is a special situation.
We defer to State.

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,183
No planned action
at this time.

24
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,551
What are we getting
in return?

25
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:41,586
I assume it has to do
with oil.

26
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,522
It does have something to do
with oil.

27
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,292
Yemen is not an OPEC nation.
They make their own deals.

28
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:48,960
So State is trading
lower gas prices

29
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,462
for a man's life.

30
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:53,065
Is that why the CIA isn't
allowed anywhere near the place?

31
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,666
They're worried
we'll mess up the deal?

32
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:57,002
While the prime minister's
here in the country,

33
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:00,038
I'd like to try and turn
his Chief of Staff.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,341
His name is Sayid al-Muqri,

35
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:05,310
and I think he could be
a valuable asset.

36
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,645
Annie, you're not the first
person in this building

37
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,547
who's wanted to turn
Sayid al-Muqri.

38
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:11,917
I've been following him, and
I think he could be a friend.

39
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,452
How so?

40
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:15,253
When he was a grad student
at Oxford in 2000,

41
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,589
an editorial appeared
<i>Political Analysis.</i>

42
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:20,392
The article condemned
the attack on the <i>U.S.S. Cole</i>

43
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:22,194
and called for greater
collaboration

44
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:23,695
between Yemen and the west.

45
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:25,564
And although there was no byline
to the editorial,

46
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,733
I could hear his voice
in the article.

47
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:33,138
If he wrote it,
I think he could be turned.

48
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,673
I'd like to make the play.

49
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,043
Halabi took in al-Muqri
when his parents died.

50
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,478
They're like family.

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
Al-Muqri will definitely be
traveling with him.

52
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:43,415
Surgery lasts three hours.

53
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,584
After which they get on a plane
straight back to Yemen.

54
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,586
It's a very short window
of time.

55
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:48,987
How do you plan
to approach?

56
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,490
A cold pitch.

57
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:52,858
It's the only way,
given the time frame.

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,192
So you think
you can turn

right-hand man

60
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,996
based on an article
he might not have written.

61
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:59,731
He's being under-utilized
at home.

62
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,601
He's ambitious,
and he's itching to do more,

63
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:05,103
to find a bigger way
to contribute.

64
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:07,272
We could be that way.

65
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:11,443
But the risk is too high
and the timeline too short.

66
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:15,747

that no Yemeni man or woman
would ever work with us.

Because you're terrible at it.
I apologize.

The Agency never intended

Okay, a brilliant,
young operative

305
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,724
flies to Minnesota
to turn a valuable asset--

306
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,592
What if she's caught
by the State Department?

307
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,828
She calls for advice.

308
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,164
What if Joan and Arthur
cave to State and send her home?

309
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,533
If we're talking
about the same operative,

310
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,501
she uses whatever time
she has left

311
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,103
to pursue her objective.

312
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,105
What if she's been banned
from the building?

313
00:15:57,107 --> 00:16:01,109
Then she finds a way
to make him leave it.

314
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,679
Auggie, you're brilliant.

315
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:07,449
That's not a "what if"
statement.

- I usually do.

317

Listen, I'm stepping into
a meeting for the next hour.

318
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,289
Call me if you need anything,
all right?

319
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,257
You're my top priority.
I'll be fine.

320
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,193
No worries.

321
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,931
Auggie.

322
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,936
How's it going?

323
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,804
Fantastic,
and I have a feeling

324
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,206
it's about to get even better.

325
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,373
It is?

326
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,675
Today's your lucky day.

327
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,210
We're gonna shake things up
a little bit.

328
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:37,112
- How?
- A field trip.

329
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,214
You could probably use
some fresh air.

330
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:41,850
I don't live in this office,
Auggie, I just work here.

331
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:43,651
Besides, we'll be here
for the hour.

332
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,053
That's how this works.

Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,056
The other week,
you presented yourself

335
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,390
as an unconventional shrink:

336
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:51,159
working with veterans,

337
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,927
offering
to let me skip sessions.

338
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,596
Is that just a cover?

339
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:58,933
What did you have
in mind?

340
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,615
- I'll take the cigarettes.
- Which ones?

341
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,984
All of them.

342
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,356
You're going
to show me

343
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,324
how to get
across the street blindfolded?

Orientation
and mobility training.

345
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,995
When I did it,
I didn't have a choice.

346
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,663
It'll help you
to understand me better.

347
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,098
Auggie, I--

348
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,499
And the more
that you protest,

349
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,936
the less time you're gonna have
to get the hang of it.

350
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,337
That's the spirit.

How does this work?

355
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,447
Okay, this cane's a couple
of inches too tall for you.

356
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,782
So choke down a little bit.

357
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,117
You're gonna hold it
waist high,

358
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,985
about a foot in front
of your body.

359
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,054
Think of it as an extension
of your index finger,

360
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:55,323
but it should be
underneath the shaft.

361
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,758
That way,
if you hit something,

362
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,293
you're not gonna stab yourself
in the stomach.

363
00:17:58,295 --> 00:17:59,527

Mmhmm.

Very good.

This little aluminum tube

is about to become
your best friend.

367
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,840
Cigarettes?

368
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:21,382
You can bum
one of mine.

369
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,854
Takes me four minutes
to smoke a cigarette.

370
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,756
That's how much time you have.

371
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,258
Mr. al-Muqri,
I'm surprised.

372
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,227
I didn't take you for a man
who shuts down conversations.

373
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,829
What sort of man
did you take me for?

374
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:38,600
If given the right support...
a leader.

375
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,235
That's what you tell
all of us, isn't it?

376
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,070
Flatter us,
make us feel special.

377
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:45,039
I've never said that
to anyone before.

378
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,874
I came here to speak to you.

379

Then speak.

380
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:58,186
I'd like
to work with you.

381
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,588
That's never going
to happen.

382
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,123
Why not?

383
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,891
Because the CIA has wreaked
havoc in my part of the world.

384
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,828
You keep referring to me
as a mouthpiece for the Agency.

385
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,496
I know you wouldn't like
to be thought of that way.

386
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:09,731
You're your own person.

387
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,999
A person
whom you have just met

388
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,467
and yet claim to know so well.

389
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:13,635
This is why we are enemies.

390
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:14,836
Because you make assumptions
about us,

391
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:16,137
and you act
as if they are true.

392
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,438
You don't really believe
we're enemies.

393
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,773
I believe your country
is only interested in mine

394
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,074
because we have oil.

395
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,577
You're right.

396
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,412
If that's your pitch,
it's not a very good one.

397
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm being honest.

398
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,382
We're interested in you
because of oil,

399
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,550
and you're interested in us
because of our technology,

our universities,
and sometimes our health care.

401

you wrote in that article.

that article.

You can't be happy with your
country's place in the world

We can share information
and ideas.

413

We can build a bridge
between our nations

that no one else
is willing to build.

00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:00,959
Okay.

477
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,431
That's it.
Keep going.

478
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:09,234
Keep going.

479
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:15,807
All right, you did it.
I did it!

480
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,144
Oh, my God,
that was amazing!

481
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:24,616
Let's do it again.
That a girl.

482
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,087
You sure we lost them?

483
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,423
Let's sit near the back door
just in case.

484
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:34,793
How are you feeling
about those cigarettes now?

485
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:38,263
Oh, not winded.
It's just adrenaline.

486
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,598
Yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

487
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,899
- Counter?
- Booth.

488
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:44,035
The one at the back, please.
Mmhmm.

489
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,346
Does this, uh, sort of thing
happen to you a lot?

490
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,847
It happens.

491
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:58,683
Mostly my job
consists of talking to people.

492
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:05,323
I'm hungry.
Let's order something.

493
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:07,592
Western food doesn't
really interest me.

494
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:11,162
Everything's on a bun.

495
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,865
Can I have a turkey sandwich
on whole wheat,

496
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,568
and can you bring
the check with it?

497
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,938
I'll have a hamburger,
toasted bun, please.

498
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:24,743
What? It's like going to Japan
and not ordering Sushi.

499
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:42,460
I barely recognized you
in that meeting today.

500
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:43,795
I read you in
on the Yemen deal,

501
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:45,297
I told you
it wasn't actionable,

502
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,999
and you used it to make a play.
I showed initiative.

503
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:49,301
How could you
send Annie there?

504
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:50,869
Because she showed me
initiative.

505
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,370
And why not send her there?

506
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,805
Because State Department's
nervous?

507
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,073
No, because
the State Department

508
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,342
is trying to navigate
very fragile terrain,

509
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:58,743
and they're doing it well.

510
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:00,578
Since when do you compliment
the State Department?

511
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,247
You detest Steve Barr
and all his cronies.

512
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:03,415
You always have.

513
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,784
You put me
in an impossible position.

514
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:12,123
Arthur, I probably should've
talked to you first.

515
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,425
Yes.

516
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:15,427
But I took a chance.

517
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,929
Are you angry because
I didn't defend your operation

518
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,397
or because
I didn't defend you?

519
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,066
You know, in this case,
they're the same thing.

520
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:23,902
You realize
you're almost out the door?

521
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,303
No.

522
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:27,505
Yes. The promise
of the Chinese ambassador post

523
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:29,708
is pulling you away
like you no longer work here,

524
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,376
like you've already gotten
the job.

525
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:33,311
The choice I made today
was the right call,

526
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:34,913
given the facts
that I had.

527
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,086
You know what, Arthur?

528
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:44,856
You're gonna make
a great politician.

529
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:54,366
Mmm.

530
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:57,502
It's pretty good.

531
00:26:57,504 --> 00:27:00,138
My, um--

532
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,174
my father was a dear friend
to Prime Minister Halabi,

533
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:06,244
and when my parents died,
he took me in.

534
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,413
I was 12 years old.

535
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:11,216
I remember, not long
after I moved into the palace,

536
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:14,386
a small bird hit the bedroom
window and injured its wing.

537
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,055
The Prime Minister,
he had falcons for some time,

538
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:18,590
so he knew something
about birds.

539
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:21,359
So he taught me
how to repair the wing

540
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:23,928
and nurse the bird back
to health.

541
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,097
And I remember asking him
every day

542
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,766
if we can let the bird go,

543
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,968
and he said something to me
I'll never forget.

544
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,139
He said it would be cruel
to let the bird go too soon,

545
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:36,374
that it would surely die
on its own,

546
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:40,045
being weak and unable to fly

547
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:44,249
and that just because I want
the bird to be free

548
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,817
doesn't mean
that it's ready.

549
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:50,188
You think
the Yemeni people

550
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,057
are little birds
with broken wings?

551
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,594
I think a nation chooses
when and how to change.

552
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:57,996
It's up to their leaders
to listen.

553
00:27:57,998 --> 00:28:00,565
That's a progressive thought.

554
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,300
Does your mentor
share your views?

555
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:03,401
He's not just my mentor.

556
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,603
He's my family.

557
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:07,138
He saved my life.

558
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,408
So you share
all his views.

559
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,743
You disagree
with your mentor?

560
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:14,612
I've had a few mentors,

561
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:16,514
and I disagree with them
every day.

562
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:19,084
How do you respect a man
you disagree with?

563
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:22,353
Both my mentors
are women.

564
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:25,490
The CIA is indeed
a complicated place.

565
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,894
I respect them.

566
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:33,565
They succeeded
where few women have.

567
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,768
And even when we disagree,
I know they'd look out for me.

568
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,736
They believe in you.

569
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,674
Now imagine how it would feel
to lose that.

570
00:28:42,676 --> 00:28:45,677
It'd feel horrible.

571
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:52,283
So is this, uh,
how the CIA works?

572
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:54,385
You talk to people like they are
on Oprah's couch?

573
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:59,390
I asked you to reveal
something about yourself.

574
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:02,961
I thought it only fair
I do the same.

575
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:25,884
They won't stay out long.
Let's circle back.

576
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,019
We're walking, huh?

577
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:32,724
Wish I would've worn
comfortable shoes.

578
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:36,127
I'm, uh, sorry this didn't
work out the way you wanted.

579
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:39,164
Oh, it's not about me.

580
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,766
What do you want
to happen?

581
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:43,868
I want A'zam
to make a full recovery.

582
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,171
That's all.

583
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:49,841
Yeah.
You're right.

584
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:51,176
I'm right?

585
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:53,511
You couldn't have written
that article.

586
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,780
Whoever wrote it
has courage and vision.

587
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:59,517
That's not you.
You have fear and caution.

588
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,687
So now you've taken
to insulting me.

589
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,722
You really think
that's going to work?

590
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:06,491
I don't know.

591
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,426
How do you convince someone
in ten minutes

592
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:11,496
that you believe in them more
than they believe in themselves?

593
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:14,332
Be grateful for what A'zam
has given you,

594
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:18,169
but look for ways to realize
your own potential.

595
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:21,406
I am one of those ways--
we are, right now.

596
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,911
Annie, I can't.

597
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,284
Where are you going?

598
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm done.

599
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:40,291
Annie, you don't know
what you're asking of me.

600
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:41,492
I do.

601
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,494
Even if I agreed to work
with the CIA,

602
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:44,829
I wouldn't be talking
to you.

603
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:46,464
You would disappear.
I wouldn't.

604
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:48,233
And what happens
if I get caught?

605
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:49,934
If someone in Yemen
discovers our work?

606
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:51,803
We have emergency protocol
for asset protection.

607
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,037
I could teach that to you.

608
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,339
Does that apply to my sister
and her family?

609
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,840
Yes.

610
00:30:55,842 --> 00:31:00,044
You can guarantee that now, or
you'll have to ask your mentor?

611
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:03,681
I have to ask her.

612
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:06,651
But here's a number
where you can reach me.

613
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:09,988
Memorize it,
and destroy the card.

614
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:35,146
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

615
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:36,481
Annie,
you missed your plane.

616
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,882
We agreed
that if you got caught,

617
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,617
you would get on a plane
and come back home.

618
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:42,520
Joan, I got him
to talk to me.

619
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:43,788
You did what?

620
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,189
He has some requests
regarding asylum

621
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:46,791
for him and his sister,
but it's all pretty standard.

622
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,793
Stop. There's something
we need to talk about.

623
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:50,461
The Prime Minister
had another heart attack.

624
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:52,697
He's in critical condition.

625
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:55,166
I have to talk to Sayid.
I don't wanna lose him, Joan.

626
00:31:55,168 --> 00:31:56,834
You have to come home.

627
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:59,370
If the Prime Minister of Yemen
dies on our soil,

628
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,838
the last thing
anyone wants

629
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,940
is for a CIA operative
to be found on the scene.

630
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:04,976
Can we grant him asylum
or not?

631
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,311
Annie,
you're not listening to me.

632
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:09,213
We cannot grant asylum.
State will never allow it.

633
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:10,415
Not after today.

634
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,749
No, we have to make
this happen.

635
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:13,184
The State Department
is trying to avoid

636
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:14,819
an international incident.

637
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:16,254
They're looking for you.

638
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:17,588
Annie, you need
to get on a plane.

639
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,857
No, not before I talk to him.
Sorry, Joan.

640
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:23,840
Ow!

641
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,668
Ooh, you okay?

642
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,836
Yeah.

643
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:28,938
Fire hydrant
came out of nowhere.

644
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,339
Yeah, they do that.

645
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:31,907
Oh, even to you?

646
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,778
Oh, I bump into stuff
about 14 times a day.

647
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,247
And I've been known to walk
into the ladies' bathroom.

648
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,517
Sometimes on purpose.
[Laughs]

649
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,852
The truth is being blind
is hard.

650
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:44,320
It's difficult every day.

651
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:46,889
Do you ever wanna
stay home?

652
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:49,491
Yeah, sure,
but I don't.

653
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:51,794
So when you're not up to it,
what do you do?

654
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,631
I keep going
'cause I have to.

655
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,806
About five years ago
after my injury,

656
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:07,176
all I wanted to do was get
back to my unit,

657
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,911
keep serving my country,

658
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,346
but I didn't see

659
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:12,281
how I could do either
of those things

660
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,451
when I couldn't even
cross the street.

661
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,220
I found myself on a corner,
just like that one--

662
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:23,259
frozen, turned around...

663
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:25,828
lost.

664
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,497
So I threw my cane away,

665
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:30,733
I heard it hit the ground,

666
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:32,701
and just walked into traffic

667
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,937
counting on somebody else
to finish the job

668
00:33:34,939 --> 00:33:36,839
the explosion didn't.

669
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:42,278
Some drivers
have good reflexes.

670
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,781
You're a survivor.
What does that feel like?

671
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:48,884
I'm lucky.

672
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:51,754
I'm a lucky guy.

673
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,995
Oh, hey, look at that.
Our time's almost up.

674
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,264
You better get back
for your next victim.

675
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:03,532
Because--

676
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,167
I opened up,
I shared.

677
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,102
Come on, Doc,
congratulations.

678
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,504
You got what you wanted
after all.

679
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,940
I got my gold star, right?
It was nice knowing you.

680
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:12,341
No, we're not done yet.

681
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,276
How do you figure?

682
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:15,644
We haven't talked about

683
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:17,613
what inspired this field trip
in the first place.

684
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:20,249
You walked into my office
with your own blueprint

685
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:21,784
for what therapy should be.

686
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:24,112
Yeah,
it was pretty damn good.

687
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:28,338
Are you always trying
to manage people in situations?

688
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:13,791
Sayid!
What are you doing?

689
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:14,824
This is my last chance.

690
00:36:14,826 --> 00:36:16,759
I really need you
to listen to me.

691
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:17,961
Listen to me, please.

692
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:19,128
A'zam had another
heart attack.

693
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,463
- I know.
- I'm going to see him.

694
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,065
Now let me out of here.

695
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,167
We both fear
that we may lose our mentors

696
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:26,169
or that our mentors
may lose faith in us.

697
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:29,005
But this is your choice.
Your wings have healed.

698
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,673
Annie, please.
Let me out of here.

699
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:31,941
I fear you'll see

700
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,376
the Prime Minister's
second heart attack

701
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,745
as some kind of sign that
he needs you now more than ever,

702
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:38,648
but your loyalty
cannot save him.

703
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,784
There is something bigger
that we can save now.

704
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:43,453
Save what, Annie?

705
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,121
Yemen? America?
The world?

706
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:47,390
Not today.
Not all at once.

707
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:49,259
But a piece of it.

708
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:53,997
Did you speak to your boss
about my request?

709
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:59,002
She said
it's not possible.

710
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:02,138
I'm sorry.

711
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,806
And do you disagree
with your mentor on this?

712
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:05,975
I do, absolutely.

713
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,110
But not enough
to do anything about it.

714
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:09,512
What can I do?

715
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:11,648
So now you understand
my position.

716
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,584
Perhaps we do have
a lot in common.

717
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:18,621
"Only a fool confuses fate
with destiny.

718
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:21,291
"Fate is what happens
to us.

719
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:25,461
Destiny is what we make
in spite of our fate."

720
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:30,600
I wrote that article
such a long time ago.

721
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:34,671
How did you know
it was me?

722
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:38,408
Because it
was courageous.

723
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,944
You weren't waiting
for someone else

724
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:45,014
to tell you you were ready,
you already knew.

725
00:37:54,224 --> 00:37:56,592
[Elevator dings]

726
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,301
Where is A'zam?

727
00:38:07,237 --> 00:38:10,840
Take her.

728
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,003
Prime Minister A'zam Halabi
of Yemen, passed away last night

729
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:24,341
at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minnesota.

730
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,877
The U.S. State Department
had made arrangements

731
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,979
for Halabi to receive
medical treatment there

732
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:32,883
after suffering his first
of two myocardial infarctions.

733
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:34,951
The late Prime Minister's aides
and personnel

734
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:37,220
have returned to Yemen, where
the state of the government

735
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,755
remains in flux.

736
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:42,359
We turn now
to our correspondent in Sana'a.

737
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,162
So this is what a deal
with State looks like.

738
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:46,797
You gonna say
"I told you so"?

739
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,132
I don't believe in
"I told you so."

740
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:51,635
The thing went sideways.
That is not your fault.

741
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:53,970
If I had two more minutes,
Sayid would've said yes.

742
00:38:53,972 --> 00:38:56,706
You know the great truth
about turning an asset.

743
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:59,543
You gotta cast a lot of lines
before you catch a fish.

744
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,546
This is the toughest thing
that we do.

745
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,448
I thought I had him.

746
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,784
The strangest thing--spending
so long reading about someone,

747
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:11,621
their whole life
unfolds in front of you.

748
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,290
I felt like I could see
his potential.

749
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,026
- You believed in him.
- Yeah.

750
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:19,963
How angry is she?

751
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:24,935
Annie.
Will you step inside, please?

752
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:39,382
Close the door.

753
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:42,686
Have a seat.

754
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,222
Do you have questions
about why

755
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:46,923
I couldn't grant
Sayid's request?

756
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,592
They don't matter now.

757
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,394
They matter to me.

758
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:56,800
Annie, this job,
this life is wonderful.

759
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:58,635
To me it is.

760
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:01,037
But it can also be
frustrating.

761
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,642
Never more so than when
uncertainties drive decisions.

762
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:07,277
Well,
the future's uncertain.

763
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,914
Yeah, it is.

764
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,149
Look, I know
this was painful.

765
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:14,918
And it's okay to be angry
with the CIA.

766
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,487
It's even okay
to be angry with me.

767
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:24,394
Joan, I've thought
about this a lot...

768
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:28,899
and I've requested
a department transfer.

769
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:33,637
Do you want to go back
to work for Lena?

770
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,673
I don't know.
I left it blank on the form.

771
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:40,343
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

772
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,845
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

773
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:45,348
I just think
it's time to move on.

774
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:10,140
Annie, there's a Yemeni man
on the asset line.

775
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:11,675
He says
he'll only speak with you.

776
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,044
What?

777
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:15,812
Does Joan know?
Of course.

778
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:16,980
We spoke this morning.

779
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:18,148
She made it clear
that if he called,

780
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,649
he was to be your asset.

781
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,151
Congratulations.

782
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,524
Annie.

783
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,959
You gonna take the call?

784
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:30,627
Yeah.

785
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:39,402
Hello?

786
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:43,716
