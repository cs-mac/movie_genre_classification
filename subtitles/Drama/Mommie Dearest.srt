Adoption agencies
Can be brutal.

71
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,500
Besides, a baby
Needs a father.

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
A father.

I could be a mother
And a father.

I know how to teach
A kid to take care
Of himself

81

I know I could.

You don't understand.

103
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,560

Is denying one of

To live a wonderful
And advantaged life.

186
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,050
Oh, I have
A grass stain.

187
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,780
Oh, darling,
That will never show.

188
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,120
I'll just run upstairs
And have nanny
Take care of it.

189
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,020
No, dear. We'll take
The photographs now.

190
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,830
Actually, miss crawford,
It might read.

191
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,230
All right, dear,
Go along.

192
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,800
Have nanny fix it.

193
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,170
We'll wait
For you here.

194
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
O.K., christina.

195
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Hold it a little more.

196
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,280
O.K.

197
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,710
Big smile, christina.

198
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,910
O.K., christina.

199
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,820
Wide smile now,
Wide eyes.

200
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,350
A little to your right,
Christina.

201
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,190
Now hang on, christina.

202
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,690
Beautiful!

203
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,830
She's a real natural,
Miss crawford.

204
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,790
I think
That's enough now, hmm?

205
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,160
Tina, run down and get
The other children.

206
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,300
Tell them to come up.
We'll open the presents
For real.

207
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,870
O.K.

208
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,000
Miss crawford,
I promised the studio
Some real good stuff

209
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,500
When she blows out
The candles.

210
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,970
All right, jimmy.

211
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,380
Oh, mommie,

212
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,920
Thank you.

213
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,390
She's so beautiful.

214
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,920
What should I name her?

215
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,230
Is that the present
You like best?

216
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh, yes.

217
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,770
Then that's the present
You can keep.

218
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,740
We'll take the rest

219
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,210
To the orphans
Who don't have anything.

220
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,410
And tomorrow we'll write
Our thank-you notes.

221
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,250
Oh.

222
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Christina,
Why can't you...

223
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,290
Hello, hello.

224
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,890
Happy birthday, darling.

225
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,630
Oh, hello, darling.

226
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,800
Darling.

227
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,430
Oh, uncle greg.

228
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,400
It's just what I wanted.

229
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,240
You like it?

230
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,640
I love it.

231
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,770
Look.

232
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,140
Oh, but, you see,

233
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm only keeping
One present,

234
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,280
And all the rest
I'm going to give
To the poor orphans.

235
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,450
Yes, I--I read about that
In the newspapers.

236
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,920
It's--it's wonderful.

237
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,990
So I'll just
Keep this for you

238
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,060
Until you don't
Have to choose.

239
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,270
I put a lot of thought
Into this

240
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,200
When I picked it
For you.

241
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,440
[sighs]

242
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,210
All right.

243
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,780
This time we'll make
An exception.

244
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,850
You may keep
The doll...

245
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,890
And the bracelet.

246
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,020
Oh, mommie dearest.

247
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,760
Mmm.

248
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
What about
Christopher's present?

249
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,200
This one.

250
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,470
Darling, remember
What I told you

251
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,970
About adopted
Children?

252
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,780
Adopted children
Are luckiest

253
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
'cause they were chosen.

254
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,110
That's right.

255
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,390
Well, that's good,

256
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,820
But you've got
To push off more
With your weight.

257
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,330
Come on, let's see
Another one.

258
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,790
She's had enough, joan.

259
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,030
But I'm tired, mommie.

260
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,200
Quitter.

261
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,440
All right, ready?

262
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,670
1, 2, 3...

263
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,010
Dive!

264
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,550
Better, but
You've got to keep
Your legs together

265
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,280
When you go
In the water.

266
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,350
She's only a kid.

267
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,420
So was I--
Only a kid.

268
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
I learned early.

269
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,960
Life goes by
Too damn fast.

270
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,300
You've got to
Know how to compete
And win.

271
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,370
I don't want her
Growing up a spoiled
Hollywood brat,

272
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,340
Just because she's
Crawford's daughter.

273
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,380
Ah...It's lovely.

274
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Isn't it?

275
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,880
Yes, it is.

276
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,350
It's a great sunday
At home...

277
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,680
With a star.

278
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,250
Oh...Ha ha.

279
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,760
You know, we hardly
Ever have nice days
Like this anymore.

280
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,230
I've got
An appointment.

281
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,400
They call, you run.

282
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,330
Who calls, I run?

283
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,340
Nobody.

284
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,880
Then why do you say that?

285
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,310
Because
I'm damn mad at you!

286
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,650
Why?

287
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,180
Look, this script
Is the best script
The studio has,

288
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,820
And it hasn't been
Offered to me.

289
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,250
You could help.

290
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,960
Joan, that's
Mayer's business.

291
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,890
I never tell a man I respect
How to run his business.

292
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,460
They think I'm slipping.

293
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,300
Are you?

294
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,370
No.

295
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,800
So?

296
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,370
Yes.

297
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,780
I just want that part.

298
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Mm-hmm.

299
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,850
I want you, too.

300
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,060
You got me.

301
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,940
Have a good time, tina.

302
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,910
Thanks, uncle greg.

303
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,440
I love you.

304
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,810
Ah...

305
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,320
Who wants to go swimming?

306
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,450
I do!

307
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,360
I'll race you.

308
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,620
On your mark,

309
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,230
Get set,

310
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,360
Go!

311
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,580
[panting]

312
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,920
Again?

313
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,450
[breathing heavily]

314
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,620
I'll give you
A bigger head start.

315
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,420
Come on, tina.

316
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,400
On your mark,

317
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,340
Get set...

318
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,470
And go!

319
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,800
[coughing]

320
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,670
Ah, you lost again.

321
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,230
It's not fair.

322
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,240
You're bigger than I am.

323
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,470
It's not fair
To win twice.

324
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,280
Ah, but nobody
Ever said that
Life was fair, tina.

325
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,010
I'm bigger,
And I'm faster.

326
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,180
I will always
Beat you.

327
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,420
Then I'm not going
To play with you anymore.

328
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,590
Ever!

329
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,520
Don't you ever

330
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,560
Use that tone of voice
With me, missy!

331
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,000
Who do you think
You're talking to?

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,600
I'll tell you
What you're going to do.

333
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,540
You're going to march
Yourself upstairs
To your room

334
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,170
And you will stay there
Until I tell you
To come out!

335
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,070
No, I won't!

336
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,710
No, you won't?

337
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,580
Yes, you will!

338
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,050
Ow! Ow!

339
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,520
Now, go up--

340
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,650
I won't go!

341
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,990
All right, all right!

342
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,490
I won't go!

343
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,820
You will stay in here
Until you are ready
To behave--

344
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,190
I won't!

345
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,430
And to apologize!

346
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,500
I won't!

347
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,730
In!

348
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,300
Aah!

349
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,430
Mommie!

350
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,390
[breathing hard]

351
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,320
Fans should know
The price you pay.

352
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,430
Mayer should know
The price I pay.

353
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,430
The biggest
Female star he's got,

354
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,340
Ever had,

355
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,340
And he's
Burying me alive.

356
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,270
He's not going
To beat me.

357
00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:00,010
I will survive.
I will survive.
I will survive.

358
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,260
Where's tina?

359
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,230
She'll be down
In a minute,
Miss crawford.

360
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,430
Hello, darling.

361
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,730
[kiss]

362
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,370
Oh, god.

363
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,810
[telephone rings]

364
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,720
[ring]

365
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,320
[ring]

366
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,620
Hello.

367
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,390
Oh...

368
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,930
Oh, yes, sir.
Joan.

369
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,230
Who?

370
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,230
At this hour?

371
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,530
It's mr. Savitt

372
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,330
Calling from
Mr. Mayer's office.

373
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,710
Greg, darling...

374
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,170
Hello.

375
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,710
Is anything wrong?

376
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,410
We had to settle
A little labor problem,

377
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,750
So we had to set
A little early meeting.

378
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,420
By the way,

379
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,920
Mayer thinks
You'd be wonderful
In the picture you wanted.

380
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,460
What?
Wh-what, greg?

381
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,260
I tried to talk
Him out of it,
But I couldn't.

382
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,930
Oh, greg!
No, greg, wait!

383
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,160
Good-bye.

384
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,230
No, greg!

385
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,470
Wait, greg!

386
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,500
Oh!

387
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,670
Greg!

388
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,640
Carol ann!

389
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,310
Oh!

390
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,640
I've got it!

391
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,810
Oh!

392
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,140
I've got it!

393
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,980
I've got it!

394
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,250
Ahhh!

395
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,490
[laughing]

396
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,990
Christina!

397
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,790
Christina, darling,
Guess what.

398
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,390
Oh, yes...

399
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,460
It was thrilling.

400
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,330
I'm so grateful
To you all,

401
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,270
My wonderful fans...

402
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,470
Who've made me a star.

403
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,310
Oh, yes.
It was thrilling.

404
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,280
I'm so grateful
To you all.

405
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,550
My wonderful fans
Who have made me
A star!

406
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,620
Mommie!

407
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,260
What do you think
You're doing?

408
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,400
Nothing, mommie.

409
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,930
I was just--
Just playing.

410
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,400
What do you mean,
Playing?

411
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,910
Pawing through
My things...

412
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,650
Making fun of me?

413
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,280
I wasn't making fun
Of you.

414
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,790
I was just trying to--

415
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,860
I was acting.

416
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,390
Playacting.

417
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,530
Like you're always doing.

418
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,430
Look at yourself.

419
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,770
Give me that.

420
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,980
Ow!

421
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,780
What have you done
To your--

422
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,520
Tina, what have you
Put on your hair?

423
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,590
What have you done
To this damn hair?

424
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,050
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

425
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,050
It was just
Setting lotion.

426
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,660
Oh, mommie, ow!

427
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,790
Ohhh!

428
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
What are you doing?

429
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,430
Oh, mommie, don't!

430
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,700
Don't you tell me
What I'm doing.

431
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,870
Oh, no.
Mommie, I look awful!

432
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,000
I know you look awful.

433
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,540
You be quiet!

434
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,470
You're always rummaging
Through my drawers.

435
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,810
Trying to find a way
To make people
Look at you?

436
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,880
Why are you always
Looking at yourself
In the mirror?

437
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,350
Why are you?
Tell me!

438
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,780
You sit still now.

439
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm going to teach you,
You're vain, spoiled.

440
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,220
Mommie, I can't go
To school like this.

441
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,120
I'd rather you go bald
To school than looking
Like a tramp.

442
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,220
[crying]

443
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,690
No, mommie, please!

444
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,600
Why?

445
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,800
Mommie, I can't go
To school like this.

446
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,340
Mommie, please!

447
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,670
You spoiled it.

448
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,710
You spoiled it just
Like I spoiled you!

449
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,010
Please!

450
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,810
Mom!

451
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,810
Aah, aah, aah.

452
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:31,320
[sobbing]

453
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,190
Joan crawford!

454
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,330
[fans screaming]

455
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,900
Joan crawford!
Joan crawford!

456
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,340
Take it easy.

457
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,200
Good evening,
Miss crawford.

458
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Good evening.

459
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Welcome.

460
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
Your booth is ready.

461
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,760
Excuse me.

462
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,900
Well, I'm glad to see
They finally let go
Of you.

463
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,530
I was about to send out
A rescue party.

464
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,830
Hello, l.B.
What a pleasant
Surprise.

465
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,570
Joanie, I want you to meet a few
Financial friends from new york.

466
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,040
They're bankers.

467
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,570
Mr. Lubin,
Mr. Dodd.

468
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,510
It's a pleasure.

469
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,810
Mr. Lubin,
Mr. Dodd.

470
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,010
Please, sit down.
Join us.

471
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,280
My daughter helen

472
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,510
Would love to have
Your signature,
Miss crawford.

473
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,050
Of course.

474
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,820
You see, she didn't ask
For l.B. Mayer's signature.

475
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,060
That's because
She's not as smart
As her father.

476
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,490
Ha ha ha!

477
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,530
She doesn't know
That you are the king.

478
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,530
Thank you.

479
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,960
Where are you going?

480
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,630
Come join us.
We're having dinner.

481
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,630
You're one of the reasons
Bankers love metro.

482
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,940
Thank you, l.B.,
But our table is ready.

483
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,070
I insist.

484
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,580
You're aces, joanie.

485
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,550
I'm glad you
Think that, l.B.,

486
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,820
Because aces
Beat kings.

487
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,620
Ha ha ha!

488
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,090
Not in hollywood,
Dear.

489
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm sure you'll find
The interest arrangements

490
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,630
Quite agreeable.

491
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,630
That'll be
Just fine, l.B.

492
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,000
We'll all meet
In new york, hmm?

493
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,700
Hauling me over
To mayer's table

494
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,840
Like some
Picked-up floozy!

495
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,310
Or one of those
Starlets,

496
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,540
Out to give
The big shots
A nice night in town.

497
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,610
Is that what you
Think of me?

498
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,310
How many drinks
Is that?

499
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,680
Oh.

500
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,790
When you were a kid,
That made you look sexy.

501
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,050
Now it just makes you
Look drunk.

502
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,130
I may as well have
"Property of mgm"

503
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,160
Tattooed on my backside!

504
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,900
And damn it,
Perino's is my place.

505
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,040
Nobody wanted my signature,
So I just walked in.

506
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,810
You expect me
To ignore my fans?

507
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,180
They're life
And death to me,
Baby.

508
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,810
They're the ones
Who really make me.

509
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,010
I expect you
To walk in with me

510
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,880
And sit down
At your table with me!

511
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,920
Then mayer would have
To bring his bankers over,

512
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,750
Introduce them, and get
Your autograph and leave!

513
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,090
That's what
You should've done!

514
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,920
Maybe that's what
I would've done

515
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,930
If you'd been
Nice enough to stay
Out there with me,

516
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,100
Help me
Through the crowd
And into the restaurant

517
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,160
Like a gentleman!

518
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,730
Why are you screaming?

519
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,730
Because I'm damn mad!

520
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,740
Damn it, greg.

521
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,540
How can you
Put mayer over me?

522
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,240
You know that son
Of a bitch is trying
To destroy my career.

523
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,380
If your career's
In trouble,

524
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,350
It has nothing
To do with him.

525
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,850
Then what is it?

526
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,690
You were always
The shop girl who fought
Her way to the top,

527
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,020
Made a great success.

528
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,660
Well, you're not
A little shop girl anymore.

529
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,630
Now that's the truth,
To face and deal with...

530
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,670
If you want to survive.

531
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,900
The truth is,
You're getting old.

532
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,210
Yeah.

533
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,140
You're nothing but a
Rotten, crooked lawyer,

534
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,550
Supplying the grease
That makes this shitty
Movie business work.

535
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
You think your life's
A mystery.

536
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,690
There isn't
A dirty cover-up
In this entire business

537
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,960
That I don't know about,

538
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,630
And your hand
Is in every one of them!

539
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,390
You reek of it!

540
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,630
Damn you!

541
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,400
Are you crazy?

542
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,230
No person talks
To me like that.

543
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,040
No one anywhere!
Are you crazy?
Are you?

544
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,170
Tell me!

545
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
Tell me!

546
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,210
I'm crazy.

547
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,720
I didn't
Mean that, greg.

548
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,860
I didn't mean it.

549
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,060
Get up.

550
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,800
There's no camera
In here.

551
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,080
Greg.

552
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,390
Where you going?

553
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,090
Where I belong--

554
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,860
Out of here.

555
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,960
You belong here.

556
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,310
I'm waiting for you.

557
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,680
Good night, joan.

558
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,860
Please don't leave,
Because if you do,

559
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,130
You'll never
Come back in again,

560
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,700
No matter what you
Say or ask or do.

561
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,430
I'll always...

562
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,940
Wish you well, joan.

563
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,240
And I'll only
Speak well of you.

564
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,250
Please don't go.

565
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,250
Don't leave me
Here alone.

566
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,360
Please?

567
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,760
If you're acting,
You're wasting your time.

568
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,530
If you're not,
You're wasting mine.

569
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,270
I'm not acting.

570
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,740
I'm not acting.

571
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,010
Good night.

572
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,380
Good luck.

573
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,910
Good-bye.

574
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,950
[door closes]

575
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,550
Good morning.

576
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,350
Good morning,
Dearest heart.

577
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,320
Hello, darling.

578
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,650
Ahh!

579
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,090
Hello, christopher,
My angel.

580
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,620
Look.
How are you?

581
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,290
Did you sleep well?

582
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,390
Did you?

583
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,160
Mmm.

584
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,900
Run along
Downstairs.

585
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,330
Get your breakfast,

586
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,230
And don't be late
For school.

587
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,130
I won't.

588
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,370
Look after
Christopher.

589
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,500
Whoa, o.K.

590
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,480
If she doesn't like you...

591
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,520
She can make you disappear.

592
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,900
Ginny, are we
Running short?

593
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,040
Shall I send
For more photographs?

594
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
Oh, no, miss crawford.

595
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,840
The studio just
Sent over a new batch.

596
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,040
We've got plenty.

597
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Good. You're all
So gracious to help,

598
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,380
And you're doing
A wonderful job.

599
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,450
And you.

600
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,150
Let's see.

601
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,620
I'll roll it to you
This way.

602
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,090
Go get it, christopher.

603
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,650
Come on!
Get it, christopher.

604
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,120
Here I come!
Get it!

605
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,890
Christina!
Christopher!

606
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,260
Damn it!

607
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,460
Carol ann!

608
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,630
I have asked you to keep
The children quiet today!

609
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,040
Now, for christ's sake,
Get them out of the garden!

610
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,240
I'm sorry, joan.

611
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,940
Have tina bring me up
My coffee.

612
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,310
All right, joan.

613
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm sorry, mommie.

614
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,390
I tried to be quiet.

615
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,720
We were playing.

616
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,330
And you forgot.

617
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,460
You promised
Last night.

618
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,070
You promised.

619
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,440
Look, I told you

620
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,340
How important
Today is to mommie.

621
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,770
I explained why,

622
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,340
Didn't I, tina?

623
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm sorry, mommie.

624
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,620
Go to your room
Until I come for you.

625
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,970
You're very, very bad
To wake mommie up like that.

626
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,570
Very naughty.

627
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,040
I told you,

628
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,470
Mommie has to be
Beautiful today.

629
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,780
This afternoon,
She has to see mr. Mayer.

630
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,380
Today is so important.

631
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,520
You are selfish
And thoughtless.

632
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,450
You must learn to think
About other people.

633
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,390
You're bad,
Bad spoiled children.

634
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,280
My babies.

635
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,050
Someone stole
Both my babies.

636
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,450
That's good, darling.

637
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:44,320
They were thoughtless,
Selfish, spoiled children.

638
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,430
Now they won't wake you up
When you need your rest.

639
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,490
Good morning,
Miss crawford.

640
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,690
Good morning, ellen.
What a lovely blouse.

641
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,360
Thank you very much.

642
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,260
Come.

643
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,470
Thank you, connie.

644
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,730
Joan.

645
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,210
Look at you.
Look at you.

646
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,880
18 years
In the business,

647
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,010
And who could hold
A candle to you?

648
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,720
You're always so kind.

649
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,250
Kind? Of all
My picture family,
Who turned out best?

650
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,460
Who never let me down?

651
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,320
Joan crawford.

652
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,260
To all the new kids
Coming up,

653
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,690
She's like a diamond.

654
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,530
Class.

655
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,700
L.B.--

656
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,230
Have I ever lied to you
In your whole career,

657
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,740
Or given you one piece
Of bad advice?

658
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,240
Never.

659
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,810
Never.

660
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,640
Your treatment of me
Has been divine.

661
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,420
Joan, my joan,
You're in a position
To do me a favor.

662
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,820
It will be as big
A favor for you
As it is for me.

663
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,290
You don't have to ask.

664
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,290
You only have
To tell me.

665
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,260
Good. I want you
To leave metro.

666
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,760
Leave metro?

667
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,770
Leave metro?

668
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,410
Your pictures,
One after another,
Are losing money.

669
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,680
Theater owners voted you
Box-office poison.

670
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,850
Even so, for years
I've paid no attention.

671
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,420
You know me, joan.

672
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
I don't give up
So easily.

673
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,220
We'll pay you off
On your contract.

674
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,290
But you can't afford
To make three or four
More losers for us.

675
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,900
It's the scripts, l.B.

676
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
Bad pictures,
Bad directors--

677
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,500
Bad with you,
Good with others.

678
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,300
No. Listen to me, l.B.
I have been begging you!

679
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,340
Begging you
For a good script.

680
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,340
Now, you've always given me
My share of bad movies

681
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,640
Because you knew
I'd make them work.

682
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,740
Well, I can't keep
Doing it, l.B.

683
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,610
Listen with your ears
And not with your pride.

684
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,750
With me, feeling
Is more important
Than money.

685
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,320
You're a great star.

686
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,720
You're hollywood
Royalty.

687
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,390
But styles change.

688
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,360
You'll leave.

689
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,430
We have creative
Differences.

690
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,270
We don't want to fight
Or argue with each other

691
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,100
Because we love
Each other.

692
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,370
Every studio will
Think they're smarter
Than l.B.

693
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,170
They'll try
To finesse me.

694
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,680
You'll be offered
One, two, three,
Four, five films.

695
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,780
[sniffles]

696
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,480
You may even get a hit.

697
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,880
Will you be sorry then?

698
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,390
I'm sorry now.

699
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,360
But here there's
No confidence,
There's no hope.

700
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,290
It's time for a change.

701
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,160
New faces, new voices,
A breath of fresh air.

702
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,500
Who knows?

703
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,740
Don't do this
To yourself.

704
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,810
I'll, uh...

705
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,650
I'll have my maid
And studio people
Clear out my bungalow.

706
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,060
I have a lot of years
To collect.

707
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,660
It's done, joan.

708
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,720
They've packed
Your things.

709
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,560
They're loading
Your car.

710
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,730
You mean everybody...
Already knows?

711
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,670
That we parted friends
Because we didn't agree.

712
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,790
Will you walk me
To my car?

713
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,500
Hollywood royalty.

714
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,390
Aah!

715
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,360
I'm...Hollywood royalty!

716
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,890
[muttering]

717
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,730
[sobbing]

718
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,330
Everyone already knows--
Box-office poison.

719
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,930
Box-office poison!

720
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,940
Class. You're...Class.

721
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,470
You're class!

722
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,110
Box-office poison!

723
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,340
[clapping]
Wake up. Wake up.

724
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,310
Come on, children. Wake up.

725
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,780
Wha-what's happening?

726
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,480
Your mother
Wants you downstairs
In the rose garden.

727
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,110
Come on. Hurry up.

728
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,080
You, too, christopher.
Come on.

729
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,180
Come on.
Come along.

730
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,090
Your mother wants you
Right away.

731
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,920
18 years
In the business!

732
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,060
Parted friends!

733
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,060
[sobs]

734
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,660
Creative differences!

735
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,700
Oh, good. I want
Some help here.

736
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,370
I want all of these branches
Cleared out of here now!

737
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,470
Carol ann and christopher,
Start clearing away
All these branches.

738
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,670
Start gathering them up.

739
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,910
Go and get the wheelbarrow
And the rake.

740
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,080
[sobbing]

741
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,320
Tina!

742
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,930
Bring me the ax!

743
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,820
[grunting]

744
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,850
[gasping]

745
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,090
Carol ann, get some more
Emotion into the scene,
Some expression.

746
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,300
I can't keep
The emotion up

747
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,930
If you don't come in
Right away.

748
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:13,610
Let's, uh--
After the uniform--
Downtown--restaurants.

749
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,640
My mother,
A common waitress.

750
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,480
I took the best job
I could find

751
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,550
So that you
And your sister
Could eat

752
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,650
And have
A place to sleep

753
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,080
And some clothes
On your backs.

754
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,220
Aren't the pies enough?
Do you have to degrade us?

755
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,650
Veda, don't say that.

756
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,320
I'm really not surprised.

757
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,760
You've never spoken
Of your people,
Who you came from,

758
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,490
So perhaps it's natural.

759
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,800
Maybe that's
Why father left!

760
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,630
I'm sorry I did that.

761
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,810
I'd have rather
Cut off my hand.

762
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,550
Your mother's been
Practicing and practicing.

763
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,780
You know how perfect
She always wants to be.

764
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,260
Well, this time
She must be perfect.

765
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,790
Do you understand?

766
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,660
She wants everything
To be perfect.

767
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,070
This time it's even
More important.

768
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,810
They're making your mother
Take a screen test.

769
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,080
Do you know what that is?

770
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,950
When they're not sure
They want you?

771
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,650
And you know how shameful
That is for her.

772
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,150
She wants this film.

773
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,720
She knows she's right.

774
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,360
She is this character,
Mildred pierce.

775
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,560
We have to help her.

776
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,360
We will, won't we?

777
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,100
I will.

778
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,970
Christina?

779
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,270
You haven't touched
Your lunch.

780
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,680
It's raw.

781
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,310
It's rare,

782
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,180
Not raw.

783
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,350
But it's got
All this red juice
When I push on it.

784
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,720
Then don't push on it.

785
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,730
Darling, rare meat
Is good for you.

786
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,290
The doctor said so.

787
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,710
Christina...

788
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:36,180
Meat loses its vitamins
If it's overcooked.

789
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,980
I've had my vitamins
This morning.

790
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,250
Pills.

791
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,890
She negotiates everything,
Like a goddamn hollywood agent.

792
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,160
Christina...

793
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,830
Eat your lunch.

794
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,410
You are not getting up
From this table

795
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,940
Until you have
Finished that meat.

796
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,780
You may get up
From the table now.

797
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,320
Just a minute,
Young lady!

798
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,760
Pick up that plate,
Take it into the kitchen,

799
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,160
And put it
Into the refrigerator.

800
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,100
Now, do you know
I'm going out this evening?

801
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,100
You will have dinner
In your room alone.

802
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,210
You will eat everything
On that plate.

803
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,870
Do you understand?

804
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,130
You may drink
Your glass of milk

805
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,040
And then you may be excused
From the table, christina.

806
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,080
Tina...

807
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,520
Empty that plate...

808
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,420
Into the trash can.

809
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,970
Why must everything
Be a contest?

810
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,040
The envelope, please.

811
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,150
And the winner is...
Ray milland!

812
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,220
For the lost weekend.

813
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,050
[applause]

814
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,190
God! I hate this night!

815
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,260
It turns every year
Into a crisis.

816
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,930
I wish I did have pneumonia.

817
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,130
I wish I was raging mad
Over the flu.

818
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,840
And a fever so I wouldn't
Have even listened!

819
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,370
Now for the best
Female performance
In a leading role,

820
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,310

829
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,730
The picture is a hit.

830

844
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,190
Oh, I knew it!

845
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,250
I would rather
Be here with you

00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,750
Than anywhere else
In the world!

847
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,020

856
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,450
Now please forgive me.

857
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,190
Good night.

858
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,400
Radio: ...All this glamour,
This has surely got to be
Everyone's dream.

859
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,390
No...Wire...Hangers!

860
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,290
What's wire hangers
Doing in this closet

861
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:10,460
When I told you
No wire hangers?

862
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,700
Ever!

863
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,400
I work and work
Until I'm half dead,

864
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,310
And I hear people saying,
"She's getting old."

865
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,780
And what do I get?

866
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,610
A daughter!

867
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,580
Who cares as much

868
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,920
About the beautiful
Dresses I give her

869
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,290
As she cares about me!

870
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,820

01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,360
Answer me!

872
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,170
I buy you beautiful dresses,

873
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,540
And you treat them like
They were some dishrag!

874
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:56,710
You'd put a $300 dress
On a wire hanger?

875
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:00,680
We'll see how many
You've got hidden over here!

876
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,310
We'll see!

877
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,450
We'll see--
Get out of that bed!

878
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:07,990
All of this is
Going out! Out!

879
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,990
Mommie, please!

880
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:09,990
Out! Out!

881
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,990
No! Mommie!

882
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,790

[muttering]

884
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,600
We're going to see
How many wire hangers

885
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,500
You've got
In your closet!

886
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,630
Wire...

887
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,670
Wire...

888
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,670
Wire hangers--

889
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,270
Why?

890
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:30,140
Why? Christina,
Get out of that bed!

891
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,940
Get out of that bed!

892
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,580
Oh!

893
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,580
You live in
The most beautiful house
In brentwood...

894
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,480
Mommie!

895
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,050
And you don't care

896
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,820
If your clothes
Are stretched out
From wire hangers!

897
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,560
Please! Mommie, don't!

898
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,700
Mommie...Don't!
[crying]

899
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,600
And your room looks like
A 2-dollar refurnished room

900
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,340
In some 2-bit
Back-street town

901
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,570
In oklahoma!

904
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,580
Now, get up! Get up!
Clean up this mess!

906
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,720
[crying]

907
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,240
Did you scrub
The bathroom floor today?

908
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,310
Did you!?

909
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,240
Yes, mommie.

910
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,210
Yes, mommie what?

911
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,490
Yes, mommie dearest.

912
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:55,030
When I told you
To call me that...

913
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,930
I wanted you to mean it.

914
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,500
Come here.

915
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,410
Look at this floor.

916
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,070
Do you call that clean?

917
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,540
Do you?

918
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,780
Miss jenkins
Said it was clean.

919
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,520
Miss jenkins
Said it was clean?

920
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,590
Do you think it's clean?

921
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:25,560
Do you think
It's clean?

922
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,690
Look at that. Do you?

923
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,900
Yes, I do.

924
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,740
Get on the floor.

925
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,370
We're going
To clean this floor.

926
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,940
You and me together.

927
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,410
Go.

928
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,610
Go. Scrub hard.

929
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:47,610
Scrub.

930
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,450
Mommie--

931
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:49,650
Scrub, christina.

932
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,480
[sobbing]

933
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,820
This floor's
Already clean.

934
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,150
It's not--this floor
Is not clean!

935
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,620
Look at it!

936
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,720
This floor is not clean!

937
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,190
Mommie, no!

938
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,500
This floor is not clean!

939
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,760
Nothing is clean!

940
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,200
This whole place
Is a mess!

941
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,400
Mommie!

942
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,840
It's...A...Mess...

943
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,040
[sobbing]

944
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,650
Mommie! I...I don't
Understand!

945
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,550
[crying]

946
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,350
[crying]

947
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,880
Clean up this mess!

948
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,950
But...

949
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,360
How?

950
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,700
You figure it out.

951
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,530
I'll help you
Clean it up.

952
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,930
No. Go back.

953
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,930
Strap yourself in.

954
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,000
She'll kill me
If she found out.

955
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,850
Jesus...Christ!

956
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:12,660
No report on christmas
Would be complete

957
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,990
Without a description

958
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,760
Of how one hollywood family
Spends this holiday.

959
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,530
So now, let us all hop
On our imaginary sleigh

960
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,900
And whisk away to the home

961
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,210
Of one of america's
Foremost actresses--

962
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,910
Miss joan crawford.

963
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:32,910
We're so very happy
To have you with us,
George.

964
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,110
This is my daughter
Christina.

965
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,550
Hello, everybody.

966
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,080
And my son
Christopher.

967
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,920
Hello.

968
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,960
All of america knows
Of your generosity

969
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,590
In adopting these
Two homeless children.

970
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:48,660
And might I say
To all of our listeners

971
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,000
They're
Beautifully behaved.

972
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,130
Thank you, george.

973
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,800
I feel that discipline
Mixed with love

974
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,770
Is such
A good recipe.

975
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:02,340
Christina,
Do you and your brother
Get lots of presents

976
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,940
At christmastime?

977
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,140
Yes, we do.

978
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,680
Mother's fans send us
So many beautiful things,

979
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,620
But we like to share them
With other boys and girls,

980
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,550
Who aren't so fortunate.

981
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:15,950
Miss crawford...

982
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,360
Could you tell us
What will happen

983
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,160
After we leave you
This evening?

984
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Well, the children
And I will probably

985
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,400
Sit and watch
The christmas tree
Lights,

986
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,900
And then later
We'll welcome

987
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,730
Some of the
Children's friends

988
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,700
To help us sing
Christmas carols.

989
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,740
And surely you'll
Finish up by reading

990
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,140
'twas the night
Before christmas.

991
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,980
No christmas eve
Would be complete
Without that.

992
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,680
Well, as a christmas present
To our listeners,

993
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,220
Would all of you like
To say the last two lines?

994
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,750
And I heard him exclaim

995
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,320
As he drove out of sight,

996
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,860
"Merry christmas to all,

997
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,760
And to all a good night."

998
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,730
And good night to you,
Miss crawford,
And thank you,

999
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:03,200
For allowing
All of us to share
Your christmas eve.

1000
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,740
And thank you,
George,

1001
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,370
And merry christmas
To you

1002
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:10,140
And to all
Your listeners.

1003
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,910
Mommie's not quite
Ready yet, mr. Gilbert.

1004
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:16,010
Will it be scotch
With ice tonight?

1005
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:18,920
Please. Take it easy
With the scotch, honey.

1006
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,050
O.K.

1007
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,200
Easy. Easy on the scotch,
Christina.

1008
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,910
Mr. Gilbert...

1009
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,280
I fix all my uncles'
Drinks this way.

1010
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,350
I...Am not your uncle.

1011
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,150
Mommie?

1012
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,290
Mr. Gilbert is here.

1013
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,520
Very good, darling.

1014
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,520
Hello, ted.

1015
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,860
Joan.

1016
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,990
You know by now you can
Call him uncle ted.

1017
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,030
Yes, mommie dearest.

1018
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,800
Uncle ted.

1019
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,730
[clears throat]

1020
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:43,230
See you later,
Tina darling.

1021
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,010
It's not good.

1022
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,550
You didn't like it?

1023
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,020
No. It's not good.

1024
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,120
We have to find
Something wonderful.

1025
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,420
I think we have
Everything here
There is to find.

1026
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:48,300
We've got company.

1027
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,280
Tina?

1028
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,180
I made you a fresh one,
Mommie dearest.

1029
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,420
Thank you, tina darling.

1030
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,400
That's quite
An extraordinary
Young lady.

1031
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,410
Whatever I did...

1032
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:35,210
I won't do it again.

1033
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:36,550
I promise.

1034
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,220
I can be better.

1035
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,890
You'll see. The time
Will fly by.

1036
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,990
You can call me
Anytime collect.

1037
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,850
Oh.

1038
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:18,390
Mrs. Chadwick,
How kind of you
To greet us.

1039
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,520
This is
Christina.

1040
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,190
I know you'll be
Happy here, christina.

1041
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,590
I won't.

1042
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:26,160
Please don't make me stay.

1043
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,140
I don't want to leave home.

1044
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,140
You're not, darling.
Now listen to me.

1045
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,240
You're not
Leaving home.

1046
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,910
You'll be home
Some weekends
And holidays.

1047
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,950
What will
Mrs. Chadwick think?

1048
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,480
I'm sure everything
Will be fine

1049
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,220
Once you settle in.

1050
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,320
Now, I'll
Call you later,
All right?

1051
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,270
I understand just
How you feel, christina.

1052
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,040
I understand.

1053
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,410
Understand.

1054
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,520
The first word
I ever heard...

1055
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
Out of any of you

1056
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,630
Was that word...

1057
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,430
"Understand."

1058
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:35,400
There will be time enough
To understand when I'm old,

1059
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,040
If I ever am old.

1060
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,110
Oh, but not now.

1061
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,550
That was great,
Christina.

1062
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,880
Thank you.

1063
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:54,720
Well, what play
Was that from?

1064
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,290
It's antigone.

1065
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,660
It's a greek myth
Written by a french
Playwright.

1066
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,460
Well, can I have
Your autograph

1067
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,530
When you're
A big movie star?

1068
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:05,160
Darling,
If I'm not too booked.

1069
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,200
Not too booked,
Miss movie star?

1070
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,430
What is this,
Not too booked?

1071
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:10,800
Stop it, tony.

1072
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,200
Yes, stop it.

1073
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,120
Christina,
Do sit up properly.

1074
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,990
Isn't this fun...

1075
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,360
Us having a date

1076
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,400
On your weekend
Home from school?

1077
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,270
Charming hat,
Christina.

1078
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,810
Oh, why thank you, tommy.

1079
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:53,640
I picked it out myself.

1080
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,410
Don't flirt,
Christina.

1081
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:03,050
Tommy, we'll have
The new york steak
For two, rare...

1082
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,960
And two
Limestone salads.

1083
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,090
Thank you,
Miss crawford.

1084
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,430
Thank you, tommy.

1085
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,200
Tina...

1086
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,510
Flirting can be...

1087
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,710
Taken the wrong way.

1088
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,710
Do you understand?

1089
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,850
Mmm.

1090
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,420
I want to
Show you something.

1091
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,750
I got all as...

1092
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,090
One "B."

1093
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:43,430
I'm very proud
Of you, christina.

1094
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:44,460
Thank you.

1095
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,600
Very proud.

1096
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,670
Now, what about your
Christmas card list?

1097
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,140
Christmas cards?

1098
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,150
I've been studying
For exams.

1099
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,350
I'll get the cards
Out on time, o.K.?

1100
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:07,390
You know, tina,
Being away at school

1101
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,690
Has made you
More rebellious.

1102
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,360
I am not a baby anymore.

1103
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,060
Maybe you'd be
Better off at home.

1104
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,630
Sorry.

1105
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,570
I have had a lot
Of schoolwork.

1106
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:28,370
Times are tough.

1107
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,580
Still, I treat you
To a lovely evening...

1108
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,910
What do I get?

1109
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,680
Smart-aleck
Back talk.

1110
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:39,580
I'm sorry, mommie dearest.

1111
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,390
It's all right.

1112
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,360
I've had to let
Helga go.

1113
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,530
I'll need your help
At home this weekend.

1114
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,530
Well, let's have
A lovely evening.

1115
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,530
Shall we?

1116
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,180
[gasps]

1117
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,590
God, you scared me.

1118
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:18,720
Sorry, tina.

1119
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,560
How are you doing?

1120
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,700
O.K.

1121
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,600
About finished?

1122
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,370
Almost.

1123
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,670
Sit down, tina.

1124
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,770
I want to talk to you
About something.

1125
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,550
What did I do?

1126
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,390
It's not you.

1127
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,460
Tina, darling, I...

1128
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,900
I'm having some...

1129
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,800
Financial difficulties.

1130
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:13,380
I just spoke
To mrs. Chadwick.

1131
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,910
She's agreed to let you go

1132
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:17,820
On a work scholarship
Program.

1133
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,430
That's all right.

1134
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:32,160
We'll manage.

1135
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:49,180
You know, I was on
A work scholarship
Program.

1136
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,490
Made my way through school
Scrubbing floors.

1137
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,490
Mostly...

1138
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:59,620
Work.

1139
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,570
What is it?

1140
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,710
There is something else.

1141
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:21,550
I lost my contract
At warner's.

1142
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,120
I...

1143
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,990
I don't feel
I have anybody.

1144
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,530
No contract.

1145
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:44,900
No studio.

1146
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,510
No money.

1147
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,610
Oh, tina.

1148
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:55,550
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1149
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,850
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1150
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:04,250
It'll be o.K.

1151
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,590
We'll manage.

1152
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,540
I'm scared, tina.

1153
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,550
I'm scared.

1154
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,920
After all those years,

1155
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,490
I never thought
It could happen to me.

1156
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,760
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1157
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,070
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

1158
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,780
Don't worry.

1159
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,850
Oh, mommie...

1160
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,520
I love you.

1161
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:17,960
Mommie.

1162
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,060
Mommie?

1163
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,070
I came up to say good night
To you.

1164
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,950
Mommie?

1165
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,820
Mommie.

1166
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:50,060
Mommie.

1167
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,500
Carol ann.

1168
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,830
Carol ann!

1169
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,440
Something's happened.

1170
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,970
What's the matter?

1171
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,370
I don't know.

1172
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:05,210
I came in,

1173
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:07,810
And I found her
Like this.

1174
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,620
I think she needs
An ambulance.

1175
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,180
She doesn't need
An ambulance.

1176
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,620
She's drunk.

1177
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:21,260
Come on.
Let's put her to bed.

1178
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,730
Joan.

1179
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,870
When did she buy
All of these?

1180
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,030
Two days ago.
They were delivered
This afternoon.

1181
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,640
Get up. Get up.

1182
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,910
She told me we were broke.

1183
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,540
Come on. Help me.

1184
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,740
Stop it. Help me. Come on.

1185
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,550
Come on, joan. Come on.

1186
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:44,880
Give me the pillow.

1187
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,090
Come on.
Give me the pillow.

1188
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,850
Give me the pillow. Good.

1189
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:51,660
Good.

1190
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,590
You're a lousy substitute...

1191
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:57,090
For someone
Who really cares.

1192
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:58,430
Huh?

1193
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:06,470
Christina, darling.

1194
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,480
Christina, darling.

1195
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,810
Come on, joan.

1196
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,650
Joan.

1197
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:20,520
Christina, darling.

1198
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,250
Sorry it has
To be like this.

1199
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,660
For you...For her...

1200
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,590
Christina, darling.

1201
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,130
Come on, joan.

1202
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,260
Joan.

1203
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,660
It all comes out
In the wash.

1204
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,230
You come on now.

1205
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:39,040
Hold on to me...
Hold on.

1206
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,150
Hi, tony.

1207
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,080
Hi.

1208
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,720
You handle that
Horse pretty well

1209
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,320
For a lousy rider.

1210
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,750
Yeah, he's a great horse.

1211
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,290
Want to ride him?

1212
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,290
When?

1213
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,760
When you want to?

1214
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,590
Well,
I work all day.

1215
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,390
How about tonight?

1216
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,830
I'll go with you.

1217
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,330
What about vera?

1218
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:10,530
She's just a friend.

1219
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,310
8:30?

1220
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,310
Right here?

1221
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:20,640
O.K.

1222
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,700
That was my first kiss.

1223
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,400
I'll bet.

1224
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,840
Well, kinda.

1225
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:17,940
Swell.

1226
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,470
This is
Really swell.

1227
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:20,700
Vera.

1228
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,340
I'm going to tell.

1229
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:25,440
Oh, I am.
I am going to tell.

1230
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,480
How? How could this happen?

1231
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,380
How could you humiliate me
This way?

1232
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,180
I am ashamed
To be your mother!

1233
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,850
And you, how could you
Let this happen?

1234
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,920
Both students
Have been put
On probation

1235
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,390
And will have
No privileges
For a month.

1236
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:39,390
Probation?

1237
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,890
This is appalling.

1238
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,230
I have devoted myself

1239
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,390
To making christina
A proper young lady.

1240
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,400
That boy should be expelled.

1241
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,870
Now, miss crawford,

1242
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,070
When this
Sort of thing has
Happened before--

1243
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,970
Before?

1244
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:53,740
Is this an institution
Of learning

1245
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,210
Or a teenage brothel?

1246
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,510
Chadwick has
An impeccable
Reputation,

1247
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:00,480
And when students
Break the rules,

1248
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,510
We curtail
Their freedom.

1249
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:05,480
Well, we are leaving here
Right now.

1250
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,480
Obviously she
Cannot be controlled

1251
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,020
In this environment.

1252
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,750
Nothing really
Happened between
Your daughter

1253
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,860
And the young man.
It was innocent.

1254
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,220
No thanks to you.

1255
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:16,990
I think you're
Overreacting,
Miss crawford.

1256
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:20,000
And I think
You're underreacting,
Mrs. Chadwick.

1257
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,870
My compliments
To your school

1258
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,440
On its impeccable
Reputation.

1259
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,910
Christina, come on.

1260
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:45,890
There's a liquor store
To the right.

1261
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:50,290
I should have known

1262
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,930
You'd know where to find
The boys and the booze.

1263
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,480
All right.

1264
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,910
Tina, look at me.

1265
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,280
Barbara bennett is
Here from new york

1266
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,480
Doing a cover story
On me for redbook.

1267
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,050
Tina, look at me...

1268
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,720
When I'm talking
To you.

1269
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:25,360
This is very
Important to me.

1270
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,000
I don't want any
Trouble from you.

1271
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,710
[typing]

1272
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,780
I'm back.

1273
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:45,920
You're going to love this.

1274
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,590
"Movie star manages
To have it all--

1275
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,450
Career, home, and family."

1276
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,490
Let me see that.

1277
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:59,930
My god, christina.

1278
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,300
It can't be.

1279
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,600
The last time I saw you,
You were 4.

1280
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,500
How are you,
Miss bennett?

1281
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,970
God, call me barbara.

1282
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:13,710
Teaching you
Some fancy manners
At chadwick.

1283
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:16,750
That's not all
They've been teaching her.

1284
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,080
Well, how do you
Like school?

1285
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,420
Very much,
Thank you.

1286
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,320
She got expelled.

1287
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,960
That's a lie.

1288
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,000
Excuse me, barbara.

1289
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:39,140
Tina, I want to talk to you.

1290
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:43,040
In the other room.

1291
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,020
Why do you
Deliberately defy me?

1292
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,060
Why did you tell her
I got expelled?

1293
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,560
Because you did
Get expelled!

1294
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,400
That is a lie.

1295
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,640
You love it,
Don't you?

1296
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,210
You love to make me
Hit you!

1297
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,350
Joan!

1298
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:25,980
Barbara, please.

1299
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,620
Please, barbara.

1300
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,050
Leave us alone,
Barbara.

1301
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,490
If you
Need anything,
Ask carol ann.

1302
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:33,360
Oh...

1303
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,690
This is wonderful.

1304
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:37,190
This is wonderful!

1305
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,700
You...

1306
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,170
You deliberately
Embarrass me

1307
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,970
In front
Of a reporter!

1308
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,200
A reporter.

1309
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,710
I told you
How important
This is to me.

1310
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,470
I told you!

1311
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,710
Why did you adopt me?

1312
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:55,580
What?

1313
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,850
Why did you adopt me?

1314
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:06,120
Because I wanted
A child.

1315
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,600
Because I wanted
Someone to love.

1316
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,870
Don't you act for me.

1317
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:21,370
I want to know.

1318
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,610
Why did you adopt me?!

1319
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,950
Maybe I did it
For a little extra
Publicity.

1320
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:34,220
Tina...

1321
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,290
That's not true.

1322
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:42,090
You know
That's not true.

1323
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:45,300
Maybe just
A little true.

1324
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,500
I don't know
What to do with you.

1325
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,810
I don't know
What to do with you.

1326
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,140
Why not?

1327
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,420
I don't ask much
From you, girl.

1328
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:18,100
Why can't you
Give me the respect

1329
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,330
That
I'm entitled to?

1330
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,140
Why can't you
Treat me

1331
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,140
Like I would
Be treated

1332
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:30,740
By any stranger
On the street?

1333
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:33,610
Because I am not

1334
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,410
One of your fans!

1335
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,650
Aah!

1336
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:41,780
Mommie!

1337
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,420
You never loved me!

1338
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,390
Mommie!

1339
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:46,190
Aah!

1340
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:48,390
Taken! Taken! Taken!

1341
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:49,730
You hated me!

1342
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,030
You never loved me!

1343
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:55,200
Never! Never!

1344
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,830
You've always taken
And taken!

1345
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:58,500
[choking]

1346
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,110
You never wanted
To be my daughter!

1347
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:05,310
You've always
Taken everything!

1348
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:08,050
Everything
You ever need!

1349
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:10,410
And you give
Nothing back!

1350
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,410
Why?

1351
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,420
Love me!

1352
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:16,550
Aah!

1353
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,860
Joan, stop! You're
Going to kill her!

1354
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,860
Aah!

1355
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,690
[choking]

1356
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,560
Get out!

1357
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:31,630
[sobbing]
Get out...

1358
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,880
Mommie.

1359
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,610
Dear christina...

1360
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:46,350
God has brought you
To our convent school

1361
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:48,350
So that you could see

1362
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:50,350
The error of your ways.

1363
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:52,420
Your mother
Has told us

1364
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,260
How difficult
You've been,

1365
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:57,360
Both at home and
At your former school.

1366
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,360
She has requested
The strictest discipline
For you.

1367
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,900
There will be
No privileges.

1368
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:07,300
You're not to leave
The school.

1369
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:11,810
There will be
No telephone calls
In or out.

1370
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,710
No visitors.

1371
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:15,550
No mail.

1372
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:19,380
You have sinned
In the past,

1373
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,650
Transgressed against
The holy commandments,

1374
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:27,220
But you shall find
Forgiveness here

1375
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:29,530
And be cleansed.

1376
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:32,530
Let us pray together
For your repentance.

1377
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:35,400
The good lord
Will grace you

1378
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,500
With his comfort
And kindness.

1379
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,490
To joan and alfred,

1380
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,730
A long and happy marriage.

1381
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:06,630
Hear, hear!

1382
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:07,960
Hold it. Hold it.

1383
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,670
Look this way, please.

1384
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,500
Thank you.

1385
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,670
Alfred, darling,
I'm so happy.

1386
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,910
Speech!

1387
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:18,840
Oh...

1388
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:19,910
Speech!

1389
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:22,910
Uh, thank you all
For being here

1390
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,850
On such short notice.

1391
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,920
If this marriage comes
As a surprise

1392
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,420
To some of you,

1393
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,920
Just think how I felt

1394
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,320
When joan said yes.

1395
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,330
You know,
A few minutes ago

1396
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,330
A reporter asked me
What I thought

1397
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:41,630
And how
I would describe

1398
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:44,270
The marriage between
The soft drink king

1399
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:45,600
And the queen
Of hollywood.

1400
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,340
I told him I thought
It was a hell of
A match.

1401
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:53,810
That's my pally.

1402
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,380
Oh, pally. That's
What he calls you

1403
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,380
When he can't
Remember your name.

1404
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,320
Oh, don't you
Let her kid you.

1405
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,920
I remember her name.

1406
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,350
It's mrs. Alfred steele.

1407
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:05,490
Right, pally?

1408
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:06,760
Right.

1409
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,910
Thank you, sister...

1410
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:27,840
For being
So good to me.

1411
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,080
These years
Have been...

1412
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,850
Very hard.

1413
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:35,390
Good-bye, dear child.

1414
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,650
God be with you.

1415
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,560
Thank you.

1416
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,670
No, thanks.
I can manage it.

1417
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:57,910
I'm o.K.

1418
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,420
Mommie?

1419
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,510
Ho ho ho. Well...

1420
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:05,140
Oh, I miss you, too,
Darling.

1421
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,410
Yes.

1422
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:08,980
You get to new york
So often.

1423
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,350
You know?

1424
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,980
We'll see each other
There.

1425
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:14,750
Yes, I've put the house
Up for sale.

1426
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,750
Alfred travels so much,
And, um,

1427
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:19,620
Well, corporate
Headquarters
Are in new york.

1428
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,830
Darling,
My daughter's here.

1429
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:26,500
I'll talk to you
Before we leave.

1430
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,770
All right.
Love to you, too.

1431
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:32,540
Hello, mother.

1432
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,810
Christina.

1433
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:41,410
I want you
To meet my husband.

1434
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:42,950
What do I call him?

1435
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,950
What would you
Call anyone
Who's your father?

1436
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,380
Go introduce yourself.

1437
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,820
Go on.

1438
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,840
Hello, daddy.

1439
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,610
I'm christina.

1440
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,610
[buzz saw]

1441
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:27,220
Hello, arthur.

1442
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,490
Well...

1443
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:30,260
I don't know
What to do.

1444
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:33,800
That bitch
Of a bearing wall
Is blocking my view.

1445
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:47,040
I'll tell you
What to do.

1446
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,850
Tear down that bitch
Of a bearing wall

1447
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:55,990
And put a window
Where it ought to be!

1448
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,130
Tina, what do you think?

1449
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:12,900
It'll be great.

1450
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,070
Darling, coffee?

1451
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:17,770
Yeah, sure.

1452
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,780
Tina, darling, coffee?

1453
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:23,910
O.K.

1454
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:29,320
So you're acting?

1455
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,890
Yeah.

1456
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,660
Where?

1457
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,630
Well, mostly in stock.

1458
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:38,090
I think I may be
Pretty good.

1459
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,200
Good luck, darling.

1460
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:48,570
I have been
Working nights

1461
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:52,140
So I can
Go on interviews
During the day.

1462
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:54,580
See, the thing is,
I...

1463
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:58,950
Well, I was wondering
If, uh, you could
Lend me a little money,

1464
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:01,820
You know,
To get by this month.

1465
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:05,590
Not a cent.

1466
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,720
Joan, come on.
A little something.

1467
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,260
Doing things
On your own...

1468
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:13,330
Is best.

1469
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:16,000
Don't you agree, tina?

1470
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,200
Sure.

1471
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,040
I'll get by.

1472
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:33,150
Between us.

1473
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:40,020
Now, the sofa will
Have to be delivered.

1474
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:41,120
This is wonderful.

1475
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,160
And this chair...

1476
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,560
That is my favorite.

1477
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,730
It's my favorite, too.

1478
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:45,960
All on the terrace.

1479
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,930
Would you excuse us
For a minute, please?

1480
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,130
Oh. Yes.

1481
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,170
Al, look at this.

1482
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:53,670
It's perfect
Except for the colors.

1483
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,070
They're too strong.

1484
01:41:55,070 --> 01:41:58,740
And I want you
To look at these.

1485
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,980
I, uh, hate
To bring this up,
But, um...

1486
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:05,650
We're going
To have to cut back
On our spending.

1487
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:08,080
What are you
Talking about?

1488
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,450
Al, I'm doing
All this for you.

1489
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:12,990
I'm turning
This apartment
Into your showplace.

1490
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,590
You're doing
A marvelous job,

1491
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:17,390
But we've got
To economize.

1492
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:18,860
Most of our expenses,

1493
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,330
Including
This apartment,

1494
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:21,760
Are for your company.

1495
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,770
We have to look great
For pepsi-cola!

1496
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,870
I want us to look great,

1497
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:29,670
And I want us to live well,
But there's a limit.

1498
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:32,010
We're going into debt.

1499
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:34,440
Al, you're a great
Businessman.

1500
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,050
You and your company

1501
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:40,720
Have found yourselves
A movie star to sell
Your soda pop.

1502
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,690
Well, you got
To pay the price.

1503
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,220
Be reasonable, pally.

1504
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,860
You've got everything
You need for this place.

1505
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:50,790
Just look at this joint.

1506
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:54,700
You genius
Of the soft drink world!

1507
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:57,830
Get the goddamned
Company to pay the bill!

1508
01:42:57,830 --> 01:43:00,240
You've got to understand!
It's a public company!

1509
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,770
This isn't hollywood

1510
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:04,340
Where someone
Takes care of things
With a phone call!

1511
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,080
This is the real world!

1512
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:10,680
The real world
Expects us to live
In a certain way.

1513
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,080
Yeah, well, that way
Is breaking my back.

1514
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:24,160
We'll find a solution.

1515
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:27,960
You love a challenge.

1516
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:33,170
O.K., pally.

1517
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,740
Miss crawford,
The condolences

1518
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,940
Of every person
At pepsi-cola
Are with you.

1519
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:42,680
Al steele helped
Make this company.

1520
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,850
And you were
Right by
His side,

1521
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:46,850
Sharing
The burdens
And the joy.

1522
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:51,150
And we want
To give you ample time
To repay the debt.

1523
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:52,150
Plenty of time.

1524
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,360
Of course,

1525
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,090
We'll have to take
The 5th avenue
Apartment.

1526
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:59,760
You probably wouldn't want
To stay there alone, anyway.

1527
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,300
What debt?

1528
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:04,300
I've got 100,000 shares
Of stock.

1529
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:07,100
Your husband
Had to borrow
Against the stock

1530
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:09,940
To pay
For the construction
On your apartment.

1531
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:12,980
And we loaned him
A considerable sum,
In addition,

1532
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:16,380
To meet expenses
His salary
Didn't cover.

1533
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:21,880
You think you're
Very clever, don't you,

1534
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,920
Trying to sweep
The poor little widow

1535
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,360
Under the carpet?

1536
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,230
Well...

1537
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,260
Think again.

1538
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,870
I'm on the board
Of directors

1539
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,130
Of this lousy company.

1540
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:40,200
Well, we assumed that
With your husband gone,

1541
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,140
You would no longer
Want to be on the board.

1542
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:46,910
Al and I helped build pepsi
To what it is today.

1543
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:49,880
I intend to stay with it.

1544
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,580
We appreciate
Your devotion
And contribution,

1545
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,550
Miss crawford,

1546
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:58,490
But we have
Retired you

1547
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:00,890
From the board
Of directors.

1548
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:03,190
You drove al steele
To his grave,

1549
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:05,730
And now you're trying
To stab me in the back?

1550
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:07,700
Forget it!

1551
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,570
I've fought
Worse monsters than you
For years in hollywood.

1552
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:13,400
I know how to win
The hard way!

1553
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,070
Miss crawford,
We don't want
Any hard feelings.

1554
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:18,310
You don't know
What hard feelings are

1555
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:22,110
Until I come out publicly
Against your product,

1556
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:24,910
And you'll see
How much you sell.

1557
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:26,350
Please,
Miss crawford,

1558
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:28,550
It's hardly
Necessary
To make threats

1559
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:30,050
You surely
Don't mean.

1560
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:32,490
Don't fuck with me,
Fellas!

1561
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,390
This ain't my first time
At the rodeo.

1562
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:41,160
You forget the press
I delivered to pepsi
Was my power.

1563
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,130
I can use it
Any way I want.

1564
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,270
The sword...

1565
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:49,110
Cuts both ways.

1566
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,740
Ahem.

1567
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,410
The board
Has failed to realize

1568
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:59,520
The extent
Of your interest
In the company--

1569
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,180
Apart from
Al's position.

1570
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:06,260
We, um...

1571
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:10,890
Misjudged.

1572
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:14,960
We shall be...Pleased
To have you stay on.

1573
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,070
Thank you, gentlemen.

1574
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:27,010
Now let's get to work.

1575
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,510
[doorbell buzzes]

1576
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:00,380
[buzz]

1577
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:01,510
Coming.

1578
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,820
Mommie.

1579
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:15,360
Oh, tina, darling.

1580
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,260
I wish I would've known
You were coming.

1581
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,300
Well...

1582
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,130
I just happened to be
In the neighborhood.

1583
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:24,430
I would've
Straightened up
A little bit.

1584
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:28,100
Looks quite neat to me.

1585
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:33,110
Oh, jesus christ.

1586
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:38,280
I'd forgotten
What it was like.

1587
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,590
Sit down.

1588
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:52,690
How are you, tina?

1589
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,160
Been making rounds.

1590
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,200
A lot of rejections.

1591
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,470
But I'm up for a part.

1592
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:59,540
Good.

1593
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:00,740
It's a soap opera.

1594
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:03,770
Well, it's very
Good experience.

1595
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:06,410
Have you got
A glass, darling?

1596
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:07,510
Oh, yeah.

1597
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:10,280
Hey, you know where
I got this from?

1598
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,080
Uh-uh.

1599
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,280
Batista himself.
Ha ha.

1600
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,250
Yeah?

1601
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:17,350
When I opened a plant
Outside havana.

1602
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:20,620
It's all
They gave you?

1603
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:22,090
That's it.

1604
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,760
Cheap bastards.

1605
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,500
Ha ha ha ha.

1606
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:34,370
Do you miss all that?

1607
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,210
I miss al more.

1608
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:45,210
So...

1609
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:48,520
How are the guys?

1610
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,690
Guys are guys.

1611
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:55,320
It--it hasn't changed.

1612
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:59,500
I brought you...

1613
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,630
A gift.

1614
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,140
Thank you, mommie.

1615
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:25,490
Oh...

1616
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:32,230
They were
The first present
That al ever gave me.

1617
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:36,670
They're beautiful.

1618
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,070
I want you to have them.

1619
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:42,540
Thank you.

1620
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:49,180
And, tina...

1621
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:51,410
If you don't
Get this part,

1622
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:54,580
For christ's sake,
Don't hock 'em.

1623
01:49:58,090 --> 01:49:59,460
Oh, I wouldn't.

1624
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:05,430
Thank you, mommie.

1625
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:19,610
Hey, don't be

I think she's been
Secretly planning
This for years.

You're in good hands,
Then.

1646

It's her wedding.

But bruce
Is being good.

Them up higher, huh?

Who made this honor
Possible.

1806
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:31,120
And on a more
Personal note...

Directly to her...

It's over.

1817
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:01,740
The pain.

1818
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:05,710
There's no more pain.

1819
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,280
You're free.

1820
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:16,520
You're free.

1821
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:20,060

I do hope you feel
We've done her justice.

From my own personally

I need to believe that.

1850
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:14,310
I need so much...

1851
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:19,650
To be able
To believe that now.

1852
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:21,480

1853
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,860
Here it is.

1854
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:35,530

Pertaining to you

Jesus christ.

1864

[sighs]

1865
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:19,640
As usual,

1866
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:28,520
Does she?

1867
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:43,330
Does she?
