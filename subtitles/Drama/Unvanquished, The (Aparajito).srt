14
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,550
Have you seen the monkey?

15
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,149
-A monkey got into the house?
-l mean your precious son

16
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,560
l boiled milk for him
but he vanished

17
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,040
The boys in this neighbourhood...

18
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,480
lt's so crowded; how can l
keep an eye on him here?

19
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,959
lsn't there a school nearby?

20
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,329
lf he went there
l'd have a rest from w' ory

21
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,329
Are you going out?
There's milk for you

22
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,550
You said it was for Khoka

23
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,029
You'll have some, too, from now on.
It's in the kitchen

24
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,930
- Won't you go to market?
- Of course. What should l get?

25
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,829
l'll tell you, but...

26
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,459
Thinking of money?
l don't have to pay in cash

27
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,089
He'll give you credit?

28
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,660
Do you think l supply all those
herbal medicines free?

29
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,079
Then bring some mustard oil,
some kerosene and some spices

30
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,579
See if you can get some mung dal...
mung or masoor, or whatever

31
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,790
Apu's been asking for khichree since
he had some at the ghat the other day

32
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,040
Anything else?

33
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,439
Can you get some paan masala?

34
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,680
- What brand?
- l don't know

35
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,129
The woman upstairs gave me some

36
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,060
Find out the name
and l'll bring it tomorrow

37
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,910
l met a sweet-seller l knew.
He says he has rheumatism

38
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,399
l'm taking him some medicine. l could
ask him for some cream from Kashi

39
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,160
Shall l ask him for some?

40
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,879
Let the medicine work first

41
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,990
Aren't you going to bathe
in the Ganga?

42
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,700
lf you don't, you won't get salvation

43
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,179
They've just arrived.
Let them settle in first

44
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,879
They will bathe, pay homage
to Vishwanathji - all in good time

45
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,389
Water

46
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,309
Apu! Wait

47
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,899
Aren't you hungry?
Have you eaten anything outside?

48
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,919
- A sweet made from milk
- You really ate it?

49
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,330
And a pedha as well

50
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,159
- Is Ray-mashai at home?
- No

51
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:23,480
l've a calendar for him. l came home
too late to give it to him last night

52
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,759
Shall l put it in his room?

53
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,009
We bring one out every year

54
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,009
You'll find all the important
holy days in it

55
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,379
The holy festivals are marked in red,
so they're easy to see

56
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,320
O Lord of the world, those who have
faith in you are the blessed ones

57
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,960
Those who worship you are the holy
ones, those who praise you...

58
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,149
Look! She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast

59
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,399
l'll tell my brother

60
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,299
Then Jatila quietly takes her brother
Ayan to her hiding place and says:

61
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,200
''Look at that.
See what your wife is up to

62
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,860
''She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast''

63
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,490
You see what has happened
meanwhile?

64
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,889
Krishna tells Radha: ''Lay a flower
at my feet as an offering...

65
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,549
''...and l'll take the form of the
goddess Kali, to please Ayan''

66
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,539
Want to swing a club?

67
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,669
l'll swing it, then

68
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,039
-What's the name of the man upstairs?
-Nanda-babu

69
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,120
Tell him that mother has used all
the matches and father isn't home yet

70
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,419
Ask him for just two matches

71
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,580
Khoka, come in

72
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,639
- What do you want?
- Matches

73
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,190
- What will you do with matches?
- Mother wants them

74
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,610
That's my medicine. l'm ill, you see.
Doctor says to take it every evening

75
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,240
Only two matches, mother said

76
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,129
Take the whole box
l have more of them'

77
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,529
Tell your mother that Nanda-babu
says she need not return it

78
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,490
You have a fine voice

79
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,240
It seems you are a singer, too

80
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,740
l used to be

81
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,890
Do you live nearby?

82
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,349
l wondered if l could have some tea.
It's chilly, my throat is sore

83
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,410
See how l've brought tealeaves,
tied to the end of my wrapper

84
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,680
Come along, l live quite near,
in Ganesh Mohalla

85
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,950
You don't mind? My name is
Kalicharan Banerji, from Satkhire

86
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,299
Lord knows whether it's all right

87
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,799
- l want some, too
- Later. Give them this tea first

88
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,470
Then come back and take the sweets

89
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,299
Your son is very helpful

90
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Excellent tea

91
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,180
Where is your son?
He is a good boy

92
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,920
On Tuesday l'll take you to a feast
at the palace of Teota

93
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,589
Will you come?

94
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,990
Every year they have a feast
at the palace...

95
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,130
...and they send me an invitation

96
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,900
Will you mind if l take your son?

97
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,900
My friend, l have saved about 400
rupees, starving most of the time

98
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,339
Another hundred or so and l can get
myself a bride from a decent family

99
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:07,380
You can't be happy without a family
of your own, can you?

100
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,410
- You wouldn't know of any girl...
- l'm afraid not

101
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,920
The Pandeys have gone to the Ramlila
performance. Can't you take Apu, too?

102
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,740
Would you take these?

103
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,740
You're burning with fever

104
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,849
l went to the market, then to
the sweet-seller, for the cream...

105
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,549
...then to the ghat
for evening prayers

106
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,799
Then as l was climbing the steps...

107
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,470
Apu has gone out to buy fireworks

108
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,549
Why do you need Apu?

109
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,089
- Shouldn't we call a doctor?
- Don't bother

110
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,400
l'm not going to listen to you

111
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,799
In that tin box there are some
herbal medicines

112
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,569
Give me a dose

113
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,519
Mix well with juice of ginger
and honey

114
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,789
Let me try it. If l'm not better
by tomorrow, then we'll see

115
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,609
Sit with your father, he's ill

116
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,589
Which fireworks did you buy?

117
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,740
They're not as good as those
in Nishchindipur, are they?

118
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,319
Were you watching the fireworks
from the terrace

119
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,490
- Who is calling you?
- Shambhu

120
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,490
He lives in Kukurgali,
he's not a Bengali

121
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,839
Is he your friend? The one
who teaches you English?

122
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,319
What is ''Apu bhalechheley''
in English?

123
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,740
- Why not invite him in?
- He's going to set off fireworks now

124
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,359
- You want to go with him?
- Yes

125
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,599
Go, then

126
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,789
- How are you feeling now?
- Much better

127
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,500
You gave me such a fright.
You must have caught a chill

128
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,339
Take things easy,
you're earning enough

129
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,420
Sit for a while

130
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,630
There's work to be done.
l have to make Apu's bed

131
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:38,259
The sweet-seller told me about
a dwelling near the Man Mandir

132
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,960
On the first floor, two rooms, facing
south. The rent is seven rupees

133
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,029
There are markets and schools nearby.
Khoka won't have any problems

134
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,960
We'll talk about it
when you're better

135
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,960
- What is the boy doing?
- Can't you hear him?

136
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,220
But for the monkeys,
Kashi would be a good place

137
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,220
- Are you going out?
- Don't l have to go to the ghat?

138
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,740
- Can't you stay, after such a fever?
- l'm all right, the medicine worked

139
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,569
You'll climb all those steps...

140
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,109
l didn't hear anything in the night,

141
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,829
we came back late
from the performance

142
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,539
My wife was going to the ghat
when she heard he had collapsed

143
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,980
l hope he hasn't hurt himself

144
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,930
He must have done
on the stone steps

145
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,430
For one thing, he has a chest cold

146
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,130
The room is damp. Close the door
and windows, to keep the cold out

147
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,890
Someone come with me
l'll prescribe medicines

148
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,059
l'll come with you myself

149
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,450
If you have mustard oil and camphor,
rub his back and chest with them

150
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,670
If you need anything,
don't be shy to ask

151
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,960
Bou-than, are you making paan?

152
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,009
Get out at once!

153
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,740
Did you say something?
Do you want water?

154
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,769
Ganga...

155
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,720
Go to the ghat, get a pot of water
and run back at once

156
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,710
He'll be back at any moment

157
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
Khoka is back

158
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,489
Pay your respects
to your great-uncle

159
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,409
- How old is he?
- He is ten now

160
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,820
-When was he given the sacred thread?
-After coming to Kashi

161
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,650
Will you come with me?

162
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,480
l can't make up my mind.
l hadn't thought of leaving here

163
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,599
l didn't know when you were coming

164
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,579
l always come at this time. l did
not know you were so badly off

165
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,949
You wrote that you were coming

166
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,559
- What are your employers like?
- Good people

167
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,619
They'll be going to Dewanpur

168
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,000
It seems they want
to take me with them

169
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,519
So l can't make up my mind

170
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,210
Think it over. l am here for
a few more days

171
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,289
If you stay at my house, it gets
lived in and you'll have no problems

172
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,590
That's enough

173
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,639
Go and open that drawer

174
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,440
No, the one next to it

175
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,599
There's a leather purse there

176
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,559
You're coming with us, aren't you?
We're going to Dewanpur next month

177
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,900
l told you that l would take you
if l liked your work

178
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,599
l hope you'll agree.
Have you any relatives here?

179
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,800
Nor where you come from?
So you might as well come with us

180
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,599
Very well

181
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,269
Mokshada says you've lost
your appetite. Are you well?

182
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,320
Tell them in the other house
that Thakur-mashai is back

183
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,679
Mother! A train!

184
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,170
l've brought firewood.
Have you enough food?

185
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,480
Yes, enough until tomorrow

186
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,170
l'll come back tomorrow. Whenever
you need anything, just tell me

187
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,090
- You haven't told me your name
- Nirupama

188
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,420
l'm here for another week or so;
will you be settled in by then?

189
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,420
Apu, come with me tomorrow. You can
learn what you have to do as a priest

190
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,449
Place the deity on the throne
and put some tulsi leaves on him

191
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,519
No, wash them first

192
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,369
What's the matter with you?

193
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,690
You've been sulking since morning.
Are you ill? Are you feeling sad?

194
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,960
Are you missing Kashi,
or Nishchindipur?

195
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,110
Don't you like it here in Mansapota?

196
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,809
Have they been rude to you?

197
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,360
Have you been doing
your job properly?

198
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,869
They are good people here. If we keep
them happy, our livelihood is secure

199
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,710
Bear it for a few years. Then we may
be able to go back to Nishchindipur

200
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,619
Mother, l want to go to school

201
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,210
Which school?

202
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:41,730
Nearby, in Arboal. It's a good school

203
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,820
How do you know it's good?

204
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:46,309
l've seen it

205
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,610
- What about your work?
- That's mornings; school's afternoon

206
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:54,619
Can you do both? Don't you need
money to go to school?

207
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:01,309
Haven't you any money put away,
mother?

208
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,079
Are the sweets
and everything else ready?

209
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Only half an hour left

210
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,519
l'll attend to it, sir

211
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,869
- What is the subject now?
- Bengali, sir

212
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,829
The Foliage of Literature.
What does foliage mean?

213
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,849
Foliage means...

214
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,630
It means green leaves, sir

215
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:19,409
The Land of Bengal

216
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,539
Where is the greenest land of all?

217
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,329
Where on tender grass
your feet must fall?

218
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,559
Where grain sways
itisn sunny afternoons,

219
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:35,289
where the blushing lotus blooms?

220
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,210
Where do the thrush and robin sing?

221
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,650
Where do fork-tailed drongos swing,
where do elegant swans swim?

222
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,199
Where do weaverbirds nest again,
where do swallows cry for rain?

223
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,400
In our Bengal, our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all

224
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,590
In what land do they speak a tongue
that fills your soul with yearning?

225
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,969
Where do you hear such clear tones
of a baul whose heart is singing?

226
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,769
Where's the signature?
Why isn't it done?

227
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,610
You can remember so many things,
but you can't remember to do this?

228
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,730
Come and sit down.
Is your mother well?

229
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,150
The Inspector was very happy with you

230
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,940
Not that l was any less happy

231
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,230
l've kept an eye on your progress,
l've spoken to Abinash-babu about you

232
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,139
He is above average

233
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,800
We expect a great deal from you

234
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,659
On our part, we shall provide you
with every facility

235
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,400
But if you want to be a really good
student, work hard. Especially...

236
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,190
...you'll have to improve
your English

237
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,369
Do you like reading?
l don't mean textbooks

238
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,570
Books about travel
lives of great men..'.

239
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,760
...books about science... if l give
you such books, will you read them?

240
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,860
Of course he will read them

241
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,510
l have many such books here

242
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,789
If you don't read such books,
you cannot broaden your mind

243
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,280
We may live in a remote corner
of Bengal...

244
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,099
...but that does not mean that
our outlook should be narrow

245
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,679
This book is about the North Pole

246
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,199
From this book anyone can learn about
the aurora borealis or the Eskimos

247
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,690
This is about Livingstone's travels

248
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:16,780
You can learn about Africa

249
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,989
This is the story of inventions

250
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,090
Here are biographies of scientists:

251
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,619
Galileo, Archimedes
Newton, Faraday...

252
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,980
Mother, come and see

253
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,579
The sun, the earth and the moon.
The moon goes around the earth

254
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,769
When the shadow falls here
that's an eclipse

255
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,159
Apu, dear,
it's time to have your meal

256
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,510
Come in, Apurba

257
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,880
You've come second in the district

258
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,349
You'll study further, won't you?

259
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,329
You can get
a scholarship often rupees

260
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,639
l can arrange for you to study in
Calcutta. Have you thought about it?

261
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:35,059
You'll continue your studies?

262
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,199
In Calcutta? Arts or sciences?

263
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,659
Have you anywhere to stay there?
Any relatives?

264
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,570
Anyway, that's not a problem.
Have you spoken to your mother?

265
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:53,989
Not yet

266
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,599
- Can you get her to agree?
- l will ty

267
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,500
l came second in the district
there's only one above me

268
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,159
l might even get a scholarship,
money for doing well in examinations

269
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:35,489
- How much?
- Ten rupees a month

270
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,960
But only if l continue my studies

271
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,829
Do you think
they'll give it just like that?

272
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,360
l must go and study in Calcutta

273
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,849
What is this, mother?

274
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,190
You're going?

275
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,610
Why not?

276
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,329
That's why the headmaster
wanted to see me

277
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,769
He gave me some addresses

278
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,010
Who's going to pay for it?

279
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,969
The college will be half free

280
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,909
l'll get ten rupees
a month, l'll find work

281
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,440
And was l washed up by the river?

282
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,019
If you give up your job as a priest,
will they take care of us then?

283
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:54,849
So l must stick at being a priest?

284
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,769
Why not? You're a priest's son.
Do you want to be a governor?

285
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,849
Yes! Must everything be as you wish?

286
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:04,610
Everything!

287
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,440
There are snakes, mosquitoes
will bite you. Come back

288
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,719
All right, you can go to Calcutta,

289
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,340
but you must think things over first

290
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,570
- Why hit me?
- l'm sorry. l'll show you something

291
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,030
Whose is that?

292
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,519
When l worked in Kashi
do you know how much l saved?

293
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:17,219
Thirty-two rupees

294
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:20,519
l'll give you something from this,
enough to last out a month

295
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:33,179
The headmaster gave it to me.
It's a globe, it shows our earth

296
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,460
See, these are the countries
and the blue is the sea

297
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,789
See where Calcutta is?

298
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,510
- It's seven-thirty
- Come and see where l've put things

299
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,670
There's your tumbler, your bowl,

300
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,730
sweets in the bowl, some spices...

301
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,289
Here's some ghee
l've made from cream

302
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,159
Your shirts and vests...

303
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,440
...and the dhobi is in the bedding

304
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,190
Two postcards.
Write to me the moment you arrive

305
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,929
Five rupees from the purse
and twenty-five from me

306
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:28,829
Keep one rupee on you, for the ticket

307
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,820
And call at the Nirupamas' on your
way, they've done so much for you

308
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:44,360
- What about my globe?
- You'll have to cary it

309
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:50,539
The key, keep it safe

310
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,869
Send me news. Be careful
when you go about the city

311
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,239
Don't eat strange things

312
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,880
Come home
at the puja festival, if you can

313
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,000
Have you ever tripped
and hurt yourself?

314
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,480
If not, you'll have
plenty of opportunities

315
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,829
This wonderful balm will come to
your aid like a benevolent friend

316
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,800
Akhil-babu?

317
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:01,920
- l have a letter
- What letter?

318
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,800
From the headmaster ofArboal School

319
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,479
Paresh wrote to me about this

320
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,890
You've come here to study?

321
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,510
Any money?

322
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,750
l have twenty-nine rupees and six
annas after paying the train fare

323
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,119
Can l get a room here?

324
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,939
l have only the one room,
but we'll manage with it

325
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,939
What rent?

326
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,579
Can you work in the printing shop?

327
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,000
At night, after classes?

328
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:17,460
Go upstairs and you'll find the room;
l'll be up in a moment

329
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:41,409
Dear mother, l have arrived safely.
Akhil-babu has arranged for my stay

330
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:47,409
won't pay rent, l'll work
n the printing shop

331
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,939
There is electric light in my room

332
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,729
Couldn't you find a better place
to sleep than CCB's class?

333
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,880
Are you crying?

334
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:13,869
Come on, we've two free periods
after this. Let's go for a walk

335
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:35,539
Apu, don't you wish to go abroad?

336
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,210
Find me a job on a ship

337
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,460
l'm serious.
Let's go together, shall we?

338
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:50,930
No ambitions?

339
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:54,930
You'll stay like a frog in a well,
even if you get the chance?

340
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,850
Mother will never let me go

341
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,770
She didn't even want me to come here
although it's only 3 hours by train

342
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:14,869
l have ambitions, or l'd have stayed
there. l even had a job there

343
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,060
- What job?
- That of a priest

344
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:24,520
The family profession? You wear the
sacred thread? No Brahman's pigtail?

345
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,539
We've missed two classes today

346
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,850
We slipped up. We should have told
Pranab to answer for us at roll call

347
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,289
No problem in PNG's class

348
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,770
Have you grown taller?

349
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,399
So you're thinner

350
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:41,550
Did you get my letter?

351
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,579
l'm not speaking to you

352
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,319
You said holidays were from the 7th.
What's the date today?

353
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,319
l had some work

354
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,460
Admit you didn't want
to come to your mother

355
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,970
Apu, you'll catch cold

356
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,550
- What do they give you to eat there?
- Everything

357
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,680
Lentils, rice, fish, vegetables

358
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:37,090
- Who does the cooking?
- There's a cook

359
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,260
A good cook?

360
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,829
Better than me?

361
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,340
Next time
bring me some she'll buttons

362
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,430
Stop reading

363
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:18,949
Talk to me.
What have you seen in Calcutta?

364
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,010
- Everything
- Tell me, then

365
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:28,180
Victoria Memorial
Whiteway Laidlaw.'..

366
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,810
...Hogg Market,
the zoo, Fort William...

367
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,630
The temple at Kalighat?

368
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:44,380
Yes, l went there the other day.
And Keoratala...

369
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,479
What's in Keoratala?

370
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,920
Cremation ground

371
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,039
Do you mind
how you cross the road?

372
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:10,960
When will you pass your examinations
and get a job? Can l stay with you?

373
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,659
Who knows if l will live that long?

374
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:18,649
Rubbish

375
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,819
What if l'm seriously ill?
Such things happen

376
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,909
Every evening
l feel feverish and dizzy

377
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,539
l've no appetite at all

378
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:36,939
l've often thought of telling you,
but l haven't

379
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:44,260
When you're able to earn money,
will you arrange treatment for me?

380
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:18,220
Want paan?
Did you hear what Niru said?

381
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:25,800
You'll go, won't you?

382
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,649
- Why not? She's asked you many times
- l've classes on Monday

383
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,800
What does it matter
if you are two days late?

384
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,239
You wouldn't understand

385
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,840
You have so few holidays

386
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,529
There are no holidays
until New Year

387
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,729
You know how happy
they are to see you

388
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:28,239
There's never time for packing in the
morning. l have to run for the train

389
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:53,829
Sunrise is at quarter past six
tomorrow. Wake me in good time

390
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,079
Mother, you didn't wake me up

391
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:15,449
l'm late

392
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,060
- Won't you check everything?
- There's no time

393
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:42,960
l missed the train

394
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:48,369
l'll go tomorrow

395
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:52,739
Won't it upset your studies?

396
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,359
- Would you like something to eat?
- Later, mother

397
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,369
Dear Apu,
why don't you write regularly?

398
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,640
worry when l don't hear from you

399
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:53,010
If you have a holiday during
the Ganesh puja, come home

400
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,449
haven't seen you for two months

401
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,140
If you haven't enough money,
'I'll send you some

402
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:12,840
There are no Ganesh puja holiday
in my college, and I have exams soon

403
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:18,359
fl don't stay in Calcutta,
my studies will suffer

404
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,460
Every day l think of calling,
but l never manage it

405
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,050
Heard from Apu?

406
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,239
Is he well?

407
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,520
Your son is a gem. You should get him
married, your worries would be over

408
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,880
You're alone, and every day
l think of visiting you,

409
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,590
but there's never time

410
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:19,239
Yesterday, my son-in-law
arrived from Kalna

411
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,979
They have a shop there.
He and his father look after it

412
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:30,229
But what goings-on there are

413
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,939
Three sons, and grandchildren, too

414
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,770
The mother died, and the father
soon remarried

415
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,229
Were you asleep?
Are you feverish again?

416
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,520
What shall l do with so much?

417
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:20,369
- Won't you go indoors?
- In a while. Sit down

418
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:25,390
l can't stay now. l must go and
prepare medicine for Kumi's cough

419
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:28,520
l'll come this evening, if l can

420
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,720
Don't be cross, but we've written
to your great-uncle

421
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:38,630
Why? He's an old man

422
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:40,520
Have you written to Apu?

423
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,779
Apu has a holiday
today and tomorrow

424
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,779
Is he coming? Shall l write to him?

425
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:59,050
If he comes, he must come
because he wants to

426
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:07,810
His examinations are around the
corner. It's best if he stays there

427
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,510
You mustn't write to him

428
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,479
Promise me you won't

429
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:25,460
l'll come again,
and so will the others

430
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:31,409
- Shall l shut the door that's open?
- l'll do it later

431
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:35,140
All right, l'll leave these
on the veranda

432
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,600
l never expected to find you here

433
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,180
Didn't you say you were leaving town
for two days?

434
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,239
To your village... Mansapota?

435
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,050
l can't study there, l fall asleep

436
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,989
- Won't your mother be angry?
- No, l've fixed that

437
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:22,569
l've sent her a money order,
from the bonus Akhil-babu gave me

438
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:27,979
Aren't you nervous?

439
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,060
A little. l'm not quite ready
for the chemistry paper

440
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,029
There's a letter for you

441
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:19,449
Is it from your mother?

442
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:22,869
From Niri-di. Mother is ill

443
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:25,130
Is it serious?

444
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:01,300
Don't cry, Apu.
Parents don't stay with you forever

445
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,520
It's what had to happen

446
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,279
Now you'd better perform
the shraddha and then stay here

447
01:42:20,119 --> 01:42:22,369
You'll earn enough as a priest

448
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:58,119
Where are you off to?

449
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:08,319
- Why Calcutta?
- For my examinations

450
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:12,859
And your mother's shraddha?

451
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:15,640
l'll take care of that in Calcutta
at Kalighat
