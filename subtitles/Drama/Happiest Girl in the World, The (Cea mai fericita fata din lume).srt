Talk to him.

Why? We have a great text relationship.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,750
You know what's a better text relationship?

- What?
- Talk to him.

No!

Too complicated over there.

Lots can go wrong over
there. The only thing that

13

can go wrong over here
is if I go over there.

It's like you can't exist without these.

51

This is what I'm talking about.

58
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:13,528
Miss Myzell has clearly
suffered a tragic loss.

59
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,097
Yet she does not seem in touch
with her actual emotions.

Cellphones have been
around for, like, ever.

It'll amaze you to know
that there was a whole world

68
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,459
before you and cellphones.

69
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:48,597
And it'll amaze you to know
that I have 394 friends in here.

70
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,132
And I'm amazed that you believe that.

71
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:58,039
This is a timeline of all human existence.

72
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:02,744
Starting here is everyone who ever lived,

73
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:07,148
laughed, loved, and
understood the value of life.

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,820
The cellphone era, which
begins right around here

75
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,189
pretty much destroys all of that.

76
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,191
Way to go, you.

77
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:19,694
Sir, if I may take a different position?

78
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,830
Yeah, save me, Mr. Friar. Do I go too far?

79
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,831
Always, sir.

80
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:28,670
I understand your point, but I use my
phone to video chat my old friends

81
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:30,705
and to find out what's going on in Texas.

82
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:35,577
Yeah. How else can he keep tabs on all
the hoedowns and cattle pageants?

83
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,512
- Maya!
- It's okay, Riley.

84
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:40,048
I'm unaffected by Maya's
views of country life.

85
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,183
As my Uncle Buster always says,

86
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:45,453
"be like an eagle and soar
above the mockingbird."

87
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,788
You're the mockingbird.

88
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,923
I know.

89
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:51,526
It kills me that I can't get to you.

90
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,828
Sorry, ma'am.

91
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,964
(Angrily) Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

92
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:59,067
- Farkle time, sir?
- Oh, I love Farkle time.

93
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:05,243
With all due respect to history,
Mr. Matthews, what's important

94
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,609
to our generation will be
on this side of the timeline,

95
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,245
when Farkle and technology rule.

96
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:13,915
And I will easily be able
to make another one of you...

97
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:14,144
Ow.

98
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:14,875
And another one of you.

99
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:15,050
Ow.

100
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:20,555
Wait, so now there's
four of us and one of you?

101
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:21,990
That's awesome.

102
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,926
The future... you can't escape it.

103
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,895
I am Farkle!

104
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,900
The assignment... you can't escape it.

105
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:33,201
I am teacher!

106
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,847
Okay, so here's what
we're going to do, guys.

107
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,973
We're going to split into teams
and discover whether or not

108
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,910
new technology has made us better people.

109
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:44,079
You'll do presentations on your findings.

110
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,815
And here's a twist... no computers.

111
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:47,882
What?!

112
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,918
We're going old school.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,854
You're going to do your research
at the New York public library.

114
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:54,556
Where?!

115
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:58,693
And here's another twist because I trust
you not at all... give me your cellphones.

116
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:00,161
- No!
- Yeah.

117
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:02,297
- (All grumbling)
- Come on, hand 'em up, hand 'em up.

118
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,998
(Grumbling continues)

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,834
Thank you, thank you.

120
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:09,104
Okay, so our teams for this assignment...

121
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,640
- Maya...
- What up!

122
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:18,113
- And Riley, you will be with...
- No!

123
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,082
- No.
- (Bell ringing)

124
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,150
No!

125
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:27,155
Why did you have to come here?

126
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:28,957
Sorry I make you uneasy, sir.

127
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,960
Oh, dad, we don't even have our phones.

128
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,895
I mean, what could possibly happen?

129
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:41,603
Hey, soaring eagle, you walkin'
with us to the library tonight?

130
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,605
Sure, if that's good with you guys.

131
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:47,242
Well, seeing as how you're
Riley's partner on this assignment,

132
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,811
I guess we should find
out if it's okay with her.

133
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:51,746
Riley?

134
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:58,386
Riley, any thoughts on this that might
come out of your mouth in word form?

135
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:00,889
No, because you don't
have your phone anymore,

136
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,259
so what are you going to
do to communicate? I wonder.

137
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,362
Oh, look at that.

138
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,863
Two thumbs up from Riley.

139
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,800
And a smiley face.

140
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,942
It was a good day.

141
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:24,112
And then my friends treated me nicely.

142
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:27,215
And then my teacher measured
us and then I'm growing.

143
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:30,985
And then Jenny Lewis loves me...

144
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,255
I think because I'm growing.

145
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,325
It wasn't a good day.

146
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,828
And then my friend pulled my hair out.

147
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,734
And then my teacher took my phone away
and then my teacher was also my father.

148
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,338
At least you're growing.

149
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Topanga: Honey, please don't come apart.

150
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:56,010
Look at this as a beautiful opportunity
to spend time with your family.

151
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,783
Hello, Riley.

152
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:02,555
How you doin'?

153
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:05,220
Want to hear about my
day? It was a good day.

154
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:06,688
Mom!

155
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,790
Forgive her, Auggie.
She misses her telephone.

156
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,325
Well, then she can have mine.

157
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,228
(Play phone beeps) The cow goes...

158
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,263
"Moo!"

159
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:18,066
I'm not gonna make it.

160
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,334
That's what your father thinks.

161
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,869
She can't.

162
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,525
Honey, please don't make your father right.

163
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,736
It's no good for any of us
when your father is right.

164
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:26,975
She's right.

165
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,945
Why are you really doing this?

166
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:34,916
Because I want you and your
friends to become human beings.

167
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,918
And I believe that by doing this,

168
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,953
you guys can learn to
become real human beings.

169
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,789
- (Buzzes)
- Hey, losers, it's Maya.

170
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,391
Except her.

171
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:47,028
You know what? I am going to do this.

172
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:53,034
I can get through this whole thing
without making a text or a call.

173
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,270
- (Buzzes)
- Come on up.

174
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,105
Of course you can, sweetheart.

175
00:08:57,107 --> 00:09:00,241
And you know what? You're
already a wonderful human being.

176
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:03,665
But every so often, little tests
like this are gonna come up.

177
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,112
Why?

178
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:07,749
Because it's your father's
job to give you little tests.

179
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:11,452
And maybe along the way, you guys are going
to learn a little bit more about yourselves.

180
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:12,040
(Door opens)

181
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:16,124
Maya: Yeah, like I've learned that I'm
actually really okay with all of this.

182
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,003
You don't miss your phone?

183
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,127
I was the only one in class
without a smart phone anyway.

184
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,029
And now I kind of feel
like everybody's even.

185
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,997
- (Door buzzing)
- Farkle.

186
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,265
Be ready in a minute.

187
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,400
- (Buzzing)
- And Lucas.

188
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,101
Ready now!

189
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,473
Did you see that?

190
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,142
You know what that was?

191
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,511
That was boys. Too soon for boys.

192
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,446
Not ready for boys. I don't want boys.

193
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,381
We just gonna accept boys?

194
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:44,218
It happened, she's gone. She was nice,
we had fun, but we still have him.

195
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,054
- You want to color?
- Color!

196
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:49,023
Of course you do. Let's color
for the rest of our lives.

197
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,715
Will I be getting a
real cellphone someday?

198
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:57,498
Someday.

199
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,335
Dominic Falcone has a real cellphone.

200
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:05,006
Would you rather have a real cellphone
or would you rather color with us?

201
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,341
Color with you.

202
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,078
Does that get me a cellphone?

203
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,847
Not too much longer with this one either.

204
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,215
Well, you'll always have me.

205
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:15,950
(Inhales sharply) Yeah.

206
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,895
What is this place?

207
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:31,033
This is where the ancients
stored all of their wisdom.

208
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,035
- Look at all of those...
- Books.

209
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,604
Both: Books.

210
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,072
Look.

211
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:39,408
(Blows)

212
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,077
"Tales of human interaction."

213
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,912
We'll take it. Thanks, quickdraw.

214
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:46,281
Farkle, do whatever you do with that.

215
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,983
You mean read?

216
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,618
- "Chapter one..."
- Oh, I'm bored out of my mind.

217
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,053
Let's go to a movie.

218
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:53,689
- Shh!
- All: Ah!

219
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:56,458
There's one of those ancients now.

220
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,065
Oh, wondrous gatekeeper of the knowledge,

221
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,334
we are travelers from
another time and place.

222
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:08,203
Seventh grade middle school.

223
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,975
We wish to partake of this information
from your great hall of wisdom.

224
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,477
- Do you rent phones?
- Shh!

225
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,479
- There's no one here but us.
- Why do we have to shush?

226
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,047
Let me handle this, Maya.

227
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,416
She obviously likes it quiet.

228
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,354
Hello, book lady.

229
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,390
Well, hello.

230
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,025
And who might you be?

231
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,960
I might be Farkle.

232
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,263
Would you do me a favor, Farkle?

233
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:36,965
Oh, you know I will.

234
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:43,005
Why don't you go over there and... shh!

235
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,339
Well, that's disappointing.

236
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,747
So...

237
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:54,116
Yeah.

238
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:57,219
Uh-huh.

239
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,521
This chapter is called
"disconnect to connect."

240
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:02,991
"Not until we put down our
phones, switch off our computers

241
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:06,361
and look in each other's eyes will we
be able to touch each other's hearts."

242
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,564
Yeah, like that's going to work on anybody.

243
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:21,143
People used to need places like this.

244
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,745
Now we can hold everything that's here in
a little device we can put in our pockets.

245
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,547
I don't even need to look out this window

246
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,683
to know what phase the moon
is in or where the stars are.

247
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,585
Yeah, well, I don't have a phone like that.

248
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,386
I just have the actual sky.

249
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,255
Oh, I'm so sorry for you.

250
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:34,790
You're at a real disadvantage.

251
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,758
That can be the basis of
our presentation, okay?

252
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,227
Want to read back the notes?

253
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,395
- What notes?
- You weren't taking notes?

254
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:42,197
- No.
- You know, why bother?

255
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,399
Without a computer, all we
have is a pencil and a pad.

256
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:46,735
What could we possibly do with that?

257
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:52,474
Maya, I had no idea.

258
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,546
Yeah, neither did I.

259
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:03,652
My dad thinks that we have no
idea how to talk to each other.

260
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,287
What if he's right?

261
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:06,388
Shh!

262
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,290
But we're not saying anything.

263
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,758
I know.

264
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Then why are you shushing us?

265
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,228
Because I can't take it anymore.

266
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,430
You guys are hopeless.

267
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:16,798
Come here.

268
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:23,405
Couple of sweet kids like you and you
sit there like a couple of lumps.

269
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:27,843
You're a disgrace to every
single story on these shelves.

270
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:31,713
- Okay, so what do I say to him?
- Look around.

271
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,750
Nothing here but books about boys and girls

272
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:37,252
and men and women and what
they say to each other.

273
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:41,089
Open any one of them and
you... no, not that one.

274
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,091
Oh, boy, not that one!

275
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:48,130
Look, all these books
have one thing in common.

276
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,000
What's that?

277
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,100
You start on page one,
and each page you turn

278
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:53,669
brings you deeper into the story.

279
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,304
- What's your name?
- Riley.

280
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,639
- What's his name?
- Lucas.

281
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,341
You like a good story, Riley?

282
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:01,576
Then start at the beginning.

283
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:11,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

284
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,462
"Because it's not until you
really looked at each other

285
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:24,166
and made a human connection that you
can even begin to know each other."

286
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,901
- Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
- No. No.

287
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,769
- Look in my eyes.
- No!

288
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:32,708
I guess the thing I miss most about
Texas are the pets I used to have.

289
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,310
I had a hamster.

290
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:37,145
I had 24 horses.

291
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:39,214
You win.

292
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,817
Tell me about them.

293
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,153
One day after school, Sofia was foaling.

294
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:48,623
That means she was giving birth, right?

295
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,292
Not too bad, city girl.

296
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,560
(Laughs)

297
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:57,295
And there was no one there, so I called
Dr. Galendo and he talked me through it.

298
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,302
Anyway, that was all.

299
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:02,904
More.

300
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:07,776
Did you know that a baby horse stands
in the first hour after it's born?

301
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:08,910
Really?

302
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:10,912
I'd liked to have been there for that.

303
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:15,250
The coolest thing I've ever
seen and I was a part of it.

304
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,688
- Riley.
- Lucas.

305
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,290
I've never told this to anybody before.

306
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,293
Yeah?

307
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,896
I think someday I might
like to be a veterinarian.

308
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,866
That's cool too.

309
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,201
I delivered this beautiful palomino.

310
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:36,938
I'd show you her picture,
but I don't have my phone.

311
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,708
That's okay. Just... (Sighs)

312
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,276
Keep talking.

313
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,884
"There is no connection
you can make with any screen

314
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:52,988
that compares to the moment you
understand only human beings have souls."

315
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,624
(No discernable dialog)

316
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,792
- I have a soul.
- No.

317
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,993
- I do! I do!
- No.

318
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:00,028
No.

319
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,934
- I colored a new picture.
- Stay like this forever.

320
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,503
Would you please? That'd be great.

321
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,906
The picture's over there.

322
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,378
Mommy, daddy, Auggie, and no Riley.

323
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,747
Uh, Auggie, I don't know if you...

324
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:23,385
It's beautiful! I think that's what
you're supposed to do. I have no idea.

325
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,487
And look at the 'frigerator.

326
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:26,721
The new one?

327
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,892
That's our trip to the Jersey shore.

328
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:33,361
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.

329
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,430
I think that's what you're supposed to do.

330
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,376
How was your night, Riley?

331
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:51,847
Thank you for sending us to the library.

332
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,682
Really?

333
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:57,018
Yes. Lucas and I did really
well on the assignment.

334
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,955
I think that we connected.

335
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:01,823
What do you mean, connected?
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:03,959
How did you connect?

337
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:06,962
We talked about stuff
that was important to us...

338
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,997
Too important to text.

339
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:14,903
Did you know that when you listen
to someone, they'll tell you stuff?

340
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,609
Oh, boy.

341
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:25,647
Friends talk to each other,
but real friends listen.

342
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:30,852
Maya knows how to draw and I
know how to be a real friend.

343
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,822
You're a good teacher, dad.

344
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:37,092
You can keep my phone as long as you want.

345
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:48,003
- Congratulations, Cory.
- What did I do?

346
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:50,405
You just taught our daughter how to feel.

347
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,374
- I did that?
- You did.

348
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,909
I didn't mean to do that.

349
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:54,843
Well, you did.

350
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,077
She has feelings now?

351
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,812
- Mm-hmm.
- How many?

352
00:17:57,814 --> 00:17:59,881
- All of them.
- Well, put them back.

353
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:01,016
We can't do that.

354
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,784
I have a way.

355
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,520
- There's no way.
- I have a way.

356
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,923
Here you go... take
your phone. Take it now.

357
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,891
Very good. Here's your phone.

358
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,561
Good, great, nobody talks to nobody.

359
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:14,829
No more feelings. Thank you.

360
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,934
Okay, guys, the great technology debate.

361
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,135
Let's boot it up!

362
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,575
I have always believed
technology would help us

363
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:28,643
fulfill our potential as a species.

364
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:33,148
And when Farkle does rule the world, no
matter what devices we come up with,

365
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,450
we should also never forget
what we can do with a pencil,

366
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:39,521
a piece of paper and our own imaginations.

367
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,860
I've been keeping this in my
pocket where my phone used to be.

368
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:48,430
I keep looking at it.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,934
I'm fine.

370
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,102
Thanks, Farkle.

371
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,971
- Look in my eyes.
- No.

372
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,575
I thought my whole life was in my phone,

373
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:04,546
but it turns out that I don't
really have any friends in here.

374
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:08,083
And you don't need your phone to
connect with your real friends.

375
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,486
Allow us to demonstrate.

376
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:15,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

377
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:21,963
<i>♪ I'm singing "go-o-o" ♪</i>

378
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:31,006
Maya: I'm not that tall.

379
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,143
Really?

380
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,982
How you doin'?

381
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:44,085
You will keep an eye on Riley at all times.

382
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:45,854
You will send me message alerts.

383
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,155
You will send me pictures.

384
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:49,157
You're really scared, aren't you?

385
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,459
I'm a father.

386
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,695
Yeah. They're just friends.

387
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:56,097
Believe me, I know the story.

388
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,200
But you're forgetting, I
don't have the technology.

389
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:02,137
Now you do.

390
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,948
You got me a phone?

391
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,085
My motives are completely selfish.

392
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:19,587
I'm not sure they are, Mr. Matthews.

393
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,190
Well, I also got you these.

394
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,995
- Colored pencils?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:30,131
You let me know everything
that's going on with Riley.

396
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:34,669
And if something beautiful ever
happens, paint me a picture.
