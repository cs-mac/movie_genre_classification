Well. Regionally.

I think he moved to Skokie.

203

This new mechanic is so awkward.

Is that shirt ripped?

Leave it on the table
in the hallway.

345
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,344
Are you having fun?

346
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,720
Fun?

347
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:47,307
There's no point
if you're not having fun.

348
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,309
Yeah. I guess so.

349
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,769
You guess so.

350
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,315
Are you on medication?

351
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,817
Tranquilizers?

352
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,110
Anything?

353
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,737
No. No. Sir.

354
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,407
Did I ask you
if they gave you shock?

355
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,950
Yeah.

356
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,577
Yeah what?

357
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,453
Yeah. You asked me.

358
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,955
Yeah. They did.

359
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,126
Don't look at us. Lazenby.

360
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,128
Get in the water!

361
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,344
I'm no doctor. Jarrett.

362
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:28,182
I wouldn't let them
put electricity in my head.

363
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,186
He drives me nuts!

364
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,980
Everybody drives you nuts.

365
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,193
Don and Fenetch looked good.

366
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,111
They looked very good.

367
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,114
Is he giving you a hard time?

368
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,116
Want a clarinet?

369
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,118
Van Buren wants a clarinet.

370
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,661
Who's selling it?

371
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,663
My brother.
He needs a motorcycle.

372
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,166
You stand behind me
in the choir.

373
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,835
Oh. I do?
Is that you?

374
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,296
You have a lot of energy.

375
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,380
I do?

376
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,174
I mean. That's good.

377
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,218
My name's Jeannine Pratt.

378
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,677
Nice. Hi.

379
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,221
You're Conrad Jarrett.

380
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,388
Right.

381
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,184
Yeah. Um. Bye.

382
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,685
Bye-bye.

383
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,689
"You've got a lot of energy."

384
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,694
[Children]
Trick or treat!

385
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,198
You're the scariest
ghost I've ever seen!

386
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,741
You look wonderful.

387
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,743
Thank you.

388
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,744
There you go.

389
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,204
Be careful.

390
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,206
Thank you.
Good-bye.

391
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,709
The Cabots.
Julie's first time.

392
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,711
She's so cute!

393
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,132
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

394
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:47,386
Know what I've been thinking?

395
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,388
That Christmas in London...

396
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:52,933
would be like something
out of Dickens.

397
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:55,394
We've never done that before.

398
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,940
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

399
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,942
We talked about it.

400
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,944
We decided on that.

401
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,904
Yeah. I know that.

402
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,907
But the timing
doesn't seem right.

403
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,910
We've always gone away
at Christmas.

404
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,663
It'd be good for him. Too.

405
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,165
Let's get back to normal.

406
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,918
He's just started
with this doctor.

407
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,920
He'll miss three weeks.

408
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,463
Why interrupt it?

409
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,425
Because I want to get away.

410
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,428
I think we should.
It's important.

411
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,974
Not if he doesn't
go through with this now.

412
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,435
He might change his mind.

413
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,979
If he changes his mind...

414
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,190
it wasn't right for him.

415
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,567
Does he want to go?

416
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,570
He doesn't know what he wants.

417
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,532
Ahh!

418
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,284
Don't do that!

419
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,785
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,788
I didn't think you were here.

421
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,790
I just got in.

422
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,792
No golf today.
Too cold.

423
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,294
How was golf?

424
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,795
I didn't play.

425
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,297
It's colder today.

426
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,800
I mean. For the year.
It's colder.

427
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,428
Weren't you swimming?

428
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,931
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.

429
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,432
How'd it go?

430
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,434
Good. I swam well.

431
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,435
Good.

432
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,980
I could swim the 50 if my...

433
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,982
my timing got better.

434
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,984
I'm a little off.

435
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,445
You must work at that.

436
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,446
Yeah.

437
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,575
I got 74 on a Trig quiz.

438
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,077
74?

439
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,080
Gee. I was awful at Trig.

440
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,623
Oh. Yeah? Did you...

441
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,834
You took Trig?

442
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,754
Wait a minute.

443
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,716
Did I take Trig?

444
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:02,099
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

445
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,688
Who'll be there?

446
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,817
Well. The Murrays.
The Gunthers. And the Caines.

447
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,653
Let's go to the movies instead.

448
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,406
Don't be negative.

449
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,825
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

450
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,202
Let's go to the movies.

451
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,704
Okay.

452
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,289
Really?

453
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,125
Okay. Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

454
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,626
What's our excuse?

455
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:34,464
Beth wanted to go
to the movies.

456
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,632
Good.

457
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,259
Very good.

458
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,766
All right now. Smile.

459
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,686
Remember. Not too many martinis.

460
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:55,777
Will you put that
with the others?

461
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,779
Look. We're in time.

462
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,281
Look who's here!

463
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,285
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

464
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,745
Come on in.

465
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,289
Happy birthday!
You look wonderful.

466
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,790
Is that new?

467
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,793
Yes. It is.
Do you like it?

468
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,213
You did the mousse?

469
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,589
It turned out well?

470
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,217
Hey. Partner.
How are you?

471
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,968
Hi there.

472
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,929
Hi. Beth.

473
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,514
Good to see you.

474
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,932
Borrow the money.

475
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,433
I'll go public.

476
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:30,604
I wouldn't do it now
because the market's low.

477
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,439
Your hair looks wonderful.

478
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:35,025
It's shorter. You like it?

479
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,737
I said.
"Please put out your cigar."

480
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,616
He says. "Huh?
I don't have another one."

481
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:46,203
Good to see you!

482
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,580
You look beautiful. As ever.

483
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,040
In school...

484
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:55,254
they think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

485
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,422
What are these hushed tones?

486
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,508
He told the funniest joke!

487
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,221
I'm not talking to you.

488
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:05,556
Why?

489
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,309
I have my fingers crossed
on this merger.

490
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,561
Let's have lunch.

491
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,938
I don't know my schedule.

492
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,232
I'm free most days.

493
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,943
Bob McLean's leaving
Coles and Johnson.

494
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,945
Where is he going?

495
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,947
He doesn't know.

496
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,240
Jesus.

497
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,825
No. You didn't.

498
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,203
Isn't he the meanest man
you've met?

499
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,581
When a ball is in play.

500
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:34,585
If a player or caddy
accidentally move it...

501
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,795
#Jolly good fellow #

502
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,339
# For he's a jolly good fellow ##

503
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,595
# Won't regret. Can't forget #

504
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:47,014
# What we did #

505
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,600
# For #

506
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:54,438
# Love ##

507
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,278
Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to?

508
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,821
Oh. Who knows?

509
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,656
How's Conrad doing?

510
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,658
He's great. Just great.

511
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:10,913
I asked Donald.
He says they haven't talked much.

512
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,624
I said maybe he's self-conscious.

513
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,625
Oh!

514
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,631
No. No. No.

515
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,633
No. He's...

516
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:26,261
There's a doctor
in Highland Park...

517
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:28,639
that he sees twice a week.

518
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,016
He's great. Just great.

519
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:34,228
Is he still having some problems?

520
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:36,146
No. Nothing like that.

521
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,690
Just somebody to talk to...

522
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,068
to polish off the rough edges.

523
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,736
How are you. Darling?

524
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,239
Is he falling asleep on you?

525
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,032
Nah. He's great.

526
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,118
[Mimicking "Mr. Wonderful"]
# Mr. Great. That's me #

527
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,124
Hey.

528
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,920
You drank too much.

529
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,463
I'm not drunk.

530
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:05,092
Why did you tell Annie
about Conrad's psychiatrist?

531
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,593
Why not?

532
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,763
People don't hear
that thing easily.

533
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:13,267
For most people.
It's a status symbol.

534
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,769
Well. Your blurting it out...

535
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,771
was a violation of privacy.

536
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,273
Whose privacy?

537
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,149
The family's privacy!

538
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,152
I think it is
a very private matter.

539
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,204
I tell you my dreams?

540
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,665
I don't believe in dreams.

541
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:40,210
What kind of
a psychiatrist are you?

542
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,671
What's happening?

543
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,132
What's going on?

544
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,134
I just feel...

545
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,219
I feel so...

546
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,264
What?

547
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,141
Jumpy. I don't know.

548
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,684
Look. Kiddo...

549
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,312
I lied.

550
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:01,356
I believe in dreams.

551
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,360
Sometimes I want to know
what's happening when you're awake.

552
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,779
Something's making you nervous.

553
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,282
Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

554
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,450
Tranquilizer?

555
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,827
What do you think?

556
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:17,372
You look like something
out of The Body Snatchers.

557
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:20,667
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer.

558
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,254
What is this?

559
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,048
A clock.

560
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:29,551
You can tell the time.
But I can't.

561
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,721
So you know when
the hour's up?

562
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,097
Right.

563
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,766
50. 55 minutes?

564
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,278
Maybe I don't want
to swim anymore.

565
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,822
My timing is for shit.

566
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,326
Two guys better than me
swim the 50.

567
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:57,329
They're a bunch of boring jocks.

568
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,374
And him...
I can't stand him.

569
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,167
Thought about quitting?

570
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,252
You telling me to?

571
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,837
Nope.

572
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,047
It wouldn't look good.

573
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,465
How does it feel?

574
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,512
How does it feel?

575
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:16,014
Yes.
How does it feel?

576
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,270
It's the same damn thing
I did last year.

577
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:24,064
Are you the same
person now?

578
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:27,234
That's why you need
a tranquilizer?

579
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,360
You're a doctor.

580
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,738
I'm supposed to
feel better. Right?

581
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,282
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,208
Is it getting any easier
with your friends?

583
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,335
No. It's still hard.

584
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,337
Is anyplace easy?

585
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,551
The hospital was.

586
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,428
It was? Why?

587
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,808
Because nobody
hid anything there.

588
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:03,520
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

589
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:04,688
Uh-huh.

590
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,191
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?

591
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,734
Uh-huh.

592
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,326
Whoa!

593
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,911
Hi.

594
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:19,912
Karen!

595
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,455
How are you?

596
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,623
Good.

597
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,082
Sit down. Please.

598
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,210
Thank you.

599
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,633
Wow.

600
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,491
When did you get back?

601
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,493
The end of August.

602
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:00,494
Good.

603
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,496
It's great to see you.

604
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,540
Oh. You. Too.

605
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:08,001
Listen. I've got a meeting
over at the school.

606
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,545
Drama Club meeting.

607
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:12,005
We're doing
A Thousand Clowns.

608
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,507
You know it?

609
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:17,219
Anyway. We're going crazy
getting it together.

610
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,513
Don't let me hang you up.

611
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:23,225
No. I wanted to see you.

612
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:26,228
I didn't know what to expect.

613
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:29,231
You sounded funny on the phone.

614
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,234
It was just a gray day.

615
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,320
Everything's great.
I'm on the swim team.

616
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:36,989
Oh. You're swimming?

617
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,074
Terrific. Conrad.

618
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:40,701
That's really wonderful.

619
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,161
I could be benched all year.

620
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,581
You'll do great.

621
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:49,960
I'll bet your folks
are real proud of you.

622
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:50,961
Yeah.

623
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,338
What can I get you?

624
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:54,798
Are you hungry?

625
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,341
Just a coke.

626
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,760
Two cokes. Please.

627
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,596
Did we offend him?

628
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,805
Something I said?

629
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,059
A low self-image day.

630
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,646
So. Uh...

631
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,023
- Are you...
- What did...

632
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,029
I can't believe
how beautiful you look.

633
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,448
You really look beautiful.

634
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,783
So do you.

635
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,493
Do you miss it?

636
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,745
Miss what?

637
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:25,954
The hospital.

638
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,040
No.

639
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,791
Thank you.

640
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,585
You don't miss it?

641
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:32,794
No.

642
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:35,589
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

643
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,303
Are you seeing a doctor?

644
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:44,264
Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?

645
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,434
Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.

646
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,937
I went for a while.

647
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,939
It didn't work.

648
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,442
He told me the things
I already knew.

649
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:56,944
Finally. I decided...

650
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:00,072
the only one who
can help me is myself.

651
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,911
At least. That's what
my dad says.

652
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,622
If it's something
you want to do.

653
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:11,458
That's what you
should be doing.

654
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:15,295
I don't know
how long I'll keep it up.

655
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,883
Your hair grew in.

656
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:24,304
Oh. That was such
a dumb thing to do.

657
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:25,973
I like it.

658
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,474
You do?

659
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:28,976
Yeah.

660
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,480
I don't know.
I just...

661
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,482
I miss it sometimes.

662
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:36,984
The hospital.

663
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,735
I really do.

664
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:43,574
Things have to change. You know?

665
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,826
But that's where we laughed.

666
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,245
But that was a hospital.

667
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:51,790
This is the real world.

668
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,709
I guess you're right.

669
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,468
I really have to go.

670
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:04,803
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:08,265
I have a meeting at the school.

672
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,767
We're doing A Thousand Clowns.

673
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,769
You told me.

674
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,398
Did I?

675
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,775
Yeah.

676
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,235
I better hurry.

677
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,779
Don't want to be late.

678
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,451
Thanks for seeing me.

679
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,746
Conrad?

680
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:34,374
Let's have a great Christmas.

681
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,795
Okay?

682

a great year.

Let's have the best year
of our lives.

685
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,683
This could be
the best year ever.

Will you call me?

690
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,027
Yeah.

691
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,529
You mean it?

692
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:04,530
Yep.

693
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,534

700
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,839
It's cold.

701
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,343
You should put that on.

702
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,304
Do you want a sweater?

703
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:11,722
Do I need one?

704
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,855

705
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,356
Nothing.

707
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,653
About what?

708
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,155
Not about anything.

709
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:35,162
Your hair is starting to grow out.

710
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,164
It's looking... looking better.

711
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,964
I was thinking
about the pigeon...

712
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,425
that hung around the garage.

713
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:53,305
How it used to get
on top of your car.

714
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,848
Oh. Yeah.
I remember.

715
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,436
I remember
how scared I got...

716
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,438
That wsssshhhhh!
Flap. Flap. Flap...

717
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,441
Every time I started the car.

718
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:09,655
That was the closest
we came to having a pet.

719
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:14,117
Buck tried to talk you
into getting a dog.

720
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:18,664
He said. "If it's the size
of a football?"

721
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,625
You know.
That animal next door...

722
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,710
that Pepper or Pippin...

723
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,546
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.

724
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,422
He's not friendly...

725
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,967
whatever Mr. McGreary says.

726
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:32,135
He wanted the retriever.

727
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,055
Each time that dog comes here.
I try to get him out.

728
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,265
Arf!

729
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,850
Arf! Arf!

730
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:44,690
Put that on
if you're staying out here.

731
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,856
Can I help?

732
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:27,357
With this?

733
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,526
No.

734
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:30,611
I will.

735
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:33,447
You can go to your room...

736
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,407
and clean the closet.

737
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,367
Mom.

738
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,453
Okay?

739
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,289
Because it's really a mess.

Oh. Hi.

745
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,142
I didn't get there.

No. I'm not doing anything.

Mary Ann Ramon started
just to scream. Right?

752
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,870
We got so drunk.
We couldn't talk.

753
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:25,165
It was the last day of school.

No. Stop!

00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,972
We just don't connect.

That I jack off a lot.

763
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:02,452
So what else is new?

00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:03,912
Does it help?

He didn't
know what to say.

773
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,948
He put his
arm around me.

774
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:42,910
We just sat there.

775
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,912
I remember watching his shoe.
And thinking...

776
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:51,418
His shoe was turned
over on its side.

777
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:55,797
I was thinking. He's so uptight!
It's gonna crack off.

778
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,136
I knew I should've
felt something.

I didn't know what to feel.

On TV. They say stuff
like. "Oh. No!"

781
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,438
But I didn't say that...

782
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:14,441
because I didn't feel sad...

783

so much as...

So much as what?

00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,953
I kept thinking John-Boy
would've said something...

about how he felt.

787

does the hiring.

I don't know
what else to do.

853
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:33,992
I'm not asking for anything.

854
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:35,536
You're kidding me.

855
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,996
I don't get it.

856
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,998
You're excused from practice...

857
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,917
to see some shrink;

858
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,462
I work with you
at your convenience.

859
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,840
What more should I do?

860
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:49,967
Nothing.

861
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,845
A bright kid like you.

862
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,888
I don't get it.

863
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:57,933
Why keep messing up your life?

864
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:01,270
I don't think that
quitting swimming...

865
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,897
will mess up my life.

866
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,904
Okay.

867
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:14,157
Okay. Now. This is it.

868
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,325
Yeah.

869
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,202
You're a big kid.

870
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:19,162
Actions have consequences.

871
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,373
I'm not taking you back.

872
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:22,833
I won't ask you to.

873
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,928
[Laughing]

874
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:47,983
What happened?
You all right?

875
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,318
Yeah.

876
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,944
You quit the swim team.

877
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,446
Yeah.

878
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:53,947
Why?

879
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,449
It was a bore.

880
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:58,452
That's no reason!

881
00:51:58,535 --> 00:51:59,953
What's going on?

882
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:01,455
Nothing.

883
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:02,956
Talk to me.

884
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,958
Swimming's a bore. That's all.

885
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:05,959
I talked to...

886
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,794
Quit talking to people!

887
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:09,463
Okay?

888
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,465
Holy shit.

889
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:13,467
Yeah. Sure.

890
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:15,469
Fuck you. Jarrett.

891
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,471
Ooh! Ohh!

892
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:18,972
Shut up.

893
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,475
Leave it alone.

894
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:24,478
I told you. The guy's a flake.

895
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,402
- What did your dad say?
- I haven't told him.

896
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,029
How come?

897
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,198
The timing isn't right.

898
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,824
He sweats everything.

899
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,993
He'll just get worried.

900
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,995
Can you tell your mother?

901
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,455
My mother?

902
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,916
I told you we don't connect.

903
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,461
What do people have
in common with mothers anyway?

904
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:50,921
It's all surface junk.

905
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,464
You know?

906
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,424
"Clean your room.
Brush your teeth...

907
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:56,051
get good grades."

908
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,472
I'm not feeling anything today.

909
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,099
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,725
No. Sorry's out.

911
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:05,894
Something's on your mind.

912
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,437
What time is it?

913
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:08,981
Never mind. There's time.

914
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:12,359
Remember the contract?
Control?

915
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,486
Maybe there's some connection...

916
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,739
between control
and lack of feeling.

917
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:19,741
I said I feel things.

918
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:20,951
When?

919
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:22,494
Come on.

920
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,497
When?

921
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,207
Sometimes. I don't know.

922
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:30,961
I thought you didn't
like fooling around.

923
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,754
What do you want?

924
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,591
Don't say. "I don't know."

925
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,177
Should I make up answers?

926
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:41,305
Make one up about
there's no feelings there.

927
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,806
I have feelings.

928
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,391
Get it together. Jarrett.

929
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,644
You're trying to make me mad.

930
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:49,146
Are you mad?

931
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,939
No!

932
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,941
You don't like being pushed.

933
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,443
Do something about it!

934
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,444
What?

935
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:57,446
No. I can't do this.

936
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,198
Why not?

937
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,949
Getting mad takes too much energy.

938
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:03,452
It takes more holding it back.

939
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:06,955
When I let myself feel.
I feel lousy.

940
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,000
# I never promised you
a rose garden #

941
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,335
Fuck you. Berger.

942
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:12,836
Fuck you.

943
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,837
Yeah?

944
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,589
That's it.

945
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,592
What do you feel?
Do you jack off?

946
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,636
What do you think?

947
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,971
You married a fat lady...

948
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,474
and you fuck
the daylights out of her!

949
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:27,142
Sounds good to me.

950
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,075
Little advice
about feeling...

951
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,619
Don't expect it always to tickle.

952
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:51,291
Do you know how
to aim that?

953
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,086
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

954
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:55,629
Be quiet.

955
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,673
Is it in focus?

956
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:59,675
Smile. Smile.
Okay. Good.

957
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:03,762
I want to take
the three young ones.

958
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:06,306
Dad. Get out of there.

959
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,683
All right.

960
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,184
Connie.

961
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,769
Be quiet.

962
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,771
Conrad. Where are you?

963
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,315
Between your mother and father.

964
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:18,360
You're taller than
your mother is!

965
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,821
Will you be quiet?

966
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:22,239
This is beautiful.

967
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:23,949
Shut up.

968
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,492
Wonderful.

969
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:27,536
Now Cal and Beth.

970
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:28,579
Sure.

971
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,497
Go on.

972
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:33,667
You can do better than that.

973
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,962
I want one of Connie and Beth.

974
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,507
Let's get the three men in there.

975
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:43,093
Move closer to your mother.

976
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:44,136
Prize winner.

977
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,971
Yeah. That's great.

978
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:47,389
Do it.

979
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:48,932
Isn't it marvelous?

980
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,392
Yes. It is.

981
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:52,394
It isn't cocked.

982
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:53,854
Calvin.

983
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,106
Hold it. Connie. Smile.

984
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,025
Calvin!

985
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,234
Smile.

986
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:01,403
Give me the camera.

987
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:02,988
Give me the camera.

988
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,241
I want a really good picture.

989
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:09,661
I want a shot of you three men.

990
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,664
Not until I get you two.

991
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:15,459
Give her
the goddamn camera!

992
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,852
Smile.

993
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:40,817
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

994
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,241
[Crash]

995
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:55,207
Beth!

996
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,293
It can be saved.

997
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,966
That was so dumb.

998
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:11,139
I don't think
he's happy in school.

999
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:16,228
Have you talked to his teachers?

1000
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,356
People don't want
to be with him.

1001
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:20,941
He provokes people.

1002
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,485
Well. It's an awkward age.

1003
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:24,987
Thank you.

1004
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,615
Maybe he needs a change.

1005
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:30,701
Is he eating enough?

1006
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,619
Yes. Mother.

1007
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,663
He'll be all right.

1008
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:37,165
If you're firm with him.

1009
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:41,170
I think he should
go away to school.

1010
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:43,672
I can't deal with him.

1011
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:45,883
Who'd make that decision?

1012
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:50,179
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.

1013
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:52,389
What sort of doctor...

1014
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,808
would make that decision for you?

1015
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,310
A psychiatrist.

1016
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,812
I thought that was finished.

1017
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,397
No.

1018
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,399
What's his name?

1019
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:04,401
Berger.

1020
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:06,403
Jewish doctor?

1021
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:08,447
I suppose he's Jewish.

1022
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:10,908
Maybe just German.

1023
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,911
What does Cal say
about all this?

1024
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:17,456
This can be saved.

1025
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:20,209
It's a nice clean break.

1026
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,504
# Amen. Amen. Alleluia #

1027
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:26,089
# Amen #

1028
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:33,347
# Amen ##

1029
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,890
Okay.

1030
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:38,393
That last "E" natural
could be higher.

1031
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:41,355
Officers. Don't forget
your meeting tonight.

1032
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,570
# Mmm mm mmm #

1033
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:50,614
# Mmm mm mmm #

1034
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,407
# Mmm mmm #

1035
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:54,243
# Mmm mm mmm #

1036
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,043
Hi. Jeannine.

1037
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,587
You're really a terrific tenor.

1038
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:09,174
In fact. You should be
doing the solo.

1039
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,218
No. L...

1040
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:12,761
No. I'm serious.

1041
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,304
You sing well.

1042
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:17,349
I'm getting to know your voice.

1043
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:20,936
How can you hear me
if you're singing?

1044
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,479
Well...

1045
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,481
I don't always sing.

1046
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,567
Sometimes I just listen.

1047
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:30,654
For instance. Marcia Blair
can't sing a note.

1048
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:34,700
Janet Fox mouths the words
and never sings.

1049
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,285
A detective.

1050
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:37,870
[Jeannine]
Do you like Vivaldi?

1051
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:40,372
Telemann?

1052
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,040
[Conrad]
Telemann? Um...

1053
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:45,127
What kind of music do you like?

1054
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:46,545
Oh. Uh...

1055
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,590
Modern jazz. I like.

1056
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,135
Folk rock. Spoon on a glass.

1057
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:56,221
Spoon on a glass?

1058
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:04,646
Oh. You mean.
Like. Table spoons?

1059
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,733
Oh. Dear.

1060
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,779
Why do I ask dumb questions?

1061
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:14,823
I'm just showing off.

1062
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,914
Why is it so hard...

1063
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:24,917
the first time you talk
to somebody?

1064
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,919
You make it look easy.

1065
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,089
Really?

1066
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:36,929
That's my bus.
I got to go.

1067
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,972
I'll see you later!

1068
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,935
You're really a terrific tenor.

1069
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,772
# Ah. You're
just saying that #

1070
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,450
# Alleluia #

1071
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,704
# Alleluia #

1072
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,665
# Alleluia #

1073
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,708
# Alleluia #

01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,086
# Ah ha ha ha

1075
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:13,298
# Ha ha ha ha

1076
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,175
# Alleluia. Alleluia #

1077
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:16,885
# Alleluia #

01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,096

# Alleluia ##

1083
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:44,872
Hello.

1084
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,415
Is Karen there?

1085
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:47,916
Who's calling?

1086
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,961
A friend of hers from Hillsboro.

1087
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,671
Oh.

1088
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:55,716
She's not home from school yet.

1089
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,384
Oh. Um...

1090
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,970
Hmm. Tell her I called.

1091
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,471
This is Conrad.

1092
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:04,057
Tell her I'm feeling great...

1093
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:07,102
and I wanted to talk to her.

1094
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:08,604
Yes. I will.

1095
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:09,688
Thank you.

1096
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,315
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1097
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:56,527
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1098
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:08,163
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1099
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:09,915
Conrad.

1100
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,333
Conrad?

1101
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,210
What a dumb name.

1102
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:17,047
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Bill.

1103
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,382
Uuuuugh!

1104
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:25,013
Hello.

1105
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,474
Hello. This is...

1106
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,476
Hello. This is Conrad calling.

1107
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,978
Jarrett.

1108
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:32,396
Oh.

1109
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,398
Oh. Hi!

1110
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:35,941
Listen. I was...

1111
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:38,944
I was wondering
if maybe you'd like...

1112
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,404
to go out sometime.

1113
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,447
Like on a date?

1114
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,909
We wouldn't have
to call it a date.

1115
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:48,453
We could see how it goes.

1116
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,457
That was dumb.
Now start over.

1117
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:53,917
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1118
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,711
I'd love to. When?

1119
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:31,914
I didn't see you.

1120
01:04:31,997 --> 01:04:33,749
What do you think?

1121
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,125
Fine.

1122
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,961
Rawlins used to have
great scotch pines.

1123
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:41,757
They look like
skeletons this year.

1124
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,343
Hi. What do you think?

1125
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,764
It's very nice.

1126
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,725
What is wrong?

1127
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,227
Ask him what's wrong.

1128
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:57,064
Maybe you won't have to
hear it from Carol Lazenby.

1129
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,482
Hear what?

1130
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:04,696
I quit the swim team.

1131
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:06,865
Carol thought I knew.

1132
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,952
It happened over a month ago.

1133
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,411
Quit? When?

1134
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:15,165
Where have you been every night?

1135
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,167
Nowhere.
The library mostly.

1136
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,962
I didn't think it mattered.

1137
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:22,464
That was meant for me.

1138
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:25,759
It's important to hurt me. Right?

1139
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:27,719
You have that backwards.

1140
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:31,765
Do I embarrass you
in front of friends?

1141
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:35,853
"Poor Beth believes
every lie her son tells."

1142
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:37,396
I didn't lie.

1143
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:41,483
You did when
you came home at 6:30!

1144
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:45,654
If the lying's starting again.
I can't stand it!

1145
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:47,948
Then go to Europe!

1146
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:53,412
She only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first!

1147
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:56,790
She never came
to the hospital...

1148
01:05:56,874 --> 01:06:00,419
because she's busy going
to goddamn Spain and Portugal!

1149
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:05,007
She doesn't care if I'm hung up
by the balls out there.

1150
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,885
They may talk like this
at the hospital...

1151
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,429
but we're not at the hospital.

1152
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,973
You never came to the hospital!

1153
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,726
She had the flu
and couldn't come inside.

1154
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,770
She would've visited Buck
in the hospital!

1155
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:21,773
Buck never would've been
in the hospital!

1156
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,483
That is enough!

1157
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:26,278
I won't do it again.

1158
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:28,947
What in hell has happened?

1159
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,575
Somebody better go up there.

1160
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:33,994
He walks all over us...

1161
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:37,247
then you apologize to him.

1162
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,041
You've been apologizing to him...

1163
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:42,211
since he returned from the hospital!

1164
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:45,714
I'm trying to
goddamn understand him!

1165
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,424
Don't talk to me...

1166
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:50,093
the way he talks to you.

1167
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:52,596
Let's not fight. Okay?

1168
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,264
No fighting. Okay?

1169
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:56,225
Please.

1170
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:57,935
Let's go upstairs.

1171
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,456
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,084
I didn't mean any of it.

1173
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,336
Please don't be mad.

1174
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,297
I'm trying to
understand what happened.

1175
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,842
I don't know what happened.

1176
01:07:29,925 --> 01:07:31,844
I didn't mean it.

1177
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:35,097
Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?

1178
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,265
Why don't you?

1179
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,100
God. I can't!

1180
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,644
I can't talk to her!

1181
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:42,145
Why not?

1182
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,189
It doesn't change anything.

1183
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:48,861
It doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

1184
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:52,906
She was hurt because
you quit the team.

1185
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,492
I don't mean just now.

1186
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:58,036
I don't mean just today.

1187
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,122
Explain it to me.

1188
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:03,166
I can't. You don't see things.

1189
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,710
What things?

1190
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,420
What things?

1191
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,464
I want you to tell me.

1192
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:12,634
Can't you see she hates me?

1193
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:14,636
She doesn't hate you.

1194
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:17,222
You're right.
She doesn't.

1195
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,266
Please leave me alone.

1196
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:35,574
Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?

1197
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,534
It's not his fault.

1198
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:46,627
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

1199
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:55,052
Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.

1200
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,553
You're the doctor.

1201
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:02,518
Don't take refuge
in one-liners. Okay?

1202
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,520
Because that pisses me off.

1203
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:07,022
Okay. Okay.

1204
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:08,524
Everything was fine...

1205
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:11,527
till you had the fight
with your mother?

1206
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:12,986
I don't blame her.

1207
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,531
She's got her reasons.
It's impossible...

1208
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:17,533
after all the shit I've pulled.

1209
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:19,535
What shit have you pulled?

1210
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:24,456
I'm talking about proportion.

1211
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,458
Now. What shit?

1212
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:33,465
You can find one example.

1213
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:35,467
Don't say you tried suicide.

1214
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:37,469
What have you done lately?

1215
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:41,181
I'll never be forgiven for that.

1216
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:42,724
Never.

1217
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:46,937
You can't get out
the blood in her towels...

1218
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,022
and in her rug.

1219
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:51,608
Everything
had to be pitched.

1220
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:55,279
The bathroom tile
had to be regrouted.

1221
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,072
She fired the maid...

1222
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:59,992
because she couldn't dust right.

1223
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,619
If you think I'll forgive...

1224
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:04,162
she's gonna forgive me...

1225
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,338
What?

1226
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:37,196
I think I just figured
something out.

1227
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:38,739
What?

1228
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:42,784
Who it is who can't forgive who.

1229
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,502
[Berger]
A real problem has a real solution.

1230
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:53,545
[Conrad]
I've heard this before.

1231
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:56,632
Doesn't make it any less true.

1232
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:58,217
I'm so tired.

1233
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,345
That's some secret
you've been keeping.

1234
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:04,389
So what do I do now?

1235
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:08,060
Recognize her limitations.

1236
01:11:09,144 --> 01:11:11,647
Like she can't love me.

1237
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:15,692
No. Like she can't
love you enough.

1238
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:18,904
Don't blame her
for not loving you...

1239
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:20,948
more than she's able.

1240
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:23,033
She loves my father.

1241
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,118
She loved my brother.

1242
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,828
It's me.

1243
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:29,998
We're back to
the rotten kid routine.

1244
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:33,919
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

1245
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:37,089
How come your Dad loves you?

1246
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,633
He feels responsible.

1247
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:41,677
Besides. He loves everybody.

1248
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,304
The guy's got no taste.

1249
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:47,349
He loves you. But he's wrong.

1250
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:48,934
Look...

1251
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,979
maybe she can't express it...

1252
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:54,022
the way you'd like.

1253
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:57,359
Maybe she's afraid
to show her feelings.

1254
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,653
What do you mean?

1255
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:02,030
There's someone
besides your mother...

1256
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,740
you've got to forgive.

1257
01:12:03,824 --> 01:12:05,576
You mean me?

1258
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:09,955
For trying to off myself?

1259
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,084
Don't stare.
What for?

1260
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:18,130
Why don't you let yourself
off the hook?

1261
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:21,216
What did I do?

1262
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,885
What did I do?

1263
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:24,386
We'll talk Thursday.

1264
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:25,387
Come on!

1265
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,222
Time's up.

1266
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:29,725
What did I do?

1267
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,185
You know the rules.

1268
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:32,769
What rules?

1269
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:34,521
Think about it.

1270
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:36,148
Just think about it.

1271
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:40,611
Jesus!

1272
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:47,367
Say. After going to a new high...

1273
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,786
it falls to 1121/4...

1274
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,873
and then rallies on good volume.

1275
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:55,375
I order to buy 4.000.

1276
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:59,713
If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.
I know something's wrong.

1277
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:03,717
But suppose I order
to buy the 4.000 shares...

1278
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,637
and I plug in at 1133/4...

1279
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,599
I get 2.000 at 114.
500 at 1141/4...

1280
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,519
and the rest on the way up.

1281
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,604
Then I know I'm right.

1282
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:18,565
I'm going to peel off here.

1283
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:20,567
See you later.

1284
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:27,908
[Voice Echoing]
Suppose the order to buy...

1285
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,952
[Beth's Voice]
You let him walk all over us...

1286
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,286
and you apologize.

1287
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,996
[Man's Voice]
500 at 114...

1288
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,040
[Conrad's Voice]
Dad, you don't see things.

1289
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:36,917
[Beth]
You've been apologizing...

1290
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,295
since he returned from the hospital.

1291
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,297
Tell her to stop it!

1292
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:45,384
Buck never would've
been in the hospital!

1293
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:46,844
She hates me!

1294
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:10,826
I want to be clear.

1295
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,744
That's good.

1296
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:19,209
In the car.
I was thinking. "be clear."

1297
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:25,090
I suppose that's what
psychiatry's about.

1298
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:27,509
Being precise and clear.

1299
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,553
And honest, of course.

1300
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:34,933
I'm not a great believer
in psychiatry.

1301
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,727
Okay.

1302
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,439
What happens here
is between you and him...

1303
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:42,524
and I respect that.

1304
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,985
He's better.
I can see that.

1305
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:47,905
I just don't believe in psychiatry...

1306
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:51,200
as a panacea for everybody.

1307
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:52,784
Neither do I.

1308
01:14:55,704 --> 01:15:00,292
I wish I knew what
I was doing here.

1309
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:04,338
You said you could shed
some light on some things.

1310
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,966
I meant in terms of Conrad.

1311
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,511
I knew something was wrong...

1312
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,096
even before he tried suicide.

1313
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,182
But I thought that...

1314
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:19,228
It's clear that he's very smart.

1315
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:22,314
He's always been
an "A" student.

1316
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:24,900
Naturally. I thought
intelligent people...

1317
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,361
could work out their problems.

1318
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:30,030
But you still feel responsible?

1319
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,115
Yeah, sure I do.

1320
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:34,243
It's hard not to.

1321
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:38,872
It was just luck that
I happened to be there...

1322
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,916
when he tried it.

1323
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:43,669
We both could've been away.

1324
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:47,714
You think of yourself
as a lucky man?

1325
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:49,341
No. No. No.

1326
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:54,388
I used to think that
I was a lucky person...

1327
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,181
before the accident.

1328
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:03,856
I guess the whole of life...

1329
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:06,400
is nothing but an accident...

1330
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:08,318
what happens to you.

1331
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:11,321
That sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter.

1332
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,240
Yeah. Maybe.

1333
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:15,659
Maybe I am drifting a little.

1334
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:19,246
I can see the two of them...

1335
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:21,331
drifting away from me...

1336
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,917
and I just stand watching.

1337
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:28,172
What would you want
to do about that?

1338
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:30,716
Something.
I don't know what.

1339
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:34,261
I feel like
I'm sitting on a fence.

1340
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:37,347
They're on opposite sides
of this fence?

1341
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:40,184
Yeah... No.

1342
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,435
I don't know.

1343
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:46,064
I see her not being able
to forgive him.

1344
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:48,692
For what?

1345
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:50,694
I don't know exactly.

1346
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:53,238
Being too much like her.

1347
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:58,368
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

1348
01:16:59,453 --> 01:17:02,456
But it's really she and Conrad.

1349
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:05,000
They were the only two...

1350
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:08,086
that didn't cry at the funeral.

1351
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,216
It's not easy for me to admit this...

1352
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:13,717
but. Um...

1353
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,302
she didn't...

1354
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,809
His mother doesn't
show him much affection.

1355
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:26,522
I'm not trying
to put her down.

1356
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:30,108
Did she give Buck
much affection?

1357
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:32,653
God. Yes.
She loved Buck.

1358
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:34,696
Bucky got so much.

1359
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:38,283
What she felt for him was special.

1360
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,869
He was her first-born.

1361
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,704
And you?

1362
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:44,289
I loved Buck.

1363
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:46,500
I mean your wife's affection.

1364
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,043
For me?

1365
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,419
Yes.

1366
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:52,297
She's very...

1367
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:56,426
No. There's no problem
with her for me.

1368
01:17:56,510 --> 01:18:00,222
We've been married
nearly 21 years.

Everybody loves Beth.

1370
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,228
For Conrad. It's been difficult.

1371
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:09,106
He didn't talk about that?

1372
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:12,192
We don't know what happens here.

1373
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,236
It doesn't come up.

1374
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:21,702
I guess that's what it is.

1375
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:24,079
It's private here. Isn't it?

1376
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:25,581
Mm-hmm.
Very private.

1377
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:33,297
I think I know why I came here.

1378
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:38,719
I think I came here
to talk about myself.

1379
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:41,555
Okay. Why don't we?

1380
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:49,396
Hi.

[Buzzing Continues]

1384
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,031
What's the matter?

1385
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:07,664
This will sound strange.

1386
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:13,253
What I'm going to say
will sound strange.

1387
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:14,796
What happened?

1388
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:16,298
Come inside.

1389
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:20,385
Could we talk about
Buck's funeral?

1390
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:22,054
What?

1391
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:26,141
It'll seem trivial.
But it's on my mind.

1392
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,144
I'd like to talk about it.

1393
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:33,148
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1394
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:36,693
What could getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1395
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,238
have to do with anything?

1396
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,907
I was wearing a blue shirt.

1397
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,578
You said. "Wear a white shirt
and other shoes."

1398
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:51,708
It was nothing. But
it seemed to stay with me.

1399
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,294
What difference did it make...

1400
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:57,422
what I wore to Buck's funeral?

1401
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,424
Hear me out. Beth!

1402
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:02,553
No one would listen to that.

1403
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:05,514
I just want to talk about it.

1404
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,475
Why do you want to remind me?

1405
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:13,355
Because I've wondered what
it mattered what I wore.

1406
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,941
I was crazy that day.

1407
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:20,070
We were going
to our son's funeral.

1408
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:26,326
You were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

1409
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:29,204
It sticks with me...

1410
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:32,875
and I wanted to
tell you about it.

1411
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:47,514
It's all right.

1412
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,989
Beth! How are you?

1413
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,033
Fine. How are you?

1414
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:08,118
I haven't seen you.

1415
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:10,704
I'll call you. How's Brad?

1416
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:13,248
Fabulous! Is everything okay?

1417
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:14,833
Isn't this madness?

1418
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,419
It gets worse every year.

1419
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:18,962
Good-bye.

01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:33,727
May I show you this?

1423
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,271
Oh. No. No. Thanks.

Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.

1425
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:50,035
Conrad should get something
for my parents.

1426
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:54,706
He's not getting something
for his doctor. Is he?

1427
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:58,043
We should go see Dr. Berger.

1428
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,378
What?

1429
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:02,422
We could all go see him.

1430
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:03,841
Why?

1431
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:06,885
He thinks it's a good idea.

1432
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:09,429
What's he know about me?

1433
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:12,182
I've never even met him.

1434
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:16,937
Wouldn't it be easier
if we all talked about it?

1435
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,481
What will we talk about?

1436
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:22,067
Don't try to change me.

1437
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,610
Hasn't enough happened?

1438
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:27,281
Let's hold on to what we've got.

1439
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:29,783
That's what this is for.

1440
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,243
Maybe you'll be surprised.

1441
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:32,995
I don't want surprises.

1442
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:37,875
I know I'm not perfect.

1443
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:41,545
If I can't hug everybody
like you. I'm sorry.

1444
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:43,964
You're missing the point.

1445
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:47,092
I don't want to see counselors.

1446
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,636
This is my family.

1447
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,680
We will solve our problems...

1448
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:55,267
in the privacy of our own home...

1449
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,895
not by running to some...

1450
01:22:57,978 --> 01:22:59,521
Ready to order?

1451
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:03,108
Could you give me
a few minutes?

1452
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:07,237
Running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1453
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:15,329
I know you mean well.

1454
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:19,041
I want this to be
a nice Christmas.

1455
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:22,586
I want them all to be nice.

1456
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:26,006
You and I need time together.

1457
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:28,509
We must get away.

1458
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:31,929
New Years'. We'll spend
time in Houston...

1459
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,430
with my brother.

1460
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:36,099
Play some golf. Relax.

1461
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,061
I've talked to Mother.

1462
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:41,605
Conrad can stay with them.

1463
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:44,233
Please don't worry about it.

1464
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:47,569
Please. For his sake.
Don't indulge him.

1465
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:50,113
We need time together.

1466
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:51,823
Okay?

1467
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:54,576
Okay.

1468
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,745
Okay.

1469
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:58,497
I love you.

1470
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,085
I love you. Too.

1471
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:10,425
Let's just give things time. Okay?

1472
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:11,844
Okay.

1473
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,438
Conrad.

1474
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:24,565
Hmm?

1475
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:26,275
I don't bowl.

1476
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:28,026
I'm a horrible bowler.

1477
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,570
That's all right.

1478
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:31,864
Yeah. Well...

1479
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:34,992
I got it.

1480
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:38,537
The thing is.
I'm a funny bowler.

1481
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:41,582
Listen. We don't
have to go bowling.

1482
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:44,001
I'm not a bowling nut.

1483
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:45,627
How funny are you?

1484
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:50,048
On a scale from 1 to 10...
About a 10.

1485
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:51,508
That's pretty funny.

1486
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:54,011
I promise you won't look silly.

1487
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,721
Guarantee it?

1488
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,139
Guarantee it.

1489
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:25,459
Can you break the ball?

1490
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:30,047
Can't break anything
in a bowling alley.

1491
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,008
That's what I like
about bowling alleys.

1492
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,260
Can't even break the record.

1493
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:44,478
Anyway...

1494
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:46,355
Hmm? What?

1495
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,732
It's a conversation starter.

1496
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:50,067
Catchy.

1497
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,401
You like it?

1498
01:25:51,485 --> 01:25:55,155
I've been working on it all day.

1499
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:58,742
Are people punished
for things they do?

1500
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:00,244
By God?

1501
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,286
Yeah.

1502
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,830
I don't believe in God.

1503
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,415
Not at all?

1504
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:07,835
Either you do or don't.

1505
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,088
I believe in God.

1506
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:14,466
You afraid he'll punish you
for something?

1507
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:18,512
I've done many things
I'm ashamed of.

1508
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:22,558
Yeah? So have I.

1509
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:32,401
Did it hurt?

1510
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,409
I don't remember really.

1511
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:43,912
You don't want
to talk about it?

1512
01:26:43,996 --> 01:26:47,082
I've never really
talked about it.

1513
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:51,753
To doctors.
But not to anyone else.

1514
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:53,255
You're the first who's asked.

1515
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:55,924
Why did you do it?

1516
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:57,384
Uh...

1517
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:06,018
I don't know.
It was like...

1518
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:08,061
falling into a hole.

1519
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:12,649
It was like falling into a hole.

1520
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:14,735
It keeps getting bigger...

1521
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:16,778
and you can't escape.

1522
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:20,199
All of a sudden, it's inside...

1523
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:21,867
and you're the hole.

1524
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:25,037
You're trapped.
And it's all over.

1525
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,997
Something like that.

1526
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,041
It's not really scary...

1527
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:31,710
except when
you think back on it.

1528
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:36,173
'Cause you know
what you were feeling...

1529
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:37,591
# Like McDonald's can #

1530
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:40,093
# Nobody can do it #

1531
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:41,803
# Like McDonald's can #

1532
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:45,682
# You deserve
a break today #

1533
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:48,685
# So get up
and get away #

1534
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,521
Hey. Jarrett.

1535
01:27:50,604 --> 01:27:53,690
How you doing?
How about some fries?

1536
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:55,651
What are you doing?

1537
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:00,072
Hey. Lighten up.

1538
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:03,242
Hey. I don't like your attitude.

1539
01:28:29,309 --> 01:28:31,520
Energetic. Those guys.

1540
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,480
They were pretty funny.

1541
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,023
No.

1542
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:37,067
You thought they were.

1543
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,610
No. L...

1544
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,413
I'm sorry.

1545
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:50,914
What for?

1546
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:56,545
Anyway...

1547
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:15,022
Do you want to talk?

1548
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,565
About what?

1549
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,110
Are you okay?

1550
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,653
Yeah.

1551
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:23,197
Yeah. I'm fine.

1552
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:27,242
I'll give you a call.

1553
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:30,537
Will you? I want you to.

1554
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:32,539
Sure.

1555
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,132
Well...

1556
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:45,677
I'll see you in choir.

1557
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:47,221
Okay. Yeah.

1558
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:49,431
Thanks.

1559
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:51,308
Okay.

1560
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,894
I mean. Good night.

1561
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:55,437
Good night.

1562

Seven.

1563
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,829
In preparation
for our landing in Houston,

1564
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,916
observe the fasten
seat belt sign,

1565
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:19,169
and no smoking until
well inside the terminal.

1566
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:30,639
Watch this.

1567
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:32,182
Pessimistic golfer.

1568
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,725
Pessimistic golfer.

01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:36,311
Oh. Damn!

1570
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:40,274
Are we two up?

1571
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,900
Two.

1572
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:43,443
Let's hustle up.

1573
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:45,487
It is flat here.

1574
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:49,700
But we decided
to teach you to love it.

He wants everybody to move here.

1576
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:55,414
It's good to see you.

1577
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:58,667
- You look tired. Cal.
- Airplane scotch.

1578
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,420
Why am I still hungry?

1579
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:03,380
'Cause you're in Texas.

1580
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:05,424
We'll get you home.

1581
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:07,467
Get some steaks on.

1582
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:09,678
A baked potato. Too?

1583
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:13,307
How long has he had
that drawl?

1584
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,434
Since joining the club.

It sure wasn't funny.

We weren't that bad.

1588
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:11,990
I can't listen to that
Buck Jarrett lecture again.

1589
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:15,619
He bugs me
when he does that.

1590
01:32:15,702 --> 01:32:19,248
Will he ever stop
kissing his picture?

1591
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:20,749
Stillman. Shut up.

1592
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:24,211
Connie. Want a ride?

1593
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:25,754
Oh. No. Thanks.

1594
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:28,340
We could've used you today.

1595
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:30,384
I don't think so.

1596
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:33,428
Nobody could've helped us.

1597
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:36,515
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.

1598
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:38,350
Made it with her yet?

1599
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:39,852
Don't be a prick.

1600
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:42,020
You're the prick.

1601
01:32:42,104 --> 01:32:46,650
You give me a goddamn
pain in the ass.

1602
01:32:51,029 --> 01:32:53,699
Connie. Come on!
Come on!

No!

No!

01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:06,128
Let go! Let go!

1608
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:08,547
It's all right!

1609
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:11,049
Just calm down.

You're crazy!
You know that?

1611
01:33:16,138 --> 01:33:19,558
Send him back
where he came from!

It's over. It's over.

Here's your hat.

You want to talk?

The guy's a nothing.

1618

He's a zero upstairs.

1619
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:57,221
Since fourth grade,
you've known that.

1620
01:33:57,304 --> 01:33:59,264
So you look stupid...

1621
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:02,267
when you let him get to you!

So I look stupid?

What's with you?

1624
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:11,026
Why do you want
to be in this alone?

You know. I miss him. Too.

The three of us
were best friends.

to be around you.

01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,912
Good. You're here.

1684
01:38:31,995 --> 01:38:33,455
Something happened.

1685
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:34,957
Just a minute.

1686
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,543
Wait till we get inside.

1687
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:40,587
There.

1688
01:38:42,214 --> 01:38:43,757
Shit.

1689
01:38:43,799 --> 01:38:47,511
You'd think they'd assume
there'd be emergencies.

1690
01:38:47,594 --> 01:38:49,429
Don't take it off.
Just sit down.

1691
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:55,143
Something happened.

1692
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:56,228
What?

1693
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:57,729
It's...

1694
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:59,189
It's what?

1695
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:00,732
Oh. God!

1696
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:03,902
I need something.

1697
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:05,070
What?

1698
01:39:05,153 --> 01:39:06,655
It keeps coming.

1699
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:08,615
I can't stop it!

1700
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,284
Don't try.

1701
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:12,870
Got to get off the hook.

1702
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:14,580
For what?

1703
01:39:14,663 --> 01:39:16,707
What I did to him!

1704
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:17,916
What?

1705
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,460
It must be somebody's fault...

1706
01:39:20,544 --> 01:39:22,671
or there's no point!

1707
01:39:22,754 --> 01:39:24,756
What point? It happened!

1708
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,885
Oh. No. I don't mean that.

1709
01:39:27,968 --> 01:39:29,428
It's just that...

1710
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:32,055
Bucky. I didn't mean it.

1711
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:35,142
Bucky, I didn't mean it.

1712
01:39:35,184 --> 01:39:37,019
Bucky!

1713
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:38,103
It wasn't your fault.

1714
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:40,480
You said. "Get the sail down!"

1715
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:42,691
I couldn't! It jammed!

1716
01:39:42,774 --> 01:39:44,443
And then the halyard jammed!

1717
01:39:44,526 --> 01:39:46,445
Because the goddamned
halyard jammed!

1718
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:49,448
Then you're sittin' here
screwing around!

1719
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:51,241
Until it's too late!

1720
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:54,494
And I'm supposed
to take care of it!

1721
01:39:54,578 --> 01:39:55,746
That wasn't fair.

1722
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:58,749
No! And then
you say. "Hang on!"

1723
01:39:58,832 --> 01:39:59,917
"Hang on!"

1724
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,627
Then you let go!

1725
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:03,253
Why'd you let go?

1726
01:40:03,337 --> 01:40:04,546
I got tired!

1727
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:07,299
Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!

1728
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:23,148
It hurts to be mad at him.

1729
01:40:23,232 --> 01:40:24,691
Yeah.

1730
01:40:26,944 --> 01:40:28,987
He just wasn't careful.

1731
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:32,950
He didn't see how
a bad thing might happen.

1732
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:36,787
Bad things happen even
when people are careful.

1733
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:38,789
We should've come in...

1734
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:41,500
when it started to look bad.

1735
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,877
So you made a mistake.

1736
01:40:43,961 --> 01:40:46,255
Why did he let go?

1737
01:40:46,338 --> 01:40:47,798
Why?

1738
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:50,926
Maybe you were stronger.

1739
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:54,263
Did that ever occur to you?

1740
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:05,190
How long will you
punish yourself?

1741
01:41:05,274 --> 01:41:06,400
When will you quit?

1742
01:41:06,483 --> 01:41:08,151
I'd like to.

1743
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:09,570
Why don't you?

1744
01:41:09,653 --> 01:41:12,364
It's not that easy.

1745
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:20,414
God...

1746
01:41:20,497 --> 01:41:22,457
I loved him.

1747
01:41:26,587 --> 01:41:28,547
I know.

1748
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:46,273
What happened?
What started all this?

1749
01:41:46,356 --> 01:41:47,858
Karen.

1750
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:51,904
She killed herself.

1751
01:41:51,987 --> 01:41:55,032
I just found out she's dead.

1752
01:41:55,115 --> 01:41:57,159
Jesus.

1753
01:41:57,242 --> 01:41:59,453
She was fine.

1754
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:01,830
No. She wasn't.

1755
01:42:01,914 --> 01:42:05,417
She told me!
She said she was...

1756
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:06,460
What?

1757
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:09,296
She was busy and
feeling good and...

1758
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:10,422
What?

1759
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:13,383
What?

1760
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:14,843
If I'd known...

1761
01:42:14,885 --> 01:42:16,386
I could've done something.

1762
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:19,264
You're taking her on. Too?

1763
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:20,265
No!

1764
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:21,266
No?

1765
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:22,809
No. I just...

1766
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:23,810
What?

1767
01:42:23,894 --> 01:42:25,312
That isn't it.

1768
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:28,482
I feel really bad about this.

1769
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:31,902
Just let me feel bad about this!

1770
01:42:33,028 --> 01:42:34,363
Okay.

1771
01:42:36,657 --> 01:42:39,910
Listen. I feel
bad about it. Too.

1772
01:42:43,956 --> 01:42:46,500
Why do things
happen to people?

1773
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,961
It isn't fair.

1774
01:42:49,044 --> 01:42:51,713
You're right.
It isn't fair.

1775
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:54,216
You just do one wrong thing...

1776
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:55,717
and...

1777
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:58,387
Um-hmm.

1778
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:02,307
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1779
01:43:09,273 --> 01:43:10,774
You know.

1780
01:43:23,745 --> 01:43:25,539
You know.

1781
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:30,460
I hung on.

1782
01:43:30,544 --> 01:43:33,630
I stayed with the boat.

1783
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:35,340
Exactly.

1784
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:45,058
Now. You can live
with that. Can't you?

1785
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:53,150
I'm scared!

1786
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:55,444
I'm scared.

1787
01:43:55,485 --> 01:43:57,738
Feelings are scary.

1788
01:43:57,821 --> 01:43:59,865
And sometimes they're painful.

1789
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:02,242
If you can't feel pain...

1790
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:05,287
you won't feel
anything else.

1791
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:07,956
You know what I'm saying?

1792
01:44:11,084 --> 01:44:12,628
I think so.

1793
01:44:15,589 --> 01:44:17,341
You're here. You're alive.

1794
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:20,219
Don't say you don't feel that.

1795
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,471
It doesn't feel good.

1796
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:24,014
It is good.

1797
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:25,516
Believe me.

1798
01:44:29,937 --> 01:44:31,813
How do you know?

1799
01:44:33,899 --> 01:44:36,068
Because I'm your friend.

1800
01:44:40,364 --> 01:44:43,784
I don't know
what I would've done...

1801
01:44:43,867 --> 01:44:46,328
if you hadn't been here.

1802
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:52,584
You're really my friend?

1803
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:57,506
I am. Count on it.

1804
01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:51,727
Hi.

1805
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:53,187
I would've called...

1806
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:56,190
but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

1807
01:45:56,273 --> 01:45:57,733
About the other night...

1808
01:45:57,816 --> 01:46:00,235
I liked being with you.

1809
01:46:00,277 --> 01:46:02,738
I didn't like myself.

1810
01:46:02,821 --> 01:46:04,740
Conrad. I was stupid.

1811
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,743
That was dumb of me to laugh.

1812
01:46:07,784 --> 01:46:09,745
It was my fault.

1813
01:46:09,786 --> 01:46:11,830
I was embarrassed.

1814
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:13,081
Really?

1815
01:46:13,123 --> 01:46:14,875
You were embarrassed?

1816
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:17,211
When those boys came in...

1817
01:46:17,294 --> 01:46:19,755
it was awful and awkward.

1818
01:46:19,838 --> 01:46:22,132
When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.

1819
01:46:22,174 --> 01:46:25,469
They were just having
a good time.

1820
01:46:25,552 --> 01:46:29,515
I let them interfere
with what was happening.

1821
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:31,058
It was dumb.

1822
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:34,645
I've done lots of
dumb things lately.

1823
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:39,441
I just didn't know if you were
being straight with me.

1824
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:44,029
Yeah?

1825
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:47,491
Anyway. I'd like
to try it again.

1826
01:46:47,533 --> 01:46:48,951
It worked okay...

1827
01:46:49,034 --> 01:46:51,161
except for the bowling.

1828
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:52,704
Yes.

1829
01:46:52,746 --> 01:46:54,665
Yes?

1830
01:46:55,749 --> 01:46:57,793
Yes.

1831
01:46:58,877 --> 01:47:01,380
Are you going to school?

1832
01:47:01,463 --> 01:47:04,299
No. Not on Sunday.

1833
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:09,137
Have you eaten?

1834
01:47:09,221 --> 01:47:11,223
No. I haven't.

1835
01:47:11,265 --> 01:47:13,725
Do you want some breakfast?

1836
01:47:15,686 --> 01:47:17,104
Okay.

1837
01:47:30,868 --> 01:47:32,160
Mom!

1838
01:47:34,037 --> 01:47:36,415
All right.
How about that?

1839
01:47:36,498 --> 01:47:37,916
Boy. Oh. Boy.

1840
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,960
I do love that.

1841
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:43,005
These holes sure do love you.

1842
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:47,092
We should spend more time
playing golf together.

1843
01:47:47,176 --> 01:47:50,137
Maybe our next vacation...
strictly golf.

1844
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,680
Pinehurst.
Myrtle Beach.

1845
01:47:51,722 --> 01:47:53,724
Pinehurst would be nice.

1846
01:47:53,765 --> 01:47:56,768
I think Connie would
like Pinehurst.

1847
01:47:56,852 --> 01:48:00,272
Is that deliberate
or just a reflex?

1848
01:48:00,355 --> 01:48:03,358
I assumed you meant him. Too.

1849
01:48:03,442 --> 01:48:06,403
I'm surprised you
haven't called him.

1850
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:08,447
I'll call him tonight.

1851
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:11,533
Can we have a little drink?

1852
01:48:11,617 --> 01:48:13,577
Drink. Yes. Little. No.

1853
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,078
Let's finish this.

1854
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:16,079
What?

1855
01:48:16,163 --> 01:48:17,664
What you started.

1856
01:48:17,664 --> 01:48:19,666
Me? There's no point.

1857
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,210
He controls you.

1858
01:48:21,293 --> 01:48:23,253
He isn't the problem.

1859
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:24,755
Isn't he?

1860
01:48:24,838 --> 01:48:28,258
No. Let's talk about
what's bothering you.

1861
01:48:28,342 --> 01:48:31,303
No. Let's discuss
what's bothering you.

1862
01:48:31,345 --> 01:48:35,349
How did I make you
so angry with me?

1863
01:48:35,432 --> 01:48:37,935
You blame me
for everything.

1864
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:40,437
Can't you see
beyond yourself?

1865
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:42,022
No. I can't!

1866
01:48:42,064 --> 01:48:45,025
Neither can you
or anybody else!

1867
01:48:45,108 --> 01:48:46,568
I'm just honest.

1868
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:48,070
Stop being honest...

1869
01:48:48,153 --> 01:48:50,113
and start being generous!

1870
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:51,657
Think about him!

1871
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:54,701
What does he expect from me?

1872
01:48:54,785 --> 01:48:58,747
He wants a hug
when he passes exams?

1873
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:01,834
I can't respond
when someone says...

1874
01:49:01,917 --> 01:49:04,878
"I did something
great. Love me."

1875
01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:08,924
He wants to know
you don't hate him.

1876
01:49:09,007 --> 01:49:11,510
Mothers don't hate their sons.

1877
01:49:11,593 --> 01:49:14,555
Is that what he told you?

1878
01:49:14,596 --> 01:49:18,600
You accept what he says
with no questions.

1879
01:49:18,684 --> 01:49:21,687
I'm trying to
keep this family...

1880
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:24,731
What does everyone
want from me?

1881
01:49:24,815 --> 01:49:29,236
Listen. We all just
want you to be happy.

1882
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:30,779
Happy?

1883
01:49:30,863 --> 01:49:31,822
Yes.

1884
01:49:31,864 --> 01:49:35,576
You tell me
the definition of happy.

1885
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:38,912
First. Be sure your kids are safe...

1886
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:42,499
that nobody's been hit by a car...

1887
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:45,544
or drowned in your swimming pool!

1888
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:49,131
Then tell me how to be happy!

1889
01:50:42,643 --> 01:50:45,103
I'm turning in.

1890
01:50:45,145 --> 01:50:46,647
Dinner was good.

1891
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,148
Really good.

1892
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:50,692
It's early. You tired?

1893
01:50:50,776 --> 01:50:52,986
It was a rough week.

1894
01:50:53,070 --> 01:50:56,823
Your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you?

1895
01:50:56,865 --> 01:50:58,825
No. She was fine.

1896
01:51:01,453 --> 01:51:03,956
I'm glad you're back.

1897
01:51:18,303 --> 01:51:19,763
Good night.

1898
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:42,971
[Sobbing]

1899
01:52:49,686 --> 01:52:51,104
Calvin?

1900
01:53:03,075 --> 01:53:04,952
Why are you crying?

1901
01:53:11,834 --> 01:53:13,293
Can I. Uh...

1902
01:53:13,377 --> 01:53:15,838
Can I get you something?

1903
01:53:17,923 --> 01:53:19,424
I don't...

1904
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:21,426
What did you say?

1905
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:27,891
Calvin. What did you say?

1906
01:53:27,975 --> 01:53:29,476
[Sighing]

1907
01:53:32,437 --> 01:53:34,648
Tell me.

1908
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,781
You are beautiful.

1909
01:53:46,368 --> 01:53:48,829
And you are unpredictable.

1910
01:53:50,956 --> 01:53:52,916
But you're so cautious.

1911
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:56,962
You're determined. Beth...

1912
01:53:57,045 --> 01:53:59,173
but you know something?

1913
01:54:01,466 --> 01:54:03,093
You're not strong.

1914
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:08,432
I don't know
if you're really giving.

1915
01:54:11,602 --> 01:54:13,145
Tell me something.

1916
01:54:13,187 --> 01:54:15,272
Do you love me?

1917
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:19,860
Do you really love me?

1918
01:54:22,237 --> 01:54:26,033
I feel the way I've always
felt about you.

1919
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:41,173
We would've been all right...

1920
01:54:41,215 --> 01:54:44,718
if there hadn't been any mess.

1921
01:54:46,345 --> 01:54:48,805
But you can't handle mess.

1922
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:53,852
You need everything neat and easy.

1923
01:54:54,978 --> 01:54:56,438
I don't know.

1924
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,982
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1925
01:54:59,024 --> 01:55:01,485
It was so much Buck.

1926
01:55:01,568 --> 01:55:06,573
It's as if you buried
all your love with him.

1927
01:55:06,657 --> 01:55:08,617
I don't understand that.

1928
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:13,664
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

1929
01:55:13,747 --> 01:55:16,166
Maybe it was just you.

1930
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:21,880
Maybe, finally, it was
the best of you that you buried.

1931
01:55:24,424 --> 01:55:26,426
But whatever it was...

1932
01:55:30,055 --> 01:55:33,058
I don't know who you are.

1933
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:37,604
I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1934
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,317
So I was crying.

1935
01:55:46,864 --> 01:55:50,909
Because I don't know
if I love you anymore.

1936
01:55:53,954 --> 01:55:58,458
And I don't know
what I'll do without that.

1937
01:57:28,215 --> 01:57:29,174
[Door Slams]

1938
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:30,819
Dad?

1939
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:37,034
The yard looks smaller
without leaves.

1940
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:40,078
Dad. What happened?

1941
01:58:42,206 --> 01:58:45,667
Your mother's
going away for a while.

1942
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:46,919
Where?

1943
01:58:47,002 --> 01:58:48,212
Why?

1944
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:49,755
Back to Houston.

1945
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:52,299
I don't know.

1946
01:58:53,383 --> 01:58:54,843
Why? What...

1947
01:58:56,929 --> 01:58:58,388
I know why.

1948
01:58:58,472 --> 01:59:00,432
It's me. Isn't it?

1949
01:59:00,516 --> 01:59:01,475
No.

1950
01:59:01,517 --> 01:59:02,976
It's my fault.

1951
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,312
Don't do that to yourself!

1952
01:59:05,354 --> 01:59:06,813
It's nobody's fault!

1953
01:59:06,897 --> 01:59:10,275
Things happen.
People don't always have answers.

1954
01:59:14,071 --> 01:59:17,866
I don't know why
I'm yelling at you.

1955
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:21,036
You should do
that more often.

1956
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:22,829
Haul my ass a little.

1957
01:59:22,913 --> 01:59:24,373
Get after me.

1958
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:28,544
Like you did for him.

1959
01:59:28,669 --> 01:59:30,128
He needed it.

1960
01:59:30,212 --> 01:59:31,129
You didn't.

1961
01:59:31,213 --> 01:59:34,132
You were always
so hard on yourself.

1962
01:59:34,216 --> 01:59:36,510
I never had the heart.

1963
01:59:36,593 --> 01:59:39,137
Oh. Dad. Don't.

1964
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,431
Well. It's the truth.

1965
01:59:43,225 --> 01:59:45,644
I never worried about you.

1966
01:59:45,727 --> 01:59:48,647
I just wasn't listening.

1967
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:51,984
I wasn't sending
many signals then.

1968
01:59:52,067 --> 01:59:53,986
You couldn't do anything.

1969
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:57,614
I should've got
a handle on it somehow.

1970
02:00:02,744 --> 02:00:06,665
I used to figure you had
a handle for everything.

1971
02:00:06,707 --> 02:00:08,959
You knew it all.

1972
02:00:09,042 --> 02:00:13,046
You always made us feel
everything would be all right.

1973
02:00:14,131 --> 02:00:17,092
I've thought about that
a lot lately.

1974
02:00:17,176 --> 02:00:19,595
I really admire you for it.

1975
02:00:19,678 --> 02:00:21,680
Don't admire people too much.

1976
02:00:21,763 --> 02:00:24,850
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1977
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:27,853
I'm not disappointed.

1978
02:00:31,064 --> 02:00:33,609
I love you.

1979
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:40,657
I love you. Too.
