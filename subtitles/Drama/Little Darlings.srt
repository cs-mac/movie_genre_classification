No. No.

I nailed the windows because
you're not right.

He got wires in the walls.

Then listen to me.

He can hear you. Shh!

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,561
Can he still hear me?

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,971
What did I just say?

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,885
It's all right.

Don't ever leave me.

that you applied?

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,129

Henry Miller.

Get down immediately.

105
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,450
That book is restricted.

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,370
Which is why I
committed it to memory.

107

Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent

110
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,362
That was highly unusual.

111

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,727
The Victorian sonnet has the
balance of three tenets,

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,610
rhyme, meter, conceit.

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,650
Without this balance,
a poem becomes slack,

116
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,888
an untucked shirt.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,769
Professor Steeves.

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,641
Then how do you explain Whitman?

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,921
Say more. Two more sentences.

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,322
Well, uh, he hated rhyme and meter.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,807
The whole point was
untucking your shirt.

122
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,845
What's your name?

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,331
Allen Ginsberg.

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,805
Ginsberg?

125
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,726
Your father, perhaps,
is the poet Louis Ginsberg?

126
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,202
He writes with
rhyming metered verse.

127
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,282
Why do you think
he chose that form?

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,289
Because it's easier.

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,724
This university exists
because of tradition and form.

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,644
Would you rather this building
be built by engineers

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,200
or Whitman and his boys at play?

132
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,761
There can be no creation

133
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,120
before imitation.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,410
<i>Reports from the
front say the Nazis</i>

135

<i>are wheeling up fresh materiel
and reserves.</i>

136
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,446
Shut the books.

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,363
We're taking my brother
with us to the social.

138
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,204
He ships out tomorrow.

139
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,931
I can't. You see
how much I have to do.

140
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,805
He's Navy.
It's catnip for the skirts.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,526
You hymies are really
all about work, huh?

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,448
Brahms?

143
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,085
Finally.

144
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,804
An oasis in this wasteland.

145
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,329
So how come you're
not at the social?

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,085
Oh, only the most antisocial
have to go

147
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,811
to an event actually called one.

148
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,405
Libation?

149
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,965
What, you drink in your room?

150
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,243
How does a horrible bottle
of Chianti sound?

151
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,167
I don't drink.

152
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,163
Freshman?

153
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,651
Yes.

154
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,171
Excellent.
I love first times.

155
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,846
I want my entire life
to be composed of them.

156
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,730
Life is only interesting
if life is wide.

157
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,520
To Walt Whitman.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,489
You dirty bastard.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,605
How's your Yeats?

160
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,842
Have you read <i>A Vision</i>?

161
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,410
Uh, never heard of it.

162
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,323
Oh. It's completely brilliant.

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,243
And impossible.

164
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,767
He says that life is round.

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,606
That we're stuck on this
wheel of living and dying.

166
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,967
An endless circle.

What we have, darlings and

No one notices him.

Look at him.
Why would we bother?

263

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,249
You can't do this.

334
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,367
Mmm.

335
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,322
Where were you?

336
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,364
I was out with a friend.

337
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,130
I called you.
I know.

338
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,451
It's time to go, Mrs. Ginsberg.

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,891
No, you're not leaving.

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,968
He's already signed the papers.
Dad, don't.

341
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,644
It's for the best, son.
Your best.

342
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,643
You know... It's for her best.

343
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,882
It's not for my best. It's for her best.
Look at her.

344
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,371
No.
Listen to her.

345
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,169
He's not gonna...
I know it's not. Don't...

346
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,447
Mom. Mom. Mom. Get off.

347
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,204
This is your fault.

348
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,164
Complicated enough?

349
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,643
At least you have her.

350
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,924
My father left me when I was four.

351
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,640
I've been thinking
about what Yeats said.

352
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,042
To be reborn,
you have to die first.

353
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,490
What do you suggest?

354
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,687
I spent my entire life
making other people happy.

355
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,127
It's time I find happiness
the only way I see possible.

356
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,929
Oh, please.

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,889
Die already.

358
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,964
Where's the verve? The brio?

359
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,004
If it be that I am indulging
my self-consciousness

360
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,606
in justifying myself or if it be...

361
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,966
That's a run-on.
Don't edit me.

362
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,769
<i>The New Vision declares...</i>

363
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,644
<i>"Proclaims. " It's better.</i>

364
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,291
Proclaims the death of morality.

365
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,402
The expression of self.

366
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,609
The true, uninhibited, uncensored
expression of the self.

367
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,047
Words, boys. Empty words.

368
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,326
Well, what do you suggest?

369
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,051
The derangement of the senses.

370
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,328
<i>What do you hate
from the pit of your gut?</i>

371
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,401
Institutions.

372
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,601
Paterson, New Jersey.

373
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,321
My father.

374
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,441
Bingo.

375
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,606
And the Shakespeare...

376
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,405
All right.

377
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,369
Extraordinary men
propel society forward.

378
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,329
It is our duty to break the law.

379
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,363
Really?
It's how we make the world wider.

380
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,965
You are an extraordinary man.

381
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,087
Well, thank you.

382
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,447
<i>Return Of the Native.</i>

383
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,285
<i>Leviathan.</i>

384
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,249
Tear 'em up, boys. Destroy
the old and build the new.

385
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,085
Chaucer. Gibbon.

386
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,090
Watch this.

387
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,325
Go.

388
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,090
What the hell is this?

389
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,484
Time slows down

390
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,201
as you drift deeper and deeper
into your cave.

391
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,365
We are exploring the avenues
of Allen's mind.

392
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,963
Dimly lit, I'm sure. What have
you done to my apartment?

393
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,281
Don't touch anything.
We need to write it all down.

394
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,047
Grab a pair of scissors. Get
this man a pair of scissors.

395
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,127
This is not your revolution.
This is my life.

396
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,441
What kind of life is it, David?

397
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,601
It's mine.

398
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,728
Not everyone gets an allowance.

399
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,727
Leave.

400
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,925
Just get out.

401
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,360
I need to speak with you.

402
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,165
Alone.

403
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,368
It only has to be five pages.

404
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,410
You make me too smart, they're
gonna suspect something's up.

405
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,960
And get you sent back
to your mother again?

406
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,122
That would just be the end of you.

407
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,930
Fuck you.

408
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,764
<i>Kill your darlings,</i>

409
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,842
your crushes,
your juvenile metaphysics.

410
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,644
None of them belong on the page.

411
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,601
It is the first principle
of good creative work,

412
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,241
a work of fiction you will
deliver as your final exam.

413
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,440
Look.

414
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,922
Whitman Junior graced us
with his presence today.

415
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,565
"The New Vision.

416
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,291
"Extraordinary men
propel us forward.

417
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,682
"It is our duty to break the law."

418
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,643
Fantastic.

419
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,529
There's more life
in those five pages

420
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,444
than in the dozens of bad sonnets
we've read in this class.

421
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,683
You want life?

422
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,683
You want the world on fire?

423
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,242
The war awaits.

424
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,410
What Will it be?

425
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,483
"The rose that scents
the summer air

426
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,245
"grows from my beloved's hair."

427
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,802
Keep going.
That's my sonnet for Steeves.

428
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,609
We have the map.

429
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,523
We have the manifesto.

430
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,564
We need the work.

431
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,966
I was wrong.

432
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,451
Maybe you're not up
for this after all.

433
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,569
Show me your fucking map.

434
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,641
Mmm! Stop.

435
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,051
No, there's nothing here

436
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,929
because David's not here
to write it for you.

437
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,286
It's complicated.

438
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,606
I love complicated.

439
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,003
He is a professor
working as a janitor

440
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,401
so he can be near
his precious Lu-Lu.

441
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,967
He is a goddamn fruit
who won't let me go.

442
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
A fruit?

443
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,365
A queer.

444
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,325
Then...

445
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,562
You know, let's get rid of him.

446
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,001
Right now, I just need you to
write us something beautiful.

447
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,968
First thought, best thought.

448
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,004
Allen in Wonderland.

449
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,450
<i>Pervitin.</i>

450
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,441
The Germans called
it the <i>"Wunderdroge."</i>

451
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,404
Prescribed for superhuman feats.

452
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,847
<i>But beware of the side effects</i>

453
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,763
which include sudden
bouts of blindness,

454
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,683
diarrhea, heart palpitations

455
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,128
and a severe decline
in moral standards.

456
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,568
Unbloomed stalwart.

457
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,923
Come out and play.

458
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,965
What the hell are you doing?

459
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,090
Writing.

460
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,010
But the words...

461
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,730
Oh, the words.

462
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,641
Yeah.

463
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,004
Lu, it's very rough.

464
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,641
Oh.

465
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,163
The vision at last.

466
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,006
Can I see?

467
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,967
Where's Lu?

468
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,081
He's out.

469
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,565
With a senior football player.

470
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,210
A writer.

471
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,248
And handsome, too.

472
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,240
James?

473
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,523
Jack. There it is.

474
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,887
Jack.

475
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
You're not allowed to be here.

476
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,206
That's odd since I'm the
only thing keeping him here.

477
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,046
Not anymore.

478
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,404
Piece of advice.

479
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,444
You don't know Lu.

480
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,450
As soon as you think you do,
he'll find someone else.

481
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,604
Maybe he already has.

482
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,722
What, are you moving in?

483
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,283
Where have you been?

484
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,489
I found a real writer.

485
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,608
Already a million words under
his belt before Columbia.

486
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,443
You mean Jack?

487
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,891
Why didn't you tell me?

488
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,288
What, am I supposed
to do newsreels?

489
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,244
What's that?

490
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,363
Oh, nothing.

491
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,250
If you're going to stay,
don't hog the blanket.

492
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,443
Why is Jack a real writer?

493
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
Once you meet him,
you'll see what I mean.

494
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,329
Hey, Al.
No.

495
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,845
Come on.
No.

496
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,247
No.

497
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,883
Oh! Fumble.

498
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,001
Jack, what was that?

499
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,326
The damn cat.

500
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,326
Shh! She painted it.
Say nothing.

501
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,883
- Hey, when did this come?
- Today.

502
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,728
It's from Sammy.
Where is he now?

503
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,962
I don't know.
Some battleship.

504
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,564
What do you think?

505
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,244
It's brilliant, no?

506
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,288
It's missing some
periods and commas.

507
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,567
It's better than
anything you've ever written.

508
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,880
I use periods and commas.

509
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,240
Both of you, quiet.

510
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,771
<i>Kerouac.
How are you, chum?</i>

511
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,090
Sammy, you bastard.

512
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,331
Who's Sammy?

513
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,081
My best friend since I was 12.
Off in the Navy.

514
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,766
<i>We've just been through 20
days of German shelling</i>

515
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,888
<i>every three hours,
night and day.</i>

516
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,609
<i>This will be
my last one for a while.</i>

517
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,766
<i>Tomorrow we're headed out to the
front, some beach near Rome. Anzio?</i>

518
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,966
Go sit at the table.

519
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,327
<i>It's supposed to be beautiful...</i>

520
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,204
I didn't know we
were having guests.

521
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,170
What's this?

522
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,364
I was aiming for stew.

523
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,329
Yeah? You missed.

524
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,251
Come on, guys.

525
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,561
Where are you going?
Out.

526
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,650
Out? I have been
cooking all day for you.

527
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,768
What? What do you want?
Want me to eat shoe leather?

528
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,968
I'm hungry, and what you do
in the kitchen's unholy.

529
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,769
That's funny.
You talk like a Catholic,

530
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,609
but you fuck me and won't marry me.

531
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,320
How does that work?
Shut your mouth, Edie.

532
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,368
I thought you liked it wide open.

533
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,601
Scram.

534
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,401
Um...

535
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,365
Allen.

536
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,562
So, Al.
Thought my novel was shit?

537
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,331
Not exactly. It's not
what I would choose...

538
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,765
It's all true.

539
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,482
Jack served in
the merchant marines.

540
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,528
I left school twice already.

541
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,324
Columbia's full of squares.

542
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,322
Not even sure why I
bothered to come back.

543
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,531
Why don't you just ship out again?

544
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,002
Trust me, sometimes when I
fight with Edie, I want to.

545
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,010
Well, you two did just fight.

546
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,768
Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

547
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,407
"A new vision." Yeah.

548
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,891
Sounds phony.

549
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,046
Movements are cooked up by people

550
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,686
who can't write
about the people who can.

551
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,047
I don't think he gets
what we're trying to do.

552
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,531
Listen to me.

553
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,160
This whole town's full of finks

554
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,368
on the 30th floor
writing pure chintz.

555
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,889
Writers. A real writer's
gotta be in the beds,

556
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,605
down in the trenches
and all the broken places.

557
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,965
Where were your trenches, Al?

558
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,323
Allen.
Right.

559
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,291
First thought, best thought.

560
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,850
Fuck you.
What does that even mean?

561
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,446
That's good.
That's one. What else?

562
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,325
Fuck your one million words.

563
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,005
Yes, even better.

564
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,810
You don't know me.

565
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,481
You're right.

566
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,811
Who is "you"?

567
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,250
"Be careful.

568
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,724
"You are not in Wonderland.

569
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,362
"I've heard the strange madness
long growing in your soul.

570
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,563
"But you are fortunate
in your ignorance,

571
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,844
"in your isolation.

572
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,327
"You who have suffered

573
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,203
"find where love hides.

574
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,245
"Give, share, lose,

575
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,929
"lest we die unbloomed."

576
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,731
Al?

577
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,009
That was beautiful, kid.

578
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,245
You wrote that?

579
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,484
You asked me to.

580
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,605
Forget Columbia.

581
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,088
Forget Ogden Nash.

582
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,441
Here's the plan, boys.
We join the merchant marines,

583
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,688
sail the world until the war ends,

584
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,243
then jump ship and make it
to Paris for the liberation.

585
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,330
And you don't speak French.

586
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,930
Jack does.

587
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,570
It'll be us together
at the beginning.

588
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,603
It'll be the perfect day.

589
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,405
Jesus Christ.
Get your hands in the air.

590
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,005
You have managed to
matriculate and drop out

591
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,369
of Tulane, Bowdoin and the
University of Chicago.

592
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,728
Your attendance record here
is abominable.

593
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,165
You've ignored curfew.

594
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,201
Your papers, when you
bother to turn them in,

595
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,846
exceed the assigned page limit.

596
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,611
Can you explain why
you're at Columbia?

597
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,365
Well, the same reason you are.

598
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,811
What is that?

599
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,484
Loose Barnard girls.

600
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,606
I know about your difficulties,

601
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,330
about what happened in Chicago.

602
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,731
You told him?

603
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,205
He's not the enemy.

604
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,927
You see, the university
acts in loco parentis.

605
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,447
You are our responsibility.

606
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,410
We're trying to find some way
to make this all work for you.

607
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,886
Who said anybody could know
anything about anything?

608
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,291
Lucien, your temper.

609
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,486
Things were going fine

610
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,406
and you're just spreading rumors
to get me kicked out of here.

611
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,051
Allen.
What the hell's going on?

612
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,731
Who's she?

613
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,842
Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.

614
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,730
What's she doing here?

615
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,088
I've been divorced for some time.

616
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,290
I'll go wait outside.

617
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,567
This is the kind of
childish outburst...

618
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,567
So that's why you locked Mom up.

619
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,410
Get back here immediately.

620
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,970
Lucien. Lucien.

621
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,447
Lucien!

622
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,760
Did he put you up to this?

623
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,091
No.

624
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,324
I stole the boat.

625
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,922
And it was tremendous.

626
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,524
Where are you going?

627
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,925
You know me now.

628
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,447
I'm only good at beginnings.

629
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,364
What, you're dropping out?

630
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,491
Best of luck.

631
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,166
Okay.

632
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,963
My father showed up today
with some new woman

633
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,045
and in the middle of all the
"Allen's a screw-up" monologue,

634
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,442
all of a sudden,
I realized I don't care.

635
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,604
I've never not cared.

636
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,281
So, I told them it was my idea

637
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,085
to steal the boat.

638
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,681
Why?

639
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,322
Because I don't want to be
the person they think I am.

640
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,564
I am on academic probation
and I could get kicked out.

641
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,483
You can't leave.

642
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,411
You started something

643
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,484
and I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do next.

644
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,085
It's our turn.

645
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,962
Let's show them what we can do.

646
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,531
You in?

647
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,763
You mustn't drink while you're
handling it, and no writing in it.

648
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,605
It comes back
exactly as you've got it.

649
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,846
Next.

650
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,971
Once you get the book,
treat it very, very well.

651
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,890
And you don't break the binding.
Now follow me.

652
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,687
All right.

653
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,889
Hey, no telling Edie.

654
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,324
Maybe you can help me
with something.

655
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,044
You're checking out
all these books.

656
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,203
I'm asking myself,
do you ever get checked out?

657
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,440
Twenty-five seconds.

658
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,326
Masterful.

659
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,363
Hi.
Hi.

660
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,886
Damn it. Shift's over.

661
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,081
See you tomorrow.

662
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,606
I'll go.

663
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,247
Hi. Uh, I wondered
if you could help me.

664
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,127
Sure.

665
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,764
I'm looking for a book.

666
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,251
Okay.

667
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,002
Does this book have a title?

668
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,923
Yes. Yes. Um...

669
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,848
It's called
<i>The Day Amanda Came.</i>

670
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,321
Ah.

671
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,849
Well, um, you'll have to wait.

672
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,565
I can't leave the desk.

673
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,684
I really need it.

674
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,165
Okay.

675
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,160
Only for you.

676
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,921
Shit.

677
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,729
So working here must be a drag.

678
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,291
I like it. It's
the only way I meet boys.

679
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,289
They're very,
very strict at Barnard.

680
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,203
Oh, really? How strict?

681
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,807
Well, for example, they
would never let me do this.

682
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,045
Right. No.

683
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,806
Go.

684
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,840
Did you know I've never done it

685
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,325
with someone who was Jewish before?

686
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,801
I'm really excited to
see what it looks like.

687
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,120
Well, uh...

688
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,240
I'm sorry.

689
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,450
I thought you were saying
something, but not saying it.

690
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,483
Should we find your book?

691
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,561
The key.

692
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,162
There is no book.

693
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,526
Take it off.

694
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,886
Really?

695
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,323
You. You take it off.
Oh, okay.

696
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,849
I'm not a virgin. I have done
it with four guys already.

697
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,242
You're kind of
a virgin though, huh?

698
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,642
No.
Liar.

699
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,645
See, if you have done it before,
you'll last for 30 seconds.

700
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,210
Start counting.

701
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,451
One,

702
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,921
two...

703
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,081
Three...

704
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,200
Four...

705
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,561
Five...

706
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,605
Six,

707
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,085
seven,

708
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,566
eight...

709
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,411
Nine...

710
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,527
Oh...

711
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,251
I knew it.

712
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,489
I bet you don't even read.

713
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,406
I do.

714
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,450
This is it, guys.
This is our Bastille.

715
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,770
No chickening out.

716

Excuse me.

729
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,842
I think I saw some light
or movement in the library.

730
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,850
What just happened?

731
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,610
We know you're here!

732
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,486
Come on.

733
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,921
Lu?

734
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,968
Bill, what the hell? It's locked!

735
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,365
This way.

736
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,643
I think they're this way.

737
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,129
We know you're here.

738
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,169
Come out!

739
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,761
Hey!

740
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,088
Lu, that's enough! What's
wrong with you? Come on.

741
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,571
Not yet.
We have to finish.

742
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,605
Enough now! It's over!

743
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,366
Let me go! Allen!

744
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,124
Let go! Let...

745
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,441
Allen! Get off of me.

746
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,646
One prick.

747
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,886
Allen.

748
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,286
Allen!

749
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,125
Let's go!

750
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,361
You guys open this
goddamn door right now.

751
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,329
Open this fucking door right now.

752
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,124
Open the fuck up.
Open the...

753
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,321
The South Hall library is a church

754
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,006
and these are the sacraments...

755
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,128
Oh, my

756
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,361
God.

757
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,481
To literacy.
To literacy indeed.

758
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,409
Jack, that's you, isn't it?

759
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,284
Yup. Last year.

760
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,570
They still won.

761
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,205
Look at them.

762
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,848
Souvenir history.

763
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,044
To make people think they
left some mark on the world.

764
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,205
Because otherwise,
nobody would ever know.

765
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,481
I never want to
end up on that wall.

766
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,248
Have no fear.
You never will.

767
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,045
What's he doing here?

768
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,880
Since you didn't stop by earlier,
I just hoped to give you this.

769
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,205
Maybe he didn't want to see you.

770
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,169
I think he can speak for himself.

771
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,806
Yup. He says that we should
all have another round.

772
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,570
You've had plenty
of time to celebrate.

773
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,567
Your library high jinks
made the morning paper.

774
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,961
I'm sure you're all very proud.

775
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,009
How do you know it was us?

776
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,725
Did he use that Bastille line?
'Cause I gave it to him.

777
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,931
I haven't seen you for days.

778
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,608
You left this at my place.

779
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,608
You told the guards we were there.
Nobody else knew.

780
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,490
You wanted me to get kicked out.
You ratted on me.

781
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,246
Stop, Lu. You're losing control.
You know what comes next.

782
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,367
I know what comes next.

783
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,561
Yeah.

784
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,645
Cut him off.

785
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,562
Best of luck, Janitor.

786
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,564
Excuse me?

787
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,250
We are over.

788
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,166
Leave.

789
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,485
Look at me, Lu.

790
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,767
You said I was everything to you.

791
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,764
You are everything to me.

792
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,721
Everything to me, do you hear me?

793
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,685
Let's go.

794
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,569
Please, Lu. Please?

795
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,651
David, time and place.

796
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,529
Shut up, traitor.

797
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,489
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.

798
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,449
You'd be boring
if it weren't for me.

799
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,170
And go!

800
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,006
Oh, my God!

801
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,730
Jack!
Jack!

802
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,005
Jack!

803
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,730
Ow!

804
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,644
He broke his fucking neck.

805
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,167
The warrior poet has passed on.

806
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,849
No!
Oh!

807
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,281
He lives!

808
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,481
Excellent!

809
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,801
Judges award a...

810
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,120
Nine!

811
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,161
Oh, my God.

812
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,361
Jack.

813
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,407
All right, Ginsy, your turn.

814
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,927
No, no, no, no.

815
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,168
This is just the beginning,
you know.

816
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,130
Your fault, Ginsy.

817
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,769
It's all your fault.

818
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,482
First thought, best thought.

819
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,162
I think I just puked on the inside.

820
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,925
Let's go, Jack.

821
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,201
What?

822
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,281
Wait.
Al, are you coming?

823
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,289
No, Allen's got work to do.

824
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,682
Ten pages on Spengler's <i>Decline
of the West.</i> Due tomorrow.

825
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,731
Excuse me?

826
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,841
I'd be lost without you, Ginsy.

827
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,090
Come on, lion.

828
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,881
Fuck!

829
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,562

831
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,125
My Edie bird.

832
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,851
I'm just gonna use the loo.

833
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,970
Say hi to Gram.

835
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,171
We invited her over for her birthday.
We made her a cake.

836
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,165
Well, then we should have a drink.

837
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,049
How about a drink, Grandma Frankie?

838
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,651
You want some red wine?

839
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,410
Where the hell have you been?

840
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,965
I was out.

841
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,845
I packed all your stuff.
It's in your bag.

842
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,450
I'm gonna be at Gram's tonight.

843
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,522
Whoa, hey, hey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

844
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,051
No, you just say that.
I'm sorry.

845
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,681
It's one of your million words,
and they don't mean anything.

846
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,730
Just don't be here when I
come back in the morning.

847
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,404
I know this is crazy.

848
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,970
I don't even know
what I'm doing here,

849
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,522
but I just had to

850
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,483
tell you I'm sorry.

851
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,682
Let me make it up to you.

852
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,002
Lu, where are you?

853
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,808
I'm going back to bed.

854
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,846
Another word and I call the police.

855
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,330

Jesus Christ!

857
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,203
What kind of sick son of a bitch
would do something like this?

858
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,121
It was David.

859
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,123
I'll wring his fucking neck.

860
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,330
It's okay. It's okay.

861
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,288
I have another idea.

862
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,205
Lu,

863
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,130
Your paper.

864
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,445
Where are you going?

865
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,245
Sailing out.

866
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,166
To Paris.

867
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,130
We're gonna make a ship
as merchant seamen.

868
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,009
Jack knows the tricks.

869
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,568
You weren't gonna tell me?

870
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,961
We both know why you can't come.

871
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,526
Fuck you!

872
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,330
You're a phony.

873
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,122
And you got me and Jack and Bill

874
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,531
making your vision come true

875
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,170
because you can't do it yourself.

876
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,561
No, Allen.

877
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,244
You got what you wanted.

878
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,926
You were ordinary, just
like every other freshman.

879
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,004
And I made your life extraordinary.

880
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,123
Go be you now, all by yourself.

881
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,326
Leave me alone.

882
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,770
You don't mean that.

883
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,683
Allen!
Please.

884
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,321
Leave.

885
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,244
Allen, have you seen him?

886
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,961
He's not in his room.

887
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,201
He left.

888
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,243
I did something wrong.

889
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,690
Really wrong.

890
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,564
You have no reason to help me.
But...

891
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,881
But?

892
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,684
I know who you are.

893
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,164
We're the ones he needs
but never wants.

894
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,641
It hurts, doesn't it?

895
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,289
All I'm asking is that
you tell me where he is.

896
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,211
Please.

897
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,483
Let me see your papers.

898
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,407
Two seamen reporting for duty.

899
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,285
What's your name?

900
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,610
Arthur Rimbaud.

901
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,562

902

that I would be here?

906
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,970
Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs.

907
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,371
I got us two passes.

908
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,801
I packed for both of us.

909
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,165
We can leave.

910
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,085
The reason I am leaving is you.

911
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,727
Then you and Jack take them.
I'll catch up.

912

964
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,127
called the police.

Listen.

966
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,086
Somehow he found me
at the Marine Hall.

967

He said that no matter where
I went, he would follow.

968

When I confronted him, he exploded.

977
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,242
<i>He told me to get a lawyer.</i>

978
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,965

01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,126
Dad?

995
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,169
It's $5,000 bail.

996
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,607
I know. I know it's a lot.

997
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,570
<i>No Kerouac was ever
wrapped up in a murder.</i>

998
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,005
<i>Go to hell!</i>

999
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,563
Would you all
just shut the hell up!

1000
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,531
You must understand that David has
been following him for years.

1001
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,241
When Lu went to Bowdoin, David
appeared out of thin air.

1002
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,810
So I sent him to Chicago.

1003
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,641
Surprise.

1004
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,369
David turned up there, too.

1005
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,088
Then when Lucien
wanted to go to Mexico,

1006
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,244
guess who had a car
idling in the driveway?

1007
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,682
But he didn't have to go with him.

1008
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,201
He spun a web to ensnare my son.

1009
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,607
That's why I brought him here.

1010
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,565
Lot of good that did.

1011
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,489
What happened in Chicago?

1012
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,091
Thank God Lu has you in his life.

1013
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,084
You know what, Allen?

1014
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,321
He calls you his guardian angel.

1015
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,605
That's what he called David.

1016
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,604
That man ruined my son.

1017
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,610
You're gonna help me
keep what's left of him.

1018
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,368
<i>Contrary to reports,</i>

1019
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,490
prison is not a tonic
for the spirit.

1020
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,965
All the district attorney cared
about was that David was queer.

1021
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,529
And what did you tell him?

1022
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,125
I said yes.

1023
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,765
Did David do something
to Lu in Chicago?

1024
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,249
Christ, Allen,
please don't get involved.

1025
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,845
I have to be.

1026
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,841
I'm helping him write his defense.

1027
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,249
David was my friend.

1028
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,525
And he's dead.

1029
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,211
And did Lucien
tell you how he died?

1030
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,127
<i>He might not have wanted
you to know, Allen.</i>

1031
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,602
<i>He tied David up.</i>

1032
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,811
<i>Put stones in his pockets
to weigh him down,</i>

1033
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,602
<i>and then dragged
him into the Hudson.</i>

1034
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,920
What?

1035
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,606
<i>He was alive, Allen,</i>

1036
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,365
<i>until Lucien made him drown.</i>

1037
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,731
Who are you?
Is he part of this business?

1038
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,484
Leave him alone, Dad.

1039
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,927
I paid your bail.

1040
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,162
Don't talk to me like that.

1041
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,204
Yes, sir.

1042

Well, then let me tell you.

1114
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,482
It's smutty and it's absurd.

1115
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,005
But you finished it.

1116

retract this fiction as your final

1125
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,361
