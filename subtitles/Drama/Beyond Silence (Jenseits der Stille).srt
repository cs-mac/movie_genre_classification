A film by
Caroline Link

2
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,989
BEYOND SI LENCE

3
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,703
Come on!

4
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,871
Great!

5
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,421
Did you hurt yourself?

6
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,577
It is thundering outside, Daddy.

7
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,741
It's so loud.
It goes BANG! BOOM! BAM!

8
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,252
It's like all hell's been let loose.

9
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,466
<i>Yes, that must have been very loud.</i>

10
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,526
<i>I can just imagine it.</i>

11
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,539
No, Daddy.
That wasn't loud.

12
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,407
Lightning is silent
like the moon.

13
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,911
It's just the thunder
that's noisy.

14
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,448
It's terribly loud.

15
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,541
<i>Ahh, thunder?</i>

16
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:17,454
<i>What would we do</i>
<i>without you and your ears?</i>

17
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,196
Daddy, you sound like a fish
blubbering through the water.

18
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,558
You're slurping.

19
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,304
The telephone is ringing.

20
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,036
Good morning.
Lara Bischoff speaking.

21
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,909
Hello, Grandma.

22
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,542
It's Grandma.
Her roses are wilting.

23
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,653
Mommy says your apartment is too warm.
You should put aspo...

24
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,528
aspirin into the water.

25
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,260
Are we coming for Christmas?

26
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,131
Sure, we are.

27
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,713
Grandma wants to talk to you.

28
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,807
I think he's already left.

29
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,250
I have to go to school.

30
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,083
Mommy, come here.

31
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,619
Okay, Grandma. Bye.

32
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:39,263
- "Hello. How are you?"
- "Fine, thanks."

33
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,984
- Good morning, Santa Claus.
- Good morning.

34
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,734
Daddy...

35
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,872
you wanted to enlarge
the poster for the school celebration.

36
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,852
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lara.

37
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,365
- I'm on my way.
- Lara! How are you?

38
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,499
- Fine.
- Does Martin know...

39
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,839
we don't get any
Christmas money this year?

40
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,573
- Is that bad?
- Well... Will you tell him?

41
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,447
If it's bad, tell him yourself.
I have to go to school.

42
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,247
Bye.

43
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,517
"Here, he thought...

44
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,388
is where...

45
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,590
Schatzhauser...

46
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,892
lives.

47
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,302
He took off..."

48
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,931
Lara, that was your homework.
Didn't you practice reading?

49
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,610
Didn't you have time?

50
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,307
Maybe she read it to her dad
and he thought it was great.

51
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,381
There's no getting
around it, Lara.

52
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,388
Reading is important.

53
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,316
If you don't work at home,
you'll have to stay after school.

54
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,157
Do you understand?

55
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,458
Continue reading, Uli,
but with feeling.

56
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,161
With feeling?

57
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,804
"And when he said that,
he was surprised to see..."

58
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,027
<i>How much longer will that take?</i>

59
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,088
<i>We have an appointment at the bank.!</i>

60
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,762
Not now! We have reading now.
That's important.

61
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,603
<i>Yes, learn to read proper.</i>

62
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,768
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

63
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,649
What's wrong now, Mommy?

64
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,781
- <i>I'll wait.</i>
- What's wrong?

65
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,692
Bea, what's so funny?

66
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,024
Lara's mother is outside.

67
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,189
What? Again?

68
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,096
This is the last time.

69
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,829
Next time, keep your waiting
out on the green.

70
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,978
"Life is the best teacher,
not school."

71
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,745
Great! Just tell that
to my teacher.

72
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,946
No, sorry.
I can't do anything till March 1.

73
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,353
They committed themselves
for half a year.

74
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,552
The return isn't payable till then.

75
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,461
<i>Ask about the money</i>
<i>we paid into the account.</i>

76
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,695
<i>Can't he give us back any of it?</i>
<i>We need money now.!</i>

77
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,397
<i>He can't, Daddy.</i>
<i>Stop begging.!</i>

78
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,336
<i>Ask him.!</i>

79
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,672
My father says thank you.
He's satisfied with your business.

80
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,268
I'm pleased.

81
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,645
- <i>He says no.</i>
- <i>You didn't ask.!</i>

82
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,412
- Can I help your parents?
- No, thank you.

83
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,049
Right. If I say
it won't work, it won't.

84
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,059
- Shall we go?
- Thank you, Lara.

85
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,925
My parents are your customers,
not me.

86
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,757
<i>Translate what I tell you.!</i>

87
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,427
- I did!
- Would you like some candy?

88
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,945
No, I don't hear anything yet.

89
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,647
"He was...

90
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,987
surprised...

91
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,391
to see..."

92
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,659
Yes, Daddy.
Now I can hear it.

93
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,730
It's nice music, Daddy.
Leave it on.

94
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,335
Okay, I'll keep on reading.

95
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:55,510
"Behind the thick pine..."

96
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,610
Yoo-hoo! Grandma! Grandpa!

97
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,320
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

98
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,896
<i>I don't remember how she looks...</i>

99
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,531
but she smells like
lilies of the valley and summer.

100
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,802
- Who?
- Clarissa.

101
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:55,540
When are they going to be here?
Robert is probably about to explode.

102
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,753
I really envy you.

103
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,020
You speak that magic tongue
as if it were a game.

104
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:12,690
If I hadn't listened to that pighead,
my hands might be able to fly too.

105
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,358
Will you help me set the table?

106
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,167
Hello, Clarissa and Gregor.

107
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,300
Hi, dear. Merry Christmas, you two.
How nice you're here.

108
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,937
I only came for the goose.
We're having roast goose, aren't we?

109
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,471
These belong in the living room.

110
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,916
I thought they belonged
in the attic.

111
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:38,514
- How has it been so far?
- Peaceful, and I hope it stays that way.

112
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,025
- Sure. It's Christmas.
- Exactly.

113
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,220
Why are you so late?

114
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,395
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- Merry Christmas.

115
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,867
Martin.

116
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,241
It's freezing outside!

117
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,810
And I forgot my blanket in heaven.

118
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,113
What do I see?

119
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,453
Nothing but old people!

120
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,761
Aren't there any...

121
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,764
What do you call those little...

122
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,494
Children!
Aren't there any in here?

123
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,092
You naughty girl!

124
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,571
I know who you are.
You aren't Santa Claus.

125
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,473
If you say that,
you won't get any presents.

126
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,806
Who am I?

127
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,279
Uncle Gregor...
No! Santa Claus!

128
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,108
You good little girl.

129
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,280
All of these things are...

130
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,317
for you!

131
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,417
Does it taste good?

132
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,054
I didn't know what to buy.

133
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,967
Take it.
I know that you can use it.

134
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,668
- Who gave you that nice book?
- Daddy.

135
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,971
- Lara, come here.
- Okay, Grandma.

136
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,782
- We'll read it later.
- Shall we play the piece from last year?

137
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,745
- What should I do?
- You can collect the napkins.

138
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,397
<i>I thought we'd read the book.</i>

139
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,230
Wait till Clarissa
is finished playing.

140
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,600
<i>Use your hands</i>
<i>when you talk to me.!</i>

141
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,484
Wonderful, you two.

142
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,222
Do you talk to the baby?

143
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,099
Sounds are very important
for babies.

144
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,833
- Is that right, Grandma?
- That's right.

145
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,239
Don't you want
to spend the night here?

146
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,004
Oh, yes! Please!

147
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,206
You'd need at least an hour
to drive home in this weather.

148
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,313
Don't cheat.

149
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,490
Here, this is for you.

150
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,152
What is it?

151
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,663
My first one.
I learned to play on it.

152
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,968
- Do you want it?
- Thank you, Clarissa.

153
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,977
Look. You press your lower lip
against your teeth.

154
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,450
Hey, you're talented.

155
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,260
Lara! Where are you?

156
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,594
- I have to go.
- Stay a while.

157
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,095
- I'll drive you home tomorrow.
- Oh, yes.

158
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,439
Ask her.

159
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,009
Clarissa wants me
to stay a while. May I?

160
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,106
She'll drive me home tomorrow.

161
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,174
Okay?

162
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,158
Look. This is my favorite color.

163
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,990
Mommy never puts on makeup.

164
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,163
When I was your age,
my hair was this short.

165
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,929
- Should I cut yours?
- No.

166
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,166
It would be pretty.

167
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:33,143
Okay, okay!
I won't do anything you don't want.

168
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,842
You see...

169
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,479
that was my haircut.

170
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,420
- Is that Dad?
- Yes.

171
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,460
That's us about 20 years ago.
Look at Grandma.

172
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,486
- You didn't like him?
- Who do you mean?

173
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,498
Martin?

174
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,500
Did he say that?

175
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,798
That's wrong.

176
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,396
When we were young,
we were very close.

177
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,065
And then?

178
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,636
You know your father.
He can really be stubborn sometimes.

179
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,513
Your grandma always took his side.
He could do everything.

180
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,676
On his 15th birthday...

181
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,552
he knocked all the cups
and plates off the table.

182
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,114
And Grandma didn't even
bat an eyelid.

183
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,219
He was always her favorite.
I never had a chance.

184
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,230
But you never learned his language.

185
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,823
Yes, I did. A bit.

186
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:33,463
As kids, we made up
our own sign language.

187
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,939
But the doctors said
it was a mistake...

188
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,377
that sign language apparently
kept him from learning to speak.

189
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,005
You look pretty in that dress.

190
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,147
Well, what do you say?
Shall I cut it off?

191
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,919
Don't be afraid.
I'll make you look beautiful.

192
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,626
<i>I told you to come this afternoon.</i>

193
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,399
<i>What happened to you?</i>

194
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,284
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

195
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,823
<i>Now you look like her.</i>

196
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,354
<i>That's what you wanted, right?</i>

197
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,426
<i>We're stuck together.</i>

198
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,265
Let me go!

199
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,804
Hey, Daddy! Let me go!

200
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,198
Mommy, why can't you ride a bike?

201
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,170
You have a bad sense of balance
because of your ears.

202
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,875
I want you to learn how.
Every real mother can ride a bike.

203
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,721
When the baby's born. Promise?

204
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,570
Hey, you in there,
don't be afraid.

205
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,837
Out here, life
isn't completely quiet.

206
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:30,678
When you come, I'll be here, and I'll
play a song for you on my new clarinet.

207
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,439
How often have I told you?
The cellos are too high.

208
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,451
Mr. Gartner!

209
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,320
Not now! We're rehearsing!
The flute players don't listen!

210
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,020
Frau Mertens sent me down.
I play the clarinet.

211
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:20,155
- Can you read notes?
- She can't even read any books!

212
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,262
Come over here.

213
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:30,164
Some things take time.
I haven't given up hope yet...

214
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,076
that you'll master the triangle
by the next parents' evening.

215
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,015
C-D-F-G.

216
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,589
Wonderful.
Now hold the last tone.

217
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,622
Great.
Now from the beginning again.

218
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,256
"Does Good Claus Do Fun Games."

219
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,130
I didn't want to learn poems.

220
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,050
My homework?
I don't have any.

221
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,103
I'm not wasting time.
Mrs. Mertens said I've gotten better.

222
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,235
What are you doing?
Give me back my clarinet!

223
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,578
What? Music keeps me
from learning?

224
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,050
Nonsense! Learning
isn't more important!

225
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,680
You don't know what's important!
You're deaf!

226
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,589
You don't even know
what music is!

227
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,060
You're mean!
You never cared about my schoolwork.

228
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,792
Neither you nor Mommy did!

229
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,392
You just don't want me
to play the clarinet!

230
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,130
I hate you!

231
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,512
<i>I'm going to lose her.</i>

232
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:24,479
<i>Only if you make the same mistake</i>
<i>your parents did.</i>

233
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,519
<i>What do you mean?</i>

234
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,623
<i>Accept her for what she is.</i>

235
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,689
<i>She can hear,</i>
<i>and we are deaf.</i>

236
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,395
<i>She is my child.</i>

237
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,006
<i>But she doesn't belong to you.</i>

238
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,275
The baby!

239
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,060
It'll take that long?
I want to stay.

240
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,627
I'll stay here with you
till the baby comes.

241
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,579
Yes, they make a sound.
They sound like bells.

242
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,248
The more wind there is,
the louder they ring.

243
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,998
Were you happy too
when Clarissa was born?

244
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,836
At first. And then?

245
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,439
Didn't you ever play together
when you were my age?

246
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,444
Why?

247
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,485
When Clarissa was nine or ten...

248
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:54,498
she gave her first concert
in front of a large audience.

249
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,764
Grandpa had invited
lots of important people.

250
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,471
I think it was
his 50th birthday.

251
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,477
Everyone was very excited
on that day.

252
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,709
Clarissa had to play
several pieces on the clarinet.

253
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,343
She had practiced them
for a long time.

254
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,877
Grandpa was very proud
of his daughter.

255
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,258
From then on, she never played again
when I was in the room...

256
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,266
and so I spent many evenings
alone in my room.

257
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,752
I have this from a friend
who teaches at a high school.

258
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,283
It may be a bit difficult,
but try it.

259
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,263
This is your first music
with triplets.

260
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,495
When you reach this point,
count to yourself: 1, 2, 3...

261
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,733
- That fast?
- No.

262
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,899
As fast as you can.
Since everything is in G major...

263
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,909
So this is F sharp.

264
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,544
1, 2, 3.

265
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,459
Hey, Mommy! Don't!

266
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,169
Don't, Mommy!

267
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:52,743
I wanted to read her a story.
I'm supposed to talk to her a lot.

268
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,648
Oh, yeah?
How do you know she's tired?

269
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,685
Did she tell you that?

270
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,427
Okay.

271
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,195
Marie? Can you hear that?

272
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,490
Hey, you can hear!

273
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,227
She can hear!
Marie, you can hear!

274
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,610
<i>But why are you suffering?</i>

275
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,582
<i>No, everything is different.</i>

276
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,414
<i>I'm not like I used to be.</i>

277
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,818
<i>But there's one thing</i>
<i>you have to know.</i>

278
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,686
<i>You love me.</i>
<i>You know you love me.</i>

279
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,487
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

280
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,894
<i>Look at me, Maria.</i>
<i>We have our whole lives ahead of us.</i>

281
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,963
<i>You and me.</i>

282
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,559
<i>Nothing can come between us.</i>

283
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,434
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>we'll always stay together.</i>

284
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,241
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,422
A bike ride?

286
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,584
But you don't know how, Mommy.

287
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,268
Except for the triangle,
everything was quite nice.

288
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,437
- I'm not so good at music.
- You don't say!

289
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:19,472
And if the trumpet player
would kindly remove his chewing gum...

290
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:27,281
It's nice that you've come.
Lara is a wonderful pupil, you see...

291
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,759
but she won't be able to pass...

292
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,787
unless she improves
her reading and writing.

293
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,797
<i>My reading is improving,</i>
<i>but it isn't perfect yet.</i>

294
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,441
And we can't always allow her
to leave class early.

295
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,209
<i>Tell her we're happy that she</i>
<i>lets you leave class early sometimes.</i>

296
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,142
Are you finished yet?

297
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:58,484
<i>It's difficult to find</i>
<i>a good translator here.</i>

298
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,587
It's summer vacation soon.
Then I won't have to leave early.

299
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:10,163
That's my last word on the matter!
Next time, I won't let you go.

300
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,931
<i>You're a wonderful teacher.</i>
<i>Lara really likes you.</i>

301
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,166
She says you're quite nice.

302
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,110
- They're pretty. Thank you.
- At last!

303
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,948
I finally get to meet you!

304
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,457
Your daughter is extremely talented.

305
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,016
For the parents' evening, I've reserved
two seats for you in the first row.

306
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,652
Okay?

307
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,391
<i>This is my music teacher.</i>

308
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:46,528
<i>He says it's a shame that you never</i>
<i>allow me to play the clarinet.</i>

309
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,544
We have to pick up our baby.
Any more questions?

310
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,375
Lara, you told them
how worried I am?

311
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,939
I told them everything...
not word for word, but more or less.

312
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,684
The easiest note is G.
No fingers. Look!

313
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,691
But I never get to play it.

314
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,220
Maybe it's too simple
for them to use.

315
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,806
I did it on the bus.
There's more I have to read...

316
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,173
but I can do it tomorrow.

317
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,552
Are you going tomorrow?

318
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,523
Of course, the baby.

319
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,050
"The sun resounds
in age-old fashion...

320
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,197
in brotherly spheres
of rival calls...

321
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,528
completing its appointed action...

322
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,626
by rendering up its thundersqualls.

323
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,830
The sight of it
gives angels strength...

324
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,233
though its wisdom
is never proclaimed.

325
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,576
These works
of baffling magnificence...

326
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,582
dazzle as if they'd just been made."

327
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,302
It's your turn.
Is everything okay?

328
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,971
You'll do a good job.
You'll play very, very well.

329
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,714
And now Lara Bischoff
from Class 3C.

330
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,582
She'll play a piece on the clarinet.

331
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:18,771
It's absolutely the best school.
Students come from all over the world.

332
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,978
What do you think?
It's a question of Lara's future.

333
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:30,847
You want to take away
my only talented student?

334
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,355
That's not very funny.

335
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,621
She has to develop her talent,
and you can't become anything here.

336
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,063
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure. Berlin?

337
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,158
I'd have to rent a room.
That's too expensive.

338
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,261
There are other ways.

339
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,898
You think Dad
would take your money?

340
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,101
It isn't for him,
it's for you.

341
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,942
- I could write a recommendation.
- Music isn't that important to me.

342
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:00,279
If you don't accept that offer,
you'll be missing your big chance.

343
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,548
You can't look after your parents
your whole life!

344
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,616
You show up once a year,
and every time you have a new idea.

345
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,321
- Sometimes I think you're just bored.
- Exactly.

346
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,159
Here's my final offer:

347
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:18,099
Spend the summer with us,
and we'll practice every day.

348
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,569
All summer long
we'll practice and go to concerts...

349
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,971
and see if you can pass
the entrance exam.

350
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,874
- Would you like to?
- May I come along?

351
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,878
You know I'd like to.

352
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,712
You can't imagine how boring it is
all day with your uncle.

353
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,555
Look!

354
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,017
What about Marie?
Can't she make calls for you?

355
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,690
Okay, I'll be right there.

356
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,211
I got something to drink
with some girlfriends.

357
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:46,550
Sure, I'll bring them along sometime.
I have to make some calls for Mom.

358
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,113
<i>You see this beautiful night?</i>

359
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,654
<i>Take a good look.</i>

360
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,659
<i>Things change quickly.</i>

361
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,257
<i>Spring will begin soon.</i>

362
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,303
<i>The snow will melt.</i>

363
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,896
<i>How does snow sound?</i>

364
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,135
<i>What does it say to you?</i>

365
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:47,315
It says, "Crunch, crunch, brr, brr."

366
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:51,616
<i>What are "crunch"and "brr"?</i>
<i>What kind of words are they?</i>

367
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,682
To tell the truth,
snow doesn't say much.

368
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,786
It's even said that snow
swallows every sound.

369
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,890
When snow is on the ground,
everything is much quieter.

370
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,662
<i>Honest?</i>

371
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,966
<i>Snow makes the world quiet?</i>

372
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,233
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

373
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,867
Clarissa was at school today.

374
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,411
I didn't know she was here myself.

375
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,754
It's her birthday soon.
Grandpa wants to take us all to dinner.

376
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,622
Won't you come with us, please?
For my sake.

377
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,003
- Hey, you pig!
- It's only chocolate.

378
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,048
- Before dinner?
- Bettina treated me.

379
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,878
Bettina's sleeping over.
Her parents aren't home.

380
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,220
- Can we use your clarinet?
- By no means!

381
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,055
Why not?
Afraid I'll break it?

382
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,096
Have you set the table yet?

383
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,893
Let me show Bettina! Please!

384
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,763
Stop it! You won't get it!

385
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,802
If you're bored,
you can help Mom in the kitchen.

386
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,737
I don't want your stupid stick!

387
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,707
Your music gets on
everybody's nerves anyway!

388
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,543
Ouch, Mommy! Ouch! Help!

389
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,118
Nothing.

390
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,918
Louder! Come on, hurry up!

391
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,764
Ouch! Mommy! Help!

392
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,740
Marie, did you hurt yourself?

393
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,905
What's the big idea?

394
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,347
Bettina thought that
maybe our parents aren't deaf.

395
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:05,116
Maybe they're spies
who were sent here to observe us.

396
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,749
We just tested Mommy.

397
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,124
Are you nuts?

398
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,719
What for?
Aren't you ashamed?

399
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:41,590
She thinks it's funny. She also
made up crazy stuff when she was little.

400
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,628
How's your work with children going?

401
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,104
I think I'll stop teaching.

402
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,939
But that Keller girl
really improved with you.

403
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,535
Her family moved to Frankfurt
a month ago.

404
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,207
The others aren't really interested.

405
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,909
That's boring.

406
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,316
What do you think about it, Gregor?

407
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,915
Me? Yes, of course she's talented.

408
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:18,519
The kids are crazy about her,
but if she doesn't want to...

409
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,992
Don't let the pleasure principle
run your life!

410
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,435
You have to do something
besides spending your husband's money!

411
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,702
That isn't fair.
I've always earned my living.

412
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,072
Sure, but how?

413
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,649
Sorry I didn't meet
your expectations, Dad.

414
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,946
Money is not the subject here.

415
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,988
Stop all the arguing, will you!

416
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,455
After all,
it's Clarissa's birthday.

417
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,687
"After all, it's Christmas!"

418
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,162
It's not my fault
we only see each other on holidays!

419
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:59,368
If you had kids or a family...
What do you do all day?

420
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,462
- She cleans up.
- Exactly.

421
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,837
You clean up, huh?

422
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:10,007
She'll have enough to do
when Lara comes for the summer.

423
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,911
- Marie!
- What?

424
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,509
- Lara is staying with you?
- You haven't told them yet?

425
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:21,048
What are you talking about anyway?
Don't keep us in suspense.

426
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,221
- What hasn't Lara told us?
- Let me tell...

427
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,289
You're afraid to.
Lara is spending the summer with me.

428
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,564
I'm preparing her
for the entrance exam...

429
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,470
and if all goes well, she'll attend
the conservatory in the fall.

430
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,636
Berlin?
Isn't there anything nearby?

431
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:44,579
That's a good idea.
Lara's talent should be developed.

432
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,946
Perhaps she'll
make something of herself.

433
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,349
But Berlin is far away.

434
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:53,287
You'd have to live there.
You want to move out?

435
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,690
Lara is 18.
There's a time for everyone.

436
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,194
It won't work
if Martin and Kai don't approve.

437
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,856
Do you have to stab me in the back?

438
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,866
Stab you in the back?

439
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,529
I'm happy I can say anything
in this family.

440
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,102
Leave her alone.
She's a wonderful clarinet player...

441
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,110
and I want to help her.

442
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,012
We'll pay for it.
Don't worry.

443
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,074
She has to get out of that nest.
She's looked after you long enough!

444
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,087
- Stop it, Clarissa!
- Why?

445
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:30,092
That school is just right for her.
And you can visit her if you like.

446
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,358
But we wanted to go to Italy
this summer.

447
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:39,368
This is more important.
Martin and Kai have to approve.

448
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,630
Lara shouldn't be handicapped
just because her parents are!

449
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,110
I'm the father!
She is my daughter!

450
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,414
Sit down!

451
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,686
Clarissa, you went too far this time!

452
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,887
Sure, it's all my fault again.

453
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,795
He throws red wine in my face,
and you stand up for him!

454
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,270
I wanted to tell you this evening,
but Clarissa told you first.

455
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,277
Nothing is decided yet.

456
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,872
Clarissa wants me to apply
for the exam. That's all!

457
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,110
She only wants to help me.

458
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:36,285
She isn't conceited.
That's nonsense!

459
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,886
Do you think you and Mom
can get along without me?

460
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,326
I treat you like a baby.

461
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,701
I can leave if I want to.

462
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,536
Then what's the reason?

463
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,846
<i>I ruined their evening again.</i>

464
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,480
<i>They felt ashamed for me,</i>
<i>as always.</i>

465
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,389
Who cares?
It isn't important.

466
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:14,362
<i>Why Clarissa, of all people?</i>
<i>Don't you know how much it hurts me?</i>

467
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,798
I want to become a musician.
That's all.

468
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,473
Try to understand me.

469
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,037
<i>Sometimes I wish you were deaf.</i>

470
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,741
<i>Then you'd be totally in my world.</i>

471
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:52,133
It's mean that you're leaving. Now I
have to translate all of Mom's movies.

472
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,569
Stop whining!
You don't help out much anyway.

473
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,838
Can I at least sleep in your bed
while you're gone?

474
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,879
If it makes you happy.

475
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,143
Yes, it does.
And don't touch my teddy bear.

476
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,795
Why do parents
only talk about homework?

477
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:42,412
When I was little, I believed
that all grown-ups could sing.

478
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,114
I also thought I'd be able to
when I was a grown-up.

479
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:53,120
I'd stand in front of a mirror
and move my mouth...

480
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,996
and pretend that wonderful sounds
were coming out...

481
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:02,470
sounds that made people look
so ecstatic, so happy... music!

482
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:11,009
I danced in front of the mirror and held
a brush as if it were a microphone.

483
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,735
What's this, Mom?

484
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:41,171
You don't know if I like this music.

485
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:45,578
It's a clarinet concert.
You read about it in the newspaper.

486
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:51,583
I'm sure it will be very good.
But why two tickets?

487
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,353
We'll have a nice evening.
It's wonderful you're coming along.

488
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,367
Thank you.

489
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:31,517
- It's nice you're here.
- Why didn't Clarissa come?

490
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,927
She isn't feeling so well
this morning.

491
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,798
Nothing serious.
She perks up after dark.

492
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:55,548
- Hello, Clarissa.
- Hello. This is my niece, Lara.

493
00:55:55,618 --> 00:56:00,521
Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang,
Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter.

494
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,218
- Hello.
- Are you visiting in Berlin?

495
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:07,821
She wants to go to the conservatory, but
she has to get used to the city first.

496
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,202
- You're a musician?
- Not yet.

497
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,468
She plays the clarinet very well.

498
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,511
And now you want to see Berlin?

499
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,257
Lara, come here!

500
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:31,836
- This is my lake.
- Right in the middle of town!

501
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,309
It's the only place
that makes me feel melancholy.

502
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,370
It always reminds me of home.

503
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,315
It froze over last winter.

504
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,890
What if somebody comes?

505
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,215
Well?

506
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:58,852
I don't like melancholy stuff. They ruin
my mood for the rest of the day.

507
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,829
Don't worry.
I'll find you some nice pieces.

508
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:07,497
I don't know if I want to play
anything else. I like the music.

509
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,770
- But you won't get accepted with that.
- Who says?

510
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,106
I do. Or are you keen on depressing
the examiners to death?

511
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,703
I think they should accept you.

512
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,477
This is ridiculous.
The greatest composers...

513
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,019
Either believe me, or try it alone.

514
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,639
<i>A stupid feeling</i>
<i>being stared at, huh?</i>

515
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,873
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

516
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,882
<i>I noticed.</i>

517
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,357
<i>Hello. I'm Johanna.</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

518
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,555
<i>L-a-r-a.</i>

519
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,064
<i>T-o-m.</i>

520
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:54,365
<i>We're going to the park, but he let me</i>
<i>take a quick look in here.</i>

521
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,735
<i>Right. And "quick"is almost over.</i>

522
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,943
- Can I help you?
- We'd like those gloves.

523
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,811
Aren't you deaf?

524
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,584
Not me. You?

525
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,915
- How much?
- Five marks. What do you want?

526
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:24,232
My father's deaf.
He raised me all by himself.

527
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,394
And now I'm a teacher
at a school for the deaf.

528
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,769
We were actually supposed to work
on articulation today.

529
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,186
In two months, I'll be gone anyway.

530
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,355
I'm going to the Gallaudet School
in Washington for a semester.

531
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:59,458
The deaf can study medicine,
art history, law...

532
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,469
all in sign language.

533
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:06,804
Americans recognize it as a language.
They're at least 20 years ahead of us.

534
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,937
I always wanted a father
I could be proud of...

535
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,347
one who protected me from the world
and sang me to sleep every night.

536
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:19,320
One who can't understand why you like
Guns 'n Roses more than Beethoven.

537
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,322
Exactly.

538
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:29,656
- 6:30. I have to go.
- 6:30. That's very late!

539
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,861
You can come visit me at school.
I'm there every day.

540
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,872
Perhaps.

541
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:23,207
- I thought I'd visit you.
- This is Lara.

542
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:29,249
She came for a visit.
She may become a teacher too.

543
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,727
- Lie down.
- What should I do?

544
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,232
Lie down on the floor
on your stomach.

545
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,904
Or don't you want to take part?

546
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,907
Okay.

547
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,619
Wait and close your eyes.

548
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:44,999
Poor Lara.
I'm afraid she can't feel the music.

549
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,669
Will you go to the movies
with me tomorrow?

550
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,024
"At The Lake! Come And Join Me."

551
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,966
Where did Gregor drive off to?

552
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,637
He's looking for an apartment.

553
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:31,544
He said he gets a toothache
from my music.

554
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,276
- They're all against us.
- Every one of them.

555
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,553
Why didn't you and Gregor
have a baby?

556
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:57,563
I don't know whose fault it was.
It never worked out.

557
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:03,875
Maybe Mother Nature didn't want
to entrust a baby to a mother like me.

558
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,818
I did everything wrong.

559
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:16,483
Martin has you, Kai,
Marie and a real home.

560
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,050
I have nothing.

561
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,494
That's not true.

562
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:26,024
You have so much. You're pretty and
strong, and you make wonderful music.

563
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,900
I always wanted to be like you.

564
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,881
It was a nice movie, wasn't it?

565
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:52,724
- Didn't you like it?
- Movies like that somehow make me sad.

566
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,888
Love stories with a happy ending
make you sad?

567
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,454
Yeah.

568
01:08:56,532 --> 01:09:01,526
They make me unhappy with what I have.
I mean, they make you so hopeful.

569
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,732
Hope is a widespread evil.

570
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:09,437
You have to be careful with your dreams.
Most of them never come true.

571
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:13,175
Why so serious? You're not even 20
and talk like Mrs. Kowalschek.

572
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,183
- Who?
- My caretaker.

573
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:20,052
But she's 70, fat and ugly
and sits at the window with her poodle.

574
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:24,149
- Isn't there anything nice in your life?
- Very little.

575
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:29,061
You're making me crazy,
you ungrateful creature!

576
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:32,396
Don't feel so sorry for yourself!

577
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,402
But I'm hungry.

578
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,418
- I want a schnitzel!
- What? A schnitzel!

579
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,763
- Two schnitzels, please.
- I don't have any money.

580
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,495
It's on me.

581
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,131
- Would you like ketchup on it?
- No, thank you.

582
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,883
Gloria Gaynor!
I loved it when I was 14.

583
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,676
Come here.

584
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,552
Come closer.

585
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,022
Your mother had an accident
on her bike yesterday.

586
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,226
She's dead.

587
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,972
There's no sound, Dad.
It's soundless.

588
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,935
It was a mistake for her
to ride a bike.

589
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,270
She had problems
with her sense of balance.

590
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,377
Are you trying to say it's my fault?

591
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,213
Look at me!
Talk to me, damn it!

592
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,616
You don't believe that!

593
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,648
What should I do?

594
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,955
The music bothers you.

595
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:38,765
You don't want any music in your house?
In your house?

596
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:52,677
I'm sure I won't be home later
than 11:00 if the bus is on time. Okay?

597
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:56,616
- Do you have to go?
- Yes. I haven't been out for months.

598
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:01,622
And I'm about to go crazy.
Anyway, the tickets are from Mom.

599
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:05,057
Why can't I go with you?
You have two.

600
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:09,860
Someone has to stay with Dad.
You have to put him to bed.

601
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,362
He can put himself to bed.
I'm not his baby-sitter.

602
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,132
Watch it, miss. Don't get cheeky.

603
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,137
- How do I look?
- Too flashy.

604
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:26,078
- Really? Clarissa uses makeup too.
- Clarissa is good-looking.

605
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,949
I love you.
You know that, don't you?

606
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,684
Tom?

607
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,459
What are you doing here?

608
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,194
You rode past me on the bus.

609
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:43,203
I wanted to see how you're doing.

610
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:47,067
Your aunt told me that...

611
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,508
I'm flying tomorrow evening.

612
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:52,746
I'm very sorry...

613
01:20:54,749 --> 01:21:00,153
I just heard a wonderful concert.
I have to get into that school.

614
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:04,056
I just have to.
Do you think I'm good enough?

615
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:08,425
- I've never heard you play.
- Shall I play for you now?

616
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,226
- Now?
- Why not?

617
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,996
There must be some advantage
in having deaf fathers.

618
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:19,530
- Well, you're in a good mood again.
- But my sister hears everything.

619
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:32,947
- Don't you need a light for the notes?
- I have everything in my head.

620
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:38,722
Don't judge me too harshly.
I just made this piece up.

621
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:57,793
Can I stay in your apartment?
I have to prepare myself for the exam.

622
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,801
- And I want to leave here.
- I've rented it to a friend.

623
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,803
I can't let him down.

624
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:13,112
Hey. What's wrong with you?

625
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:19,316
Little Lara,
why are you so terribly sad?

626
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:26,315
The saddest things in life
are separations and deaths.

627
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:31,463
I don't want to say good-bye anymore.
I've had enough of that.

628
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:35,299
You aren't rid of me yet.
Our story's just beginning.

629
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:40,537
What a great couple... a clarinet player
and a teacher for the deaf.

630
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,969
I don't want you to go.

631
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,877
I'm almost back.

632
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:23,106
- Where were you?
- I was out walking.

633
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:28,679
- Aren't you a bit late?
- What? It's only 7:15.

634
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,224
Was the concert nice?

635
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:38,860
Yes. Around 12:00, I think.

636
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,161
So what? I wasn't home by 11:00.

637
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:48,403
But I'm 18, and I can be
an hour late if I want.

638
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,776
You're allowed to do some things,
but not everything. Hey, what's up?

639
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,854
But he won't allow you...

640
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:04,085
to bring men home
to the living room.

641
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,218
Who was here?

642
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:16,761
What did I do wrong this time, Dad?
What do you hold against me?

643
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,830
That I'm irresponsible?
That I'm egotistic...

644
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,376
and that I only think of myself
and my music?

645
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:27,244
That I stabbed you and Mom in the back?
That I'm on Clarissa's side?

646
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:31,649
Let me tell you something.
I can't stand it here...

647
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,916
your silent, reproachful looks,
your complaints.

648
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:39,255
The silence here, the noise you make
when you read the paper...

649
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,261
when you eat,
when you brush your teeth.

650
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,923
This house is like a cage.

651
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,829
Get out of here!

652
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,834
I've had enough!

653
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,824
Yes?

654
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:18,354
I'm looking for my aunt...
Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here?

655
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,400
What are you doing here?
Come in.

656
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,442
Your uncle has chosen to live alone.

657
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:37,175
You did the right thing.
Your music is more important.

658
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,618
Martin will understand.

659
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,547
You have no idea.

660
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,320
- What's wrong now?
- You have no right to condemn him.

661
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:51,092
You never even tried
to understand him.

662
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:53,030
Lara, I want you to be free...

663
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:56,195
What do you really want from me?

664
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:00,799
Sometimes I think you want me
to study at that school for your sake.

665
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:04,208
Nonsense! I want you to be good,
really good.

666
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,443
Your problems only distract you
from your music.

667
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:12,850
Sure. You want me to be good,
but not better than you.

668
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,749
That's not fair.

669
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:21,056
That's why you oppose my music.
You think it's boring, depressing.

670
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:26,066
If you were really interested, you would
have encouraged me, but you never did.

671
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:29,831
Slow down, ladies.
No need to get excited.

672
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:33,499
Shut up! You have no idea
what we're talking about!

673
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,707
Coffee?

674
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,405
Just like your father.

675
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,312
- Now I see what you're really like.
- Exactly.

676
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:47,287
I'm my father's child
and not the daughter you never had.

677
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,346
And most of all, I'm not you.

678
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:16,210
My publishing company is over there.

679
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,748
You can sleep here.

680
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,727
Sleep tight.

681
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:32,558
My deadline is next month.
The publisher is impatient.

682
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:36,467
- I'll only practice when you're gone.
- Practice whenever you want.

683
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:40,303
After 12 years with your aunt,
I can sleep no matter how noisy it is.

684
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:47,411
Do you regret having moved out?

685
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,585
Not really.

686
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,815
But maybe I will.

687
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,259
Why did you leave?

688
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:04,187
Clarissa has no need for me.

689
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,733
Her mind is filled with you,
Robert and Martin.

690
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,292
But they always argue.

691
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:13,830
Yet, I wish she had
loved me as much.

692
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:19,437
Her damned health food got on my nerves
too. Everything's green in her fridge.

693
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:23,177
I don't eat anything that's green,
besides chewing gum.

694
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:52,128
Yes?

695
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,606
Marie! Where are you?

696
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:58,270
Very near. Downtown.
Can you pick me up?

697
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:02,077
- I don't know what subway to take.
- Are you okay?

698
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,707
Yes.

699
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,977
My goodness.

700
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:19,258
Are you out of your mind?
Alone by train?

701
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,860
- Why are you here anyway?
- To visit you.

702
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:27,237
That's why you went 300 miles by train?
But I have no time.

703
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,472
- Does Dad know you're here?
- Sure. I wrote him a note.

704
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,415
What did you write?

705
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,419
That I was going to a party
after school...

706
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:43,821
but I didn't write that the party
was 300 miles away.

707
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,326
- What does he say?
- About what?

708
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,389
You know.
Does he talk about me?

709
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,034
I don't think what you said
was so nice either.

710
01:32:56,103 --> 01:33:00,938
Oh, shut up.
You don't have to tell me that too.

711
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:06,509
Can you come back soon, please?

712
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:11,712
- The exam is in a few days.
- And how do I get back home?

713
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:14,482
What? Don't you have a return ticket?

714
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:20,459
I used up all my money.
And it's gonna be night soon.

715
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:22,826
And I'm only nine.

716
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:28,793
Oh, shit.

717
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:35,474
There's a problem sleeping here.

718
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,940
Come here and you'll see.

719
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:42,346
We need your help.

720
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,785
Yes, a family affair.

721
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:54,284
The tank is full.
I filled up yesterday.

722
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:58,431
Are you good?

723
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,661
Sure.

724
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:05,365
- It goes 140 miles per hour?
- But drive carefully.

725
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:09,403
See you tomorrow.

726
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:12,173
Take care, Marie. Say hi to Martin.

727
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:38,936
<i>Other fathers are proud</i>
<i>of their daughters...</i>

728
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,941
<i>when they're successful.</i>

729
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:44,000
<i>Why don't you help me?</i>

730
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:03,889
You can't let me go in there alone.
Daddy will tear me apart.

731
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:07,297
I drove you here. Now you walk
the last ten yards yourself.

732
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:13,068
- Please.
- Go on. He'll be happy you're back.

733
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,927
I drove Marie home.

734
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:46,131
<i>Thank you.</i>

735
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:50,075
Hey! Since when does Clarissa
know our language?

736
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:55,441
<i>Is Lara still at your place?</i>
<i>Is she all right?</i>

737
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:59,213
No, she's sad.

738
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:01,220
She misses you.

739
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,950
Come on. I'll take you to her.

740
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:09,257
<i>Why didn't she come with you?</i>

741
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:13,630
She doesn't have the time.
You have to go to her.

742
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:17,467
Oh, yes! We'll all go
right back there together!

743
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,802
<i>No, I can't.</i>

744
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,675
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!

745
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:30,342
<i>It must be a family problem.</i>

746
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:48,697
Oh, Daddy!
Why didn't you go there with her?

747
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:51,704
<i>If you ever run away again...</i>

748
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,332
<i>I'll spank the living daylights</i>
<i>out of you.</i>

749
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:39,179
- Which instrument?
- Clarinet.

750
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,849
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

751
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:58,132
Lara Bischoff.
Come with me, please.

752
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,775
Miss Bischoff...

753
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:12,615
in your application, you wrote you're
interested in traditional Idezmer music.

754
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:18,991
- Why are you interested in it?
- That's hard to say. It's a feeling...

755
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,755
Perhaps because it's so emotional.

756
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:24,559
Emotional? Well, well.

757
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:28,466
Inside it's joyful and wild,
and at the same time...

758
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,504
it's sad and not really free.

759
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:34,097
It's a feeling I understand
very well.

760
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:38,277
Do you know what I mean?

761
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:40,813
Then let's begin
with your main subject.

762
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:43,679
Miss Bischoff,
you've brought along three pieces?

763
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:48,882
Yes. If you don't object,
I'll begin with the contemporary piece.

764
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:52,858
As you wish.
The order is unimportant.

765
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:15,313
<i>I want to see you play.</i>
<i>Is that okay?</i>

766
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,950
We're waiting.

767
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:22,721
Don't you feel well?

768
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:26,851
Would you like some water?
Take a deep breath.

769
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:31,955
Then begin.
It's not as bad as you think.

770
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:35,832
<i>Calm down.</i>
<i>I just want to wish you luck.</i>

771
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:39,168
What's going on?
Why did you come?

772
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:41,969
<i>To see what's so important to you...</i>

773
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:44,806
<i>and to see how you play.</i>

774
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:52,385
- Excuse me. Would you let us in on this?
- Yes.

775
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:55,047
That's my father. He's deaf.

776
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:57,352
He'd like to watch.

777
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,596
All right. If he'd like to.
But I must ask you to begin.

778
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:11,400
<i>That's right.! Show them.!</i>

779
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:16,205
Please, Dad. Stop talking.
I'm getting all mixed up.

780
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:05,315
<i>So that's your music?</i>

781
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,588
Yes, it's my music.

782
01:42:09,656 --> 01:42:12,557
Do you think you'll ever
be able to understand it?

783
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:15,993
<i>Maybe I can't hear it...</i>

784
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:20,363
<i>but I'll try to "understand"it.</i>

785
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:33,043
<i>Have I lost you?</i>

786
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:37,675
I've loved you
ever since I was born.

787
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:41,881
You'll never lose me.

788
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:02,435
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

789
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
