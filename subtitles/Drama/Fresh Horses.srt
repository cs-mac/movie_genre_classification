1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,967
"The head of the family
is the one with the tail."

2
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:12,271
God, I want to see this.

3
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:13,673
Finding everything okay, Louis?

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,240
Oh, uh, yep.

5
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,009
Thanks, Corey. Just browsing.

6
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:18,777
In the Critter Capers section?

7
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,044
Oh.

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,847
I thought it said "Criterion Capers."

9
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:27,736
Like silent French police dramas.

10
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:28,781
Inspector.

11
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,257
Oh,
here's the movie I was looking for.

12
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:34,391
"La Choffey."

13
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:35,592
"La Chouffe."

14
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:38,395
Gnome's folly. It's a great choice.

15
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,663
See, this is why

16
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,199
you're one of our favorite customers,
Louis.

17
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,266
Y-You get film.

18
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,401
Most of the other
people who come in here,

19
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,637
they just want the
latest Mel Gibson movie

20
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,439
or something with cars fighting.

21
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:50,106
But not you.

22
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:51,141
You're one of us.

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,608
I really am.

24
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,578
Oh, okay,
you have a $2 late fee on "Das Boot."

25
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,447
But, uh,
since you're a fellow cinephile,

26
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:58,715
I'm just gonna go ahead

27
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,616
and das boot that
right off your account.

28
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,686
I understand that reference.

29
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:06,055
Uh, and your other rentals
are due back Tuesday.

30
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,023
Other rentals?

31
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,024
Somebody from your
family came in last week

32
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,493
and rented a bunch of movies.

33
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:12,861
What? Who?

34
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:16,164
Our store policy says we can't
reveal our customers' identities

35
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,066
or any specifics on the account,

36
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:21,035
but I can tell you they
have terrible taste.

37
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:24,639
If it were up to me,
they'd be due back never.

38
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:25,806
But it's not.

39
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,508
So, it's Tuesday.

40
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,612
S02E22
Gotta Be Me

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

42
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:47,827
Eddie, up now! School!

43
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:49,796
Who's Eddie?

44
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:50,897
I'm Dorf.

45
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,401
"Leonard, keep your eye on the ball."

46
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:57,437
I don't know who that is,
but I don't have time for jokes.

47
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,538
Stop playing invalids and get dressed.

48
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:03,751
Okay, who was it?

49
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,778
Who used my card to rent movies?

50
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:06,745
Just tell me who it was.

51
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,747
I won't be mad.

52
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,081
Come on.

53
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:12,651
I know one of you took my card,
went to the video store,

54
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:14,420
embarrassed me in front of Corey.

55
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,288
Louis,
nobody knows what you're talking about.

56
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:17,855
Let the boys focus on their breakfast.

57
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,223
Staring contest.

58
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:21,091
I didn't know.
It's too early to compete.

59
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,027
Too late. I'm staring at you!

60
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,361
Eddie, stop distracting Evan.

61
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,096
He has a spelling test. He needs to eat.

62
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,399
You can still eat, right, Evan?

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,859
I never wanted this.

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,074
I'll wait outside.

65
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:41,344
Game over.

66
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,012
Now move.

67
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,848
We tied!

68
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,249
Okay, come on. We got to go.

69
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,551
Let's go. Come on, please.

70
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:48,985
Mom. I need you to sign this.

71
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm not gonna sign another doctor's note

72
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,788
granting you permission
to eat two lunches.

73
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:56,058
It's my permission slip for
my history-class field trip.

74
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,527
Field trips are just paid
vacations for teachers.

75
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:01,029
I don't pay taxes so they
can walk around a museum

76
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,164
telling our children

77
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,299
that a painting of a
soup can is beautiful.

78
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,434
What?! But...

79
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,135
When your class goes on the field trip,

80
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,036
you can just do CLC in the library.

81
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,472
End of discussion. Okay.

82
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,974
You never let me do anything.

83
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:16,878
Louis, I'm going with Honey to
the mall to run some errands.

84
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,680
Maybe I'll eat a pretzel or a doughnut.

85
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,348
Okay! Just finishing my coffee,

86
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,316
and then I'm off to work like normal.

87
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,586
Just as soon as I find those tapes.

88
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,609
What the hell?

89
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,311
So many nipples.

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,817
Ah! Don't lift him by the neck, Louis.

91
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,317
Lift him by the sphenoid.

92
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:00,318
Uh-huh.

93
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,419
Uh-huh.

94
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,254
Uh, Marvin, I actually just came over

95
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:05,490
to ask your advice about something.

96
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,859
Uh, okay. What a beauty.

97
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,495
You know,
I got him when he was drinking water.

98
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,497
Pow. That's why his tongue's out.

99
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:14,966
Anyway, what were you saying?

100
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,467
Oh, um, does Honey ever...

101
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:19,102
look at other men?

102
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,103
Why?

103
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,271
What the hell did you hear?

104
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:22,272
Nothing.

105
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:24,241
Uh, it's just... I found some tapes

106
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,376
under Jessica's side of the bed.

107
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,546
Shirtless-men tapes.

108
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,147
Shirtless-men tapes?

109
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,049
Action movies.

110
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:34,183
Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme.

111
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:35,484
Oh. Uh-huh.

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,887
And you're worried that
you're not giving Jessica

113
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:41,223
the macho action-movie
energy she clearly craves.

114
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,561
You know, now that I hear it out loud,

115
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,362
it does sound kind of crazy.

116
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:47,430
No, it doesn't.

117
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:49,198
You should be worried.

118
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,199
- What?
- She probably kept it a secret from you

119
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:53,301
because she didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

120
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,470
which you shouldn't even
have in the first place.

121
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,573
Maybe you're right, Marvin.

122
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,476
Tonight, I'm going to sit her
down and really talk it out.

123
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:02,510
Talk?

124
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,446
That's what got you into this mess.

125
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,247
They're action heroes,
not talking heroes.

126
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:10,150
You want to solve the problem,
you got to act.

127
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,486
You think I took that stag to tea

128
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,856
and floated the idea of
mounting his head on my wall?

129
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:17,391
No. I just did it.

130
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,525
Pow!

131
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:21,228
You want to stop Jessica
from watching those tapes?

132
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:24,664
You got to show her you
can be that kind of a man.

133
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,799
Pow.

134
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,400
Pow.

135
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,868
- Pow!
- Pow!

136
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,808
I'm telling you, it was him!

137
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,577
Why would Steven Tyler be at
the Sharper Image in Orlando?

138
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,879
Because he wants a fogless shave mirror,
Honey.

139
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,847
Anyway, how's everything else?

140
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,515
How are your boys doing?

141
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,683
Fine. Eddie's mad at me

142
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,251
because I won't let him go
on his history field trip.

143
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,353
The one to Colonial Floridatowne?

144
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:50,489
Believe me,
you're doing the right thing.

145
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,124
I chaperoned when Nicole went,

146
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,693
and let's just say the
bathrooms are very realistic.

147
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,229
Did you just say Colonial Floridatowne?

148
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,664
They are literally wood sheds
with a hole in the ground.

149
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,866
I love colonial American history!

150
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:05,169
Colonial Americans were
like the Chinese of today.

151
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,538
Their struggle, their work ethic,

152
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,407
their ability to use every
single part of the buffalo.

153
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,944
I mean,
you've seen my porcelain colonial mice.

154
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,847
What the...?

155
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,181
Colonial Americans survived

156
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,850
under the harshest of circumstances,

157
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:22,886
and for that, they deserve our respect.

158
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,021
Look at this one.

159
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,422
Proud, hard-working,

160
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,224
holding out her milk jug to the world

161
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,294
as if to say,
"Show me your worst, America.

162
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,928
I'll still have milk."

163
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,098
This one looks a little
bit like Sally Field,

164
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,366
don't you think?

165
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,469
I think that one looks
a lot like Sally Field.

166
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,373
Where's your brother?

167
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,942
He's playing Super Mario in his room.

168
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:49,077
He says it's nice to start
the day with a victory.

169
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,378
Eddie, you're gonna be late!

170
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,815
Stop playing Italian Maintenance
Twins and get in here!

171
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,197
Later, I'm going to dig a
trash pit and burn this.

172
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,332
Louis, what are you doing?
Put a shirt on.

173
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,168
I feel more comfortable this way.

174
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,569
You hate being shirtless.

175
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,337
You wear a t-shirt in the ocean.

176
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,740
I'm trying to give you

177
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,709
the macho action-movie
energy you clearly crave.

178
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,343
What are you talking about?

179
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,779
I found your tapes, Jessica.

180
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,514
The ones you keep hidden
under our mattress.

181
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,216
Your action-movie tapes.

182
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,851
I don't watch action movies.

183
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,653
The only movies I watch
are riveting Denzel dramas

184
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,788
about legal briefs.

185
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:36,789
"Where are the legal briefs?

186
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,758
Who has the legal briefs?

187
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,559
Julia Roberts, get me the legal briefs."

188
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,462
Okay, so if you didn't rent them,
who did?

189
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,731
Probably your mother.

190
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,132
I already searched her room.

191
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,034
All I found was a Chow YunFat calendar.

192
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,970
Somebody in this house is lying to me,

193
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,438
and I'm gonna find out who.

194
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:01,678
Forgetting something?

195
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,148
Uh, why are you giving me this?

196
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,149
I changed my mind.

197
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,118
You can go on your history field trip.

198
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,418
Really?

199
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,121
Thanks, Mom.

200
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,122
Wait.

201
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,223
Why are you wearing a hat?

202
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,268
Because I'm coming with
you as parent chaperone.

203
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,194
We leave at first light.

204
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,074
Aha!

205
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,642
Emery?

206
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:36,894
I can explain.

207
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,975
Are you mad?

208
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,945
Oh, uh, no,
no, I'm not, uh, mad.

209
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:48,954
I-I-I-I-I-I'm just, um, well...

210
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,588
you know, Emery, you're at an age where,
uh, your body...

211
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:56,523
A-a-and by that I mean...

212
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,662
Uh, uh, uh, a father's love knows no...

213
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:07,434
Greg Louganis is a wonderful...
And Broadway.

214
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,236
Uh, although we may not live
in the best state for...

215
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,771
The tapes were research for school.

216
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,807
I knew it.

217
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:17,543
I knew it was homework-related.

218
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:18,578
Not exactly.

219
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,647
You know how I've always
made friends easily?

220
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:24,016
Well, there's been a change at school.

221
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:26,151
It's like it happened overnight.

222
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:29,053
And I'm tapping five mana to
cast Ancestral Tentacle Grab,

223
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:30,488
dealing two damage to all your...

224
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,257
Oops.

225
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,729
You guys are dorks.

226
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,632
I'm gonna go throw bottles at a train.

227
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,701
Suddenly, all of my friends
are acting like tough guys.

228
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:47,037
All they want to talk about is cars,
fire,

229
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,872
and throwing things at other things.

230
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,006
And that's not me.

231
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,142
I don't even know how to
hang with them anymore.

232
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,010
Puberty strikes hard and quick,

233
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,947
like a large soda halfway through
"Schindler's List."

234
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:59,250
Anyway, that's why I rented the tapes.

235
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:02,151
The video store has a whole
section on tough guys.

236
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,987
And I was hoping they might
help me figure it out.

237
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,856
But I know what I'm gonna do.

238
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,492
I've decided to write a poem.

239
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,127
A poem?

240
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,194
For class.

241
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,230
I'm gonna tell an epic
story through verse

242
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,566
and show that brains are
as valuable as brawn.

243
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:18,767
Big no to that.

244
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,835
Luckily, as a small-business owner

245
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,804
who relies on customer service,

246
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,574
I understand the mechanics of
getting people to like you.

247
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,409
You find out what makes them tick,

248
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,444
and then you use that to relate to them.

249
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,045
Like, uh, these boys at school...

250
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,213
How do they speak to each other?

251
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,182
Well, they mostly just insult each other

252
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,683
and make jokes about farts.

253
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,184
Like, "Who farted?

254
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,253
Did you fart? No, I farted.

255
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,588
Fart, fart, fart."

256
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,292
That's a funny joke.

257
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,628
So, they have a sense of humor.

258
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,796
Good.

259
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,831
That'll be the key to
winning their respect.

260
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:57,904
And group five is Huang, Masterson,

261
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,206
Stone, Selby, and Pew.

262
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,941
Your chaperone will be Mrs. Huang.

263
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,543
Mother goose!

264
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,645
Wait, Brian, your last name is Pew?

265
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,681
How long have we been friends?

266
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:09,014
It's cool that we're all together.

267
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,116
Cool? My mom is our chaperone.

268
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,884
- So?
- It'll still be fun, right?

269
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,953
No way. My mom hates fun!

270
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,922
Boys.

271
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,290
Here we go.

272
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:21,026
We're not even inside yet,
and she's already starting...

273
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,128
- We're going rogue.
- What?!

274
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,463
I looked at the map,
and turns out your class is only hitting

275
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,398
the educational parts of Floridatowne,

276
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,767
which doesn't leave any
time for the good stuff.

277
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:32,169
So we're going to forge our own way.

278
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,806
It's what the colonials would have done.

279
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,906
Come on!

280
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,509
What are you waiting for, Pew?

281
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,345
Follow her.

282
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,514
You forgot to wipe.

283
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,150
Hey, Chad.

284
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,184
Want to hear a joke?

285
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,553
Your face looks like a butt,

286
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,621
and whenever you talk,
it sounds like a fart.

287
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:06,502
And that's how colonial women used milk

288
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,705
to get out even the most
stubborn of household stains.

289
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:10,939
Now, who wants to help me

290
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,376
get the blood out of this undershirt?

291
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,711
Come on, come on!

292
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,860
Whoa.

293
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,835
Whoa!

294
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:50,110
Wow, that was fun.

295
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,879
Who knew that making candles
was a career possibility?

296
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,614
Goodbye, architecture.

297
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,783
And I got a kiss from
the midwife's assistant.

298
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,284
You didn't get a kiss from her.

299
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,286
You just asked her
where the bathroom was.

300
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,421
We had a connection.

301
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,022
Eddie, your mom is so fun.

302
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:05,324
She makes my mom look
straight-up garbage.

303
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,692
Nobody tell my mom I said that.

304
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,327
I was just wrapped up in the moment.

305
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,529
Yeah, Eddie.

306
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,096
This field trip would've
sucked without your mom.

307
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,465
I vote we all pool our money

308
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,033
and buy her some fancy chocolates.

309
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,167
Sea salt or something.

310
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:17,502
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

311
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,770
Yeah, you guys are right.

312
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,673
Hey, Mom. You were fun today.

313
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,841
Oh, thank you, Eddie.

314
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,975
I'm glad you and your
friends had a good time.

315
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,310
You know, that Big Red...

316
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,111
He has a real talent for tanning meat.

317
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:31,014
No, I mean, you were fun today.

318
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,149
What is that all about?

319
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,217
Are you jealous your friends
had fun with your mom?

320
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:35,185
No.

321
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,520
You were fun today,

322
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,589
which means you've always
been capable of having fun.

323
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:39,924
You just chose not to.

324
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,491
Where was Fun Mom when I
wanted to keep that gecko

325
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,192
that got into Grandma's room?

326
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,995
Or when I spilled my Slurpee on
the moving walkway in the airport?

327
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,064
You could've been fun this entire time.

328
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,509
Hello?

329
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:04,813
Eddie got into a fight?

330
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,281
Eddie got into a fight?

331
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,651
Madeline, what did I tell you
about keeping me in the loop?

332
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,053
We had two vomits and a sprained ankle,

333
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:13,321
but no fights today.

334
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:14,723
Really? Two vomits?

335
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:16,991
It's taco day.

336
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:18,225
Wait.

337
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,995
If Eddie didn't get into a fight,
then who...

338
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,397
Oh, no.

339
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:29,804
Oh, my God. What happened?

340
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,272
You came so late that I missed a
Tony Little Gazelle Masterclass

341
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,141
that I paid $45 for.

342
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:36,209
You know that expression,

343
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,144
"Oh, if you work out,
everything else will"?

344
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,581
Well, that is not true.

345
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,384
Oh, and Emery was in a fight.

346
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,764
You know,
this isn't really as bad as it seems.

347
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,666
So you got punched.

348
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,982
Everybody gets punched at
some point in their lives.

349
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,305
Your mom got punched by a lady
at the yogurt shop last week.

350
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,139
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

351
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:03,275
Instead of handling things my own way,

352
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,678
I took your advice,
and look what happened.

353
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:08,061
Thanks a lot, Dad.

354
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,919
Yo, Evan, want to hear a secret?

355
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:17,588
If it's that you wipe your hands
on my towel, I already know.

356
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,324
How do you know about that?

357
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,793
I know what a damp towel feels like,
Eddie.

358
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:22,960
Whatever.

359
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,429
I'm trying to tell you a real secret.

360
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,230
Mom is fun.

361
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,632
That's not a secret.

362
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,201
I've been telling you that for years.

363
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:31,702
Not your nerd version of fun.

364
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,169
Like actually fun.

365
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,605
Today at my field trip, she...

366
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:36,457
Boys!

367
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,075
What are you,
waitresses at a small-town diner?

368
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,176
Stop chatting.

369
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,511
Evan, finish your homework in your room.

370
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,779
Eddie, take out the trash.

371
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,293
Okay, Mommy.

372
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,516
Oh, cool, you're back to being zero fun.

373
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:48,784
Awesome.

374
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,120
Maybe I'll experience Fun Mom
again in another 12 years.

375
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:54,390
You think I don't want to be Fun Mom?

376
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,158
I would love to be Fun Mom.

377
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:57,593
So then do it.

378
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:58,761
Eddie, we had fun today

379
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,696
because I didn't have
to spend every minute

380
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,065
chasing after you and nagging you.

381
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,866
You think Fun Mom could
get you to do your homework

382
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,934
and clean your room?

383
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,902
No way.

384
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:10,872
That's what this mom is for.

385
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:13,742
This mom gets things done.

386
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:16,611
No juice boxes until you
finish your homework.

387
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:19,313
Your discipline is the
only reward I need.

388
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,093
Mom.

389
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,095
I did the right thing, right?

390
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,925
With Emery.

391
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:36,822
_

392
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,629
_

393
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,909
_

394
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,044
What do you mean?

395
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:44,091
_

396
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,714
I don't do that.

397
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,204
_

398
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,793
_

399
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,077
Go, you 'Guanas!

400
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:54,714
Go, you Barn Owls!

401
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,082
Why do they call it women's basketball?

402
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,084
It's just basketball, am I right?

403
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,789
Oh, my God, you're right.

404
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,291
I hate women's basketball.

405
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,994
_

406
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:13,492
_

407
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:15,902
_

408
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,986
_

409
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,870
Do you really think I change who I am

410
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,086
to get people to like me?

411
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,384
_

412
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,982
Now I understand the difference
between a movie and a film.

413
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,620
How's that eye?

414
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,721
It's okay.

415
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,089
And don't worry... I told Mom

416
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:42,291
that I got it from looking
too hard through my telescope.

417
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,327
I think she was proud?

418
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:49,397
I, uh, shouldn't have told you
to act like somebody you're not.

419
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,166
You're your own person,
you're not ashamed of it,

420
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,601
and that's your strength.

421
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,202
Tell that to the boys at my school.

422
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,337
They're just too busy

423
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,372
trying to figure out
who they are to notice.

424
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,875
You may feel like you're falling
behind the curve right now,

425
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,210
but trust me, you are way ahead of it.

426
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,420
Thanks, Dad.

427
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,955
You know, maybe I just need
to change my tactics.

428
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,641
Good.

429
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,174
And deliver my poem in a
completely different way.

430
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:10,728
Oh.

431
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,987
I need to show Chad and those other boys

432
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:15,857
that you don't need to fight all
your battles with your fists.

433
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:18,192
Sometimes you can use the
power of rhymed verse.

434
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,326
Okay.

435
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,927
Just be smart about it, all right?

436
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,462
Don't worry, Dad.

437
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,030
That's who I am.

438
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:28,635
You guys are missing
the gnome's funeral!

439
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,204
I wonder if there's a "La Chouffe 2."

440
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:33,907
Eddie, up now.

441
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,041
School.

442
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,311
I heard what you said yesterday,
and I get it.

443
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,547
Sometimes, I can be a little much.

444
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:42,715
Sometimes?

445
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,950
- More like...
- Not now.

446
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,118
Yes, Mommy.

447
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:48,053
I understand now that the only reason

448
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,655
why I have any fun around here

449
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,390
is because you're not having any,

450
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,525
and that's not fair.

451
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,192
That's why I got myself
ready this morning.

452
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,529
I even packed my own lunch...
Six Oreos and a tortilla.

453
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,830
Thank you, Eddie.

454
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:01,265
Even though I can tell you didn't shower

455
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,735
because you smell like
a pepperoni pizza,

456
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,869
I'm proud of you.

457
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,907
But that means we're 30
minutes ahead of schedule.

458
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,944
Am I the green janitor
or the red janitor?

459
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:16,112
Neither, Mom. You died five minutes ago.

460
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,715
You've just been pressing
buttons for no reason.

461
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:23,253
"And for who but the
flowers and the trees

462
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:27,024
doth man speak and sing
his many whimsies."

463
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,991
Poetry's for 'ginas.

464
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:32,386
"And though a fist may crush and sprain,

465
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:36,498
there is no weapon like the brain."

466
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:41,003
This poem was written by a
clearly sensitive student.

467
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,773
Our very own Chad.

468
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,475
Lovely work, Chad.

469
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,677
No.

470
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:50,144
That wasn't me, I swear!

471
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,913
No need to be bashful, Chad.

472
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,514
It was a beautiful poem.

473
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,053
I really like that poem.

474
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,120
Me, too.

475
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,789
There's real power in rhymed verse.

476
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:04,024
Oops. I dropped my pencil.

477
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:07,695
Let's go
spray-paint some turtles.

478
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:14,473
Oh, hey, Louis.

479
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:16,841
We just got an amazing Danish film in.

480
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:18,477
"Cosette and the Gentle Clown."

481
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:20,679
It tells the story of a young girl,
Cosette,

482
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:23,715
who leaves her oppressive
mining village to apprentice...

483
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,710
I'm renting "Beethoven."

484
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,019
I think maybe you meant to get
"Amadeus."

485
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,154
That's over in...

486
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,022
No, I didn't.

487
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,924
I don't want to watch "Amadeus."

488
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,160
"Amadeus" looks boring.

489
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:38,929
Just like all the movies you recommend.

490
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,064
From now on, I'm only renting

491
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,067
the kind of movies that I like.

492
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:48,638
Movies about animals... acting... crazy.

493
