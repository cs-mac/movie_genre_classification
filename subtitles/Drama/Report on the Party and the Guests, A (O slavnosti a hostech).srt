1
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:36,214
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,008
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:01,406
Murder.

4
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,066
Good luck, John.

5
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,277
- Any contractions?
- Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,210
Okay, Jad, what's coming?

7
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:58,046
Red Ball, double homicide,
one male, one female.

8
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,215
Killer's male, white, 40s.

9
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,676
Agatha nailed the time frame
at 8:04 a.m.

10
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,512
The twins are a little fuzzy on that,
so we'll need confirmation.

11
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:08,849
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

12
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,142
This will be case number 1108.

13
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,400
Good morning, detectives.

14
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,362
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Precogs,

15
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:24,865
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

16
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,992
My fellow witnesses
for case number 1108 ...

17
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,994
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

18
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,120
Good morning.

19
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,204
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,416
Will the witnesses preview and 
validate number 1108 at this time?

21
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,961
- Affirmative. I will validate.
- Go get him.

22
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,214
- Stand by.
- Time of murder, 8:04 a.m.

23
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,717
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now.

24
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,510
This is a Red Ball.

25
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:14,164
You know
how blind I am without them.

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,543
All right, Howard Marks, 
where are you?

27
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,213
Howard? Howard, breakfast!

28
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:41,191
"Four score
and seven years ago ..."

29
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,361
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

30
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:49,449
A man standing in the park across 
the street. I've seen him before.

31
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,952
How can you even tell? You know
how blind you are without your glasses.

32
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,119
Where are your glasses?

33
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:54,829
I must have left them up 
in the bedroom.

34
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,122
You are running out of time.

35
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,291
You know how blind I am ...

36
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:16,309
I show eight Howard Marks in the 
District. Sorting by race and age.

37
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:18,103
Run their license and registration.

38
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,480
See if I can capture an address here.

39
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:22,983
You are running out of time.

40
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,485
You know, I was thinking maybe 
I'd play hooky, stay home today.

41
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,114
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.

42
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,533
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

43
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:35,870
I got six licenses.
Where do you want them?

44
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:37,622
Over here, please.

45
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,592
I'm very sorry.

46
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,812
You know how blind I am without them.

47
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:08,987
Got him in the Foxhall,
4421 Gainsborough.

48
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,488
Send a DCPD blue-and-white.

49
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,323
Set up a perimeter,
and tell them we're en route.

50
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:16,119
You know, I was thinking maybe 
I'd play hooky, stay home today.

51
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,330
"We have come
to dedicate a portion of that field ..."

52
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,416
- What do you think?
"as a final resting place ..."

53
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,877
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

54
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,253
I've been working too much anyway.

55
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:27,630
"is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this."

56
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:30,675
- "But in a larger sense ..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

57
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,843
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate.

58
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,344
"We cannot hallow this ground."

59
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,055
- Any place you want.
- I would love ... I would love to.

60
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,598
"The brave men, living and dead ..."

61
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:39,309
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

62
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:43,480
"have consecrated it far above
our poor power to add or detract."

63
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:46,691
I guess that's why you look so nice.

64
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:49,652
Chief!

65
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,655
We got a problem with our location.

66
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,953
- It's no longer there.
- Shit.

67
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,164
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

68
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,249
Investigator from the Fed's here.

69
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:05,502
Yeah, I don't need some twink
from the Fed poking around right now.

70
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,712
John, I wrote it down on your calendar.
I left you a message at your house.

71
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:09,047
Check in with the papers.
They had it forwarded.

72
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,090
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

73
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:11,925
- Check all relations.
- Checking neighbors and relations.

74
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,302
- But, John ...
- Fletch, just get him some coffee.

75
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,054
Tell him some stories
how I save your ass every day ...

76
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:18,431
and you can't live without me.
- I got coffee, thank you.

77
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:21,267
Danny Witwer, 
the twink from the Fed.

78
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,436
Whoops. Gum?

79
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,939
Sorry, Danny, I'm gonna have to give 
you the full tour some other time.

80
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,357
The Markses moved
a couple of weeks ago,

81
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:30,110
nobody knows where. Still 
searching for family and employer.

82
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:32,195
Time Horizon, 12 minutes.

83
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,239
All right. What he's doing now,
we call "scrubbing the image,"

84
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,783
looking for clues
as to where the murder's gonna happen.

85
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:40,662
Original running bond brick pattern,
streamlined early Georgian details ...

86
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,163
The brick has been re-pointed.

87
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,833
- And, "That this nation ..."
- "This nation ..."

88
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,126
- "under God ..."
- "under God ..."

89
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,128
"shall not perish from the Earth."

90
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:50,713
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

91
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,590
Beyond that and the date of the crime,

92
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,593
all we have to run on are the images
that they produce.

93
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,730
I show a cop on horseback.

94
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:10,275
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.

95
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,609
The Mall?

96
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,903
Georgetown.

97
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:17,115
The Precogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

98
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,449
Well, we call it a Red Ball.

99
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,326
With crimes of passion
there's no premeditation,

100
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:21,578
so they show up late.

101
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,872
Most of our scrambles are 
flash events, like this one.

102
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:26,332
We rarely see anything
with premeditation anymore.

103
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,626
- People have gotten the message.
- Uh-huh.

104
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,044
Oh, this is good.

105
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,922
I show a match for Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

106
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,549
He did two dozen houses in D.C.

107
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,885
- Time Horizon, 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes.

108
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,428
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,645
Look at this kid. In this one, he's
on the left side of the man in the suit.

110
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,648
- Yes, so?
- This one he is on the right.

111
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,585
Merry-go-round.

112
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,587
It's a park!

113
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:19,719
Tell me there's only 16 of these 
old merry-go-rounds left in the city.

114
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:21,221
Two in Georgetown,
one in Barnaby Woods.

115
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,347
The other's in Woodley.

116
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,224
Woodley's all Victorian.
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.

117
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,850
- Evanna, flight time?
- The way I drive,

118
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,977
three minutes after wheels up.

119
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:43,660
- Clear.
- Clear.

120
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,098
Time Horizon, six minutes.

121
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,344
Let's go to bed.

122
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:45,930
Let's do it in here.

123
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:50,351
- The bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

124
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,107
Shit!

125
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,527
Which one is it?

126
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,785
- Don't stop!
- Not the bed!

127
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,747
- Come on, come on.
- I don't want to be on the bed!

128
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,961
Time Horizon, one minute. Chief, 
we're catching up to the future.

129
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,797
Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

130
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:03,549
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

131
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,552
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

132
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,013
Did Marks close the front door?

133
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:18,773
Front door.

134
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:24,362
I didn't want to be on the bed.

135
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,743
Negative. The front door is open.

136
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,746
- The front door is open.
- Time Horizon, 30 seconds.

137
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:44,966
- I forgot my glasses.
- Oh, Howard!

138
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,515
No, no, no, Howard.

139
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,021
You know how blind 
I am without them.

140
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:01,899
Howard, don't cry.

141
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,734
Marks!

142
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,922
Look at me. Look at me.

143
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,637
Positive for Howard Marks.

144
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:35,975
Mr. Marks, by mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

145
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,143
I'm placing you under arrest ...

146
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,853
for the future murder of Sarah Marks
and Donald Dubin ...

147
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,940
that was to take place today,
April 22nd, at 0804.

148
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,817
No! I didn't do anything.

149
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:47,653
- Sarah!
- Give the man his hat.

150
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:51,782
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me! Sarah!

151
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,327
- Put your hand on your head!
- Help me!

152
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,329
I wasn't gonna do anything!

153
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,499
Officer Scott, I'm with the
Precrime trauma Response Unit.

154
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,959
I want you to sit here a minute
and listen to me.

155
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:05,171
Your husband is being arrested
by officers from Precrime.

156
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:07,048
Oh, God, Howard, no!

157
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,178
Howard, don't cry.

158
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:17,475
Howard, please don't cry.

159
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,519
Oh, God. Oh, God.

160
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:25,608
I thought they stopped the murder.

161
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:29,403
Well, that's just an echo,
a Precog déjà vu, if you will.

162
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:33,282
The really bad ones, the Precogs
see them over and over again.

163
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,409
Wally, erase the incoming.

164
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,219
Imagine a world without murder.

165
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:56,514
- I lost my best friend.
- I Lost my aunt.

166
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:57,723
- I Lost my dad.
- I Lost my father.

167
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:58,808
I Lost my wife.

168
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:01,519
Just six years ago,
the homicide rate in this country ...

169
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,604
had reached epidemic proportions.

170
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:06,732
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

171
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:11,320
But instead of one miracle, we 
were given three, the Precognitives.

172
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:14,240
Within just one month
under the Precrime program,

173
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:18,035
the murder rate in the
District of Columbia was reduced 90%.

174
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,495
They were gonna be waiting for me
in the car.

175
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
He was gonna rape me.

176
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,248
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

177
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:27,211
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation's capital.

178
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:30,423
In the six years we've been conducting
our little experiment,

179
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:33,009
there hasn't been a single murder.

180
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,595
And now
Precrime can work for you.

181
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,763
We want to
make absolutely certain ...

182
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:41,851
that every American can bank on
the utter infallibility of the system,

183
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:46,897
and to ensure that what keeps 
us safe will also keep us free.

184
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:51,110
- It works.
- It works.

185
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:52,570
- It works.
- It works.

186
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:54,614
- It works.
- It works.

187
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:57,575
- Precrime, it works!
- Precrime, it works!

188
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,455
On Tuesday, April 22nd, vote yes
on the National Precrime Initiative.

189
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,336
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

190
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:17,637
- I just need a little clarity.
- True, true, true, true, that.

191
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:22,892
You want the customary clarity or 
the new-and-improved kind of clarity?

192
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,644
Just give me the new stuff.

193
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:28,397
New and improved. New and 
improved clarity, clarity, clarity.

194
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,483
Yes, indeed, clarity.

195
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,318
Come on, come on.
I just want a hit.

196
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:33,444
Look, don't bust my balls.

197
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,863
You just gave me four,
and some of these are duds.

198
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:37,823
Sweet dreams, Chief.

199
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,120
Don't worry none,
your secret's safe with me.

200
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,998
Besides, I could use a little juice
on my side.

201
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,292
What do you think you know, Lycon?

202
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,712
It's like my daddy used to say,

203
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:54,298
"In the land of the blind,

204
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,512
"the one-eyed man is king."

205
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,868
I'm home.

206
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,837
Overhead.

207
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:30,853
Wall screen.

208
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,945
- Sean!
- Hi, Daddy.

209
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,364
Can you teach me how to run faster?

210
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:46,035
'Cause all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

211
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,454
No. That's good.

212
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:50,414
Look, keep your knees up.

213
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,166
Keep your knees up like that. Good.

214
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,292
- Like that.
- Like that.

215
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,878
- Like that. High. High. Like that.
- Like that. High.

216
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:59,089
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running!

217
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,384
Gotta keep running.

218
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:03,969
You gotta keep running.

219
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,471
You gotta keep running.

220
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:08,182
Will I be as fast as you someday?

221
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,226
Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

222
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,560
You're gonna beat everybody.

223
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,938
I think you'll beat everyone someday.

224
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:17,358
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

225
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,694
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips!

226
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:23,614
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

227
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:26,033
Yeah. All right, 
all right, all right.

228
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,493
I love you.

229
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,413
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

230
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,159
It reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

231
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,121
Remember?

232
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:15,165
Yeah, we had those ... We had $20,

233
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,920
and waiting in the van so the 
sun would shine on our vacation.

234
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,925
John! John.

235
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:29,263
John, put the camera down. Look, 
I'm ... I'm all ready for bed.

236
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,557
What ... What is this? No.

237
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:34,560
Put it away. It's time 
to put the camera to sleep,

238
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:37,563
and time to come
and take care of your wife.

239
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,902
Sweetie, why don't you
put the camera down ...

240
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:45,321
and come and watch the rain with me?

241
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:50,451
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

242
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:58,250
Look, put the camera down,
or you're not getting anything tonight.

243
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:42,544
A gentleman at Justice wants
to take all this away from us.

244
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,130
You understand a week from now
people are going to vote ...

245
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,007
on whether or not
what we've been doing down here ...

246
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,385
has been
some noble-minded enterprise,

247
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:52,346
or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

248
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,431
- I understand, sir.
- John.

249
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,393
Watch this Danny Witwer,

250
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:00,854
the observer from Justice.
- Yes, I met him yesterday.

251
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:04,483
You can let him look around,
answer his questions, but watch him.

252
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,235
- Yes, sir.
- And if there's any problem,

253
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,237
make sure we know about it first.
- I understand.

254
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,656
When the Precogs declare
a victim and a killer,

255
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,616
their name is embedded
in the grain of wood.

256
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,369
Since each piece is unique,
the shape and grain is unique.

257
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,663
The shape and grain
is impossible to forge.

258
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sure you all understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

259
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,042
Here we go again.

260
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,253
Look, I'm not with the ACLU
on this, Jeff.

261
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:25,337
But let's not kid ourselves.

262
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,172
We are arresting individuals
who have broken no law.

263
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:29,174
- But they will.
- The commission of the crime itself ...

264
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,300
is absolute metaphysics.

265
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,511
The Precogs seethe future,
and they're never wrong.

266
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:36,932
But it's not the future if you stop it.
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

267
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:38,600
Yes, it is.

268
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:41,812
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

269
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:48,027
- Why'd you catch that?
- Because it was going to fall.

270
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:49,611
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:52,114
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

272
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,034
The fact that
you prevented it from happening ...

273
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:57,119
doesn't change the fact
that it was going to happen.

274
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,413
You ever get any false positives?

275
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,958
Someone intends to kill his boss or his
wife, but they never go through with it.

276
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,960
How do the Precogs 
tell the difference?

277
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:08,839
The Precogs don't see what you 
intend to do, only what you will do.

278
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,925
Then why can't they see rapes?
Or assaults or suicides?

279
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,386
Because of the nature of murder.

280
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:17,431
"There's nothing more destructive to 
the metaphysical fabric that binds us ...

281
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:20,392
"than the untimely murder
of one human being by another."

282
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:21,977
Somehow, I don't think
that was Walt Whitman.

283
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,395
It's Iris Hineman.

284
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,191
She developed the Precogs, designed
the system and pioneered the interface.

285
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,985
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

286
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,321
- To Hineman?
- To them.

287
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,450
Cops aren't
allowed inside the temple.

288
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:38,619
Really? You've never been inside?

289
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:42,414
We keep strict separations so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

290
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:45,167
So, I'll be the first one 
to go in, then?

291
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:48,087
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority ...

292
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:52,007
No, there is no question.
You don't have any.

293
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:56,553
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

294
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:10,734
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

295
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,117
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel ...

296
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,077
is being conducted
under the direct supervision ...

297
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:24,081
and express permission from the
Attorney General of the United States.

298
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:26,125
I'm here as his representative,

299
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:30,295
which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

300
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:37,678
Seems you've been
left out of the loop, John.

301
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:50,065
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

302
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,115
Hold it right there. Hold it.

303
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,409
Not cleared for access.

304
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:04,705
Eye-dent, John Anderton. Approved.

305
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,589
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

306
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:15,007
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

307
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:17,259
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

308
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:18,343
I can't touch you.

309
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:20,596
- Don't touch him or anything else.
- John, you can't be in here ...

310
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,765
I understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

311
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,850
Tell me how ...

312
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,938
- They're sleeping.
- Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

313
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:33,734
The photon milk acts as both
a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor.

314
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:36,445
It enhances the images
that each of them receive.

315
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:40,240
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.

316
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:43,368
We scan by way of optical tomography.

317
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:46,205
White-light pinpoints pulse along 
the entire length of the headgear,

318
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,750
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

319
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:52,920
In other words, 
we see what they see.

320
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,505
They don't feel any pain.

321
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,258
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

322
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:02,179
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

323
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,973
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

324
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:06,934
They can't be kept too awake, either.

325
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:10,145
It's better if
you don't think of them as human.

326
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,981
No. They're much more than that.

327
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,779
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

328
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:25,035
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

329
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,039
I find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

330
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,250
The Precogs are pattern-recognition 
filters, that's all.

331
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,753
- Yet you call this room "the temple."
- Just a nickname.

332
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,047
The oracle isn't
where the power is, anyway.

333
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,757
The power's always been
with the priests,

334
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:41,510
even if they had 
to invent the oracle.

335
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:46,473
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

336
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:50,060
Well, come on, Chief. The way 
we work, changing destiny and all,

337
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:53,272
I mean,
we're more like clergy than cops.

338
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,107
- Jad?
- Yeah?

339
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,776
Go to work. All of you.

340
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:09,204
Sorry. Old habit.

341
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,708
I spent three years at Fuller 
Seminary before I became a cop.

342
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,543
My father was very proud.

343
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,420
What does he think
of your chosen line of work?

344
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,588
I don't know. He was shot 
and killed when I was 15 ...

345
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:21,258
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

346
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:24,052
I know what it's like
to lose someone close, John.

347
00:27:24,137 --> 00:27:26,388
Of course,
nothing is like the loss of a child.

348
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,681
I don't have any children of my own,

349
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:31,101
so I can only imagine
what that must have been like.

350
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,646
To lose your son
in such a public place like that.

351
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,523
At least now you and I have
the chance to make sure ...

352
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,150
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

353
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:39,901
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me ...

354
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:42,487
exactly what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

355
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:43,655
There hasn't been 
a murder in six years.

356
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,324
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is ...

357
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:49,244
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

358
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:51,997
It always is.

359
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,458
John.

360
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:38,960
Wally.

361
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,928
Can you see?

362
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,879
John, what the hell just happened?

363
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:24,506
Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

364
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,758
- What did you do to her?
- She grabbed me.

365
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,177
Grabbed you? That's impossible.
The Precogs aren't even aware of us.

366
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:32,013
- In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.

367
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:33,140
It could have been a nightmare.

368
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:35,100
Sometimes they dream
about the old murders.

369
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,185
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

370
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:41,523
- What'd she say?
- "Can you see?"

371
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,713
You the Sentry?

372
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,215
Yes, sir! I'm Gideon.

373
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,719
You're Chief Anderton.

374
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:13,597
The music relaxes the prisoners.

375
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,724
Say, I don't ever see
any of you Precops down here.

376
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,560
- I'm not in trouble, am l?
- Not yet.

377
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:23,148
- I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?

378
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,734
- Drowning.
- That narrows it down.

379
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:27,360
Not too many in here for that one.

380
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:31,114
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

381
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,950
I'm supposed to spruce up for a
 tour they got planned for tomorrow.

382
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:35,785
Told me to wear a tie. 
You like this one?

383
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,953
Stop.

384
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,917
Roll back.

385
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,003
There.

386
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:49,758
She's a golden oldie. One of our 
first. Probably before your time.

387
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,303
This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

388
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:58,767
That's right! A combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

389
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,977
Just show me Agatha's data stream.

390
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:02,312
For that,

391
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,774
we go for a ride.

392
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:31,424
My God.
I'd forgotten there were so many.

393
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:36,763
And to think they'd all be out there 
killing people if it wasn't for you.

394
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:40,559
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they all seem.

395
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:43,937
But on the inside, busy, busy, busy.

396
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:48,984
Okey-pokey! Now that is one bad man.

397
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:52,779
He drowned a woman
named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

398
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:56,116
The killer's a John Doe.
Never identified.

399
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:14,301
Why is he still a John Doe?

400
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:16,469
Why wasn't he ever ID'd
from the eye-scan?

401
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:18,597
On account of those are not his eyes.

402
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:21,558
He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

403
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:25,604
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

404
00:32:25,688 --> 00:32:29,649
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

405
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,192
That's right.

406
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,784
We don't seem to have her data.

407
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:43,038
Try again.

408
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:46,541
This is odd.

409
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:50,295
See? We have the two previsions.

410
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:53,423
We got what Art saw,
we got what Dash saw,

411
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,467
but Agatha's isn't here.

412
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:00,388
Probably just a glitch.

413
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:03,767
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

414
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:09,147
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

415
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:12,567
but I show an address history
that includes the Beaton Clinic.

416
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,236
So she cleaned up.
So where's she now?

417
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,741
I guess glitches come in twos.

418
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:26,331
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

419
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:32,962
No.

420
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:36,758
I can't let you take that
out of here, Chief.

421
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:39,678
It's against the rules.

422
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:43,264
Anything else going on in here
that's against the rules?

423
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:53,316
Careful, Chief. You dig up 
the past, all you get is dirty.

424
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,866
And then you said the third prevision
was, what, kind of fuzzy or something?

425
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:06,121
No. No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

426
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:08,039
That's not all.
I spent a few hours down there,

427
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:11,042
and there are a dozen more cases
with missing previsions.

428
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,296
You'd think we'd have found a cure
for the common cold by now.

429
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,757
- It's stress.
- What's this?

430
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,552
Herbal tea with honey.

431
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:23,722
I hate herbal tea,
almost as much as I hate honey.

432
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:26,766
Just drink it before 
I pour it in your lap.

433
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:29,769
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you, Celeste.

434
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:33,898
Witwer's scheduled for a Containment ...
Tour of Containment tomorrow.

435
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,192
Yeah, give him a tour.

436
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:39,446
- Lara called me.
- What?

437
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:43,283
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am l.

438
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:46,077
I'm fine.

439
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:49,831
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl.

440
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,335
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night?

441
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,713
What if Danny Witwer
came to you right now ...

442
00:34:56,797 --> 00:35:00,258
and insisted on a full chem run?
- Lamar, I'm fine.

443
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,469
You understand, John,

444
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:05,972
the minute Precrime goes national,
they're going to take it away from us.

445
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:07,307
We won't let them.

446
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:11,978
No? How's an old man and a cop
on the whiff ever going to stop them?

447
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,815
My father once said to me,

448
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,028
"You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

449
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,322
There's a reason you are here, John.

450
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:24,866
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

451
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,369
the loss you and Lara suffered
would have been prevented.

452
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,246
Remember the eyes ...

453
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:35,835
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

454
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,797
And we both know I'm not the 
generation anyone listens to.

455
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:40,882
But people trust you, John.

456
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:44,052
When you speak
of your absolute belief in Precrime,

457
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:48,640
they know it's a belief born of pain,
not politics. I always understood that.

458
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:52,310
And I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

459
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:58,024
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

460
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:05,698
They're not gonna take it away from us.

461
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,408
I won't let them.

462
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,190
Bingo.

463
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,372
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey, little buddy.

464
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:56,541
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?

465
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:00,211
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.

466
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:03,131
- We made up a soccer team ...
- Yeah.

467
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:04,799
and we practice at school.

468
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,175
Yeah?
Do you practice with Connor?

469
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,678
Daddy's in a lot of trouble, Sean.

470
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:35,371
Wait.

471
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:42,170
Jad, how come you're not out there
with Father Witwer?

472
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:44,923
We're in motion on something.
Now, from what I can see,

473
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:48,593
we got a white male victim,
about 5'10", approximately 170.

474
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:51,054
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

475
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:53,097
- Red Ball?
- Nope, Brown Ball.

476
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:55,099
- This one's premeditated.
- Amazing.

477
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,894
There's someone within 200 miles
actually dumb enough to still do that.

478
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:02,398
Well, the victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109.

479
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,776
Time of occurrence, 
Friday, 15:06 hours.

480
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,403
Start a location run and a contact
search for future victim, Leo Crow.

481
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:10,114
Case number 1109,
previsualized by the Precogs,

482
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,742
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

483
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:14,786
My fellow witnesses
for case number 1109 ...

484
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,330
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

485
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:18,414
Good morning.

486
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,499
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

487
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,793
Are the witnesses ready
to preview and validate number 1109?

488
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:23,878
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

489
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,387
Oh, I love this part.

490
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:36,224
I've got no address,
last known or otherwise,

491
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:38,643
no tax returns for the last five years.

492
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:41,312
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.

493
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:45,733
And send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

494
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,781
Looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

495
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:54,701
Ouch.
About 1,000 of those in the District.

496
00:38:56,412 --> 00:39:00,248
Fractured images coming in.
Numbers nine ...

497
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,627
Nine and six.

498
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:13,636
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

499
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:16,389
She's laughing.

500
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:21,269
Okay, now inside a room.

501
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:25,023
Window panes, aluminum extrusion.

502
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:28,609
Two figures resolving in the room.

503
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:31,195
Wait!

504
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:37,827
Looks like we got a third party,

505
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,414
wearing sunglasses,
just out of the window.

506
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,208
You're not gonna kill me.

507
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:48,504
Goodbye, Crow.

508
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,595
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me.

509
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:58,389
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait!

510
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:04,312
Wait. Wait.

511
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:07,607
- You say something, Chief?
- No.

512
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,488
I'll get this one.

513
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:15,990
We got time on this one, Jad.

514
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:19,118
Mind going down and getting me a piece
of cake they're eating down there?

515
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:21,245
- I'm starving.
- Sure, Chief.

516
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,082
I think I'll get one for myself
while I'm at it.

517
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,708
Take your time.

518
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:46,646
Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?

519
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,523
I'm confused about ...

520
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:21,722
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

521
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:23,641
Wait! Anderton, wait!

522
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:27,603
Anderton, wait!

523
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:36,904
I like you, Chief.
You've always been nice to me.

524
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:43,077
I'll give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

525
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:00,845
Hold that, please.

526
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,139
Thanks.

527
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:09,937
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

528
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:13,524
I'll write the paranoia off to the 
whiff you've been doping on all night.

529
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:17,028
- Easy. Easy.
- Seems I found a flaw.

530
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:20,948
What are you gonna do?

531
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:24,202
Possession alone will cost you
six months, not to mention your badge.

532
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:26,787
I guess we won't be working 
together after all.

533
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:30,374
Now, put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

534
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:53,981
Lamar? Lamar?

535
00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:58,945
- Lamar?
- John, what the hell is happening?

536
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:00,821
- It's Witwer! He set me up!
- What the hell is happening?

537
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,073
- He set me up.
- Stop. Just wait.

538
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:04,116
- Who ...
- He set me up. Witwer. It's Witwer!

539
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:05,785
Yeah, who's the victim?

540
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,120
- Somebody.
- Who?

541
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:09,914
- Somebody. Leo Crow.
- Well, who is he?

542
00:43:09,998 --> 00:43:13,167
I have no idea! 
I've never heard of him!

543
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:15,753
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

544
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:18,297
Ah. But how could Witwer
have access to case files?

545
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:19,924
Can you fake a cerebral output?

546
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:21,300
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

547
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:24,053
- Well, I doubt it very much.
- Well, would Hineman know?

548
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:26,138
- Listen. Come in.
- What?

549
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:28,766
Well, I'll keep you safe until 
we get to the bottom of this, John.

550
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,850
No, Lamar, Listen to me. Listen.

551
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:31,936
Talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

552
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,856
Then ask Jad for any off-hour 
eye-dents into the analytical room.

553
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:38,401
Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

554
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,195
Security lockdown enabled. 
Revised destination, office.

555
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,363
Lamar, they found me.

556
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,872
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

557
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:53,833
- No. No. No.
- No?

558
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:57,378
I'LL meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.

559
00:43:57,462 --> 00:44:00,464
You know I can't. They'll get me 
there. I'm not gonna get haloed.

560
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:01,757
You can't run, John.

561
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:04,510
Everybody runs.

562
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:52,850
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

563
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:09,992
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

564
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,623
Don't worry, sir.
I'll bring him in, unharmed.

565
00:45:15,707 --> 00:45:17,541
Actually, Gordon,
you're not gonna do that.

566
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:19,710
- I'm taking control of the team.
- What?

567
00:45:19,795 --> 00:45:23,130
Witwer, Fletcher is second
in command. It's his show to run.

568
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:26,717
If you want, you can observe. Do it.
Find him.

569
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:28,094
Yes, sir.

570
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:33,891
He came to see you the other day,
right before he was tagged.

571
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:36,602
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

572
00:45:36,686 --> 00:45:39,063
John doesn't think they have a deep 
enough pitching roster this year,

573
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:41,649
and I'm inclined to agree.
- Why are you protecting him?

574
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:43,734
You knew he was doping,
yet you did nothing about it.

575
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:47,738
- The man lost a child, for Christ's sake.
- Six years ago.

576
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:50,241
- What did you two talk about?
- None of your damn business.

577
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:52,576
Oh, it's all my damn business now,
Lamar.

578
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:55,121
Investigation of a supervising 
officer for a capital crime ...

579
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:56,455
falls under federal jurisdiction,

580
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,625
so as to rule out
any possibility of conspiracy.

581
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:02,086
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

582
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,629
Shall we call the Attorney General?

583
00:46:03,713 --> 00:46:05,923
I'm sure he'd be happy
to clarify the issue for you.

584
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:08,509
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

585
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:13,722
I'm gonna enjoy working here.

586
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:19,270
A road diverges in the desert.

587
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:20,980
Lexus.

588
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:24,817
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less traveled.

589
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:33,409
- Good evening, John Anderton.
- John Anderton.

590
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:37,121
John Anderton!

591
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:39,957
You could use a Guinness
right about now.

592
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,169
Stressed out, John Anderton?

593
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,133
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

594
00:47:07,194 --> 00:47:09,028
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.

595
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:11,780
The train makes two stops,
at 20th and 33rd.

596
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:13,324
Send units to each location.

597
00:47:13,408 --> 00:47:15,367
- They'll never make 20th.
- Have faith.

598
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:57,952
Fire them up!

599
00:48:22,143 --> 00:48:24,061
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

600
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:26,605
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,857
- You have to work on that.
- It's that old, shit knee of mine.

602
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:30,818
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

603
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:33,362
Hey, don't do this.

604
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:36,824
John? Don't run.

605
00:48:37,993 --> 00:48:39,994
You don't have to chase me.

606
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:41,954
You don't have to run.

607
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,791
- Everybody runs, Fletch.
- You know we'll catch you.

608
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:48,961
Everybody runs.

609
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,341
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

610
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,261
Get your sick-sticks ready.

611
00:48:58,722 --> 00:49:00,431
Everybody runs, Fletch.

612
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:03,851
Slow down, Chief. Just take it easy.

613
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:09,398
No sudden moves, Chief.

614
00:49:11,026 --> 00:49:13,027
John, it's okay.

615
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:15,029
- Fletch ...
- Easy does it, Chief.

616
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,894
- Got a grip? Got a grip?
- Yeah.

617
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:15,089
Chief! Chief, no! Chief!

618
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:18,092
Anderton!

619
00:50:48,456 --> 00:50:51,083
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

620
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:55,087
Get that thing out of my house!
Get out of my house! Get out!

621
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:00,384
Anderton, stop!

622
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:03,220
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

623
00:51:03,304 --> 00:51:07,349
Do something! try to get them out 
of here! What's the matter with you?

624
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:15,441
- John! Stop!
- Get out of my house now!

625
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,464
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

626
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:40,424
I'm placing you under arrest ...

627
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,633
Go to sleep.

628
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:04,281
Just stay with me.

629
00:56:35,136 --> 00:56:37,137
Dr. Hineman?

630
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:40,057
You're trespassing. 
I don't have visitors.

631
00:56:46,022 --> 00:56:48,815
Oh, I'm afraid that would be
from the Doll's Eye, the vine.

632
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,693
The baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

633
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,988
It's not a true Doll's Eye, of course.
It's a little hybrid of my own design.

634
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:57,741
It's quite something. Once the poison
gets into your bloodstream,

635
00:56:57,825 --> 00:56:59,493
you will start to see
what I can only describe ...

636
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:03,622
as the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

637
00:57:04,373 --> 00:57:08,210
This just isn't your week, is it,

638
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,171
Chief Anderton?

639
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:15,300
I'm not a killer.

640
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:22,599
You better drink this.

641
00:57:22,683 --> 00:57:27,020
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

642
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:29,940
All of it.

643
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:33,026
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

644
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:38,532
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

645
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:45,413
You can tell me
how someone can fake a prevision.

646
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,707
How would I know that?

647
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,793
Because you invented Precrime.

648
00:57:52,547 --> 00:57:54,089
What's so funny?

649
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,884
If the unintended consequences
of a series of genetic mistakes

650
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:00,720
and science gone haywire
can be called invention,

651
00:58:00,805 --> 00:58:02,806
yes, then I invented Precrime.

652
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,891
- You don't seem all that proud.
- I'm not.

653
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,727
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

654
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:08,812
Heal who?

655
00:58:08,896 --> 00:58:11,273
The innocents we now use
to stop the guilty.

656
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:14,359
You're talking about the Precogs.

657
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:17,279
You think the three in the tank
come out of a test tube?

658
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:19,990
They are merely the ones who survived.

659
00:58:20,074 --> 00:58:22,492
I was doing genetic research
at the Woodhaven Clinic,

660
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:23,952
treating children of drug addicts.

661
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:27,330
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

662
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:30,959
It was an impure form of the drug,
not the engineered cocktail ...

663
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:34,421
that became so popular
among the more educated.

664
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:38,258
All of these kids were born
with severe brain damage.

665
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:41,011
Most died before the age of 12.

666
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:44,097
Those few, those precious few
who survived, they had a gift.

667
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:47,684
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

668
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:50,437
They would wake up in the night,
curled up in the corner of their rooms,

669
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:52,355
screaming, clawing at the wallpaper.

670
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,860
Because when these little children,
you see, closed their eyes at night,

671
00:58:56,944 --> 00:59:01,740
they dreamt only of murder,
over and over, one after the other.

672
00:59:01,824 --> 00:59:05,076
And it didn't take long for us to
realize that the real nightmare ...

673
00:59:05,161 --> 00:59:08,288
was that these so-called dreams
were about to come true.

674
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:10,957
These murders
were actually happening.

675
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:17,088
You say some of the children died.

676
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:20,425
So many of them,
despite what we did for them.

677
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:24,888
Or maybe because of what we did
to them. But it doesn't matter.

678
00:59:24,972 --> 00:59:27,515
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

679
00:59:28,893 --> 00:59:31,394
I'm not going to commit murder.

680
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,688
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

681
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:35,690
And yet a chain of events 
has started,

682
00:59:35,775 --> 00:59:38,235
a chain that will lead you 
inexorably to his murder.

683
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,402
Not if I stay away from him.

684
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:40,904
How can you avoid a man
you've never met?

685
00:59:40,988 --> 00:59:42,072
So you won't help me?

686
00:59:42,156 --> 00:59:46,993
I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Precogs are never wrong.

687
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,456
But occasionally,

688
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,167
they do disagree.

689
00:59:56,003 --> 00:59:57,045
What?

690
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:02,092
Most of the time, all three Precognitives
will see an event in the same way,

691
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:06,137
but once in a while, one of them will
seething differently than the other two.

692
01:00:06,222 --> 01:00:09,683
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

693
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:14,604
Because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

694
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:15,939
Why?

695
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:18,191
Obviously, for Precrime to function,

696
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:20,777
there can't be
any suggestion of fallibility.

697
01:00:20,861 --> 01:00:24,239
After all, who wants a justice 
system that instills doubt?

698
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:27,200
It may be reasonable, 
but it's still doubt.

699
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:31,454
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

700
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:35,333
I'm saying that every so often
those accused of a Precrime ...

701
01:00:35,418 --> 01:00:38,336
might, just might,
have an alternate future.

702
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:42,882
Does Burgess know about this?
About this minority report?

703
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:46,261
I used to joke with Lamar that we were
the mother and father of Precrime.

704
01:00:46,345 --> 01:00:49,055
Well, in my experience,
parents very often see their children ...

705
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,016
as they want them to be, 
not as they are.

706
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,600
Answer my question.

707
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:56,438
Does Lamar Burgess know
about the minority report?

708
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:58,606
Yes, of course, he knew.

709
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:00,650
But at the time, 
he felt, we both felt,

710
01:01:00,735 --> 01:01:03,945
that their existence
was an insignificant variable.

711
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,780
Insignificant to you, maybe,

712
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:09,993
but what about those people that 
I put away with alternate futures?

713
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:12,454
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance ...

714
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,539
The system would collapse.

715
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,877
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

716
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:20,086
You want to bring it down.

717
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:24,174
You will bring it down,
if you manage to kill your victim.

718
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:27,510
Why, that will be
the most spectacular public display

719
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:29,888
of how Precrime didn't work.

720
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:33,141
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

721
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:34,517
Why should I trust you?

722
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:36,353
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't trust anyone.

723
01:01:36,437 --> 01:01:39,564
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

724
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:42,692
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

725
01:01:42,777 --> 01:01:45,612
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang onto what he created.

726
01:01:45,696 --> 01:01:49,741
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the minority report.

727
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:54,621
You said
the minority report's destroyed.

728
01:01:54,705 --> 01:01:58,166
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

729
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,044
I designed the system so that 
whenever a report occurred,

730
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:04,005
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

731
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,049
What safe place is that?

732
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:09,219
The safest place there is.

733
01:02:09,845 --> 01:02:12,013
Where is it?

734
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:18,228
Inside the Precog who predicted it.

735
01:02:23,526 --> 01:02:27,320
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

736
01:02:29,657 --> 01:02:31,282
That's all, huh?

737
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:37,747
Just walk right into Precrime,
get in the temple,

738
01:02:37,832 --> 01:02:42,419
somehow tap into these Precogs,
and then download this minority report.

739
01:02:42,503 --> 01:02:45,213
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

740
01:02:45,297 --> 01:02:50,135
Actually, I think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

741
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:52,178
You're insane.

742
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,014
Or you think I am.

743
01:02:55,808 --> 01:03:01,020
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime!

744
01:03:01,105 --> 01:03:06,067
Sometimes, in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

745
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:09,446
As a policeman ...
Oh, excuse me, as a former policeman,

746
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,031
I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people ...

747
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:14,701
who can help you out in this regard.

748
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:24,669
It's funny
how all living organisms are alike.

749
01:03:24,753 --> 01:03:28,756
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on,

750
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:33,261
every creature on the face of the Earth
is interested in one thing ...

751
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:35,054
and one thing only.

752
01:03:36,557 --> 01:03:38,224
Its own survival.

753
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:42,520
Find the minority report.

754
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,487
How do I even know which one has it?

755
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:53,448
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

756
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:57,202
Which one is that?

757
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:01,748
The female.

758
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:06,711
All right, here's where we're at.

759
01:04:06,837 --> 01:04:08,880
Three men in a room.
The victim is here.

760
01:04:08,964 --> 01:04:13,801
John is here. And this 
unidentified male, out the window.

761
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:15,929
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

762
01:04:16,013 --> 01:04:17,805
but I can't make out the location,
which means ...

763
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,307
There's thousands of units 
like this one.

764
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:20,683
Yeah, they're everywhere.

765
01:04:20,768 --> 01:04:23,144
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

766
01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:24,395
Excuse me,
this is Chief Anderton's space.

767
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,522
Casey, he's okay.

768
01:04:25,606 --> 01:04:27,106
- You can't sit in his space.
- He's not here anymore.

769
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:28,525
- He'll be back.
- I doubt that.

770
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:29,776
- What happened to you?
- It's okay.

771
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,945
In the meantime, I'm betting
he's somewhere in the sprawl.

772
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:34,072
Anderton's smart enough to
go where electronic billboards ...

773
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:35,823
and other media can't ID him
to pick his pockets.

774
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:38,409
There's fewer consumers there, which
means fewer scanners to target him.

775
01:04:38,494 --> 01:04:42,038
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

776
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,125
We concentrate on the sprawl.

777
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:49,379
Do flyovers in shifts
with two spyder teams on the ground.

778
01:04:49,463 --> 01:04:53,758
Thermal scan the entire area, read 
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

779
01:05:09,608 --> 01:05:10,817
Where is she?

780
01:05:38,846 --> 01:05:40,388
This damn cold!

781
01:05:42,308 --> 01:05:43,474
Don't worry.

782
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:46,477
You see, I could cut open your chest
and sew a dead cat in there,

783
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:47,687
you would never get an infection.

784
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:51,482
Not with the spectrum of antibios
I'll be shooting into you.

785
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:53,026
That's comforting.

786
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,613
You do understand
I can't just give you new irises.

787
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:58,114
Please don't touch.

788
01:05:58,198 --> 01:06:01,784
Because the scanners will read the 
new scar tissue, alarms will go off,

789
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:04,662
and large men with guns will appear.

790
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:10,668
What was that? What was that?

791
01:06:10,753 --> 01:06:13,963
It's anesthesia.
It's all gonna be downhill from ...

792
01:06:14,048 --> 01:06:15,798
You always sneak up
on your patients like that?

793
01:06:15,883 --> 01:06:19,385
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

794
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,887
Please, relax.

795
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:30,605
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll 
have to remove your eyes completely.

796
01:06:31,523 --> 01:06:32,732
I know.

797
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,318
And I'll have to replace them
with new ones.

798
01:06:35,402 --> 01:06:37,487
I know that,
but I wanna keep the old ones.

799
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:38,655
Why?

800
01:06:39,948 --> 01:06:41,866
Because my mother gave them to me.

801
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,077
What's it to you? They're no good
in the secondary market anyway.

802
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:46,579
Whatever you say. It's your money.

803
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:57,965
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant,
Miss Van Eyck.

804
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:23,950
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

805
01:07:32,668 --> 01:07:34,460
What did you give me?

806
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:38,840
Smile medicine. Tell you what,
since you and I go way back,

807
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:43,136
why don't I just give you my
"old pal" discount? What do you say?

808
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,430
You don't remember me, do you?

809
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:48,099
- We know each other?
- Oh, yes, we do.

810
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,561
From where? D.C.?

811
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:53,771
- Baltimore. East side.
- Baltimore?

812
01:07:53,856 --> 01:07:56,357
- Yeah.
- How do we go way back?

813
01:07:56,442 --> 01:08:00,528
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

814
01:08:00,612 --> 01:08:05,116
You remember? I specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

815
01:08:06,118 --> 01:08:09,078
- I put you away.
- Oh, yeah. You did.

816
01:08:11,498 --> 01:08:13,332
You made those tapes.

817
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:16,502
They were performance pieces.

818
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,674
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out!

819
01:08:22,176 --> 01:08:26,846
Some not as quickly as others, but 
let's change the subject, shall we?

820
01:08:29,433 --> 01:08:34,520
The future is so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

821
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:41,027
Miss van Eyck,
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

822
01:08:42,362 --> 01:08:46,115
She only has eyes for you.

823
01:08:47,785 --> 01:08:51,454
I know what you're thinking, John.
How can I do what I do now?

824
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:56,292
Well, let's say that I did spend an 
awful lot of time in the prison library.

825
01:08:56,376 --> 01:08:57,460
Now that was a great way ...

826
01:08:57,544 --> 01:09:01,964
to avoid some of the more unpleasant
aspects of prison life.

827
01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:05,092
Confinement was a real education,
a real ...

828
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:08,805
eye-opener.

829
01:09:13,685 --> 01:09:18,189
I mean, for true enlightenment, there's 
nothing quite like, well, let's say,

830
01:09:18,273 --> 01:09:21,567
taking a shower while this 
large felon with an attitude ...

831
01:09:21,652 --> 01:09:23,319
you can't even knock down
with a hammer...

832
01:09:23,403 --> 01:09:26,197
whispers in your ear,
"Oh, Nancy. Oh, Nancy."

833
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:27,657
Now, that was a lot of fun.

834
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:29,909
Thank you so very much, John,
for putting me there.

835
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:32,036
Thank you so very much
for giving me the opportunity ...

836
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,163
to get to know myself so much better.

837
01:09:34,248 --> 01:09:36,415
And now, to return the favor.

838
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:50,596
- This your work?
- Yes.

839
01:09:52,224 --> 01:09:53,558
I like it.

840
01:09:54,226 --> 01:09:56,018
Thanks.
You take anything in your coffee?

841
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:58,688
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.

842
01:09:58,772 --> 01:10:00,731
Just sugar, then.
You and John ever come here?

843
01:10:00,816 --> 01:10:04,193
- We used to, every summer.
- He's not here now, is he?

844
01:10:06,446 --> 01:10:07,947
I had to ask.

845
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:12,493
You know,
I don't have any sugar, either.

846
01:10:12,578 --> 01:10:13,744
Thank you.

847
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:17,206
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

848
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,876
You ever heard him
mention the name Leo Crow?

849
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,879
No, but then I don't talk 
to John that much anymore.

850
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:25,006
So you haven't seen his apartment?

851
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,842
- That was our apartment.
- Have you been there recently?

852
01:10:27,926 --> 01:10:31,095
It's full of these.
How long has he been doping?

853
01:10:32,264 --> 01:10:36,434
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.

854
01:10:37,769 --> 01:10:39,604
It was nobody's fault.

855
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:45,484
But John was with him
at the public pool.

856
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:48,738
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

857
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:50,072
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

858
01:10:50,157 --> 01:10:52,241
- I regret ever saying that.
- Then what was it?

859
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:55,578
The FBI found something that
belonged to my son, a sandal.

860
01:10:55,662 --> 01:10:58,581
Anyway, John was upset. He ...

861
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:00,583
He took out his gun and sat down
and watched his home movies.

862
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,960
- He shot ...
- This is all in your statement, Lara.

863
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:05,546
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling.
So what?

864
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:08,841
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

865
01:11:10,177 --> 01:11:11,552
Lamar Burgess thinks you left John ...

866
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:14,180
because he lost himself
in Precrime instead of you.

867
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:20,102
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

868
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:24,857
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

869
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:27,902
That's why I left him.

870
01:11:29,488 --> 01:11:31,322
And now you can leave.

871
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:36,327
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

872
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:46,003
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

873
01:11:47,214 --> 01:11:51,008
In the fridge there's milk,
and Greta made you a sandwich.

874
01:11:51,093 --> 01:11:53,469
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

875
01:11:54,346 --> 01:11:56,597
How do I find the bathroom?

876
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:59,392
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

877
01:12:03,063 --> 01:12:04,814
The kitchen is your left.

878
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:10,236
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

879
01:12:11,405 --> 01:12:13,990
Seeing as we're being old pals and all,
I'm going to give you a bonus.

880
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:15,783
It might come in handy.

881
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:17,868
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.

882
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:20,287
You're gonna shoot this baby 
up there, right under your chin.

883
01:12:20,372 --> 01:12:21,330
What is this?

884
01:12:21,415 --> 01:12:23,708
It's gonna turn your pretty face
into mush.

885
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:26,460
People won't even 
recognize you, okay?

886
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:28,087
In 30 minutes, 
it'll tighten up again,

887
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:31,048
but it's gonna hurt like
nothing you've ever felt before.

888
01:12:31,133 --> 01:12:36,262
Gonna put this in your goodie bag,
together with your leftovers.

889
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:42,018
I'm setting up a timer.
When it rings tomorrow,

890
01:12:42,102 --> 01:12:44,562
you can take off the bandages
and get the hell out of here,

891
01:12:44,646 --> 01:12:48,649
but not before then, or you'll ...
- Go blind, I know.

892
01:12:48,734 --> 01:12:50,401
Don't scratch.

893
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:55,906
A little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

894
01:13:33,111 --> 01:13:35,780
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

895
01:13:36,782 --> 01:13:41,285
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

896
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:05,434
25.16 seconds. That's a new record.

897
01:14:05,519 --> 01:14:06,936
Is that a world record?

898
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:10,606
Is it a world record? 
It's a personal best.

899
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,566
Okay, now I want to time you.

900
01:14:12,651 --> 01:14:13,692
You wanna time me?
You gotta be kidding.

901
01:14:13,777 --> 01:14:17,071
'Cause there's no possible way
I can beat 25.16 seconds.

902
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:19,990
How long can a whale
hold its breath underwater?

903
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:22,409
A whale can hold its breath for
about 20 minutes.

904
01:14:22,494 --> 01:14:25,162
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

905
01:14:27,707 --> 01:14:29,375
We gotta beat the whale.

906
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:33,129
Here you go.
Now, that's gonna be 20 minutes.

907
01:14:33,213 --> 01:14:35,047
You sure you don't want to go
for an ice cream or something?

908
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:36,465
- No.
- Because you know,

909
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,843
you know I'm going to beat that whale.
- Yeah.

910
01:14:39,553 --> 01:14:40,636
- Okay, give me the count.
- Ready?

911
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,347
- Give me the count.
- Three, two, one, go.

912
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:06,620
Sean?

913
01:15:09,749 --> 01:15:11,041
Sean!

914
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,422
Sean?

915
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:19,133
Have you seen ...

916
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,386
Sean! I'm looking for my son.

917
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:25,222
Have you seen a boy
in a red bathing suit?

918
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:27,016
Sean!

919
01:15:28,935 --> 01:15:30,811
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

920
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:37,484
Sean!

921
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:41,405
Sean ...

922
01:17:19,004 --> 01:17:21,338
Jad, we are now in position
and ready to begin thermal scan ...

923
01:17:21,423 --> 01:17:23,632
on all residences on North Powell.

924
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:27,261
I'm thinking you must
really like me, don't you, Fletcher?

925
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:30,222
That's why you asked to partner with 
me on this little sortie, isn't it?

926
01:17:30,307 --> 01:17:31,849
I think you're swell company, Knott.

927
01:17:31,933 --> 01:17:34,977
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the Chief, is it?

928
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:37,396
That you think I might futz 
with him if I had the chance?

929
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,107
No, I just want to watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

930
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:42,818
That's all, Jeff. Evanna, go.

931
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,947
I show 27 warm bodies.

932
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:49,533
Roger that. Confirm 27 warm bodies.

933
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:51,827
What do you think? Four spyders?
One per floor?

934
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:54,246
Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

935
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:13,182
Residents of 931 Powell,
residents of 931 Powell.

936
01:18:13,266 --> 01:18:15,851
This is Officer Fletcher
of D.C. Precrime.

937
01:18:15,935 --> 01:18:18,854
Under authority P.C. Section 6409,

938
01:18:18,938 --> 01:18:21,357
we are deploying spyders
into your complex.

939
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:24,610
- Go, go, go, baby.
- Mom, I'm scared.

940
01:18:24,694 --> 01:18:27,363
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

941
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:29,698
Come on, it's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Just stay still.

942
01:18:29,783 --> 01:18:32,368
Stay still, baby. Open your eyes.
It's okay.

943
01:18:32,452 --> 01:18:34,828
- I don't like it.
- Stay still, stay still.

944
01:18:57,102 --> 01:19:00,437
Come on! You can't just come
barging in here like that! Come on!

945
01:19:00,522 --> 01:19:02,773
You have stepped out on me
for the last time.

946
01:19:02,857 --> 01:19:04,900
I told you where I was!
Now get off my back!

947
01:19:04,984 --> 01:19:08,654
You're a no good liar! I know 
you was with that ho last night.

948
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:15,661
- Leave me alone!
- Get out of here!

949
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:34,031
We lost one.

950
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:38,076
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping
through a window or something.

951
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:41,163
- That's an awful big cat.
- Fletcher.

952
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:44,458
I'll go check it out.

953
01:21:23,498 --> 01:21:24,623
They're crying their eyes out.

954
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:26,750
You terrified them. They're 
absolutely terrified right now!

955
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:29,169
You don't want your kids to know 
terror, keep them away from me.

956
01:21:44,561 --> 01:21:46,436
Wait a minute. The big cat's back.

957
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:49,064
What do you guys think,
a drunk, maybe can't wake up?

958
01:21:49,148 --> 01:21:51,316
Yeah, some guy
who doesn't want to get read.

959
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:54,236
Folks, please be quiet.
Close your doors. Go back inside.

960
01:22:05,248 --> 01:22:07,416
Be quiet and close the door!

961
01:22:14,591 --> 01:22:16,758
We got an ID. It's not him.

962
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:19,928
Standing down.

963
01:22:20,179 --> 01:22:21,221
Let's eat.

964
01:22:21,681 --> 01:22:23,348
Anderton, wait!

965
01:22:35,028 --> 01:22:37,195
Fletcher, take a look.

966
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:42,284
There's four people in this room,
not three.

967
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:46,455
Four? There's Anderton, there's Crow
and there's the man with sunglasses.

968
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:49,374
Here's the man with sunglasses
outside the window.

969
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:56,173
There's also someone here,
in the mirror.

970
01:22:56,257 --> 01:22:58,884
Yeah. Definitely female.

971
01:23:00,053 --> 01:23:04,389
The Precrime Program began in the 
year 2046 with a federal grant.

972
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:06,683
And now, nine years later,

973
01:23:06,768 --> 01:23:09,811
the District of Columbia is
the safest city in America.

974
01:23:09,896 --> 01:23:12,481
Why? Because Precrime works.

975
01:23:12,565 --> 01:23:16,068
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives,

976
01:23:16,152 --> 01:23:17,819
so most of what happens now ...

977
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:20,864
is the verification and the protection
of the future victim.

978
01:23:20,948 --> 01:23:22,324
Can we see the Precogs?

979
01:23:22,408 --> 01:23:25,160
Well, the Precogs have
such a powerful gift ...

980
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:26,995
that they have to be kept
in peaceful seclusion ...

981
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,414
so as not to be distracted
from the outside world.

982
01:23:29,499 --> 01:23:33,919
But this display is to give you some 
idea of what their daily life is like.

983
01:23:34,921 --> 01:23:38,799
The Precogs get over eight million 
pieces of mail every year,

984
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:40,801
more mail than Santa Claus gets.

985
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:44,346
Each Precog has their own bedroom,
television and weight room.

986
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:46,890
It really is wonderful 
to be a Precog.

987
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:14,126
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

988
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:17,212
He's just not a 
very intelligent person.

989
01:24:17,296 --> 01:24:19,047
My mom wouldn't let me go upstairs
and eat in my room.

990
01:24:19,132 --> 01:24:20,716
She made me sit down there
the entire time,

991
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,468
having to listen to him
go on and on and on.

992
01:24:31,853 --> 01:24:35,063
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

993
01:24:51,831 --> 01:24:54,666
Eye-dent, John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

994
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:58,336
I want to get a new dog.

995
01:24:58,713 --> 01:25:00,589
Which I told her 
I should be able to do

996
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:02,215
because I'm so good
at taking care of you guys.

997
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,052
But she thinks that I'll be 
irresponsible, which is ridiculous.

998
01:25:10,183 --> 01:25:14,519
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

999
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:19,149
No, no, no, no!

1000
01:25:19,233 --> 01:25:21,943
Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1001
01:25:22,028 --> 01:25:24,279
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you? Who are you?

1002
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:28,241
I like you, Wally. So, I don't want to have
to kick you or hit you with anything hard,

1003
01:25:28,326 --> 01:25:30,494
but only if you promise to help me.

1004
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:33,705
Hi, John.

1005
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:44,674
Who does that look like to you?

1006
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,761
I don't know.

1007
01:25:51,808 --> 01:25:53,809
It's Agatha.

1008
01:25:53,893 --> 01:25:56,061
He's coming here to get her.

1009
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:01,858
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

1010
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,822
I don't need to see all these.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1011
01:26:06,906 --> 01:26:08,490
I'm looking.
They're not coming out in any order.

1012
01:26:08,574 --> 01:26:10,408
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1013
01:26:14,413 --> 01:26:16,081
Can you see?

1014
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:32,347
- He's inside.
- He's got some kind of mask on.

1015
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:33,974
He sealed the door from the inside.

1016
01:26:34,058 --> 01:26:36,184
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1017
01:26:36,269 --> 01:26:38,937
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1018
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:41,147
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

1019
01:26:41,232 --> 01:26:44,025
John, move away from the tank!

1020
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:46,611
Move away from the tank, John!

1021
01:26:54,954 --> 01:26:58,248
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1022
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:02,460
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1023
01:27:04,463 --> 01:27:06,298
- What does he want with the Precog?
- What do you think?

1024
01:27:06,382 --> 01:27:09,759
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1025
01:27:09,844 --> 01:27:11,469
But there's still the other two.

1026
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:15,056
Wally! Wally!
The other two can still function, right?

1027
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:17,058
You don't understand.
They're a hive mind.

1028
01:27:17,143 --> 01:27:20,604
It takes all three for their 
predictive abilities to work.

1029
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:25,275
Are you telling me
they can't see murders anymore?

1030
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,445
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1031
01:27:28,529 --> 01:27:31,573
She's the one they listen to,
the one with the most talent.

1032
01:27:31,657 --> 01:27:33,491
She takes care of the other two.

1033
01:27:33,576 --> 01:27:35,785
Jesus. Agatha.

1034
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,203
Please, bring her back.

1035
01:27:37,288 --> 01:27:39,831
Find out where that pipe leads.
I want every team underground, now!

1036
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:41,041
It doesn't matter, he wins.

1037
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:43,251
No, no. I'll send my men to EVAC.
We'll stop him in the reservoir.

1038
01:27:43,336 --> 01:27:45,754
Gordon, she's in the room with him
when he kills Crow.

1039
01:27:45,838 --> 01:27:48,089
She's already a part of his future.

1040
01:27:48,174 --> 01:27:50,300
Jad, put everything you've got
into finding that room,

1041
01:27:50,384 --> 01:27:51,593
and we stop a murder.

1042
01:27:51,677 --> 01:27:56,806
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got 51 minutes, 30 seconds.

1043
01:27:59,852 --> 01:28:01,102
You cold?

1044
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:04,981
Can you understand me? 
Are you cold?

1045
01:28:05,066 --> 01:28:07,442
The shivers, 
it's the drugs we gave you.

1046
01:28:07,526 --> 01:28:09,110
It should wear off soon.

1047
01:28:10,196 --> 01:28:13,031
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.

1048
01:28:13,115 --> 01:28:15,200
I need to know how to get at it.

1049
01:28:16,577 --> 01:28:19,621
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
Can you tell me if ...

1050
01:28:19,705 --> 01:28:21,623
- Is it now?
- What?

1051
01:28:21,707 --> 01:28:23,083
Is it now?

1052
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:28,171
Yes, this is all 
happening right now.

1053
01:28:29,674 --> 01:28:31,675
We've gotta take you
some place in public,

1054
01:28:31,759 --> 01:28:34,469
which means I've gotta get you
something else to wear.

1055
01:28:34,553 --> 01:28:37,806
I'm tired. 
I'm tired of the future.

1056
01:28:44,897 --> 01:28:47,816
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.
Welcome back to the Gap!

1057
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,360
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

1058
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:53,738
Mr. Yakamoto?

1059
01:28:57,994 --> 01:28:59,995
Hey, Miss Belford,
did you come back ...

1060
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:02,747
for another pair of
those Shimmy Lace Ups?

1061
01:29:17,722 --> 01:29:19,848
If he's ransoming her,
where's the damn note?

1062
01:29:19,932 --> 01:29:21,933
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1063
01:29:22,018 --> 01:29:25,186
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1064
01:29:27,106 --> 01:29:28,732
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1065
01:29:28,816 --> 01:29:31,276
But he can't download her
without a lot of technical support.

1066
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,070
Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff ...

1067
01:29:34,155 --> 01:29:36,197
because it's been assembled
and scrounged ...

1068
01:29:36,282 --> 01:29:38,408
from spare parts made to order.

1069
01:29:40,453 --> 01:29:43,621
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

1070
01:29:53,299 --> 01:29:55,842
Who's Rufust. Riley?

1071
01:29:58,554 --> 01:30:00,055
What's your pleasure?
We got it all here.

1072
01:30:00,139 --> 01:30:01,431
We got sports fantasies.

1073
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:04,017
We got what I like to call
"Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies,

1074
01:30:04,101 --> 01:30:06,061
which encompasses everything 
from bungee jumping ...

1075
01:30:06,145 --> 01:30:08,354
to soaring like an eagle
over the Grand Canyon.

1076
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:10,565
We got guys coming in wanting 
to experience sex as a woman.

1077
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:12,734
We got women coming, wanna get laid
by their favorite soap star.

1078
01:30:12,818 --> 01:30:16,946
Or just some good, clean fun.

1079
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,325
Yeah.

1080
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:23,411
It's a big rush, but you come out
the other side without a heart attack.

1081
01:30:23,496 --> 01:30:26,164
I want to kill my boss.

1082
01:30:26,665 --> 01:30:28,666
Uh-huh. Okay.

1083
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:31,419
You got some images I can work with?

1084
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:33,129
Rufus!

1085
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:37,092
Yeah, being concert master for the 
Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra ...

1086
01:30:37,176 --> 01:30:38,718
is one of our most popular choices.

1087
01:30:38,803 --> 01:30:40,762
No, no, no. I want to kill my boss.

1088
01:30:40,846 --> 01:30:42,097
You sick bastard!

1089
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:45,350
You're the kind of person that
makes this a terrible world to live in!

1090
01:30:45,434 --> 01:30:47,185
Detective, nice of you
to come down here,

1091
01:30:47,269 --> 01:30:49,437
seeing how every cop in the world
is looking for you right now.

1092
01:30:49,522 --> 01:30:50,688
I need your help.

1093
01:30:50,773 --> 01:30:52,148
Why did you have to come
all the way down here?

1094
01:30:52,233 --> 01:30:54,150
Chief, I make house calls.
You know that.

1095
01:30:54,235 --> 01:30:57,403
- I need your help with her.
- Well, hello there, honeypie.

1096
01:30:57,905 --> 01:30:59,572
I'm impressed, Anderton.
You're on the lam,

1097
01:30:59,657 --> 01:31:03,743
and you still have the time and energy
to slice off a little jerky for yourself.

1098
01:31:04,245 --> 01:31:08,748
- She's a Precog.
- Yeah. Okay. She's a Precog.

1099
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:14,712
You brought a Precog here.

1100
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:30,728
Jesus Christ.

1101
01:31:31,897 --> 01:31:34,774
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

1102
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:35,942
I'm sorry for whatever 
I'm going to do,

1103
01:31:36,026 --> 01:31:38,778
and I swear I didn't do
any of that stuff I did.

1104
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:46,369
She's got information inside of her.
I need you to get it out.

1105
01:31:46,453 --> 01:31:49,831
No way, man. No.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1106
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:53,710
Those thoughts about my cousin Elena,
they were just thoughts.

1107
01:31:53,794 --> 01:31:55,420
You've been busted twice
for felony hacking.

1108
01:31:55,504 --> 01:31:58,339
- So?
- So, I need you to hack into her.

1109
01:32:01,927 --> 01:32:04,804
I tell you what. I do this,

1110
01:32:04,889 --> 01:32:07,307
I get to keep whatever images
I get from her head.

1111
01:32:07,391 --> 01:32:09,100
They don't belong to anybody.

1112
01:32:09,185 --> 01:32:10,602
Take her to RadioShack.

1113
01:32:12,771 --> 01:32:14,105
Rufus, you gotta help me.

1114
01:32:20,487 --> 01:32:24,824
Agatha, I need to see. I need to 
see what's going to happen to me.

1115
01:32:26,285 --> 01:32:27,702
And then we'll go.

1116
01:32:42,009 --> 01:32:45,345
- Wow. She works.
- Slow it down.

1117
01:32:46,805 --> 01:32:50,016
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

1118
01:32:56,315 --> 01:32:59,234
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

1119
01:32:59,944 --> 01:33:01,486
Yeah, recording.

1120
01:33:28,264 --> 01:33:30,890
I know this already. 
Come on, move on.

1121
01:33:34,103 --> 01:33:38,106
Goodbye, Crow.

1122
01:33:46,365 --> 01:33:48,700
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1123
01:33:48,784 --> 01:33:50,368
- What happened?
- I ...

1124
01:33:50,452 --> 01:33:52,787
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

1125
01:33:55,374 --> 01:33:58,209
Where's my minority report?

1126
01:34:00,754 --> 01:34:02,755
Do I even have one?

1127
01:34:08,012 --> 01:34:10,888
- Do I have one?
- No.

1128
01:34:12,725 --> 01:34:14,809
- What?
- No.

1129
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:26,529
What? Agatha, what?

1130
01:34:28,032 --> 01:34:30,575
- Can you see?
- See what?

1131
01:34:46,884 --> 01:34:48,217
Anne Lively.

1132
01:34:56,935 --> 01:34:59,270
You want me to see
who killed Anne Lively.

1133
01:35:00,105 --> 01:35:01,189
Are you recording this?

1134
01:35:01,273 --> 01:35:03,566
Yeah, but look,
it's pouring out of her backwards.

1135
01:35:09,782 --> 01:35:12,116
I like my life. Everything is good.

1136
01:35:23,587 --> 01:35:25,254
They're inside.

1137
01:35:25,923 --> 01:35:27,256
Who?

1138
01:35:28,384 --> 01:35:30,218
All your old teammates.

1139
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:33,137
Get in, left chamber.

1140
01:35:34,014 --> 01:35:35,515
- Hey, close the door!
- Negative!

1141
01:35:36,725 --> 01:35:38,226
- Negative!
- Negative!

1142
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:39,727
Thank you, I don't deserve that.
I'm gonna cry.

1143
01:35:39,812 --> 01:35:40,937
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

1144
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:42,105
- No, you are the man.
- You are the man.

1145
01:35:49,154 --> 01:35:51,322
Can you see the umbrella?

1146
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:55,201
Take it!

1147
01:35:59,665 --> 01:36:01,165
A man in a blue suit.

1148
01:36:01,834 --> 01:36:03,668
He drops his briefcase.

1149
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:15,346
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

1150
01:36:16,849 --> 01:36:18,349
Turn in here.

1151
01:36:25,482 --> 01:36:26,732
Let's go.

1152
01:36:32,448 --> 01:36:33,448
Wait.

1153
01:36:33,532 --> 01:36:36,033
- No, we can't stop here.
- You see the balloon man?

1154
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:44,292
Wait.

1155
01:36:45,752 --> 01:36:47,253
What are we waiting for?

1156
01:36:51,925 --> 01:36:53,759
Wait. Wait.

1157
01:36:54,636 --> 01:36:55,887
Wait.

1158
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,931
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

1159
01:37:02,436 --> 01:37:03,603
Wait.

1160
01:37:08,442 --> 01:37:10,067
Thank you.

1161
01:37:10,986 --> 01:37:12,820
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

1162
01:37:12,905 --> 01:37:14,155
- Negative.
- Negative.

1163
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,157
All right.
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.

1164
01:37:16,241 --> 01:37:18,326
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

1165
01:37:30,547 --> 01:37:32,798
He knows. Don't go home.

1166
01:37:41,642 --> 01:37:42,892
We've got eyes on.

1167
01:37:42,976 --> 01:37:45,728
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

1168
01:37:46,438 --> 01:37:50,399
- Please! Please! Have you got a coin?
- Drop some money.

1169
01:37:53,278 --> 01:37:56,322
Can't you put it in my hand?

1170
01:37:56,406 --> 01:37:59,075
May the Lord bless you.

1171
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:02,787
May God take care of you.

1172
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,808
Damn!

1173
01:38:52,629 --> 01:38:56,215
That's the guy. The man in the window.

1174
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:11,689
Hey. Hey.

1175
01:39:12,816 --> 01:39:15,776
- Rooms are $95 a night, plus tax.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

1176
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:17,778
Yeah, I mind.

1177
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,281
How about now?

1178
01:39:20,365 --> 01:39:22,199
Help yourself.

1179
01:39:35,797 --> 01:39:37,632
He's here.

1180
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:39,842
Anderton, leave.

1181
01:39:46,892 --> 01:39:50,102
You have a choice. Walk away.
Do it now.

1182
01:39:50,187 --> 01:39:53,397
I can't. I have to know. I have to 
find out what happened in my life.

1183
01:39:53,482 --> 01:39:55,024
Please.

1184
01:39:55,108 --> 01:39:59,236
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

1185
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:01,572
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1186
01:40:02,532 --> 01:40:05,326
Come on. Come on.

1187
01:41:24,906 --> 01:41:26,657
Wrong room.

1188
01:41:55,353 --> 01:41:58,355
Leave. Leave.

1189
01:42:55,372 --> 01:42:56,831
Oh, God.

1190
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:05,297
This is Sean, my son.

1191
01:43:09,511 --> 01:43:14,473
Every day for the last six years,
I've thought about only two things.

1192
01:43:16,643 --> 01:43:20,521
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today,

1193
01:43:22,065 --> 01:43:25,484
if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street,

1194
01:43:29,322 --> 01:43:32,867
and second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1195
01:43:37,873 --> 01:43:39,456
You're right.

1196
01:43:41,126 --> 01:43:42,835
I'm not being set up.

1197
01:43:45,797 --> 01:43:47,715
You have to take me home.

1198
01:43:48,091 --> 01:43:50,634
No. No.

1199
01:43:53,972 --> 01:43:57,766
You said so yourself.
There is no minority report.

1200
01:43:57,851 --> 01:44:00,561
I don't have an alternate future.

1201
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:04,356
I am going to kill this man.

1202
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:11,572
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1203
01:44:11,656 --> 01:44:13,741
You still have a choice.

1204
01:44:15,493 --> 01:44:17,912
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1205
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:25,794
Six years ago, Baltimore,
you grabbed up a kid ...

1206
01:44:25,879 --> 01:44:28,380
at Francis Public Pool 
in the West End.

1207
01:44:29,716 --> 01:44:31,634
Did l? I don't know.

1208
01:44:31,718 --> 01:44:34,386
I don't remember
anything about that place.

1209
01:44:38,433 --> 01:44:42,061
Who am l? Who am l?
Do you know who I am?

1210
01:44:42,145 --> 01:44:45,689
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1211
01:44:47,984 --> 01:44:49,568
Sean!

1212
01:44:49,653 --> 01:44:52,446
I told him I was a policeman.
I told him I needed his help.

1213
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:55,866
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a 
song. I bought him a pretzel.

1214
01:44:55,951 --> 01:44:57,952
I bought him a pretzel.

1215
01:44:58,036 --> 01:45:00,621
He was happy. He was happy.

1216
01:45:00,705 --> 01:45:03,874
Is he alive? He's alive.
Where have you got him?

1217
01:45:03,959 --> 01:45:07,002
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?

1218
01:45:07,087 --> 01:45:10,506
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1219
01:45:11,383 --> 01:45:14,677
He floated back up. 
I took him out.

1220
01:45:14,761 --> 01:45:17,179
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1221
01:45:18,974 --> 01:45:20,557
I was gentle.

1222
01:45:25,647 --> 01:45:29,233
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1223
01:45:30,068 --> 01:45:33,320
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

1224
01:45:36,074 --> 01:45:38,450
How could you do that to my ...

1225
01:46:02,142 --> 01:46:03,726
I'm sorry.

1226
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:18,699
You can choose.

1227
01:46:37,302 --> 01:46:40,345
You have the right to remain silent.

1228
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:44,558
Anything you say or do can be
used against you in a court of law.

1229
01:46:45,643 --> 01:46:47,853
You have the right to an attorney,

1230
01:46:47,937 --> 01:46:51,940
now and during any 
further questioning.

1231
01:46:52,692 --> 01:46:55,736
If you can't afford an attorney,

1232
01:46:57,947 --> 01:46:59,948
we will appoint one.

1233
01:47:01,701 --> 01:47:04,119
Do you understand these rights?

1234
01:47:05,497 --> 01:47:07,706
You're not gonna kill me?

1235
01:47:10,668 --> 01:47:14,171
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1236
01:47:17,634 --> 01:47:21,386
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1237
01:47:21,471 --> 01:47:25,349
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1238
01:47:27,477 --> 01:47:29,812
He? Who's he?

1239
01:47:29,896 --> 01:47:33,148
I don't know. 
He called me in my cell.

1240
01:47:33,233 --> 01:47:35,317
He told me I'd be released
if I went along,

1241
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:40,572
and my family would be taken care of.
- If you did what? If you did what?

1242
01:47:42,242 --> 01:47:45,744
If I acted like 
I killed your kid. Okay?

1243
01:47:47,497 --> 01:47:49,706
If you killed my kid?

1244
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:53,544
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1245
01:47:54,212 --> 01:47:56,505
What about the pictures?

1246
01:47:57,215 --> 01:48:00,926
They're fake.
He gave them to me. Okay?

1247
01:48:01,553 --> 01:48:04,138
Now, listen to me. You ...

1248
01:48:04,222 --> 01:48:07,683
You tell me, 
who was it that set this up?

1249
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,269
I don't know.

1250
01:48:11,104 --> 01:48:13,063
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again.

1251
01:48:13,148 --> 01:48:16,191
- Who was it that put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1252
01:48:16,276 --> 01:48:18,318
I tell you who it was,
and my family gets nothing.

1253
01:48:18,403 --> 01:48:20,445
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1254
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:21,989
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1255
01:48:22,073 --> 01:48:24,074
- Kill me. Kill me.
- Give me the gun.

1256
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,577
Leo, let go of the gun.

1257
01:48:26,661 --> 01:48:29,246
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1258
01:48:31,207 --> 01:48:34,751
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1259
01:48:36,588 --> 01:48:38,630
You're not gonna kill me.

1260
01:48:39,424 --> 01:48:41,466
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a ...

1261
01:48:46,264 --> 01:48:48,640
No!

1262
01:48:55,607 --> 01:48:58,066
- Hey, did you see it?
- Stay back!

1263
01:48:58,151 --> 01:49:00,319
What's happening down there?

1264
01:49:01,487 --> 01:49:03,030
Murder!

1265
01:49:03,114 --> 01:49:04,865
Murder!

1266
01:49:07,285 --> 01:49:08,660
It doesn't make sense.

1267
01:49:08,745 --> 01:49:10,913
If you were a child killer,
you took these pictures,

1268
01:49:10,997 --> 01:49:12,873
would you leave them on the bed
for anyone to find?

1269
01:49:12,957 --> 01:49:15,209
They may have been put away.
Anderton might have found them.

1270
01:49:15,293 --> 01:49:18,045
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent. Eight years.

1271
01:49:18,129 --> 01:49:19,504
This would be
your first actual murder scene?

1272
01:49:19,589 --> 01:49:20,547
Yeah.

1273
01:49:20,632 --> 01:49:22,216
I worked homicide 
before I went federal.

1274
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,760
This is what we call 
an orgy of evidence.

1275
01:49:24,844 --> 01:49:27,137
Know how many orgies I had
as a homicide cop, Gordon?

1276
01:49:27,222 --> 01:49:29,848
- How many?
- None.

1277
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:37,481
This was all arranged.

1278
01:49:37,815 --> 01:49:41,443
Today we saw the first murder in the 
six years of the Precrime experiment.

1279
01:49:42,654 --> 01:49:45,489
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1280
01:49:45,573 --> 01:49:49,076
The protection team simply didn't
get there in time to stop the murder.

1281
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:54,289
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Precogs predicted it would.

1282
01:49:54,374 --> 01:49:58,126
I think that today's event put
a human face on the Precrime system.

1283
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:02,256
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1284
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:06,718
Lamar?

1285
01:50:14,102 --> 01:50:15,102
- What?
- Lamar, there's something ...

1286
01:50:15,186 --> 01:50:17,437
terribly wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.

1287
01:50:17,522 --> 01:50:18,563
What?

1288
01:50:18,648 --> 01:50:20,232
I don't wanna say over the phone.

1289
01:50:20,316 --> 01:50:22,067
Meet me at Anderton's.

1290
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,529
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1291
01:50:31,077 --> 01:50:34,871
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1292
01:50:35,957 --> 01:50:37,541
Please, sir.

1293
01:50:40,545 --> 01:50:42,421
Tell me what you have.

1294
01:50:47,051 --> 01:50:50,095
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1295
01:50:51,931 --> 01:50:55,976
Yeah, John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1296
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:58,979
Yes. this is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1297
01:50:59,063 --> 01:51:01,064
Agatha's stream was missing.

1298
01:51:03,109 --> 01:51:05,444
Now this one is from the cyber parlor.

1299
01:51:05,528 --> 01:51:10,073
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1300
01:51:13,244 --> 01:51:16,830
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1301
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:23,086
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1302
01:51:23,838 --> 01:51:26,423
Moving away from shore.

1303
01:51:27,967 --> 01:51:29,301
Now the second image.

1304
01:51:29,385 --> 01:51:32,471
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1305
01:51:33,139 --> 01:51:34,848
Watch the water.

1306
01:51:36,267 --> 01:51:40,645
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1307
01:51:42,732 --> 01:51:45,942
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1308
01:51:46,027 --> 01:51:48,153
According to the Sentry,
Anderton was watching this ...

1309
01:51:48,237 --> 01:51:49,863
at Containment
right before he was tagged.

1310
01:51:49,947 --> 01:51:53,033
Well, I know. He came to me, told 
me about the missing data stream.

1311
01:51:53,117 --> 01:51:54,993
He was concerned 
that you might find it.

1312
01:51:55,078 --> 01:51:58,955
Well, he was right. I did find it.
It was inside of Agatha the whole time.

1313
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:03,627
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1314
01:52:04,295 --> 01:52:07,964
Danny, just tell me 
what you're thinking.

1315
01:52:08,966 --> 01:52:11,802
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1316
01:52:12,428 --> 01:52:13,470
How?

1317
01:52:14,138 --> 01:52:16,264
Well, Jad told me that 
sometimes the Precogs see ...

1318
01:52:16,349 --> 01:52:17,891
the same murder more than once.

1319
01:52:18,309 --> 01:52:22,562
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it "Precog déjà vu."

1320
01:52:22,647 --> 01:52:26,608
Well, we teach the techs
to identify them and disregard.

1321
01:52:26,692 --> 01:52:32,447
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1322
01:52:32,532 --> 01:52:33,907
What if what he was 
really looking at ...

1323
01:52:33,991 --> 01:52:36,743
was a completely
different murder altogether?

1324
01:52:36,828 --> 01:52:39,162
I don't understand.

1325
01:52:39,247 --> 01:52:41,665
All you'd have to do is
hire someone to kill Anne Lively,

1326
01:52:41,749 --> 01:52:45,252
someone like a drifter, a neuroin 
addict, someone with nothing to lose.

1327
01:52:45,336 --> 01:52:47,963
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1328
01:52:48,047 --> 01:52:53,677
haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else,

1329
01:52:53,761 --> 01:52:57,097
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes,

1330
01:52:57,181 --> 01:53:00,684
commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1331
01:53:01,769 --> 01:53:06,481
Technician takes a look, thinks he's 
looking at an echo, erases it.

1332
01:53:11,696 --> 01:53:13,196
Of course, 
it would have to be someone ...

1333
01:53:13,281 --> 01:53:16,116
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1334
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,492
Someone fairly high up.

1335
01:53:20,955 --> 01:53:22,831
Do you know what I hear?

1336
01:53:24,584 --> 01:53:28,378
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1337
01:53:28,463 --> 01:53:32,174
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1338
01:53:32,258 --> 01:53:34,134
Do you know why I can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1339
01:53:34,218 --> 01:53:37,721
Because right now,
the Precogs can't see a thing.

1340
01:54:02,622 --> 01:54:05,248
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1341
01:54:06,292 --> 01:54:09,419
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1342
01:54:17,136 --> 01:54:19,095
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1343
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:21,640
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1344
01:54:23,142 --> 01:54:25,685
- Is he there?
- Yes.

1345
01:54:26,604 --> 01:54:28,855
Has he got the Precog with him?

1346
01:54:31,067 --> 01:54:34,611
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1347
01:54:34,987 --> 01:54:38,740
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1348
01:54:39,825 --> 01:54:41,952
I won't say a word.

1349
01:54:42,954 --> 01:54:47,123
You just don't let 
John leave, all right?

1350
01:54:48,459 --> 01:54:50,168
He's no killer, Lamar.

1351
01:54:50,795 --> 01:54:52,379
I know.

1352
01:55:03,766 --> 01:55:05,267
It's cold.

1353
01:55:10,273 --> 01:55:12,899
Lara, this is Agatha.

1354
01:55:18,322 --> 01:55:23,326
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1355
01:55:26,497 --> 01:55:31,334
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1356
01:55:34,505 --> 01:55:36,214
I gotta sit down.

1357
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:42,512
I gotta figure this out.

1358
01:56:21,969 --> 01:56:23,553
They used Sean.

1359
01:56:25,598 --> 01:56:28,224
They wanted me to
think Crow killed him.

1360
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,061
But he didn't.

1361
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,189
He didn't.

1362
01:56:36,108 --> 01:56:38,401
Why would they set you up?

1363
01:56:46,077 --> 01:56:48,620
Because I found out about her.

1364
01:56:49,747 --> 01:56:51,831
About who?

1365
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:55,627
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1366
01:56:56,921 --> 01:56:58,755
Anne Lively.

1367
01:57:01,467 --> 01:57:02,926
Agatha.

1368
01:57:07,723 --> 01:57:12,352
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead
don't die. They look on and help."

1369
01:57:13,813 --> 01:57:15,605
Remember that, John.

1370
01:57:17,108 --> 01:57:19,275
- Agatha.
- Sean.

1371
01:57:24,198 --> 01:57:28,743
He's on the beach now, 
toe in the water.

1372
01:57:30,579 --> 01:57:33,289
He's asking you 
to come in with him.

1373
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:37,711
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1374
01:57:39,296 --> 01:57:42,006
There's so much love 
in this house.

1375
01:57:47,221 --> 01:57:49,139
He's 10 years old.

1376
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,810
He's surrounded by animals.

1377
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:57,522
He wants to be a vet.

1378
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:03,987
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1379
01:58:05,906 --> 01:58:07,699
He's in high school.

1380
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:10,994
He likes to run, like his father.

1381
01:58:11,537 --> 01:58:14,664
He runs the two-mile 
and the long relay.

1382
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:18,001
He's 23.

1383
01:58:19,503 --> 01:58:21,337
He's at a university.

1384
01:58:22,047 --> 01:58:25,175
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1385
01:58:25,259 --> 01:58:27,719
He asks her to be his wife.

1386
01:58:28,512 --> 01:58:31,514
He calls here 
and tells Lara, who cries.

1387
01:58:33,684 --> 01:58:39,189
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1388
01:58:40,024 --> 01:58:44,194
Oh, God. He's running so fast, 
just like his daddy.

1389
01:58:45,529 --> 01:58:49,032
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1390
01:58:51,202 --> 01:58:55,163
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1391
01:58:55,998 --> 01:58:58,374
And the other man is so fast.

1392
01:59:02,588 --> 01:59:05,256
There was so much love in this house.

1393
01:59:06,425 --> 01:59:08,551
I want him back so bad.

1394
01:59:11,263 --> 01:59:13,014
So did she.

1395
01:59:13,849 --> 01:59:15,517
Can't you see?

1396
01:59:19,313 --> 01:59:21,940
She just wanted her little girl back.

1397
01:59:24,693 --> 01:59:26,694
But it was too late.

1398
01:59:28,656 --> 01:59:31,074
Her little girl was already gone.

1399
01:59:31,826 --> 01:59:33,576
She's still alive.

1400
01:59:35,079 --> 01:59:38,998
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1401
01:59:41,126 --> 01:59:42,627
Agatha?

1402
01:59:45,214 --> 01:59:48,383
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1403
01:59:49,927 --> 01:59:51,970
Who killed Anne Lively?

1404
01:59:53,722 --> 01:59:58,601
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1405
01:59:59,436 --> 02:00:00,478
What?

1406
02:00:00,563 --> 02:00:03,606
Run!

1407
02:00:18,622 --> 02:00:19,998
I love you.

1408
02:00:20,791 --> 02:00:22,625
- Okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

1409
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:25,545
- You'll be fine with them.
- No, no.

1410
02:00:25,629 --> 02:00:26,880
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1411
02:00:26,964 --> 02:00:29,048
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1412
02:00:46,984 --> 02:00:48,526
John Anderton.

1413
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:52,697
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

1414
02:00:52,781 --> 02:00:57,869
I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1415
02:01:01,165 --> 02:01:02,582
That's it.

1416
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:04,834
That's my girl.

1417
02:01:07,004 --> 02:01:09,505
I was so worried about you.

1418
02:01:13,093 --> 02:01:14,761
Did he hurt you?

1419
02:01:18,182 --> 02:01:20,058
I missed you so much.

1420
02:01:20,142 --> 02:01:23,978
It's okay. 
Wally's here. Wally's here.

1421
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:33,905
You're a part of my flock now, 
John. Welcome.

1422
02:01:35,366 --> 02:01:39,953
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1423
02:01:40,037 --> 02:01:46,250
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1424
02:02:03,602 --> 02:02:05,603
This is all my fault.

1425
02:02:06,939 --> 02:02:09,440
There was nothing anyone could do.

1426
02:02:12,027 --> 02:02:13,403
Lara ...

1427
02:02:14,029 --> 02:02:16,781
I thought you might want to have those.

1428
02:02:22,997 --> 02:02:27,458
I haven't worn this in years. I just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1429
02:02:27,543 --> 02:02:29,210
You look great.

1430
02:02:29,294 --> 02:02:33,464
I knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet I did nothing about it.

1431
02:02:33,549 --> 02:02:36,175
Excuse me.
The guy from USA today is here.

1432
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:37,301
Tell him not now.

1433
02:02:37,386 --> 02:02:40,596
- He just wanted a few minutes before ...
- Not now!

1434
02:02:43,392 --> 02:02:47,061
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1435
02:02:47,146 --> 02:02:52,108
But this incident with John made 
me realize the fragility of all this.

1436
02:02:53,485 --> 02:02:56,779
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1437
02:02:57,614 --> 02:03:00,950
Now I have an obligation 
to protect that.

1438
02:03:01,577 --> 02:03:05,329
Lara, I know how 
difficult this is for you.

1439
02:03:05,414 --> 02:03:09,917
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact that ...

1440
02:03:10,002 --> 02:03:12,920
John finally found the man
who killed your son.

1441
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,051
Who's Anne Lively?

1442
02:03:20,304 --> 02:03:22,764
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1443
02:03:23,557 --> 02:03:27,060
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1444
02:03:27,144 --> 02:03:29,145
I don't know who that is.

1445
02:03:30,814 --> 02:03:35,902
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1446
02:03:35,986 --> 02:03:41,074
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1447
02:03:41,158 --> 02:03:43,910
And Witwer?
He was killed with John's gun ...

1448
02:03:43,994 --> 02:03:46,579
inside John's apartment.
- Lamar, do you know the reason ...

1449
02:03:46,663 --> 02:03:50,041
why John came here to work for you?

1450
02:03:50,125 --> 02:03:51,584
- Sean.
- Yes.

1451
02:03:52,336 --> 02:03:55,755
He came here to work for you
because he thought ...

1452
02:03:55,839 --> 02:04:00,510
if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening ...

1453
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:04,388
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1454
02:04:04,681 --> 02:04:09,018
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1455
02:04:09,436 --> 02:04:13,731
Lara, John was the best cop
I ever knew,

1456
02:04:13,816 --> 02:04:17,110
and, in some ways, 
also the best man.

1457
02:04:17,194 --> 02:04:19,779
But the scars he carried around ...

1458
02:04:19,863 --> 02:04:25,409
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the
good things we remember about him.

1459
02:04:25,494 --> 02:04:28,287
And I also know why he married you.

1460
02:04:28,372 --> 02:04:30,706
You're as stubborn as he is.

1461
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:32,291
Lamar ...

1462
02:04:32,376 --> 02:04:35,628
Lara, do you know
how to tie one of these?

1463
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:39,715
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, you see.

1464
02:04:48,058 --> 02:04:50,977
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1465
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:55,481
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1466
02:04:55,566 --> 02:04:59,360
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files,

1467
02:04:59,444 --> 02:05:02,488
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of ...

1468
02:05:02,573 --> 02:05:04,866
What did you say her name was?

1469
02:05:07,411 --> 02:05:09,162
Anne Lively.

1470
02:05:09,746 --> 02:05:12,165
But I never said she drowned.

1471
02:05:32,144 --> 02:05:36,606
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1472
02:05:41,695 --> 02:05:43,946
We'll talk about this later.

1473
02:05:44,823 --> 02:05:48,826
Perhaps tomorrow
I'll come by the cottage.

1474
02:06:26,156 --> 02:06:28,532
I'd like a word with my husband.

1475
02:06:29,493 --> 02:06:31,827
You're not authorized.

1476
02:06:32,621 --> 02:06:34,830
How did you get in here?

1477
02:06:44,258 --> 02:06:45,424
Thank you.

1478
02:06:45,509 --> 02:06:50,513
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1479
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:57,186
On behalf of your staff, we would 
like to present you with this.

1480
02:06:57,271 --> 02:07:00,690
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1481
02:07:02,401 --> 02:07:03,776
How did you get this?

1482
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:05,903
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1483
02:07:09,741 --> 02:07:11,450
Revolvers like this one ...

1484
02:07:11,868 --> 02:07:16,163
were given to generals at the end of
the Civil War by their troops.

1485
02:07:17,165 --> 02:07:21,127
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets ...

1486
02:07:21,211 --> 02:07:24,046
to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death ...

1487
02:07:24,131 --> 02:07:27,133
that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1488
02:07:27,217 --> 02:07:30,928
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national,

1489
02:07:31,013 --> 02:07:34,807
maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us ...

1490
02:07:34,891 --> 02:07:38,311
will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1491
02:07:39,896 --> 02:07:44,066
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1492
02:07:47,654 --> 02:07:50,781
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1493
02:07:50,866 --> 02:07:52,158
I hope so.

1494
02:07:54,494 --> 02:07:57,330
Hello. Yes. Right away.

1495
02:07:58,790 --> 02:08:01,125
Excuse me. Excuse me. So sorry.

1496
02:08:02,127 --> 02:08:03,836
- Sir?
- Yes.

1497
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,838
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1498
02:08:05,922 --> 02:08:07,757
All right. Thank you.

1499
02:08:08,425 --> 02:08:10,343
Yes, this is Burgess.

1500
02:08:10,427 --> 02:08:14,305
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.

1501
02:08:15,182 --> 02:08:17,767
You created a world without murder.

1502
02:08:17,851 --> 02:08:20,978
Sir, everyone wants your name on 
a hat. Can you sign these for us?

1503
02:08:21,063 --> 02:08:23,606
And all you had to do
was kill someone to do it.

1504
02:08:28,278 --> 02:08:29,278
A-room. Jad.

1505
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:33,532
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1506
02:08:33,784 --> 02:08:35,076
I don't know 
what you're talking about.

1507
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,788
I'm talking about Agatha's mother,
Anne Lively.

1508
02:08:38,872 --> 02:08:41,540
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up.

1509
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:45,920
But surprise. She cleaned herself up
and she wanted her daughter back.

1510
02:08:46,004 --> 02:08:47,671
She wanted Agatha.

1511
02:08:50,926 --> 02:08:52,218
Jad, you getting this?

1512
02:08:52,302 --> 02:08:55,137
It's a single stream from the female 
only with no time or incident data.

1513
02:08:55,263 --> 02:08:57,765
Whatever this is, it isn't the 
future. It already happened.

1514
02:08:57,974 --> 02:09:01,560
The problem was, without
Agatha, there was no Precrime.

1515
02:09:01,645 --> 02:09:04,105
She's always been
the strongest of the three.

1516
02:09:04,189 --> 02:09:06,399
You knew without Agatha,
you had nothing.

1517
02:09:06,483 --> 02:09:08,484
Without her,
you wouldn't be where you are now,

1518
02:09:08,568 --> 02:09:11,195
standing there, signing autographs.

1519
02:09:20,163 --> 02:09:21,163
Jad, what are you doing?

1520
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,457
Jad. Jad, what are you 
doing with that?

1521
02:09:23,542 --> 02:09:24,750
What you up to, big man?

1522
02:09:24,835 --> 02:09:27,253
Jad, Jad, let's think
before you send that.

1523
02:09:27,337 --> 02:09:28,337
Slow down.

1524
02:09:49,234 --> 02:09:52,278
So now you had to get rid of
Anne Lively. You had to shut her up,

1525
02:09:52,362 --> 02:09:53,904
which presented a problem.

1526
02:09:53,989 --> 02:09:57,616
How can you kill her
without the Precogs seeing it?

1527
02:09:57,701 --> 02:10:02,121
Simple. Use a system 
you control against her.

1528
02:10:02,205 --> 02:10:04,206
So you hired someone 
to kill her for you,

1529
02:10:04,291 --> 02:10:07,501
knowing full well
the Precogs would see that murder.

1530
02:10:07,586 --> 02:10:10,921
You lured Anne Lively 
out to the lake ...

1531
02:10:11,214 --> 02:10:14,884
with the promise
of reuniting her with her daughter.

1532
02:10:59,763 --> 02:11:01,722
Where's my daughter?

1533
02:11:09,022 --> 02:11:10,231
Where?

1534
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:13,651
Run.

1535
02:11:16,988 --> 02:11:18,113
Run!

1536
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:33,295
And then, when you were all 
alone, you killed her yourself,

1537
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:37,216
in the same way the Precogs predicted
your John Doe would kill her.

1538
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:40,052
You made the real murder
look like an echo,

1539
02:11:40,136 --> 02:11:44,640
knowing the tech would do what 
he was trained to do. Disregard it.

1540
02:11:51,064 --> 02:11:54,984
Anne Lively became
just another missing person.

1541
02:11:56,194 --> 02:11:58,696
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1542
02:12:00,073 --> 02:12:02,074
What are you gonna do?

1543
02:12:13,336 --> 02:12:15,087
We got a Red Ball!

1544
02:12:20,844 --> 02:12:26,265
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1545
02:12:26,349 --> 02:12:31,437
Think about all the lives she will save.
That little girl could have saved Sean.

1546
02:12:31,521 --> 02:12:34,023
Don't you ever say his name!

1547
02:12:36,526 --> 02:12:39,528
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1548
02:12:39,738 --> 02:12:42,781
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up!

1549
02:12:42,866 --> 02:12:45,784
That was the one thing you knew
that would drive me to murder.

1550
02:12:46,202 --> 02:12:49,371
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1551
02:12:49,706 --> 02:12:51,498
- How are you gonna ...
- Shut me up?

1552
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:53,751
Forgive me, John.

1553
02:13:02,427 --> 02:13:04,094
Forgive me, John.

1554
02:13:15,815 --> 02:13:18,400
Lamar, it's over.

1555
02:13:19,694 --> 02:13:24,865
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1556
02:13:38,254 --> 02:13:40,631
No doubt the Precogs
have already seen this.

1557
02:13:41,132 --> 02:13:42,675
No doubt.

1558
02:13:44,177 --> 02:13:46,345
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1559
02:13:47,097 --> 02:13:51,308
If you don't kill me, Precogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1560
02:13:52,435 --> 02:13:56,313
If you do kill me, you go away,

1561
02:13:56,398 --> 02:14:00,317
but it proves the system works.
Precogs were right.

1562
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:10,035
So, what are you gonna do now?

1563
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:13,622
What's it worth?

1564
02:14:14,499 --> 02:14:16,333
Just one more murder.

1565
02:14:19,921 --> 02:14:24,550
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but 
people will still believe in Precrime.

1566
02:14:24,634 --> 02:14:28,303
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1567
02:14:32,475 --> 02:14:37,396
Except you know your own future,

1568
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:40,899
which means you can change it
if you want to.

1569
02:14:42,193 --> 02:14:46,613
You still have a choice, Lamar,
like I did.

1570
02:14:52,203 --> 02:14:54,788
Yes, I have a choice.

1571
02:14:56,291 --> 02:14:57,916
And I made it.

1572
02:14:59,210 --> 02:15:00,878
Forgive me, John.

1573
02:15:02,839 --> 02:15:04,298
Forgive me.

1574
02:15:09,929 --> 02:15:11,680
Forgive me, my boy.

1575
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:31,533
Lamar!

1576
02:15:43,046 --> 02:15:47,591
In 2054,the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1577
02:15:55,558 --> 02:15:58,644
ALL prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released,

1578
02:15:58,728 --> 02:16:03,190
although police departments kept watch
on many of them for years to come.

1579
02:16:50,947 --> 02:16:56,034
Agatha and the twins were transferred
to an undisclosed location,

1580
02:16:57,954 --> 02:17:01,540
a place where they could find 
relief from their gifts.

1581
02:17:01,624 --> 02:17:05,252
A place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
