1
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,495
- Darling!
- Please leave me alone!

2
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,587
- Listen, Danny, you know
how much I love you.

3
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,587
- Why don't you just say it like it is:
"Danny, I don't love you anymore."

4
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,307
"In fact I never loved you."
- That's what you ought to say.

5
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,908
- You're mad. It's not my fault, it's 
because of my friends and family!

6
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:39,267
- They weren't opposed to...

7
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,308
...our engagement.
- They have done some inquiries in Paris.

8
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:43,748
And the facts were bad.

9
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:46,828
- Ah!
- What are your parents doing?

10
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:50,427
- I told you, my dad is dead.
Mom is in real estate but I haven't

11
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,827
seen her in six years.
- Is she the one sending you money?

12
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:57,307
- Stop counting numbers.
It's ridiculous.

13
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:02,947
Obviously this is about the difference
in our financial status.

14
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,987
It's sad and absurd.

15
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,627
- You don't understand. It's not like that.
- What then? 

16
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:12,227
- This concerns things that
you will understand later.

17
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:14,667
- I understand it right now.

18
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:18,667
You are like all other people, 
you think you love and you say:

19
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,507
..."I love you".
Because you feel like doing so. 

20
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,867
- Danny!

21
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,147
- I had a feeling it would end
like this.

22
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,667
I don't want to see you ever again.

23
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:31,067
Tomorrow I will have left London.
- You're leaving?

24
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,227
- Maybe rather the day 
after tomorrow.

25
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,587
Go!

26
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,827
Don't stay to see me cry.

27
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,427
Because I won't be crying.

28
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:45,946
(A man sings a song of love)

29
00:03:46,266 --> 00:04:19,986
....

30
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:26,786
- I simply want to say
how much I love you.

31
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:31,947
I can't hide 
my desire, my burning desire.

32
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:36,107
'Cause that's true happiness,

33
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:42,547
...the joy that nothing can kill.

34
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:47,947
Often lovers think...

35
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:51,706
...that they should hide
their true feelings.

36
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:57,667
And they have to go through
a thousand tortures.

37
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:01,467
I don't envy them
their tortures.

38
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:02,866
Thank you.

39
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,906
I have come to tell you...

40
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,426
...that I love you.

41
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:13,386
And you will repeat once more
and forever my song of love.

42
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,786
(Knock on door)
- Enter.

43
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,146
- What is it?
- A telegram from London.

44
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,386
It was sent to rue Spontini
Mme Vraque brought it over.

45
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:31,906
- It's from my daughter.

46
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:34,866
She's coming.

47
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,026
- It's been a long time since you
saw her last?

48
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,386
- 6 years! She's been
touring England, America.

49
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,306
She's a famous pianist.

50
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,307
Serious girl.
- Well, some have to be that too.

51
00:05:53,467 --> 00:06:22,467
....

52
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:26,627
- Mom!
- Darling, how you have grown!

53
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,627
Incredible.
- One changes during 6 years.

54
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,827
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

55
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:35,587
- What made you do the travel?
- I'll tell you when we get home.

56
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,107
You seem tired.
- A bit from travelling.

57
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,747
- Let me take that.
- No!

58
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,227
- Give me your coat, then.
Come!

59
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,987
20 rue Escudier at Boulogne.

60
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,987
- But your address used to
be rue Spontini?

61
00:06:56,387 --> 00:07:00,387
- I moved two years ago.
I chose a place that was more quiet.

62
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:03,667
- Then how did you get
my letters?

63
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,747
- They were forwarded to me, sweetheart!
- Oh!

64
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,747
To bad, rue Spontini
was very nice.

65
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:44,867
....

66
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,707
-No, not like that!

67
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:54,107
-Hello Florence, is Mme Jenny there?
-Not yet.

68
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,347
-And Mme Vraque?
-She is in her office.

69
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,547
-Hello Benoît.
-Hi.

70
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:05,427
She's still with Lucien?
-More than ever.

71
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,787
-What's up with her?
-Who knows?

72
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:13,667
-She doesn't realize?
-She's even buying him a new car.

73
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:15,507
-And everything is working
well here?

74
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:17,627
-So and so.

75
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,667
-I'll have to take charge and
create some order here.

76
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:23,587
It's not serious, the way
the place is run.

77
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,547
And the club had such 
a good start!

78
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,187
(knock on door)
-Yes.

79
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,947
-A costumer wants to
see Mme Jenny.

80
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,387
-I'll go. 
Do you mind?

81
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,147
Can I help you?

82
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:49,547
-Mme Jenny is not in?
-That's right, I'm acting in her place.

83
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:53,107
-I am planning to come here tonight
and I would like to reserve a table.

84
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,187
-That can be easily done.
-It's a bit delicate.

85
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:59,787
You see, I'm supposed to
meet someone.

86
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:03,628
I already know Mme Jenny,
when will she be back?

87
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:07,067
-Not until tonight.
-That's unfortunate!

88
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:08,547
-I'm sorry.

89
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:12,188
-Don't be. My respects.
-Goodbye, dear sir.

90
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,947
I hope we'll see you here again.
-Certainly.

91
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,428
-Jenny's an extraordinary lady, too bad
 she's heading the wrong direction.

92
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,508
Life is like mayonnaise,
you shouldn't miss out on it.

93
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:31,828
-Certainly.

94
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,388
-The champagne isn't here yet.
-Mme Jenny takes care of that.

95
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,988
-We have to wait for her 
to show up?

96
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,788
-She is taking a wrong turn!

97
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,508
A wrong turn, I tell ya!

98
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,788
-Oh, vaguely!
If I had known that it mattered

99
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:50,788
to you, I would certainly 
have made the trip to London.

100
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,308
-It wouldn't have made much
difference anyway, you know.

101
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,547
-Well, you know, the lack of
 information was an obstacle.

102
00:09:57,907 --> 00:09:59,187
Or maybe an excuse, rather.

103
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,507
People can say what they want, but 
your father was a distinguished man.

104
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:07,068
I'm not a millionaire,
but I have a job to go to.

105
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:08,748
I even work very hard.

106
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,708
-It's better that it came out this way.
-Maybe you're right.

107
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:14,948
Don't be sad.

108
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:18,748
-I'm not sad,
it's forgotten.

109
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:24,388
I'm looking at your room and
I find it very nice.

110
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:28,507
And what a large bed!

111
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,547
-I adore large beds.

112
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,147
One sleeps better in them.

113
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,307
-You're the one who's looking sad!
-Me!

114
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:45,467
-We have the same smile.
I take after you.

115
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:46,827
-No.

116
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,227
-Does that bother you?
-What are you saying!

117
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:54,627
What would you like to do?

118
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,027
-What I'd like to do?
-What would you like to do in life?

119
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:03,587
-Everything seems interesting to me,
but I have so little experience.

120
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,667
-Let's go to the theatre.

121
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:09,108
-Paris by night! In London one
talks a lot about that.

122
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,508
-But at night I seldom have time.
I work at night.

123
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:16,947
But I'll manage somehow.

124
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,188
-Tell me!
-Yes.

125
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:26,628
-Why didn't you stick to real estate? 
That was easier on you.

126
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,668
-I earn more doing this.

127
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,428
-This place of yours, is it 
a kind of restaurant with live music?

128
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,908
-That's right!
-You'll take me there?

129
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:39,188
-It's a restaurant
like any other.

130
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:44,148
And also, I am associated partner.
In business, these are delicate matters.

131
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:46,468
I have to make a call.

132
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,067
Hello, Hotel des Glycines?
Mr Lucien Dancret, please.

133
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,108
Ah!

134
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,348
He didn't say when he'll
be back?

135
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,388
It's Mme Gauthier calling.

136
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,188
-Well, don't tell him that 
I called.

137
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,548
It's ready?
-Yes. You're not dressing here?

138
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,988
-From now on I'll be doing it there.
-Everything is prepared.

139
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:27,188
-Thank you Paulette.

140
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,068
You see Danielle, I manage.

141
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:35,307
If you want to read there are plenty
of books and there's also a radio.

142
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,588
Or else, ask Paulette. She's kind.
-When will you be back?

143
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,148
-Late, so don't wait up for me!

144
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,628
Bye, darling.
-Bye.

145
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,308
-Good evening, my lovely.

146
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:48,708
Thank you.

147
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:52,108
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Madame.

148
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,028
-Paulette!
-Yes?

149
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,348
-How long have you been working here?
-Only a couple of days.

150
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,508
Your mother didn't live
here before then.

151
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,867
-Thank you.

152
00:13:06,187 --> 00:14:06,868
....

153
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:09,868
-Tell Jenny that I'm
waiting for her at the office.

154
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:10,948
-Okay.

155
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,988
-Do you mind?

156
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,069
Let's get back where we ended!
-Yes, let's.

157
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,908
As strange as it may seem,
I really am a dreamer.

158
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:44,148
So I am hoping....
-Hoping what?

159
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,148
-Well, uh, for a meeting....

160
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:50,588
-Well, well!
-Don't put it like that!

161
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,668
You're supposed to be a good fairy
when it comes to arranging such matters.

162
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:57,308
-And you, you're a monster.
-A monster?

163
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:01,548
-You had a charming girlfriend.
-Yes, but she was too expensive.

164
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,788
Jewels! Furs!

165
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:08,028
-I see, you need someone
more disinterested.

166
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:09,268
-Exactly!

167
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,388
-Good evening. Jenny,
you're expected at the office.

168
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:15,868
-I'm coming. 
Well, I'll have to excuse myself.

169
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,668
I'll be back.

170
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:21,428
-On one condition, think about
what I just said.

171
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,388
-Well, I'd even say that that's
what I am here for.

172
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:47,348
....

173
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,708
-I always paid you correctly.
-You paid me correctly?

174
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:53,228
You owe me 50 000 francs.

175
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:57,668
-Would you have preferred it if I 
left the place the way it was?

176
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:01,548
-The place went very well. Then came
 your boyfriend who ignored your past. 

177
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:06,189
Soon your fantasies about him
started to cost a lot of money.

178
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,469
Him costing me: Benoît!
This won't stand much longer.

179
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:13,309
-Don't talk like that. There are vast 
expenses and the ongoing crisis.

180
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:16,229
You don't know about the crisis,
do you?

181
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,149
-Do you think that I'm a moron?

182
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,469
Do you think that I ignore the
millions of francs that are coming in?

183
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,309
Your little traps bring in a fortune.
-You know how much?

184
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:30,949
-Yes I do. Nothing here is happening
without me knowing.

185
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,109
-Trust is the word, I see.
-Not any longer!

186
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:37,508
Not after you started doing
all these mistakes.

187
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,068
It's in your own interest.

188
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:43,308
I assure you: You are not
being serious.

189
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:48,468
You are not paying your debts and
there is no champagne to be served.

190
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,308
-Oh, Benoît, what morality!

191
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:56,189
-When morality leaves the arena,
money is galloping behind!

192
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,749
You're only thinking of
your little runner!

193
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,228
-Benoît, you're talking drivel!

194
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:07,548
-If this doesn't end, I'll take all back.
You'll have to manage with him.

195
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,308
We'll see afterwards.
-I'm free to do as I please!

196
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,708
-Nobody is free.

197
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:17,748
You're getting too old for such follies!
You'll have to face facts.

198
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:22,988
To think that we may in fact
have been made for each other.

199
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:26,548
Bah! I could have made
you happy, no?

200
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:30,348
I'm somebody after all. People 
greet me. They respect me.

201
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:34,948
I'm Benoît. That's not just anything.
What does he do, your young man?

202
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,108
He boxes.

203
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:42,228
He's a crawler. Crawling!
To think they call that swimming!

204
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,949
He's a second class gigolo, 
I tell you!

205
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,149
A Swiss cheese, that
can be crushed flat.

206
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,669
So ....

207
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:56,429
If you want to stick with
a draft of air!

208
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,309
But I warn you,

209
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,509
...the day that turns wrong, I'll get 
difficult! And you know how that is.

210
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,788
Good evening, see you tomorrow
 for the usual aperitif.

211
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:09,788
-See you tomorrow.

212
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:16,468
(singing a blues tune)

213
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:31,948
....

214
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,388
-All I want in life is to 
be loved for being who I am.

215
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,868
-That's rare.

216
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:38,348
-I am handsome.

217
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,028
-Life is unjust.
-And I am rich.

218
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,748
-Does that count?

219
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,948
-Good evening, Monsieur.
-Good evening.

220
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:53,668
Mme Jenny, please.
-She's be here soon.

221
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:56,068
Would you like to have a seat?

222
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:00,228
-No, I don't like music,
and I don't like dancers.

223
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,268
I don't like noise.

224
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:05,348
I just want to talk to
that lady.

225
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,588
-This way, please.

226
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:18,469
-Am I disturbing you?
-Not at all.

227
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,749
-Ravishing!

228
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,229
You are ravishing.

229
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,629
What eyes!

230
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,709
I really like you a lot.
You don't know me.

231
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:39,109
But I have money, lots of
money. I can give you some.

232
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,468
I like to give where
there is beauty.

233
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:46,228
Take this. It's for you.
-No, keep it yourself.

234
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,189
-What, you won't accept the money?

235
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,509
You are formidable,
you are magnificent!

236
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:57,028
It's incredible.
-I'm an artist, Monsieur.

237
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:58,508
What do you want?

238
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:01,228
-Artist?

239
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:06,469
Ah, I'd like to see Mme Jenny,
a remarkable woman.

240
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:09,908
-She's not there. Would you like to
see Mme Vraque instead?

241
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:13,468
-No, but would you accept this?

242
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:18,268
If you see her, tell her that
the Albino was here.

243
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:20,988
Remember, the Albino.

244
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:25,948
I'll be back. I like you 
a lot, miss.

245
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,428
You are beautiful.

246
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,468
-I like all things fresh.

247
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,628
I love youth.

248
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,508
I'll come back to see you, 
miss.

249
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,148
See you soon.

250
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,908
Bye.

251
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:05,509
-What is it?
-A guest wanted to see Mme Jenny.

252
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,108
A strange guy.

253
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,868
He has left his wallet and 
said his name was the Albino.

254
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:16,389
-What? The Albino came and you
let him go?

255
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,029
You're mad!

256
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,988
-No, I work here as an artist.
-Yes.

257
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,949
So, go and do your number!

258
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:31,468
She let the Albino go!

259
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:35,828
-And now, ladies and
gentlemen,

260
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:40,828
...I have the pleasure of introducing
our charming Miss Florence.

261
00:21:41,228 --> 00:22:03,628
....

262
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:07,228
-But I insist. And it's my duty
to insist. So I repeat:

263
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:10,629
There are certain things that
a man shouldn't accept.

264
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:15,628
-Your new dress suits you very well.
-You're lacking tact, Lucien.

265
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:18,549
-We don't share the same principles.
-Yes, but we share the same tailor.

266
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,789
-Lucien, I tell you. If I had the money,

267
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:25,149
...I'd pay my dresses myself, and I would
pay yours. Cause now you're paying mine.

268
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,429
But if I had money, it would have been 
earned from real work. You hear?

269
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,749
-You make me want to cry.
Wait for me here.

270
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:38,389
-Where do you want me to go?
-I don't know. The Salvation Army?

271
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,149
-Life isn't easy.
To keep up, that's what it's all about.

272
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,269
-You said it! To keep up.

273
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:49,989
-Am I disturbing?

274
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,669
-Not at all!

275
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:56,189
We're in agreement, then, little lady.
I'll give you a call.

276
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,509
-Between 5 and 7 o'clock.
-That's it.

277
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:07,708
So?

278
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:09,948
Are you in a better mood today?

279
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:11,708
-Well, I was kind of sad.

280
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:15,308
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

281
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:18,188
What is it, Lucien?
-Nothing.

282
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:22,228
I'm so tired of it all.

283
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,908
Money, money.... Always money!

284
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:28,868
You agree to lend some dough as a token
from a friend one day and so it goes.

285
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:30,468
-Are you crazy?

286
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,548
-No, I'm not.

287
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:37,028
I remember the first day you 
put money in my pocket, Jenny!

288
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:40,668
Oh, it was very discreet,
a pack of cigarettes,

289
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:44,028
...some bills with it,
and so the story went on.

290
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,628
Now I am intoxicated
and I want it all to stop.

291
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:48,948
-What's eating you?

292
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:51,908
If I give you money, that's
because I love you.

293
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:55,868
You'd have done the same for me.
-Yes, but I don't have any.

294
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,028
-You'd manage somehow!

295
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:00,748
If I told you: Lucien, I need 
you to do something for me!

296
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:04,428
-Yeah, I'd do something.
-Well, there you see!

297
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:07,828
-But I have nothing.
When we met, Jenny,

298
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,708
...I wasn't doing that good.

299
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:13,148
I managed, I didn't earn much,
but I enjoyed it.

300
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:16,628
While now, I'm doing
nothing at all.

301
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,148
You can't imagine how
bored I am.

302
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:25,028
Well, I'm as lazy as any
other guy.

303
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:29,748
But sometimes I have felt happy when 
my hands have been smeared with oil.

304
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:33,268
-That's right: Blame me for having
brought you to the manicurist!

305
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,788
-The manicurist, bah!
-You are constantly making quarrels.

306
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:40,868
The truth is that you love some 
other woman, but won't tell me.

307
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:43,868
-Women!
-Don't act modest!

308
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,748
You're eye candy for
every woman in town!

309
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:50,868
Wouldn't be strange if you fell for one.
-You're crazy, Jenny!

310
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:53,669
I tell that I....
-That you love me, right!

311
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,869
You love me plenty!

312
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:57,269
-And Florence?

313
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:59,789
You don't love her?

314
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:01,229
-Florence!

315
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:02,829
Are you dreaming?

316
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,389
-I may dream, but I see clearly.

317
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,829
When you're around, she turns
and stammers.

318
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:12,549
-Do I stammer?
-You're hiding your game too well.

319
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:14,069
Enough.

320
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,469
Excuse me, I have to
make a call.

321
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:18,749
-You are excused.

322
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,110
-It's a personal call.

323
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,430
I'd like to be alone!

324
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,069
You too are turning and
stuttering.

325
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,670
But I'm discreet, you know!

326
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,190
-My sweet love!

327
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,149
A moment!

328
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,109
Hello, M. Lucien.

329
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:50,870
You don't say hello anymore?
-Sorry, how are you?

330
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,030
-Very well.

331
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,709
You don't seem to be doing
too good on the other hand.

332
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:59,389
-What makes you say so?
-I don't know.

333
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,549
Even your smile is sad.

334
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,989
-Go get Danielle. Oh, its you!
I didn't recognize your voice.

335
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,949
-I'm a bit out of my
element, you know.

336
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,669
Yes, mom, I'm bored.

337
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:15,389
Terribly bored.

338
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,909
-Tonight we'll go to the Comédie
 Française. I have two seats.

339
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:22,429
I'll pick you up at 7.30 pm.
Would that cheer you up?

340
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,389
It's difficult for me to get
an evening off.

341
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,389
Make yourself pretty!

342
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:31,269
So long, darling.

343
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,669
-You don't love Jenny.

344
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:38,070
You don't love me,
you love nobody.

345
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:42,109
All you love is money.

346
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:43,509
-Money!

347
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,229
-It's not your fault.

348
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,589
You have full pockets and 
an empty heart.

349
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:51,829
One can't have it all.

350
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:58,309
-Why do you talk to me this way?
I never did anything to you.

351
00:26:58,629 --> 00:26:59,829
-Exactly.

352
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,949
-Don't feel inconvenient,
 you two!

353
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,749
Come with me, I have to do some 
shopping, go to my dressmaker,

354
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,749
...and meet Benoît
for the aperitif.

355
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,469
The Dromedary will be there, he's
funny. I enjoy him a lot.

356
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:19,589
-He disgusts me.
-In any case you won't be staying long.

357
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:22,589
Do you have your car?
-Yes. And Xavier's in it!

358
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,469
-Him again!
-Yes! He's teaching me good manners.

359
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:26,829
See you again some day, Florence.

360
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,150
-You see, Benoît, that guy,
I really can't stand him.

361
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,110
If I only see his smile, 
it hurts inside.

362
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,790
-May I, Dromedary?
-Of course, my lovely.

363
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,470
-Thanks, honey.

364
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,030
-What has Lucien done to you?
-Nothing, but he ignores me!

365
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,670
He despises me.

366
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,110
The others here make jokes about 
my high and pointy back.

367
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,990
But not him. He ignores me.

368
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,710
Oh, and also,

369
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,150
...he's too well shaped.

370
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,830
He should be modified.
You get my drift, Benoît?

371
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,870
Transform him a bit.

372
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,990
I'd also like it if he limped.

373
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,070
That he were one eyed.

374
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,550
-You're making me laugh.

375
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,990
-Look!

376
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,350
There he is, me little favorite.

377
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,870
-I don't want to hang out with 
people like that!

378
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,590
I'll go to the bar. 
Will you join me?

379
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,470
-Romeo et Juliet!

380
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,510
-A Juliet well past her bloom ....

381
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,550
-Hello, gentlemen.

382
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,190
-So, life is good?
-Life is what it is.
-Well, that's already something!

383
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,270
-Do you mind?
-Not at all!

384
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,030
I don't mind when people touch
my hump.

385
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,710
-Say, Benoît?

386
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,710
Guess who came by
last night?

387
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,190
-I don't like riddles.

388
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,590
The Albino!
-The Albino!

389
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,750
He left his wallet and said that
he would be returning.

390
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,390
-The Albino?

391
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,790
-You wouldn't understand.
Youth today!

392
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,269
What do they learn in school?

393
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:38,429
-Keep your reflections for yourself.
-Interesting.

394
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:42,829
When he's around, be sure he'll be
spending. Pays 300 like that for a bottle.

395
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,469
One day, in a club, he met a
young dame, nothing special.

396
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:53,229
He liked her and bought her the club, 
a house, a Rolls and then left.

397
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:56,189
-What's he doing?
-I dunno. Business.

398
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,950
-He's called the Albino because 
he only goes out at night.

399
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,070
And he's also called the Admiral
because he has a yacht.

400
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,990
-He's into steel, cotton, matches....
-Not an easy guy to satisfy.

401
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,110
He mustn't be touched, 
as he's very fragile.

402
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,950
He mustn't be looked at,
as he's so ugly.

403
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,830
And you mustn't cry when he's 
around, cause he hates tears.

404
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,830
-Nice guy!

405
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,751
-That's not what it's about.

406
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,550
It's about having money and
knowing how to spend it.

407
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,990
-Where are you going?

408
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,590
-To get some fresh air.

409
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,790
-Some people are empoisoned
by that stuff!

410
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,470
-Benoît is right
the open air isn't good for you.

411
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,910
Look, once I was fishing
for eels.

412
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,990
-Nuff of that!

413
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,270
-Oh, let him tell his fables.

414
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,470
-I was saying that I was fishing for 
eels, and when the eel is caught

415
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,310
...he can fight all he wants, 
but he starts to breathe 

416
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,151
and inevitably ends up dead.

417
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:55,711
The morality of the tale is,
those who live at the bottom

418
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,391
.... they better rest there.

419
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:03,072
-Ah, you're talking as
if you were a book!

420
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:05,631
-I don't think much of your stories.

421
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:09,592
I'll give you an advice,
not a friendly advice, of course.

422
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,672
But a good advice anyway. 
If you want to eat eel,

423
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:16,512
...make sure that you use
a good and solid fork.

424
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:17,792
Waiter!

425
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:21,352
How much will it be?
-42 francs.

426
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:26,312
I guess you're also paying Xavier's bills.
-I won't let you pay.

427
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,792
-I'll wait for you in the car.

428
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:31,832
-I'll come with you.
-I have things to discuss.

429
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:35,152
-I told you I'll pay you the sum.
-Saying and doing are not the same.

430
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:39,472
I'll pass by the club tonight 
with the Dromedary.

431
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,871
He's good at counting, you see.
-As you please.

432
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:43,511
-It's a deal.

433
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,392
-So, are you angry?

434
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,472
-I was right you see, the best 
thing would be to let me go.

435
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:04,472
-I don't want you to go.
What would I do without you?

436
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:07,632
I couldn't go on living.
-Do you call this living?

437
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,672
-It's not for me only.

438
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,032
It's for the whole establishment.

439
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:15,512
Jenny must stop her 
foolish behavior.

440
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,832
-No, I'm not mad.
I'm quite lucid.

441
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,433
It's a strange disease,
lucidity.

442
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:26,472
-Come, I'll accompany you.
-No, tonight I can't.

443
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:29,552
I'm meeting someone.
-Have fun.

444
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,792
-What can you do?
She loves him.

445
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,472
If he had a hump,
she wouldn't.

446
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,392
She would even be disgusted!

447
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,151
Oh, imagine that!
M. Lucien with a hump.

448
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:51,591
What a good looking 
Quasimodo he would make!

449
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:54,871
We must make that happen.

450
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:58,111
Think about it, Benoît.

451
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:01,191
It would be easy,
we'd only have to strike.

452
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,312
What joy would come of it.

453
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:08,112
-You're jealous!

454
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:12,192
Are you in love with Jenny?
-No!

455
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,192
I love my dog!
-Your dog?

456
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:19,352
Do you have a dog!
-No.

457
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,672
I only love that which I have not.

458
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:29,033
-Have you seen my friend Lucien?
-Yes.

459
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:30,552
Where is he?
-Gone.

460
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:33,592
-Without leaving his address.
-Unfortunate.

461
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,032
-Where are you dining tonight, 
Marquis?

462
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,752
-Very funny!

463
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:43,392
We don't have the same way
of seeing things.

464
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:46,512
-So you're saying you're not hungry?
-Not at all.

465
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:50,111
-You'll dine with us, then.
-Well actually.... Let me see.

466
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,791
I have no obligations, so I'd
be glad to!

467
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,031
-The acting was very good!
-Almost too good.

468
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,431
Were you bored?
-No, as I were with you I wasn't.

469
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,672
But all these actors with old costumes.... 
I like what's new and alive.

470
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,032
-Hello, dear Jenny!

471
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,912
Delighted to meet you here.

472
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:27,792
The performance was charming.
The young lady is charming as well.

473
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:31,472
Will we get to see her at rue Spontini?
-Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

474
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:35,112
-Of course, but we'll meet again soon,
I'll be passing by.

475
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,231
-Who was that?

476
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:44,392
-Nothing. A guy I was doing
some business with.

477
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:47,272
-Why did he call you Jenny?

478
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,952
-He must prefer it to Jeanne.

479
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:53,352
You know, he's a bit fresh,
not well behaved!

480
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:57,591
-He said rue Spontini!
-That's normal, as he's an old client.

481
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,551
-Ah!
-Ah, look!

482
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:09,392
Good evening.
-Mme Vraque is here.

483
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:10,552
-What's she doing?

484
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:13,632
-She drinks. Had the lights turned off.  
-Who's that?

485
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:17,033
-An old friend.
She's a bit odd.

486
00:35:17,393 --> 00:35:20,392
She's suffering from insomnia and makes
visits at 1 am. You go to bed, darling.

487
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,752
-I'm not sleepy.
-That doesn't matter!

488
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:25,592
Good night, darling.

489
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,393
I thought I told you not to
let anyone enter here.

490
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:35,953
Good Lord, it's as if you're
doing it all on purpose.

491
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:39,113
Nobody has called?

492
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:42,233
That's probably best.

493
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:50,553
I told you never to
come here.

494
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,513
Why aren't you at the club?

495
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,353
-I wanted to see you.

496
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:58,193
Have a calm talk.

497
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:02,713
Benoît and the Dromedary
often come by.

498
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,193
They spy on you.

499
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:08,153
Be careful, Jenny!

500
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:13,393
I too had a friend
that I loved dearly.

501
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,352
He died in a strange way.

502
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:19,752
During 3 days he was delirious.

503
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:22,352
He saw giraffes.

504
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:26,153
He called me grandmother.

505
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:28,952
It was terrible.

506
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:32,553
I brought the papers.

507
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:35,833
Look at the advertising,
it's very well done.

508
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,433
Fine insert cards, 
fine advertisement.

509
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,113
-Very well. Now get up!

510
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,673
Come on!

511
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,593
-And your daughter.
-Leave her be. 

512
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,073
-I want to see her.
-She's asleep.

513
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:51,473
You've had enough to drink. Come!
-I too, I had a girl once ....

514
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,793
...or a boy. I can't remember
anymore.

515
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,594
-That doesn't matter.
Come!

516
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,034
-You always have the best port wine.
-Yes, yes.

517
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:05,514
-I too had a very good port. Best in Paris.
-Yes. Come now!

518
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,434
I have a car ready.

519
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:12,274
-Believe me, you'd better be
careful Jenny!

520
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:15,553
They pass by every day .... the police.
But after all, Jenny isn't just anybody!

521
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,154
-If you say so. 
Go, now. Go!

522
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:24,354
-Watch out. For the Dromedary.
-I'll do that. Now go!

523
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:27,154
-Don't forget, I'm your friend.

524
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:28,234
-Leave!

525
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:33,434
-You can't say they're
not behaving well.

526
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:35,954
They're correct and polite.

527
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:40,274
They even say hello and ask 
how things are going.

528
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:44,194
But they're always on the look.

529
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:48,314
Let them look, cause there
is nothing to find.

530
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,553
When they want to find something,
they end up finding something.

531
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,554
(Chez Jenny - the merriest place in Paris.
Pretty Paris girls from midnight to dawn)
Be careful Jenny.

532
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:01,874
-Don't worry. That's not what's
keeping me up at night.

533
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:06,034
-If there was an investigation,
if you'd have to close....

534
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:09,394
-You're sauced!
-I'm not drunk.

535
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:10,514
-No!

536
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:12,274
Wait for me downstairs.

537
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:22,354
-Why did you come down?
-I wanted to say good night.

538
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:25,114
-I'll go right up.
Good night darling.

539
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:29,234
What a strange look you have.
-It's nothing.

540
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:33,954
-Something bothering you?
You should tell me what it is.

541
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,394
You can tell me everything, Danielle.
-It's nothing, mom.

542
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:41,114
Go, you'll be late.

543
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,674
-You're behaving strangely.
-No, I assure you.

544
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:47,274
-You worry me.
-Why?

545
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,954
-I'm not sure. 
Bye.

546
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:05,074
-You're not going to bed?
-I'll be going.

547
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:08,114
-Do you need me for anything?
-Yes, get me my robe.

548
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:11,034
(Piano playing)

549
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:22,754
....

550
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:24,514
-Jenny!
-What!

551
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,634
-I'm in love.
-Impossible.

552
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,834
-Have some champagne.
-No, I'm not amorous.

553
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:36,035
-I'll give you 1000 francs
if you join me to drink.

554
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:40,394
-Sold! Get up, toots.
Your arguments are irresistible.

555
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,954
We don't have anything to drink.
Get us a Cliquot.

556
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:47,514
Is it really true?
-Sure!

557
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:03,875
-9,5 francs.

558
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,194
-It's a good spot.
Charming ladies.

559
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:08,794
-It's a nice distraction.

560
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,274
-What a joker!

561
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:27,873
-A table, miss?
-I'd like to see Mme Jenny.

562
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:31,354
-Miss Florence, take care
of the young lady.

563
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:34,794
-What do you wish?
-To see Mme Jenny.

564
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:40,713
-It's a bit difficult right now.
She's with some costumers.

565
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:45,874
Are you an artist?
-No.

566
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:50,274
-Really? Cause you don't look
like the type.

567
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:52,554
-What type?

568
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:57,314
What is this lady dealing with?
-What same as she used to.

569
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,754
But a little more hidden.

570
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,634
-But isn't this a restaurant?

571
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:09,274
Hide me. I don't want to 
see this woman.

572
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,633
-But that's Mme Jenny's manager.
-Hide me.

573
00:41:13,393 --> 00:41:16,273
(Piano plays a tune)

574
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:55,394
....

575
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:58,754
-Oh, no, you're crazy!

576
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:22,955
....

577
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:27,235
-So is Jenny coming?
-Be patient, she has a good table.

578
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:29,954
For once she's actually working!

579
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,274
She's placing the strike
rather early.

580
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,394
-You already said so.
-I'm patient, but I know when to act.

581
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:39,034
-No, that's enough. Go!

582
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:45,314
-If you go I'll kill myself.
-So go on and kill yourself, darling.

583
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:49,554
-There she is.

584
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:57,955
-I'm all yours, Benoît.
-Good!

585
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,434
You don't mind,
the Dromedary is a good accountant.

586
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:04,914
-I don't mind.

587
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:16,394
-Hello, Monsieur.
-Hello.

588
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,794
-I know that you
don't like noise or music.

589
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:21,554
-No, I don't like any of that.

590
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:25,154
-You'd probably prefer the 
little salon, it's more calm.

591
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:27,874
-Yes.
-I'll let Mme Jenny know.

592
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:31,394
-Don't tell her,
I don't want to see her.

593
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:34,074
-Everything is fine.
-Some champagne?

594
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:37,194
-No, no champagne.
I'm fine!

595
00:43:38,874 --> 00:43:41,674
(Piano playing)

596
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:51,194
....

597
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:52,754
-Oh!

598
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:58,874
But this house is really a
paradise filled with birds.

599
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:03,035
Each time there is
a new surprise.

600
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:06,034
You are a flower, 
miss!

601
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,754
Normally I hate flowers, but
you I really like.

602
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:16,514
A wallet is like a flower.
It opens and it blooms.

603
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:22,874
Why do you hide behind
the curtain, little girl?

604
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:35,154
-Wait for me.

605
00:44:41,994 --> 00:44:45,474
-What shall we do?
-Let me go or I'll cry.

606
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:49,354
Let me go!

607
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:54,394
-What's up?
-The Albino is with a chick.

608
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:01,635
- Let her go!
-Let me go!

609
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:03,955
-I beg your pardon!
-Let her go!

610
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:06,555
-What's this supposed to mean?

611
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:13,794
-I don't know what you're doing
here, but you should be going.

612
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,874
-Help!

613
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:25,074
-Help!

614
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,194
-Help!

615
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:30,914
-Help!

616
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:38,395
-Help!

617
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:40,795
Call the police.

618
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:43,555
Help! Police!

619
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:48,635
-Why are you crying like this?
-Somebody hit me.

620
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:51,115
-Someone slapped you,
and what then!

621
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,195
-In my face!
-Don't scream like that. Calm down.

622
00:45:55,115 --> 00:45:57,035
-Who did this?
-Mr Lucien.

623
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,554
-Where would you like to go?
-I don't know. Anywhere.

624
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:21,274
-You'll be hearing from me!
You'll know my name!

625
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:24,393
The little cheat!

626
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,033
Thank you, no!

627
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:31,673
And the other one who struck
me brutally to the ground.

628
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,194
My wallet!

629
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,234
You can keep it.

630
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:42,914
Money is of no importance.
I don't care about it.

631
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,953
But brutality!
That I don't like.

632
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,434
I like what's soft.

633
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,834
Birds!

634
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,514
Flowers!

635
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,554
Yes, I like flowers.

636
00:47:01,474 --> 00:47:03,274
But brutality, no!

637
00:47:04,195 --> 00:47:06,034
I'll never set my foot in here again.

638
00:47:08,914 --> 00:47:11,514
What I like is freshness.

639
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:13,995
It's softness.

640
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:16,994
It's youth.

641
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:20,434
It's beauty!

642
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:34,195
-Nice work indeed!

643
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:37,395
-Who's the girl?
-No idea.

644
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:40,915
-Touching romance,
with handsome Lucien involved!

645
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,995
Why would he come here
with a girl?

646
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:46,595
-To have you see her!

647
00:47:46,955 --> 00:47:48,635
-No, she came by herself.

648
00:47:49,395 --> 00:47:52,315
-Wake up!
We know how Lucien is.

649
00:47:54,515 --> 00:47:58,395
It's crazy, she has a spot that works,
the Albino comes with plenty of dough

650
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:01,475
...and then Lucien comes and screws 
it all up because he feels like it.

651
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:04,395
Bastard!
-Let me laugh.

652
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:06,355
-What's that supposed to mean?

653
00:48:06,835 --> 00:48:07,675
-Oh, nothing!

654
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:09,635
Come, Benoît!

655
00:48:10,315 --> 00:48:11,435
-Ah, yes!

656
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:16,834
-Collect that in stead of
walking in your sleep.

657
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:37,675
....

658
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:40,315
-Anywhere, that's right here.

659
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:43,555
-No, let's not stay here.
A little further.

660
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:45,234
-Like I thought! Anywhere.

661
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:11,114
-What's wrong, Jenny?
-Oh, nothing!

662
00:49:11,474 --> 00:49:14,354
-That's what everybody says
when something is wrong.

663
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:18,074
-I tell you it's nothing.
-Tell me what's wrong.

664
00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:19,914
-I'd like to leave.

665
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:25,234
But it's too late!
-Get yourself together!

666
00:49:26,274 --> 00:49:29,434
You're not alone in life.
You have a daughter.

667
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:31,914
-That's true.

668
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:33,834
I have a daughter.

669
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:37,915
-Go to sleep.
It will do you good.

670
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:40,835
-Yes.

671
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:55,515
-Where are we?
-Anywhere.

672
00:49:56,155 --> 00:49:57,395
-It's like London.

673
00:49:57,715 --> 00:49:58,755
Docks.

674
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:01,915
-Places people works all
resemble each other.

675
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:05,595
-Why did we go here?
It's gloomy!

676
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:08,515
-You don't like it?
-I think it's alive.

677
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,715
-You like to walk?
-Yes.

678
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:11,955
-Me too.

679
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:16,195
-Say, if you don't like the landscape,
just take the car and leave!

680
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:20,955
-That's a great occasion for me,
who always wanted to go to Chartres.

681
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:25,035
Unbelievable! I have never
seen the Chartres cathedral.

682
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:27,755
It's a real jewel, in a style....

683
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:30,794
-You and your style! 
How much do you need?

684
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,994
-I don't know, enough
for the gas.

685
00:50:34,354 --> 00:50:38,634
Oh, and I'd like to get some 
souvenirs, post cards and such.

686
00:50:39,554 --> 00:51:09,035
....

687
00:51:09,395 --> 00:51:12,835
-This is a strange encounter.
-Yes, very strange.

688
00:51:13,715 --> 00:51:17,155
-What are you doing?
-You're cold, take this!

689
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,115
-Thanks, you're very kind.

690
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:31,675
-But what were you doing there?

691
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:34,635
-Nothing, 
I came with some friends.

692
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:38,075
-You didn't know what kind
of place it was?

693
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,635
-No, and nor did they.

694
00:51:40,995 --> 00:51:44,475
I was looking for them and then
that man turned up.

695
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:45,635
-Ah!

696
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:49,275
-You don't seem to believe me?
-No, I believe you.

697
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:51,315
-I'm tired.

698
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:54,115
I don't feel like lying.

699
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:57,915
-There are moments in life
where you need some truth.

700
00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:02,795
Do you have parents?
-My mother, that's all.

701
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:05,235
-That's already something.

702
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:08,515
-Mine died the day I 
was born.

703
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,035
We barely met.

704
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:14,755
What would your mother say,
if she saw you at this time of day,

705
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:18,435
...alone with a man on the canal?
-She would say lots of things.

706
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:20,035
Too much.

707
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,635
You are looking at me?

708
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:27,075
-Yes, and I'm thinking that what
you are saying seems true.

709
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,555
That's a rare thing.

710
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:30,794
-Why is it rare?

711
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:34,074
-I'm living a grim life,
that makes me suspicious.

712
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:38,034
-And I am living a sad life, or rather
a dull one. It's the same thing.

713
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:40,954
-Strange.
-What's strange?

714
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,875
-Normally I keep telling stories to
show off when I meet girls.

715
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:48,035
With you I feel I'm being very
straight forward.

716
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:52,394
-I'm just like you.
What's your name?

717
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:55,074
-Lucien, and yours?
-Danielle.

718
00:52:55,554 --> 00:52:57,434
-Danielle, that's nice.

719
00:52:57,754 --> 00:52:58,794
-It's cold.

720
00:52:59,194 --> 00:53:01,314
-Let's go further.
-Yes.

721
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,283
-Are you walking around all
by yourself, miss?

722
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:28,522
-Yes.

723
00:53:29,202 --> 00:53:30,122
-Come with me.

724
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:31,722
-Where to?

725
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:35,762
-I'm going to Chartres to see the 
cathedral. Want to come along?

726
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:47,522
-Your car is great!

727
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:49,882
-One must have what one needs.

728
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,321
-What I would like is to be seated on
my suitcase and wait for a train or a boat.

729
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:17,521
-You'd like to go away?
-Yes, but there would be two briefcases.

730
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,641
Yours and mine, but that is
only a dream.

731
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:26,441
I'm sentimental in 
the mornings.

732
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,961
You finally smiled.
I could see your teeth.

733
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,961
If we were to leave, we'd
go to a harbor.

734
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:37,921
-When I was little I played with the
fishermen at Belle-Ile.

735
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:40,921
It's very beautiful in February.
There is already mimosa in bloom.

736
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:44,402
-I know Belle-Ile and it's mimosa!
-Really?

737
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:45,762
-I stayed there a while...

738
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:49,562
...11 years.
-Maybe I have seen you.

739
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:51,681
-No!
-Why?

740
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:53,721
-No reason.

741
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:00,041
There's a prison for young boys
at Belle-Ile.

742
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:04,601
You have probably passed by it?
-I can't remember. I was just a little kid.

743
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,161
-Me too.

744
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:09,722
I was a little kid too.

745
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:14,081
-Hi, good evening everybody.

746
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:17,801
A coffee with brandy,
 if somebody is offering me one!

747
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:21,841
-I don't want to see your ugly face here.
-You're not being polite!

748
00:55:24,122 --> 00:55:27,962
-Be considerate, it's a 
costumer like any other.

749
00:55:28,322 --> 00:55:30,122
Give him a coffee with 
brandy.

750
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:31,202
-Thank you.

751
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:35,641
-You're good.
-No.

752
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,881
I just think that one should 
treat everybody right.

753
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:41,801
One day, I could turn
out like him.

754
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:43,121
-No way.
-Yes, maybe.

755
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:46,481
-In London there are 
lots of poor people too.

756
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,842
-Did you stay there a long time?
-Yes, and I'd like to go back.

757
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:55,362
-Somebody waiting for you?
-No, but I worked there.

758
00:55:57,002 --> 00:55:59,722
-Do you mind?
I'll read the palm of your hand.

759
00:56:00,082 --> 00:56:03,242
-Leave us alone.
-But he'll enjoy it.

760
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:05,842
-Oh, I see voyages.

761
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:09,122
You're crossing something.
Where are you going?

762
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:12,682
You were in England and you'd
like to go back.

763
00:56:12,762 --> 00:56:12,842
You were in England and you'd
like to go back.

764
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:16,122
Nobody is waiting for you and
you have a job there.

765
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:21,121
Boss! A coffee with brandy.
-That's all right.

766
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:22,561
-May I?

767
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:26,642
-It will be harder with me, as
I haven't said anything.

768
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:27,922
-Doesn't matter.

769
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:31,962
What a strange white hand.
Let's see the other one.

770
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:34,802
It's alike.

771
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,322
Oh, what nails!

772
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:39,362
Not bad!

773
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:43,202
You certainly won't get killed
carrying heavy cases.

774
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,922
But you seem to have been carrying
a lot a long time ago.

775
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,042
A hand of a man!

776
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:52,282
Lazybones, you're doing nothing
nowadays.

777
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,962
No, you're not doing
anything!

778
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:58,002
-Leave me alone.
-What?

779
00:56:58,362 --> 00:56:59,962
-I'm a tad nervous.

780
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:03,282
-Excuse me, I didn't know!
-How much do I owe?

781
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:06,162
-You're going?
-I'll take you back.

782
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:09,962
-Why leave all of a sudden?
Sit down.

783
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:14,002
We're fine here.

784
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:18,161
-You know what we could do?
-No.

785
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:22,481
I know. Make a date for 
tomorrow and not show up.

786
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:25,121
-Why?
-I told you I lead a grim life.

787
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:26,401
-Me too.

788
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:28,241
I'm alone.

789
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:30,121
All alone.

790
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:34,642
-What you're telling me is strange,
and it's sad.

791
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:38,881
On the other hand it makes me happy,
it makes me feel closer to you.

792
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:43,682
-Boss! A coffee with brandy.
-It's coming right up.

793
00:57:45,722 --> 00:57:48,202
-Hello, Lucien isn't there?

794
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:52,362
He hasn't said when he'll
be back.

795
00:57:52,682 --> 00:57:55,042
I'll call back.

796
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:58,361
-It's very hot.
-Thank you Paulette.

797
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:01,121
Danielle isn't back yet?
-No.

798
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,841
-She gets back late.

799
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:04,161
(Door bell)
-Ah!

800
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,841
Well, Danielle?

801
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:18,441
You're coming back at dawn.
What's this supposed to mean?

802
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,241
-Nothing. I go out.
I meet people.

803
00:58:22,561 --> 00:58:23,921
-This has got to stop!

804
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,842
It can't go on.
-Yes, I know.

805
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:36,122
I already told you, we don't
care for the same things.

806
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:38,482
-But I'm your mother!

807
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:40,402
-Yes.

808
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:43,802
I remember, in London,

809
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,482
...my departure.

810
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:49,202
-What do you mean?
-Oh, nothing.

811
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:52,202
But I'm 21 years old, I'm free.

812
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,402
-Don't say that, Danielle.

813
00:58:54,722 --> 00:58:57,242
I said so too when I was
your age.

814
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:59,962
-I want to go back.
-Go?

815
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:04,082
-Yes, I'll go see my impresario
tomorrow.

816
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:06,882
-Why do you want to go?

817
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:09,243
-Oh, no particular reason.

818
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,363
How could I explain?

819
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:13,683
It would only complicate matters.
Sleep well.

820
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,083
-Danielle!

821
00:59:33,682 --> 00:59:34,602
Hello.

822
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:37,762
Give me Mr Lucien.

823
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,203
Is it you, Lucien?

824
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:45,083
You were back,
it was a misunderstanding.

825
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:47,762
I tried to reach you 
several times.

826
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:51,162
I was so sad and lonely.

827
00:59:52,682 --> 00:59:55,322
Yes. Say, what about tomorrow?

828
00:59:58,042 --> 00:59:59,122
You're taken.

829
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:01,122
You're always taken.

830
01:00:01,482 --> 01:00:02,842
Oh, don't lie to me!

831
01:00:03,882 --> 01:00:05,762
You don't understand.

832
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:08,882
No, I'm not crying, 
I'm not begging.

833
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:12,242
No, it can't be over like that.
That's impossible.

834
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:13,362
Listen!

835
01:00:13,682 --> 01:00:15,402
No, let me talk.

836
01:00:16,082 --> 01:00:17,082
Lucien!

837
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:18,842
Luc....

838
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:25,362
It's not possible.

839
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:29,082
It's not possible.

840
01:00:31,682 --> 01:00:33,242
-Who's there?
-Xavier!

841
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:38,563
So old man, what's up.
I never see you anymore.

842
01:00:39,643 --> 01:00:41,683
-You're worried?
-Yes I am.

843
01:00:42,043 --> 01:00:44,603
Everybody are worried.
-Ah?

844
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:49,083
-Jenny is looking for you by the 
way. You know she can't stand me.

845
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:53,162
But the other day she came 
and asked me where you were.

846
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:56,562
She almost cried.
I was moved.

847
01:00:58,082 --> 01:00:59,282
What's this?

848
01:00:59,842 --> 01:01:01,442
-Blue Gauloises.

849
01:01:02,322 --> 01:01:04,402
-What? What's happening to you?
-Nothing.

850
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:06,882
-Well now I have seen all!

851
01:01:07,603 --> 01:01:09,442
Blue Gauloises!

852
01:01:09,802 --> 01:01:13,482
-If you're getting along with Jenny, do 
me a favor and hand over something.

853
01:01:13,802 --> 01:01:14,762
-Hand over something to her?

854
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:18,123
-Yes, I'm going on a trip.
-Oh yeah? Where are we going?

855
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:19,723
Deauville, Cannes?

856
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,923
-I'm going away, but without you.
-You're traveling alone?

857
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:25,163
-No, but that's none of
your business.

858
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:28,883
-There no room for me
in your car?

859
01:01:29,243 --> 01:01:33,243
-No, but it's because of the car
that I need to get in touch with Jenny.

860
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:36,283
You must give her back
the papers.

861
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:38,923
-The papers?
-Yes, the papers.

862
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,683
She can pick the car up 
in the garage.

863
01:01:42,043 --> 01:01:45,563
-What, are you going mad?
-No, I'm following your advice.

864
01:01:45,923 --> 01:01:48,043
I'm changing my way of life.
I'm following your advice.

865
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:50,723
-Don't be a fool, Lucien!

866
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,243
There's a big difference 
between saying and doing.

867
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:59,204
You're being stupid. Scruples,
niceties, those are fine things!

868
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:03,964
But they also make you starve.
And all this for that girl on the canal!

869
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:05,924
-Oh, get off it, Marquis!

870
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:13,363
-Blue Gauloises! And you're leaving?
-Yes, tomorrow.

871
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:17,283
-Think about your future, 
what will you be doing?

872
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:21,203
-You know English?
-Some. German too.

873
01:02:21,923 --> 01:02:24,243
And Latin.
-Well, read this then.

874
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:26,163
Alright?

875
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,443
-You're taking up running?

876
01:02:29,803 --> 01:02:33,083
-They let me rejoin the team.
-You're out of your mind!

877
01:02:33,443 --> 01:02:36,003
You'll get crushed
for nothing at all.

878
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:39,763
The only thing lacking now 
is that you get married!

879
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,003
That would top everything!
-I am going to get married.

880
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:45,723
You'll be my best man!

881
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:53,843
-Is Mr Lucien home?

882
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:56,363
-He's on a travel, Madame.

883
01:02:56,923 --> 01:02:57,683
-Ah!

884
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,283
I'll wait for him.
-As you wish.

885
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:13,323
-Don't talk nonsense!

886
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:17,163
200km an hour, that's too much.
-Yes, I know.

887
01:03:17,483 --> 01:03:18,363
-Lucien!

888
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:26,404
-You here?

889
01:03:27,323 --> 01:03:29,604
-Yes, it's me.
-You're in luck.

890
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:32,404
-You think so?
-I am seldom here.

891
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:33,524
What do you want?

892
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:37,203
-Listen, it's been 15 days since
I saw you last.

893
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,124
You're not even making up
excuses anymore.

894
01:03:40,924 --> 01:03:43,523
I know that you want 
to leave me.

895
01:03:43,883 --> 01:03:47,683
I didn't come to bother you.
-Bother me.... those are only words.

896
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,763
I'm in a hurry,
what do you want?

897
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:54,563
-I don't know. I hoped at least that
you would have come.

898
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:57,963
-That I would have come?
-You wouldn't understand.

899
01:03:58,323 --> 01:04:00,963
-In an hour I'll be available,
where would you like to meet?

900
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:03,723
-The usual place for an aperitif.

901
01:04:04,043 --> 01:04:05,683
-Alright. I'm off.

902
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:09,123
-You are really coming, right?
It would mean a lot to me.

903
01:04:10,283 --> 01:04:12,843
If you only knew all I'm
going through at the moment.

904
01:04:14,803 --> 01:04:17,283
Everything is passing away.

905
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,003
Everything is going
to pieces

906
01:04:20,763 --> 01:04:22,723
-What's wrong?

907
01:04:25,123 --> 01:04:27,283
-Nothing. Go now!

908
01:04:35,283 --> 01:04:38,563
-It's the same, after all!
-What's the same?

909
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:42,243
-I don't know.
-If you don't know, then shut up!

910
01:04:46,723 --> 01:05:14,883
....

911
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:17,523
-You look sad?

912
01:05:17,883 --> 01:05:22,523
-No. But I spoke with my agent, and 
there's no work to get in eight days.

913
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,123
-You know English?
-Some.

914
01:05:25,483 --> 01:05:27,443
-Then read this!

915
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:34,724
-Oh, Lucien!

916
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:37,644
-I'm getting back my place
in the team.

917
01:05:38,004 --> 01:05:41,404
-Yes, that's great.
-But it doesn't make you happy?

918
01:05:41,764 --> 01:05:45,204
-I want to go with you.
-Sure you will!

919
01:05:45,564 --> 01:05:48,124
-Do you have enough money?
-We don't need that.

920
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:51,764
I won't get much in the start,
but it will suffice.

921
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:54,604
Shall we dine together tonight?
-I can't.

922
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:57,324
-Why?
-I have to see my mother first.

923
01:05:57,684 --> 01:06:01,084
-You haven't told her you're leaving?
-I have mentioned it vaguely.

924
01:06:01,444 --> 01:06:02,964
-What did she say?
-Nothing.

925
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:04,724
-That's strange.

926
01:06:05,604 --> 01:06:07,244
-It's nice here!

927
01:06:08,204 --> 01:06:11,364
-You can breathe freely.
-With you around I feel good any place.

928
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:27,244
- Still alone Mr Marquis?
-Still.

929
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:31,044
Friendship is a rare thing. Friends 
leave you one after the other.

930
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,404
I have become skeptical lately,
very skeptical.

931
01:06:47,324 --> 01:06:49,644
-But you used to be close friends!
-Yeah.

932
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:53,405
-What's the use of it all?
A dame passes by and then ....

933
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:56,404
-She arrives and the friendship ends.

934
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:59,204
-Is she a good looker?
-Very young.

935
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:01,844
-How old?
-18, 20 years.

936
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:06,724
-If you're going, I can't hold 
you back. There's nothing to do

937
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,884
That's life!
-Are you mad at me?

938
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,244
-Certainly not!

939
01:07:13,564 --> 01:07:15,684
-It was set to end like this.

940
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:19,804
I was loosing right from the start.
That's how it is.

941
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:22,044
-Excuse my frankness, but

942
01:07:22,444 --> 01:07:25,804
...I'd prefer to be correct.
-You may be right.

943
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:29,924
-Your car is in front of the door.

944
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:34,804
-You don't want to keep it,
as a memory of me?

945
01:07:35,924 --> 01:07:37,884
-You know, memories....

946
01:07:39,244 --> 01:07:40,164
-Listen,

947
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:43,844
...I don't want to make interrogations,

948
01:07:44,204 --> 01:07:46,484
...but this woman you're 
leaving with,

949
01:07:47,684 --> 01:07:49,284
...how is she?

950
01:07:50,284 --> 01:07:51,404
Is she young?

951
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,924
-Don't ask.

952
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:56,404
-They don't look too happy.

953
01:07:56,764 --> 01:07:59,084
-It's the goodbyes of Fontainebleau!
-I don't like to see...

954
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:01,564
...women cry.
-Really?

955
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:04,884
-Yes, cause they never
cry because of me.

956
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:08,604
-I have lost everything.
More than you could imagine.

957
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:11,004
I can't explain.

958
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:13,605
What a drag life can be!

959
01:08:14,325 --> 01:08:18,885
-I always told Lucien that he lacks
tact and distinction.

960
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:22,805
As for you, you are
badly dressed.

961
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:26,645
-Badly dressed in a 2000 francs suit?
-It's not cut right for you.

962
01:08:27,005 --> 01:08:29,845
-Especially the back!
-Stop joking!

963
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:34,285
-I know a magnificent tailor. We'll 
go there and have you transformed.

964
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:36,885
-You're a happy fellow, Xavier!

965
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:42,365
Come Medor, do a trick 
for Mr Xavier.

966
01:08:46,045 --> 01:08:47,725
Some perform tricks ...

967
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:49,925
...to have some sugar.

968
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:53,245
But when it goes wrong
they beat it.

969
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:54,525
-Stop!

970
01:09:00,725 --> 01:09:03,325
-Join me for a glass?
-You're inviting me?

971
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:06,205
-That is... I'm with these
gentlemen.

972
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:09,205
-I've had enough of these guys!

973
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:12,805
Say, Benoît,
will you do a thing for me.

974
01:09:13,165 --> 01:09:16,525
Tell the Dromedary to keep his
little songs for himself.

975
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:20,725
Since he's not my size it's
you that I'm addressing.

976
01:09:21,085 --> 01:09:23,885
-You like to insult me?

977
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:27,245
It's not on the level what 
you're doing there.

978
01:09:29,325 --> 01:09:32,965
-I don't know if this is the hump
of commerce or of crime,

979
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:35,125
...but you should have it removed 
cause it's making you bad.

980
01:09:35,645 --> 01:09:38,085
-So you're acting out
to leave the scene in a big style!

981
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:41,605
I already told you, and I'll
say it again.

982
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:44,605
You're not on the level.
You have no manners.

983
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:47,525
-Stop this!
-Stay out of this!

984
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:50,965
-Be polite, Benoît!

985
01:09:54,965 --> 01:09:56,525
-You're a bit too much, 
little guy.

986
01:09:57,765 --> 01:09:59,965
You have chosen the wrong
place to be.

987
01:10:01,205 --> 01:10:03,125
We'll meet up.

988
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:07,565
-You decide when and where.
But quick, I'm leaving tomorrow.

989
01:10:08,565 --> 01:10:09,885
Have fun.

990
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:14,885
-Go on. Follow him!

991
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:20,845
(whistles)

992
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:24,645
-What is it?

993
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:27,085
-I'm thinking that a man in
the ground is easier to deal with...

994
01:10:27,485 --> 01:10:30,405
...than a man standing up.
-And so?

995
01:10:31,005 --> 01:10:34,845
-So we'll have to make him fall.
-Thanks, I don't need any help.

996
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:36,405
-So they say!

997
01:10:37,325 --> 01:10:41,085
-Listen, you're not going to hurt
him, are you?

998
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,245
(they laugh)

999
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:49,485
-I too used to travel
in my days.

1000
01:10:49,965 --> 01:10:53,765
South America,
palm trees, music.

1001
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:56,205
It was nice.

1002
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,325
That's where I met
your mother.

1003
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:03,485
She was beautiful.
What a woman!

1004
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:07,325
That's a mother that
one could really love.

1005
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:10,245
It's not a mother,
but a saint.

1006
01:11:19,805 --> 01:11:21,045
-Danielle!

1007
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:30,845
What is this?
-I was waiting for you, mom.

1008
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,485
-Why this briefcase?

1009
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:39,765
-You're leaving?
-Yes, I'm leaving.

1010
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,965
I had news from 
my impresario.

1011
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:44,045
-You....

1012
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:48,365
You're giving a concert?
-No, not that.

1013
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:52,165
I don't know but... 
I'm leaving....

1014
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:54,365
-Come here!

1015
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:56,725
Come here!

1016
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:58,725
Why are you lying?
Tell me the truth.

1017
01:11:58,845 --> 01:12:01,005
-The truth. Do you think
that would do any good?

1018
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:04,765
-The truth. Do you think
that would do any good?

1019
01:12:06,005 --> 01:12:09,005
-What has happened to you?
-Oh, cut it out.

1020
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:13,164
-But what's happening?
-Nothing.

1021
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:17,084
-Listen to me, darling,

1022
01:12:18,445 --> 01:12:22,845
...often in life there are things
that you just can't say.

1023
01:12:24,525 --> 01:12:26,805
Maybe you already know 
of them?

1024
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:32,324
Life is what it is,
you can't change it.

1025
01:12:33,004 --> 01:12:34,084
Embrace me.

1026
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:39,444
And now, leave!

1027
01:12:42,765 --> 01:12:44,645
Don't forget me.

1028
01:12:45,005 --> 01:12:47,285
Let me hear from you.
-Mom!

1029
01:12:47,645 --> 01:12:51,005
Go and don't say anything.
It's better this way.

1030
01:12:51,365 --> 01:12:53,885
-Mom!
-No, honey. Go away!

1031
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:56,925
Go now, sweetie, I assure you.

1032
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:01,645
Go!

1033
01:13:02,285 --> 01:13:29,325
....

1034
01:13:29,925 --> 01:13:31,445
-Life is strange.

1035
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:36,244
There's always one who
enters and another one leaving.

1036
01:13:37,004 --> 01:13:39,165
Arrivals, departures ....

1037
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:42,764
Departures, arrivals ....

1038
01:13:46,365 --> 01:13:50,484
-Departures, arrivals,
London, America, harbors.

1039
01:13:52,204 --> 01:13:55,365
Do you remember the first
time we kissed?

1040
01:14:00,805 --> 01:14:03,765
You're the prettiest girl
I ever met.

1041
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:07,045
It's strange how much I like
you. I love you.

1042
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:09,725
You make me want to
do silly things.

1043
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:13,684
How do you say 
"my dear little bird" in English?

1044
01:14:14,044 --> 01:14:17,765
I'm sure it's more beautiful in English.
How do you say it?

1045
01:14:18,085 --> 01:14:19,565
-My dear little bird.

1046
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:22,205
-My dear little bird.

1047
01:14:23,765 --> 01:14:26,445
You see, it's much better.
-You're mad!

1048
01:14:27,325 --> 01:14:30,205
-I'm happy.
Before I was merely content.

1049
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:34,125
You're surly a swell girl,
while I....

1050
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:38,365
We must talk, I have a lot
of things that I must tell you.

1051
01:14:38,685 --> 01:14:41,045
That car I loaned ....
I had to return it.

1052
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:43,605
-I don't care.

1053
01:14:43,965 --> 01:14:47,525
-The truth is somebody gave it to me,
I didn't loan it.

1054
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:49,685
Do you understand?

1055
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:51,845
I was given money.

1056
01:14:52,205 --> 01:14:55,685
-Leave those things. I'm not
curious tonight.

1057
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:57,965
I'm happy.

1058
01:15:01,085 --> 01:15:03,365
-Before I didn't want anything.

1059
01:15:05,285 --> 01:15:06,325
-And now?

1060
01:15:07,205 --> 01:15:10,365
-Now I want you.

1061
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:36,805
....

1062
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,365
-I like you so much!
-I don't!

1063
01:15:39,726 --> 01:15:41,245
-Ah, you don't!
-No.

1064
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:42,605
Sweetheart!

1065
01:15:43,645 --> 01:16:03,005
....

1066
01:16:03,885 --> 01:16:04,926
(phone rings)

1067
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:06,725
-Hello?

1068
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:10,606
Mr Fenat? Venat? 
I don't know him.

1069
01:16:12,966 --> 01:16:14,246
Who? Mr Benoît!

1070
01:16:15,246 --> 01:16:18,126
-Yes, have him wait
a minute.

1071
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:20,486
-Who is it?
-Nothing. A friend.

1072
01:16:20,806 --> 01:16:21,726
(knock on door)

1073
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:23,006
-Come in!

1074
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:27,206
Wait, I have some more
things. Come along.

1075
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,646
-You're impatient, Benoît!

1076
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,766
-That's right. 
Patience, isn't my thing.

1077
01:16:49,926 --> 01:16:52,246
My thing, that's punctuality.

1078
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:55,526
Isn't that better?
-Much better.

1079
01:16:55,886 --> 01:16:56,886
Do you mind?

1080
01:16:57,566 --> 01:16:58,766
Danielle!

1081
01:16:59,526 --> 01:17:02,406
I'll join you in two minutes.
-Not more!

1082
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:05,406
-It won't last longer than that.

1083
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:10,206
-Be quick.
-I will.

1084
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,166
Nice of you to come by.
It's calmer here.

1085
01:17:21,526 --> 01:17:24,286
-Yeah, that's why I'm here.

1086
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,286
What do you want?

1087
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:28,206
-Talk to you.

1088
01:17:29,006 --> 01:17:31,086
To have a serious chat.

1089
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,646
I don't really believe in this departure. 
You've repeated yourself too much

1090
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:35,846
-So?

1091
01:17:36,206 --> 01:17:38,846
I want to get it straight
once and for all.

1092
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:42,126
I don't like people mixing in
my business.

1093
01:17:42,446 --> 01:17:44,326
And also,
you're annoying me.

1094
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,406
I don't like to be annoyed.

1095
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:51,966
Take my advice and quit
this sector,

1096
01:17:52,806 --> 01:17:55,366
...and don't come back
in a while.

1097
01:17:57,446 --> 01:17:58,606
Get it?

1098
01:18:01,006 --> 01:18:03,806
And now, another story.

1099
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:07,606
That acting out in public,
I don't like that.

1100
01:18:09,366 --> 01:18:12,606
if you want to make a mess, 
do it elsewhere

1101
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:15,446
Your cigarette knick-knack, 
I can do that too.

1102
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:17,206
Without making noise. 
Get it?

1103
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:31,167
-I have a train to catch.

1104
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:33,447
Just act like you're at home.

1105
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:38,207
-Taxi.

1106
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,807
-What's he doing?
-Shall we go?

1107
01:18:48,127 --> 01:18:48,967
-Let's go!

1108
01:18:49,327 --> 01:19:08,606
....

1109
01:19:09,246 --> 01:19:10,486
-Where's Benoît?

1110
01:19:11,526 --> 01:19:15,126
-Don't worry about him, he's
having a nap upstairs.

1111
01:19:21,886 --> 01:19:24,887
-That's it, 91 Calgen Street 
in London.

1112
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:39,287
-You'll sort it out?

1113
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:42,246
-3 cases, that's won't cause
complications.

1114
01:19:43,686 --> 01:19:47,566
-Your business finished badly,
but don't let that force you to leave.

1115
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:51,528
If you'd like to rest, that's
entirely up to you.

1116
01:19:51,848 --> 01:19:53,688
-Go or stay?

1117
01:19:54,648 --> 01:19:56,408
What's that?

1118
01:19:58,088 --> 01:20:00,648
-I got the door slammed
in my face.

1119
01:20:01,008 --> 01:20:02,528
-Someone pushed it?

1120
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:06,207
-Don't joke about it.

1121
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:11,567
In any case,

1122
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:16,247
...you should know that if you
need me, bah....

1123
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:20,847
You can count on me.

1124
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:25,007
You have enough money?
-I have what's needed.

1125
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:27,807
-Enough?
-Enough.

1126
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:31,166
-Cut it out. Enough isn't a number.

1127
01:20:31,486 --> 01:20:33,886
-l really don't care.

1128
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,126
-But I do.

1129
01:20:37,486 --> 01:20:41,486
I'm telling you what I think, 
romance isn't my thing.

1130
01:20:44,647 --> 01:20:48,167
I don't know. I need you.
I would miss you.

1131
01:20:49,447 --> 01:20:52,567
Us two together, that wouldn't
be so bad?

1132
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:54,007
What?

1133
01:20:54,327 --> 01:20:56,247
And we have the same age.

1134
01:20:56,567 --> 01:20:58,207
It would be ....

1135
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:00,567
More moral.

1136
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:05,326
-You're being nice, but let's 
talk about something else.

1137
01:21:07,326 --> 01:21:08,406
-Well, well.
(knock on door)

1138
01:21:08,726 --> 01:21:09,487
-Enter!

1139
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,327
A visitor, Jenny.
-Who is it?

1140
01:21:14,647 --> 01:21:15,767
-Xavier.

1141
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:18,407
-That's strange. 
Do you mind?

1142
01:21:18,727 --> 01:21:20,327
-Go on!

1143
01:21:22,847 --> 01:21:26,366
Would you like to come to the wedding?
-You know me....

1144
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,887
Weddings or funerals,
it makes the time go.

1145
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:36,167
-What do you want?

1146
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:38,727
-It's a delicate matter.

1147
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,367
It bothers me.

1148
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:43,127
It's hard to say.
-What?

1149
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,527
-I need 5000 francs,
 and I thought of you.

1150
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:49,967
-You need 5000 francs?
Is this a joke?

1151
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:51,127
-Not at all!

1152
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:53,367
I have a gambling debt.

1153
01:21:53,687 --> 01:21:55,447
-A debt of honor.

1154
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:58,007
I don't feel like joking.

1155
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,887
You're the king of parasites!

1156
01:22:01,727 --> 01:22:04,327
-Parasite, did you say parasite?

1157
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:06,687
-Go away,
you're bothering me.

1158
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,447
-I've had to cope with
many things. Too many!

1159
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:11,847
But now you're attacking me,
insulting me!

1160
01:22:12,447 --> 01:22:16,247
And I wanted to be discreet!
Well, that money isn't intended for me.

1161
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:18,567
-Lucien?

1162
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,327
-Yes, he's in the hospital.

1163
01:22:21,647 --> 01:22:22,767
-What's wrong?

1164
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:25,127
-I promised not to talk.

1165
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:27,247
-Talk, imbecile!

1166
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:30,007
-He's hurt.
-Which hospital?

1167
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:32,847
-I can't say.
-What an idiot!

1168
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:36,367
-Maybe I'm an idiot, but don't
tell him.

1169
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:37,527
-No!

1170
01:22:44,847 --> 01:22:47,566
Benoît, can you lend 
me 5000 francs?

1171
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:49,647
-Straight away?
-Yes.

1172
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:53,286
-Well, why not?

1173
01:23:09,206 --> 01:23:11,206
-1, 2, 3 and dame.

1174
01:23:11,566 --> 01:23:14,126
-What, dame?
-Bah, place a piece!

1175
01:23:16,447 --> 01:23:18,047
You don't know how to play?
-No.

1176
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:21,247
-Why do you play?
-To pass the time.

1177
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:24,286
-You're funny, I'll teach you.
It's not difficult.

1178
01:23:27,727 --> 01:23:28,927
What, you?

1179
01:23:30,527 --> 01:23:32,087
-Yes, it's me.

1180
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:34,007
You're not happy to see me?

1181
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,447
-Excuse me, old man.
-Sure.

1182
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:38,927
Madame.
-Hello.

1183
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:42,287
-How did you know?
-I called the hotel.

1184
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:43,407
-And?

1185
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:46,447
-I wanted to get some news.

1186
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:48,127
-That was nice of you.

1187
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:52,047
I already told you, I would like things 
to be clean between us.

1188
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:56,607
I addressed someone else, it was
easier that way.

1189
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:00,128
-Maybe you're right.
-Why do you smile?

1190
01:24:00,728 --> 01:24:02,248
-No reason.

1191
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:06,888
-Say, which one is the winning one,
black or yellow?

1192
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,008
-Always black.

1193
01:24:12,808 --> 01:24:15,047
It hurts me to tell you, but ....

1194
01:24:15,407 --> 01:24:17,287
...I'm expecting someone.

1195
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:20,687
-I know and why shouldn't
I see her.

1196
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:24,327
She must be very pretty
since you like her so.

1197
01:24:25,287 --> 01:24:26,967
-You wouldn't understand.

1198
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:29,927
It's not a girl like any other.

1199
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:32,248
-What's she doing?
What's her story?

1200
01:24:32,608 --> 01:24:34,888
-I don't know.
-You're not very curious.

1201
01:24:35,248 --> 01:24:37,728
-Neither is she,
I've been wanting to tell her.

1202
01:24:38,128 --> 01:24:40,208
-Tell her what?
-Everything.

1203
01:24:40,927 --> 01:24:42,887
She wouldn't listen.

1204
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:46,367
She's had a though life,
her name is Danielle.

1205
01:24:47,408 --> 01:24:48,288
-Ah!

1206
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:50,848
-Yes, Danielle Bricart.

1207
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:54,968
Bricart, that's her father's name.

1208
01:24:55,368 --> 01:24:58,968
Her mother's name is different, but 
they're not getting along.

1209
01:24:59,688 --> 01:25:01,608
That's all I know.

1210
01:25:01,928 --> 01:25:03,488
-She doesn't love her?

1211
01:25:04,568 --> 01:25:05,728
-Yes, but...

1212
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,888
...they have different ways of
seeing things.

1213
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:16,328
-I must go.
-You've been very kind.

1214
01:25:16,688 --> 01:25:17,728
-Good bye.

1215
01:25:18,528 --> 01:25:21,208
-Jenny, where are you going?
it's closed over there!

1216
01:25:21,528 --> 01:25:43,648
....

1217
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:47,487
-I can't explain why,
but I must stay here a bit.

1218
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:48,807
It's absolutely necessary.

1219
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:53,167
-Oh, that's nice.
I never get visits.

1220
01:25:55,327 --> 01:25:56,367
I'm alone.

1221
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:59,367
All alone, do you understand?

1222
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:01,007
Nobody comes to see me.

1223
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:13,768
-Xavier said he'd be back soon.

1224
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:17,768
-Maybe he didn't find the way.
-Anyway we must go.

1225
01:26:18,088 --> 01:26:19,768
We'll be fine in London.

1226
01:26:20,128 --> 01:26:22,608
(The clock strikes).

1227
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:34,888
....

1228
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:37,768
-It's two o'clock.
Visiting time is over.

1229
01:26:38,368 --> 01:26:40,568
-You'll be back tomorrow?
-Of course.

1230
01:26:40,928 --> 01:26:43,688
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1231
01:26:46,008 --> 01:26:49,368
-Good bye, and remember, in
three days we're leaving!

1232
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:05,929
-Already? The only time 
someone comes to see me.

1233
01:27:06,649 --> 01:27:07,569
-Good bye.

1234
01:27:08,329 --> 01:27:10,729
Thank you.
-You'll be back?

1235
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:12,569
-Naturally.

1236
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:33,089
-I brought this, it's better than
flowers.

1237
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:36,529
It's discreet and more practical
than a bird.

1238
01:27:36,889 --> 01:27:38,129
-Thanks, old man.

1239
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:43,409
-You still have a fever.

1240
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:46,129
One should when one is ill.

1241
01:27:47,489 --> 01:27:49,369
-I thought you weren't coming
any more.

1242
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:52,288
-No? Well, you were wrong.

1243
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:56,209
-So?
-I brought you what you asked for.

1244
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:59,328
You see, it's all there.

1245
01:27:59,808 --> 01:28:02,609
1, 2, 3, 4.

1246
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:06,169
-How did you do it?
-My family.

1247
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,929
I told them it was from gambling.

1248
01:28:27,329 --> 01:28:28,969
-You're a swell guy.

1249
01:28:29,649 --> 01:28:31,649
-I am what I am.

1250
01:28:32,049 --> 01:28:35,449
-You remember the first time
Danielle met you.

1251
01:28:35,809 --> 01:28:39,369
I told her that you weren't my
friend, but I was wrong.

1252
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:42,129
I treated you badly, 
forgive me.

1253
01:28:43,209 --> 01:28:44,009
-No.

1254
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:46,849
You were right.

1255
01:28:48,929 --> 01:28:53,610
-I had stacked away 1000 francs.
-You made a loan in advance!

1256
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:57,850
-You obviously know me. If I
didn't really need them....

1257
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,450
-You wouldn't have asked for them.

1258
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,370
-This visit is over.

1259
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:05,170
-Here my friend, this is for you!

1260
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:07,690
For your lunch.

1261
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,530
-Good bye, Lucien.
-Good bye.

1262
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,690
-Have a good trip,
and if you're passing by London

1263
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,970
don't forget to send me
some ties. Red ones.

1264
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,890
-But Xavier!
-Good bye.

1265
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:29,449
-Madame, you'll have to leave.

1266
01:29:29,769 --> 01:30:05,250
....

1267
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,530
-Mom, I'm free.

1268
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,810
-Nobody's free.

1269
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:13,931
-She's had a though life, that's
all I know about her.

1270
01:30:15,491 --> 01:30:19,650
-Life is strange. There's always one 
who enters and another one leaving.

1271
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:22,171
Arrivals, departures!

1272
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:24,610
Departures, arrivals!

1273
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:32,730
-When you're at the bottom, you
should stay at the bottom.

1274
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,891
-Chez Jenny, 95 rue Spontini.

1275
01:30:48,251 --> 01:30:50,810
-Ah, the merriest place in Paris!

1276
