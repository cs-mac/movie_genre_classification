1
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,138
- Our planet
faces a lot of problems.

2
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,406
But in some parts of the world,

3
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,409
people live in a time
of over-consumption,

4
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,513
abundance of food, and an
eagerness to be fit and healthy.

5
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,082
The supermarket is
overflowing with options.

6
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:54,153
But despite that, we are
poorly advised in nutrition,

7
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,121
and easily vulnerable
to misinformation,

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,592
and unreliable slogans,
inaccurate health promises,

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,694
and colorful tempting packages

10
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,364
are cluttering our
relationship with food,

11
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,566
and risking our well-being.

12
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,401
We are bombarded by
conflicting information

13
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,671
about food, diets
and supplements.

14
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,274
So how can we know
what's best for us?

15
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,376
Which foods improve
health, and which ones

16
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,611
can potentially promote disease.

17
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,848
I have struggled with these
questions for a long time.

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,850
And it has been a
challenge to find a diet

19
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,287
that would help me
achieve my health goals.

20
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,722
After trying several new
diets over the years,

21
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,559
I decided to change
my lifestyle,

22
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,594
by simply incorporating
lots of plant-based

23
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,729
foods into my diet.

24
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,165
So far, it has worked for me.

25
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,601
I lost 50 pounds, brought
my blood pressure,

26
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,404
blood sugar and
cholesterol under control,

27
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,639
and overall, felt really good.

28
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,208
But it was a work in progress,

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,809
and I still had many
questions and concerns

30
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,613
about nutrition and living
this plant-based lifestyle

31
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,583
for the long run,
especially now with a recent

32
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,719
addition to our family, i
felt that I really needed

33
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,688
to find answers.

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,590
So I decided to go on a journey,

35
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,358
to search for the
truth, and to uncover

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,528
many of the myths
surrounding food.

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,697
For three years, I traveled
across the country,

38
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,199
and interviewed the
world's top authorities

39
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,902
on the subject, as well as
people that had experienced

40
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,272
amazing, life changing benefits
through healthy eating.

41
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,642
All to explore the idea
of what is the healthiest

42
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,146
and most sustainable
diet for ourselves,

43
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,715
future generations,
and our planet.

44
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,619
So join me on this journey
of shocking discoveries,

45
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,889
and buckle up, because
what you're about to learn

46
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,191
might forever change the
way you look at the food

47
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,526
on your plate.

48
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,341
- Well, there's a lot
of difference of opinion

49
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,811
about it, and there's
a faction of people

50
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,680
who insist that there
are different diets

51
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,549
for different people.

52
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,250
But I think that the
evidence is fairly clear that

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,618
that's not true,
and there really is

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,787
an appropriate diet for humans,

55
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,556
just like there's a best
diet for cats, dogs,

56
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,692
elephants, and any other mammal.

57
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,529
And the best diet for humans
is one that is plant-based,

58
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,265
almost all calories
coming from four principle

59
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,301
food groups, fruit,
vegetables, whole grains

60
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,502
and legumes.

61
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,205
It's low in fat, high in fiber.

62
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,307
Not very much processed
food, none is great,

63
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,876
but in today's world, I don't
know how realistic that is.

64
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,680
- What we have seen in
nutrition for many, many years,

65
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,784
I must say, is a
lot of confusion.

66
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,886
You go and survey
people, you know,

67
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,521
outside of the science,
and ask them what do

68
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,556
they think that nutrition is,

69
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,692
and you can hear all
kinds of comments.

70
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:47,893
I eat this, and I eat that,

71
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,861
and this is good,
and this is not good.

72
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,396
There's also confusion
in the professions.

73
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,998
You know, medical
doctors are not trained

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,399
in this field.

75
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,635
And there's confusion
in my own field.

76
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,337
You know, about
medical research.

77
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,240
We don't get an opportunity,
to tell, you know,

78
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,942
the real science I think,
the way it should be told.

79
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,378
Because we're overwhelmed,

80
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,648
with the corporate sector
trying to sell stuff.

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,683
- We are living
in extreme times.

82
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,953
Where we have 27% of people
dying of heart disease,

83
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,023
25% of cancer, 10% of stroke,

84
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,292
four or five percent
from diabetes,

85
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,694
the same number for Alzheimer's.

86
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,497
I mean, these are,
in many, many cases,

87
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,766
diseases of
nutritional ignorance,

88
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,403
and diseases that are all
based on our lifestyle choices.

89
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,871
- There are a lot of
different dietary theories

90
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,875
out there, but I think one
fact is kind of indisputable.

91
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,712
Having a diet that is rich
in whole plant-based foods,

92
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,583
is truly a great way to
get you to good health.

93
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,618
- Everywhere I go
around the world,

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,453
there's not a single person
I've met that doesn't

95
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,289
know that fruits and
vegetables are good for them.

96
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:51,056
We all know it.

97
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:55,060
It's not about the knowing,
it's about the doing.

98
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,396
- There was a time when
there was no heart disease.

99
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:01,366
No colon cancer, no breast
cancer, no multiple sclerosis,

100
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,934
no inflammatory arthritis.

101
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,704
Of course these days, in
Asia, the middle east,

102
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,540
in central America,
and around the world,

103
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,642
people have become rich.

104
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,045
They have given up
much of their starch,

105
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,946
and they replaced it
with meat and dairy.

106
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,582
Throughout history, rich
people, the royalty,

107
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,952
the pharaohs, the
queens and the kings,

108
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:24,056
the priests, the
priestesses, the people

109
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:25,824
that could afford
to eat the meat.

110
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,728
They had artery disease,
they had obesity,

111
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,996
they were sick.

112
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,397
Nothing's changed
except for the number

113
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,566
of kings and queens
living in the world.

114
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,438
- A question
kept coming to my mind.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,540
If plant foods are
so good for us,

116
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,108
and the consumption
of animal products

117
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,811
in excess appears to do us harm,

118
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,447
how about the ancient
populations of people

119
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,515
that survived on
diets based off mostly

120
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,617
meat, eggs and dairy,

121
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,553
and appeared to be healthy?

122
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,556
After all, aren't we known
for being hunter-gatherers?

123
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,861
- All large, successful
populations of people

124
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,763
have gotten the bulk
of their calories

125
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,366
from starch, rice,
corn, potatoes,

126
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,868
and other starches,
breads and so on.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,405
Particularly when you
live near the equator,

128
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,007
as you move north and
south in latitude,

129
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,510
then you end up eating
more animal foods.

130
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,513
And if you get far
north, like for example,

131
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,449
the inuit eskimos, they
are largely carnivores,

132
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,985
because that's what's available.

133
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,522
But that's a small
population of people

134
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,858
that exists on the extremes
of the environment.

135
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,427
That's the exception,

136
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,661
not the rule.

137
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,632
- We have become
the most successful

138
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,901
species on this planet.

139
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,736
No one comes close to us.

140
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,639
We share it with animals,
and insects, and microbes,

141
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,509
and plants, but
we're number one.

142
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,943
And the way we got to number one

143
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,546
was all about survival.

144
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,748
We see in color, i
believe, because fruits

145
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,650
and vegetables are colorful.

146
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,153
Our hand is perfectly
designed to pick,

147
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:05,490
forge, grab and dig,
peel, and feed ourselves

148
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,125
fruits and vegetables,
nuts, beans and seeds,

149
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,061
plant food, food made
by mother nature.

150
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,731
- This idea that we're
hunter-gatherers,

151
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,200
is true, we're hunter-gatherers.

152
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,669
But mostly, we've
been gatherers.

153
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,639
One of the problems
has to do with sexism.

154
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,708
It has to do with the
fact that the gatherers

155
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,512
were grandparents,
women, and children.

156
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,549
The hunters were men,
and they got the glory.

157
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,150
The people who really
provided the bulk

158
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,687
of the calories, for most
of the civilizations,

159
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,523
through all verifiable
human history,

160
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,726
have been the women,
children and grandparents.

161
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,596
- Even when i
began considering the idea

162
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,065
of eating mostly a
plant-based diet,

163
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,701
I was still hounded
with many questions.

164
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,203
How was I going
to be able to live

165
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,505
without animal foods?

166
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,607
I didn't want to become
nutrient deficient.

167
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,709
And how about things
like protein, calcium,

168
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,544
and omega 3's?

169
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,913
In my head, I always
associated these nutrients

170
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,849
with animal foods.

171
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,851
I needed to find out
if those were valid

172
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,186
concerns, or simply myths.

173
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,897
- It's almost
impossible to design

174
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,800
a protein deficient diet

175
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,002
surrounding, you know, a variety

176
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,605
of whole plant foods.

177
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,607
- What people need to know

178
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,710
is there's never been a
case of protein deficiency

179
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,512
ever described in
the world literature,

180
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,914
on any natural diet,

181
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,683
that met the sufficient
amount of calories.

182
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,151
- You know, back to
1839 when protein

183
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:44,022
was discovered, it had
this incredible reverence

184
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,259
associated with it, and
it just gained traction.

185
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,261
But the evidence is
very clear that humans

186
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,897
do not need to eat
a lot of protein,

187
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,566
and when they do, they get
a lot of health problems

188
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:54,566
as a result.

189
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:58,703
I mean human protein needs
are just a tiny percentage

190
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,106
of calories, maybe two
and a half, three percent

191
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,307
of calories.

192
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,609
And if you were to
eat the lowest protein

193
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,845
foods, in the plant world,

194
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,113
which would be foods like rice,

195
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,048
you're at eight or
nine percent protein.

196
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,918
So you're not going to
become protein deficient.

197
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,086
But, the promoters of
the low-carb diets,

198
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,122
the promoters of
the sports drinks,

199
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,858
and the food bars, and
all these kinds of things,

200
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,227
insist and market to
the public that they

201
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,262
absolutely must
have more protein.

202
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,664
It's just not true.

203
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,799
In practical sense,
and in reality,

204
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,668
the way we humans operate,

205
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,037
we get ideal loads of
protein if we just get it

206
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,738
from plants.

207
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,641
When we consume animal foods,

208
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,977
to get that protein,
if you will,

209
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,746
what we're actually
doing, we're displacing,

210
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,882
the consumption of
those foods that matter.

211
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,719
And foods that
matter are plants.

212
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,621
- The amount of
animal protein we eat

213
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,822
is the problem.

214
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,790
You know, in rural China,

215
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,792
and Japanese populations,

216
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,327
and healthier
places in the world,

217
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:55,327
people eat a little
bit of animal protein,

218
00:09:55,329 --> 00:10:00,231
but for economic reasons,
it's very, very, very tiny.

219
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,766
They use one little
piece of meat,

220
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,835
they slice it up,
and it seasons a dish

221
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,103
for eight people.

222
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,072
Here in this country,
we have one gargantuan

223
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,808
piece of meat, we
put it on a plate,

224
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,843
with a tiny little
bit of vegetables,

225
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,378
we call that a meal.

226
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,848
The problem is that when
you eat too much protein,

227
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,817
of any type, you
stress your kidneys,

228
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,354
you stress your liver, and
when it's animal protein,

229
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,656
you increase your
risk of cancer.

230
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,692
And we see cancer is
geographically distributed.

231
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,828
The more animal food
consumed in a society,

232
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,697
the more cancer, more
heart disease, you get.

233
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,733
- And it's amazing all
the animals that we choose

234
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:38,670
in this country to eat
for protein and calcium,

235
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,238
are vegetarian animals.

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,806
Where's the logic in that?

237
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,341
And I always like
to remind you, also,

238
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,110
when you're eating your garbage,

239
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,077
you never ask , "where
am I getting my protein,

240
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,345
"and my calcium."

241
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,813
It's only when you come
into the healthy world

242
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,281
that all of a sudden
you're concerned

243
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,983
with where it's coming from.

244
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,754
- We're in the midst of
this amazing protein push.

245
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,389
Everywhere you look,
the message is clear.

246
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,990
Protein, protein, protein.

247
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,725
This idea that you
need massive amounts

248
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,928
of protein, to
simply breathe air

249
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,063
in and out of your lungs,

250
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,965
you know, and to be healthy,

251
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,933
or to perform as an athlete.

252
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,735
- Prior to making
this dietary change,

253
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,873
like my main nutritional
strategy in a day

254
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,143
was to see how many
grams of protein

255
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,377
I could get in, like about that,

256
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,312
the only calculations
i ever really did,

257
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,181
I didn't count calories,
i didn't count anything,

258
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,084
was just like trying to
get in exorbitant amounts

259
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,453
of grams of protein in my day.

260
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,188
Just because there
are grams of protein

261
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,823
on the nutritional
content of something,

262
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,124
doesn't mean that
your body can actually

263
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,859
process all of those grams.

264
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,194
- Protein does
some other things.

265
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,862
It elevates blood
cholesterol levels,

266
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,399
which most people
have not heard of.

267
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,335
But that's about 100
years old, that idea.

268
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,904
And then repeated several times,

269
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,038
but always ignored.

270
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,908
Animal protein
starts heart disease.

271
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,877
It increases things
like the production

272
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,979
of so called free radicals,

273
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,282
which are those highly
reactive molecules

274
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,851
that actually stimulate aging,

275
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,821
and encourages cancer formation.

276
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,723
It also stimulates the
production of the wrong

277
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,157
kind of hormones.

278
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,159
It tends to increase
the level of estrogens,

279
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,762
for example, and
one, which in turn,

280
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,731
is associated with
breast cancer.

281
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,799
It changes the microflora
in our intestine

282
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,302
when we're consuming
too much protein.

283
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,803
I mean, it does
all these things.

284
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,171
- There's lots of things
we have to worry about

285
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,774
in the American diet.

286
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,744
Fiber, 97% of Americans
don't reach the daily

287
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,178
minimum intake of fiber,

288
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,781
98% of Americans don't
reach the daily minimum

289
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,050
intake of potassium,
for example.

290
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,852
The nutrients of concern
for most Americans

291
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,855
are the ones that are
found in plant foods.

292
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,056
Mostly fruits and vegetables,

293
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,458
and the ones that we're
getting too much of,

294
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,895
in excess, whether
it's calorie, sodium,

295
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,897
cholesterol, saturated
fat, are found

296
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,366
in processed foods and
animal foods in general.

297
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,970
- Many people
decide they want to improve

298
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,873
their health, by staying
away from red meat.

299
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,442
And instead, they begin
consuming more white meats,

300
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,979
like chicken, Turkey, and fish.

301
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,547
I always wondered if
certain types of meats

302
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,350
were really better than others.

303
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,252
- People think that
they're going to be healthy

304
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,821
by giving up red meat,

305
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,190
and instead, eating
poulty and fish.

306
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,059
Stop and think about
this for a minute.

307
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:18,930
What are meat, poultry and fish?

308
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,466
They're muscles of animals.

309
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,469
In one case, they
have to move a limb,

310
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,538
another case, they flap a wing,

311
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,573
in another case,
they wiggle a tail.

312
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,809
They're the same.

313
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,077
High fat, high protein,

314
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,080
high cholesterol,
no dietary fiber,

315
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,417
high in the food chain,
so heavily polluted.

316
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,352
- From the standpoint of
the effect of the protein

317
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,555
and fat in those foods,
and their effect on health,

318
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,989
it really doesn't matter.

319
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,092
It's dose dependent,
not type dependent.

320
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,961
So fish is not
healthier, in many cases,

321
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:54,065
it has more fat, than
chicken and pork.

322
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,000
But you have other
issues with fish, too.

323
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,569
In the ocean, you have
this whole hierarchy

324
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,538
of things eating things, that
eat things, that eat things.

325
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,074
And so you concentrate all
the pollutants in the ocean

326
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,176
including Mercury,
in fish like tuna,

327
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,046
that are some of the
favorite that we like to eat.

328
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,547
So fish is really not healthier.

329
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,016
Don't kid yourself in
thinking that if you're eating

330
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,018
fish and chicken you
can eat more of it.

331
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,120
Because one thing
in common with these

332
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,622
healthy populations
around the world that

333
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,624
do eat a little
bit of animal food,

334
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,025
whatever type they're choosing,

335
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,127
it's really a tiny,
tiny percentage

336
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,029
of what they're
eating in their diet.

337
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,397
So fish doesn't get a free pass.

338
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,333
A lot of people are
being told to eat fish,

339
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,569
by cardiologists,
or to take fish oil.

340
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,971
That's the other thing.

341
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,940
By cardiologists who
say that if you do that,

342
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,643
you'll increase your
hdl cholesterol,

343
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,212
and here's the
problem with that.

344
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,448
It's true, by the way.

345
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,149
It just doesn't
make any difference.

346
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,585
Studies are pretty clear
that in populations with very

347
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,955
low incidence of heart
disease, total cholesterol,

348
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,958
ldl cholesterol,
and hdl cholesterol

349
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,393
are very, very low.

350
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,595
So that's the wrong
reason to eat fish,

351
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,964
or take fish oil capsules,
is to increase your

352
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,432
hdl cholesterol.

353
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,068
Work on getting all
your cholesterol low.

354
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,906
- Since I was a
kid, I always heard that milk

355
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,108
was a very important food.

356
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,176
And I consumed a lot of it.

357
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,946
I also loved all kinds
of dairy products,

358
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,181
cheeses, butters,
ice creams, yogurts,

359
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,384
you name it, I had it all.

360
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,120
It took me many years
to begin realizing

361
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,356
that perhaps that was
not such a great idea.

362
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,958
But I still wondered.

363
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,359
How about calcium?

364
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,561
Would I be able to get
enough of it from plants?

365
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,365
- Well, we have a lot
of calcium in dairy.

366
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,034
But it's never been a
problem to have too low

367
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,635
calcium in a diet.

368
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,672
- An orange has a 110
milligrams of calcium.

369
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,041
Alright, so if you're trying
to take in 1500 milligrams

370
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,143
a day, that doesn't
sound like so much,

371
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,445
but when you're only
trying to get 500,

372
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,080
it sounds pretty
good as a percentage

373
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,548
of your daily intake.

374
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,051
- Milk is healthy food,

375
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,552
for calves.

376
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,354
For baby cows.

377
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,057
I mean, milk is for
babies, literally.

378
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,092
I mean, we're the only
species that drinks milk

379
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,128
of another species, and then
the only species that drinks

380
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,532
milk after weaning
into adulthood.

381
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,068
Why is milk associated
with increased prostate

382
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,303
cancer risk, for example.

383
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,105
Well, what is milk?

384
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,141
Milk is a cocktail
of growth hormones

385
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,177
to get a little bovine animal,

386
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:23,047
who's you know, who's
susceptible to predation

387
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,350
out on the African Savannah,

388
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,418
to, you know, put on
a few hundred pounds

389
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,253
in a few months, right,
because they don't

390
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,155
want to get eaten by a lion.

391
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,125
And so it's engineered
as this growth food

392
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,361
for rapid growth, which is
great if you're a little

393
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:40,398
baby cow, but if
you're an adult person,

394
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,204
that extra growth hormones
is not a good thing.

395
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,505
You know, one of the
hardest things for people

396
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,407
to give up is dairy,
and they're sometimes

397
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,377
really resistant to it, so
one of the things I tell

398
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,779
people is, "well, why don't
you look at the evidence

399
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:54,779
"and then decide."

400
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,216
Because I've always said
taking control of your health,

401
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,151
is not doing what I say
instead of what other

402
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,086
people say, taking
control of your health is

403
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,690
looking at the information
and making a conscious

404
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,092
choice, about what
you want to do.

405
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,328
- Dairy products i
describe as liquid meat.

406
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,164
They're basically
just like red meat.

407
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,134
High fat, high
cholesterol, no fiber,

408
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,202
in fact, they may
be worse than meat.

409
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,273
- The casein that they
use to bind the cheese

410
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,741
is so full of chemicals.

411
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,476
The chemicals are as
addictive as heroin,

412
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,211
that we don't have four
stomachs like a baby

413
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,215
calf, and unfortunately,
it is in everything.

414
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,051
They put cow secretions, i
know you have other names

415
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,221
for it, dairy, butter,
ice cream, cheese.

416
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,625
But it's really breast
milk from a cow.

417
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,759
- The only reason
people think we need

418
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,430
extra calcium is
because two decades ago

419
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,232
scientists, they raised
the bar on how much

420
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,134
calcium we needed.

421
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,271
That in turn was influenced
by the dairy industry.

422
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,139
What they're really saying
is, "we're not drinking

423
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,674
"enough milk."

424
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,544
Because that's what the dairy
industry wants us to say.

425
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,379
When in reality, if you
look at the relationship

426
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,115
between how much calcium
that people consume,

427
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,217
in different societies,
as it relates to,

428
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,487
let's say, osteoporosis,
the bone disease,

429
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,823
the higher the calcium intake,

430
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,259
the higher the risk
of osteoporosis.

431
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,360
No one wants to hear that.

432
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,830
But that's what the datas show.

433
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,380
- What goes on
inside an egg during incubation?

434
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,252
Well, after a week, the
eye shows up clearly

435
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,754
in the embryo, as the first
external organ to develop.

436
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,559
Gestation is much further
advanced at ten days.

437
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,261
The chick's outline
is more pronounced

438
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,263
as other organs begin to form.

439
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,633
At 14 days, you can see
the shape of the chick.

440
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,235
The contents of the
egg provide nourishment

441
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,303
during the incubation period.

442
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,207
- Most people
can't imagine starting

443
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,909
their day without eggs.

444
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,778
It's the favorite breakfast
option around the world.

445
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,780
And eggs make their
way everywhere,

446
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,316
in breads, cakes,
candies, dressings,

447
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,518
and even drinks.

448
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,654
Eggs have played an important
role in our foraging

449
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,390
ancestors creation and survival.

450
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,326
Overall, eggs are regarded
as a healthy food,

451
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,363
rich in protein,
minerals and fats.

452
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:29,367
But in today's world, are eggs
really a good food choice?

453
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,402
I was shocked to discover
the mounting amount

454
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,405
of scientific evidence
showing that eggs

455
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,308
and especially commercial
eggs might not be

456
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,378
the healthy food that we
all once thought it to be.

457
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,949
- Eggs are the most
concentrated source

458
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,918
of dietary cholesterol,

459
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,422
in the average person's diet.

460
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,325
And dietary cholesterol
can lead to an increase

461
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,427
in blood cholesterol
levels, which is the leading

462
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,496
risk factor for our
number one killer

463
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,932
of men and women, heart disease.

464
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,968
- Eggs have kind of
the same issue as dairy

465
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,805
in some ways, because
commercial eggs

466
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,808
are from chickens that
are commercially raised,

467
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,543
so, if you ever knew
how they were raised,

468
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,779
it's horrible, you would
never go near it once.

469
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,347
So, it's disgusting, but aside

470
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,382
from the disgustingness
of it, commercial

471
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,420
chickens are fed
antibiotics, to keep them

472
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,488
bigger, it makes them
bigger, cephalosporin,

473
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,290
to be specific.

474
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:31,395
They are fed feed that's
usually corn and soy,

475
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,298
genetically modified,
so bt toxin, corn,

476
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,302
roundup ready corn,
roundup ready soy.

477
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,605
So those are effecting
again the bacteria

478
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,340
and the microbiome
of the chicken,

479
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,376
and then, of you, because
you're ingesting it,

480
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,278
it's bio-accumulative.

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,513
A commercial chicken
leg is mostly omega 6,

482
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,317
it's not omega 3, so it's
a horrible polyetceteric

483
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,954
profile, and that's you know,
the least of the problems.

484
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,589
Because, like I said,
you've got the residue

485
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,960
from glyphosate and bt
toxin, and pesticides.

486
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,830
- The next
nutrients on my list were

487
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,932
omega 3 fatty acids.

488
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,368
Who hasn't heard about
fish oil capsules?

489
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,371
And their supposedly
great health benefits.

490
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,439
There seems to be a
lot of controversy

491
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,275
on this topic.

492
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,777
I was curious to find out
how much of these fats

493
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,746
we needed to stay healthy.

494
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,314
And how would someone get them,

495
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,016
if they didn't eat fish.

496
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,287
- A lot of these silly dietary
fads become an industry.

497
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,055
There's a lot of money to
be made, making products

498
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,556
that cater to them,
and that sort of thing,

499
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,859
and I'm convinced that's
the omega 3 thing.

500
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,394
Okay, so here's the deal.

501
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,362
There are two
essential fatty acids.

502
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,797
Omega 3's and 6's.

503
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,565
All the rest of them,
your body synthesizes,

504
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,435
essential means
must come from food.

505
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,504
Alright, so we find
omega 3 fatty acids

506
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:50,074
in foods like seafood,
walnuts, flax seeds,

507
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,809
some soy, alright.

508
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,511
And then we find
omega 6 fatty acids

509
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:57,448
in land animals, chicken, pork,

510
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,418
beef, and polyunsaturated
vegetable oils.

511
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,720
And so you can see
what our problem is,

512
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,456
we eat a lot of
omega 6 fatty acids.

513
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,825
And in fact the ratio
of omega 3 to omega 6

514
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,928
fatty acids used to
be between one to one,

515
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,596
and one to four.

516
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,998
You know what it is today?

517
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,501
Between one to twenty
five, and one to thirty.

518
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,470
So this has led a
lot of people to say,

519
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,939
"my gosh, this is
so out of whack.

520
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,808
"Omega 6 is up here, and
omega 3 is down here.

521
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,976
"Maybe what we
ought to do is take

522
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,979
"omega 3 fatty acid
pills, fish oil pills,

523
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,415
"and encourage fish
eating to get that

524
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,484
"omega 3 back up to
that ratio that we have

525
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,454
"been accustomed to
as a population."

526
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,923
Okay, there's no
evidence that it works,

527
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,958
in fact a large
meta-analysis that looked

528
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,961
at 89 studies showed that it
didn't make any difference

529
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,430
in health outcomes,
but besides that,

530
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,567
wouldn't it be better
to lower the omega 6

531
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,370
fatty acid in the diet,
stop eating all those

532
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,938
land animals, stop
consuming all that

533
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,476
plant oil, and the ratio
goes back to normal.

534
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,845
So let's not supplement
with omega 3,

535
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,147
let's ratchet down
omega 6, and we end up

536
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,548
where we need to be.

537
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,450
There's no money in
the decreasing omega 6.

538
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,587
There's a lot of money in
selling people omega 3 pills.

539
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,988
And getting them to eat fish.

540
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,424
- In fact, when you take
a supplement omega 3's,

541
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,760
we've got some really
good evidence now.

542
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,928
Summarizing a lot of studies.

543
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,532
The higher the use of omeg
3's, the higher is the risk

544
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,801
for type ii diabetes.

545
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,604
And even there's evidence
that cancer goes up, too.

546
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,672
It does exactly the opposite
of what people think it does.

547
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,808
It's disgusting.

548
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,110
It's one of those
ridiculous things.

549
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,079
- Early on, there
was data suggesting

550
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,915
that it might be
beneficial, but now,

551
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,151
the preponderance
of evidence is that

552
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,720
fish oil is useless, so
there's this billion dollar

553
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,489
industry that's
basically selling people

554
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,825
fish oil as snake oil.

555
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,562
- For many guys,
eating a diet rich in meat

556
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,165
is seen as a reflection
of their manhood,

557
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,767
and associated with
being strong and manly.

558
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,603
I felt the same way
for most of my life.

559
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,640
So I was really surprised
to come across studies

560
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,775
that showed that such
a diet might actually

561
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,645
have the contrary
effect in the long run.

562
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,548
- Here they are eating
the meat that's going

563
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,583
to make them macho, right?

564
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,618
It has the opposite effect.

565
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,655
That's not being very macho
to have erectile dysfunction.

566
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,023
- It's all about blood
flow, they even say it

567
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,693
in the Cialis, and
Viagra commercials.

568
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,895
So, if your arteries
are clogged,

569
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,831
with cheese and dairy and meat,

570
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,933
and bacon and all this bullshit,

571
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,768
what's the main vein?

572
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,637
Come on, it's
simple science, man.

573
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,774
- It's unquestionable that
men think that they have

574
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,610
to eat a lot of
protein and that eating

575
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,146
a plant-based diet may
not be really masculine.

576
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,781
But I'll tell you what's
really not masculine,

577
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:46,150
is erectile dysfunction.

578
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,985
If you want to be virile,
if you want to have

579
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,755
a great masculine life,
eat a plant-based diet.

580
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,058
There is a great deal of
evidence that erectile

581
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,062
dysfunction is caused by
diet in many instances.

582
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,532
And the reason is, that if
you have coronary artery

583
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,134
disease, in one
area of the body,

584
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:04,869
you have it everywhere.

585
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,171
So those very tiny blood vessels

586
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,240
that lead to the penis,
are some of the first

587
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,909
to get effected, and
so erectile dysfunction

588
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,777
has been referred
to as the canary

589
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,246
in the coal mine.

590
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:18,249
It's the sign that
something is terribly wrong,

591
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,951
and you need to fix
it, and at that stage,

592
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,521
it's much more fixable
than if you've already

593
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,855
had the heart attack,
or the stroke,

594
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,024
or something really
serious happen.

595
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,032
- Obesity
is linked to more

596
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,601
than 60 chronic diseases,

597
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,703
and it is common knowledge
that there is an epidemic

598
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,006
of obesity around the world.

599
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,174
Today, two thirds of
adults, and nearly one third

600
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,578
of children in America
struggle with it.

601
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,747
It seems like in
the last 30 years,

602
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,682
human waist lines
have simply grown

603
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,950
out of proportion.

604
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,719
And if obesity rates
stay consistent,

605
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,256
by 2030, 51% of the
American population

606
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,225
could potentially be obese.

607
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,697
- As far as dieting,
or losing weight,

608
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,233
people take two
approaches that don't work

609
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:09,233
for the long term.

610
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,937
And so of course they
say diets don't work.

611
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:15,839
One approach is they try
and starve themselves,

612
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,341
and be hungry all the time.

613
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,710
These are portion controlled
diets, typical diets

614
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,111
that people follow.

615
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,746
They don't work because
you're hungry all the time,

616
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,716
you can't tolerate
that kind of pain.

617
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,886
The alternative is the
make yourself sick diets.

618
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:33,157
And those are the high
protein, high fat,

619
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,959
low carbohydrate diets.

620
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,728
- Over
the last few decades,

621
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,730
there has been an explosion
of commercial diets

622
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,732
in the U.S.

623
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,200
Most of them revolving
around the idea

624
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,670
that eating few carbs,
and lots of animal protein

625
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,839
helps with weight loss,

626
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,075
all orchestrated by
multi-million dollar,

627
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,110
ingenious advertising campaigns

628
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,145
and celebrity endorsements.

629
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,116
As a result, nowadays,
most people associate

630
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,385
carbs with weight gain.

631
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,888
For many years, I worked
really hard to cut my carbs,

632
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,791
without any long term
results, and without fully

633
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,860
understanding why
i was doing it.

634
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,163
I wanted to find out
what the latest science

635
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,733
had to say about
these low carb diets.

636
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,937
- Rob atkins, some
years ago, in 1973,

637
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,706
published his first book,

638
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,109
in which he argued that
it's not the problem

639
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,812
with the fat, it's not the
problem with the protein,

640
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,748
but mostly fat, he said
that's not the problem,

641
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,083
the problem is we consume
too much carbohydrate.

642
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,052
And he made that point,
we should be consuming

643
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,920
low carb diet, he said.

644
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,790
And then many other people
wrote the same thing.

645
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,960
The south beach diet,
is only a copycat,

646
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,696
for the most part,
of the atkins diet.

647
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,932
The zone diet is basically
a copycat, different name.

648
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:52,403
The blood type diet in many
regards is also a copycat.

649
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:55,773
Good calories bad calories,
dairy 12, same thing.

650
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:59,009
Even Marco paleo, and I have
to say, omnivore's dilemma.

651
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,778
And the paleo diet
in this day and time

652
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,713
is a copycat.

653
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:03,380
They may give it
different names,

654
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:07,351
they may try to throw out
you know, different types

655
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,152
of arguments for
why that's right,

656
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,420
they're all wrong.

657
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:10,888
- Everybody wants
to hear good news

658
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,222
about their bad habits.

659
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,324
So when you tell
people you can eat all

660
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:17,227
the lobster you want,
you can have steak,

661
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,897
and eggs, and you know,
some include dairy,

662
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,067
some don't include dairy,
but that's sounds good

663
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,903
to people, because it
sounds less restrictive.

664
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,237
- This is written by
people, I should tell you,

665
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,840
who don't have
experience in this field

666
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,309
of nutrition research, period.

667
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,844
Most of them have
never even published

668
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,380
a single paper into
scientific literature.

669
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,815
- Some of the people
who are talking

670
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,817
about low carb diets
are little better than

671
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,153
news reporters, and that's
not to take anything away

672
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,823
from their skill at
investigating things,
but they cannot

673
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,860
don't have the skills to
evaluate scientific information.

674
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:52,763
- Low carb diets,
they make you sick.

675
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,132
And as a result, your
whole body gets sick,

676
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,967
with artery disease,
and kidney damage,

677
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,402
liver damage and so on.

678
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,170
They increase mortality,
that's been shown

679
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,107
over and over again
in major studies.

680
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,842
But they also make
you sick in a way

681
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,910
that you lose your appetite.

682
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,213
The dieter goes, "oh,
I've finally found it."

683
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,048
And then you go into
ketosis, you lost your

684
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,084
appetite, as a result,
you're able to sustain

685
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,920
yourself without thinking
about food all the time.

686
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,288
Because you're sick.

687
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,891
These diets are dangerous,

688
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,926
and people should
not be on them.

689
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,294
- Well, you know, the
biggest lies in the world

690
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,097
are the ones that
have a little truth.

691
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,132
We all know that.

692
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,900
It's a great tactic.

693
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,369
It's true, I happen to agree,
that we should cut down

694
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,371
on simple carbohydrates.

695
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,808
You see, that's out of
context to the whole.

696
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,510
You know, sugar, white flour.

697
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,978
That makes sense.

698
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,513
So in that sense,
there's a little truth.

699
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,983
But they don't always
point that out.

700
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,285
They just say, low carb,
low carb, low carb.

701
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,021
- Listen, forget about
what you like and dislike,

702
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,323
think about what
your objective is.

703
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,559
Alright, let's just
acknowledge we all like eating

704
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:55,559
junk food.

705
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:55,559
If you put chocolate in front
of me today, I'll have some,

706
00:29:55,561 --> 00:30:01,064
right, but that
doesn't lead to health.

707
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,368
- I personally
knew several people

708
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,904
who experienced amazing
healing and health

709
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,872
benefits after
adopting some kind

710
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:12,376
some kind of a plant-based
diet, including myself.

711
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,579
But at the same time,
i had also met others

712
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,081
who are still experiencing
health issues,

713
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,083
or were struggling
with their weight,

714
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:24,054
after adopting this lifestyle,
some for many years.

715
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,556
So it made me wonder.

716
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,090
Was there a flaw in this diet?

717
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,461
- First vegetarian
that I knew well

718
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,498
about 40 years ago,
was actually a vegan

719
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,867
he was a very strict vegetarian,

720
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,003
he lived on Coca cola
and potato chips.

721
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,606
He was fat, greasy,
and unhealthy.

722
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,909
So being a vegetarian
means really nothing to me.

723
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,979
- 90% of the vegetarians
are still consuming dairy.

724
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,247
90%.

725
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,316
And they also consume
sometimes some fish,

726
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,552
and sometimes some chicken,
and eggs, and so forth.

727
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,221
The nutrient composition
of the vegetarian diet

728
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:01,091
is not very different
from the non-vegetarian.

729
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,561
So, as a result, if you compare
the health of vegetarians,

730
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,130
with non-vegetarians, you
can't expect to see very much.

731
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,266
- But somebody's decided
they're going to be vegan,

732
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,535
in other words eat no
animal foods, they've made

733
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,272
a declaration as to
their physical and mental

734
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:18,275
strength, and their interest,
and their willingness

735
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,443
to work hard.

736
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,979
After all, if you become vegan,

737
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,648
you have to stand up
to your mother-in-law,

738
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,650
and your doctor or your
dietitian, you have to,

739
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,586
quote, risk protein
and calcium deficiency,

740
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,221
even though that's not true.

741
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,090
But the problem is
that too many vegans

742
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,158
they don't look good.

743
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,261
They're overweight,
they're unhealthy looking.

744
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:39,096
- I don't really like
to use the words vegan

745
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,164
and vegetarian because,

746
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,001
that's not describing
the kind of science

747
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,269
I'm talking about.

748
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,304
- I would call myself a
fat vegan when I first

749
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,573
started out, that's
exactly what I was, and I

750
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,508
was trying to tell
everyone how great this

751
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,111
lifestyle is, and it
saved me, and it reversed

752
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,479
my heart disease.

753
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,548
But yet, I was still walking
around, about 75 pounds

754
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,918
to a hundred pounds overweight.

755
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,352
- Now why is
somebody a fat vegan?

756
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,356
Not because they give
up the animal foods.

757
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,092
That's a good thing, you need
to give up the animal foods.

758
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,029
But what they haven't
given up is the oil.

759
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,231
The olive oil, the
other vegetable oils,

760
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,335
the fat you eat is the
fat you wear, whether

761
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,570
it comes from a
plant, or an animal.

762
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,439
- So, I made the change.

763
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,541
I removed the foods
in my diet that were

764
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,078
empty calories, the
oils and the fats,

765
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,081
the sugars, the processed foods,

766
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,582
the food additives
that kept me coming

767
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,985
back for more, those
companies add those

768
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:38,055
things purposely to
get us to not eat

769
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,057
just one potato chip.

770
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,591
We need the whole bag.

771
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,961
There's millions of overweight
people in this country,

772
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,662
and they're all struggling,
trying this diet,

773
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,631
or that diet, and they
try this diet for a week,

774
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,599
or that diet for a week,
and they're spending

775
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,602
a lot of money on all these
different diet programs,

776
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:56,173
and pills, and supplements,
and adding things

777
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,609
to their diet to lose
weight, or to get healthy,

778
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,679
and that's where we need to
realize that a whole foods

779
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,549
plant-based diet is
free, there's no shakes,

780
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,551
there's no bars,
there's no powders,

781
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,653
there's no counting
calories, we eat until

782
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,556
we're full and
satisfied, and stop.

783
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,358
And that's it.

784
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,226
- As much as
i liked the idea of eating

785
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,628
exclusively a plant-based diet,

786
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,164
especially since it
had worked for me,

787
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,033
I wanted this film
to be very accurate

788
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,669
with the latest science on food.

789
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,038
So I wondered, if realistically,

790
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,173
from a scientific perspective,

791
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,575
could every person
in this day and age

792
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:36,346
eat a plant-based
diet 100% of the time?

793
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,682
- I can't say, and I don't
thing science can say,

794
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,251
that everybody has to be 100%.

795
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:42,152
You know, all the time.

796
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:46,490
I can argue the case, i
think, for the vast majority

797
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:50,093
of people, we ought
to be at least 90,

798
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,429
probably 95%, we've got
good science for that.

799
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,197
And in many cases, if
people already have

800
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,799
a disease, it's a good idea

801
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,201
they should be
100% all the time.

802
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,737
So that's my
scientific argument.

803
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,339
I have another practical
argument, though

804
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,108
on this question, concerning
how far do you go.

805
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,545
And that is that if
we're going to adopt

806
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,180
this dietary lifestyle,

807
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,285
it's really important that
we become accustomed to it.

808
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,255
And we should go
probably 100% if we can.

809
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:18,255
And stay there.

810
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:22,192
And don't tease ourselves
with the other things.

811
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,561
Because what happens, we
never become accustomed

812
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,664
to this, where our taste
preferences change.

813
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,267
- If you do it right,
there are no health issues.

814
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,202
In fact, the side effects are
you're going to lose weight,

815
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,703
you're going to look
better, you're going to have

816
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,273
more energy, you're going
to avoid most of the common

817
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,242
degenerative conditions,
most of the time,

818
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,211
you're going to have a
longer life, and a healthier,

819
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,246
and a better life.

820
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,281
You know, that's
about what happens

821
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,215
when you do this.

822
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:46,716
So there isn't a downside.

823
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,787
- We often hear
that the key to good health

824
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,557
is moderation, and
it makes sense.

825
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,193
But why then does
it not seem to work

826
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,494
for most people?

827
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,670
- You know for some people,

828
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,138
that's a really
easy thing to do.

829
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,739
But unfortunately for most,

830
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,210
finding moderation is
like finding a needle

831
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,344
in a haystack.

832
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,246
And, because others can do it,

833
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:19,549
they feel lost, and they
feel like an absolute

834
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,284
failure because they can't.

835
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,820
And the truth be
told, most people

836
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,223
can't find moderation,
so they're actually

837
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,458
in the majority and
not the minority.

838
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,262
But this minority few
that are on television,

839
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,898
that have never, ever been fat,

840
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,466
never, ever been sick,

841
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,369
have genetics very
much on their way,

842
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,904
they're out there saying,
"it's all about this,

843
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,372
"and all about that."

844
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,207
I mean, how are
they going to relate

845
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,743
to that poor person
sitting at home,

846
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,678
that's 350 pounds,
that feels like their

847
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,447
world is over?

848
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,349
Now, I know what they feel like.

849
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,584
I was 310 pounds.

850
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,220
I was loaded up on
medication for eight years.

851
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,156
I understand, I can relate.

852
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,790
I won't tell anybody
that moderation's easy.

853
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,726
Moderation's damn hard.

854
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,361
Really hard.

855
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,896
I still haven't mastered it.

856
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,365
I'm a work in progress when
it comes to moderation.

857
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:11,368
But what I'm finding
is that I'm away

858
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,702
from an extreme now,

859
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,840
of 93% of my energy
coming from this processed

860
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,575
and fun part of
town, animal fat,

861
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,810
I've now got this moderation up,

862
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,613
I've now moved it
up, and it's working.

863
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,285
- So how are
people supposed to get

864
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:30,220
all this information?

865
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,355
Since everyday we're
bombarded with TV ads,

866
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,326
infomercials, news talking
about the new food trends.

867
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,495
How can we know who's
telling the truth,

868
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,397
and has honest and
unbiased science

869
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,631
behind their products?

870
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,835
- The media always approaches
things with the idea

871
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,572
that if we're going
to interview somebody

872
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,640
about diet, we have to let
somebody with a different

873
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,376
opinion give their opinion.

874
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,945
Alright, so here's what happens.

875
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,846
Someone like Colin Campbell,
at Cornell university

876
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,282
writes this book,
the China study.

877
00:36:59,284 --> 00:36:59,282
It has hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds

878
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:04,321
of references, it
represents decades of very

879
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:07,624
meticulous research,
work that he did, right?

880
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,292
And so they're going to
interview him, well then

881
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,394
they go find somebody that's
promoting a paleo diet,

882
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,363
or a low carb diet
because we have to have

883
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:14,664
the contrary opinion.

884
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,433
That person may have
written a terrible book,

885
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,734
that's a little more
than a storybook,

886
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,570
it's not referenced,
it has no credibility,

887
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,906
but in the eyes of the
public, now those two

888
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,508
are equal, Colin has an opinion,

889
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,510
and this other person
has an opinion.

890
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,679
So it confuses people, and
it gains traction that way.

891
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,451
- We tend to look
at the fast food industry

892
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,254
as the big villain,
responsible for all the havoc

893
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,688
surrounding food choices.

894
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,458
But these same companies
that are contributing

895
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,327
to the problem may
also hold the key

896
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,962
to the solution.

897
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,031
It is a supply and demand issue,

898
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,867
so if enough people
begin demanding healthy,

899
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,804
plant-based options, perhaps
that could be a good approach.

900
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,574
After all, it is us the
consumers who should dictate

901
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,909
what the market has to offer.

902
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,511
And not the other way around.

903
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,483
- You can make better,
cleaner, healthier products

904
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,818
by incorporating more
plant-based foods

905
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,888
into your products, and
not to shy away from that.

906
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,790
So, I don't take a
negative approach like down

907
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,393
with these fast foods.

908
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,728
We need to make them understand

909
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,530
that they can still
make money, and they

910
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,499
can still have a
sustainable business,

911
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,067
because there are
people out there

912
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,535
that want this food.

913
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,737
We just have to make
it available to them.

914
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,648
- Most people
rely on their doctors

915
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,718
for information about
diet and nutrition.

916
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,753
But several medical
school programs

917
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:48,325
show that doctors get very
little training on nutrition.

918
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,026
Sometimes, none at all.

919
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,463
- As I went through
medical school,

920
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,865
and I went through
residency, and I started

921
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,470
after that, working on
my own as a physician,

922
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:04,341
after awhile, I became kind
of a little bit frustrated

923
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,509
with my inability to
really, really help people.

924
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,944
Because what i
thought was happening,

925
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:11,548
was that, I was just
basically seeing patients,

926
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,683
asked to see them very quickly,

927
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,452
and was really left
with limited options

928
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,120
as far as what I could do.

929
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,556
I really felt what i
needed to do with the time

930
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,492
that I had, was left to
do, was just basically

931
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:26,096
treat symptoms, instead of
trying to get to the root cause

932
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,931
of the problem, or the root
cause of their disease.

933
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,567
So, it left me basically
practicing I think the kind

934
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,470
of medicine that the
majority of people are

935
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,573
practicing in the U.S.,
which is pharmaceutical based

936
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:39,476
medicine, and I don't have
a problem with medication.

937
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,044
I think medications are
wonderful, medications

938
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:44,547
are great, they're necessary
for a lot of people,

939
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,982
they are really the only option.

940
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,485
For many people
they're a good option.

941
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,587
But I think what we're
missing is that there's

942
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,489
something else that's out there.

943
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,726
- I was outsourcing my
health, to somebody else.

944
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,561
I was coming along saying,
"here's some money,

945
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,097
"will you fix me,
I'm busy over here."

946
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,565
And when are you
going to come up

947
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,100
with a drug that's
going to like, cure me?

948
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,004
- By using more
chemicals to correct

949
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,173
the imbalance, we're
actually causing

950
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:13,476
the imbalances to
be even stronger.

951
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,513
I found that people
who've been on medications

952
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,583
for a long time, are developing
a lot of side effects

953
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,585
from those medications,
where then are causing

954
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,956
other organs in their
bodies to become diseased,

955
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,161
their functioning is
weakening, their overall health

956
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:33,596
is weakening, their
immune system is getting

957
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,698
deficient, if
something is destroying

958
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,035
you really need to infuse
that with something

959
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,438
that's going help rebuild it.

960
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,206
- So, if somebody
comes along and says,

961
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,743
"you know, doctor, I can take
this patient, and by doing

962
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,612
"these simple things, you
know changing their diet,

963
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,215
"getting them to eat a
little bit differently,

964
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,883
"more plant-based,
getting them to exercise

965
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:56,085
"a little more, do you
realize that I could make

966
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,555
"this diabetes
essentially, if you were

967
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:01,024
"to test them again,
virtually go away?"

968
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,625
And a lot of doctors
in this country,

969
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,494
some may be familiar
with the idea,

970
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,929
but a lot of them,
even to this day,

971
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,198
would still say, "no,
you know, I don't think

972
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,198
"that would be possible."

973
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,601
- The cause of most of
our diseases and the cure

974
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:15,872
is within anybody's reach
who gets the knowledge.

975
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,908
The problem is, is they
have to make some change.

976
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,243
That's a small problem.

977
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:23,046
The real problem is
there is no money

978
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,014
in doing the right thing.

979
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,749
There's money in
selling you statins,

980
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,153
and blood pressure pills,
and powerful arthritis drugs,

981
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:35,225
and laxatives, and antacids,
that's where the money is.

982
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,227
So that's where
the education goes.

983
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,195
- We have to shift the dollars,

984
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,532
from expensive procedures,

985
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:46,002
and shift it more
towards education,

986
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,271
teaching people, showing
them about their disease,

987
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:51,908
and why it's there, and
teaching them the things

988
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,610
that they can do
day in and day out

989
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,713
that would positively
impact that disease,

990
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,582
and possibly even get
it certainly improved,

991
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,150
and maybe even
reversed in some cases.

992
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,954
- You can expect artery disease,
to stabilize and reverse,

993
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,756
and the symptoms to go away,

994
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,858
you can expect the type ii
diabetes, if it's really

995
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,862
type ii diabetes, to be
cured 100% of the time

996
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,532
with diet change and
associated weight loss.

997
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,867
You can expect the
arthritis' to improve,

998
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,869
and go away and be
cured, many times,

999
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,671
with your inflammatory
arthritis'.

1000
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:24,307
The bowel problems, all
the way from indigestion,

1001
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:27,010
to constipation, to
colitus, you can expect

1002
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:30,647
to cure when you direct
your attention to the cause

1003
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,749
of the problem and you fix it.

1004
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,691
- On the
supplement aisle is where

1005
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,326
things get really crazy.

1006
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,828
It seems like every product
can improve our health,

1007
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,730
in one way or another.

1008
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,099
Some support each of
our different organs,

1009
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:54,137
others give us energy,
stimulate our immune system,

1010
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:58,041
prevent colds, reduce appetite,
or promote weight loss.

1011
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,710
It makes me really confused.

1012
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,179
If they're all so good for
us, should we even have

1013
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,181
to worry about eating healthy?

1014
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,118
- Too
tired, too often?

1015
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,853
Try rybutol.

1016
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,755
If you, too, need extra
amounts of thiamine

1017
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,258
and riboflavin, rybutol
can help you gain

1018
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,760
new strength, new energy

1019
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,696
let just one person
among thousands of users

1020
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:24,067
tell you about amazing
benefits gained from rybutol.

1021
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,768
- There's some products
out there that could

1022
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,704
be beneficial to our health,

1023
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,105
and there's nothing
wrong with them,

1024
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,773
but I think the problem
comes when people

1025
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,910
overdo or overuse
that one product,

1026
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,379
and look at is as you
know, the silver bullet,

1027
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,182
the thing that's going
to cure all my ills.

1028
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,718
When people go to that extreme,

1029
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,320
I don't think there's a
product out there like that.

1030
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,189
- I discourage supplements,

1031
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,390
most of the time.

1032
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:48,758
For most people.

1033
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,693
And part of the problem
with supplements

1034
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:54,764
is that supplements,
drugs, procedures,

1035
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:59,068
they all have application
for specific populations.

1036
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,937
So, the whole pitch,
if you will, is based

1037
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:04,273
on the idea that you can't
get enough nutrients,

1038
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,376
from food, you don't
eat the right diet,

1039
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:09,045
so you can somehow,
make up for it,

1040
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,747
by taking these
dietary supplements.

1041
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,749
So it's become a 40
billion dollar industry.

1042
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:15,385
The sales pitches worked,
people are doing it.

1043
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,786
They're buying this stuff.

1044
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,154
And the people who sell
it, they're hanging

1045
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,956
on for dear life, and
they're not about to give

1046
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,725
into the scientific truth.

1047
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,028
But the reality is that
all of the nutrients

1048
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,064
that you need are in
food, and they're in food

1049
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:31,034
- in very specific and
complex combinations

1050
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,703
that we don't really
even understand

1051
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:35,004
all of yet.

1052
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,106
And so when you extract
a single nutrient

1053
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,776
and purify it, and
put it in a pill,

1054
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:41,944
you're overloading your
system with something

1055
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:44,080
that it's never seen
before, and is really not

1056
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,716
adapted to deal with.

1057
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:48,284
Much better to eat
smaller amounts of it,

1058
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,987
in the food, and again,
I'll Grant that there

1059
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,922
are exceptions,
and in my office,

1060
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,991
I recommend
supplements sometimes,

1061
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,927
but not to the
general population.

1062
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,762
And that's the problem
in medicine, too,

1063
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,230
we want to take
everything, and sell it

1064
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,800
to everybody, because
that's how you make money.

1065
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,769
- A lot of people have
done a lot of disservice

1066
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,438
to many, many people,

1067
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,140
trying to offer them a
magic pill, or a magic this,

1068
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:13,743
or a solution in five days,

1069
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,845
that's going to
change your life.

1070
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,282
And the simple reality
is, is that you can't do

1071
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:24,353
20 years of damage, by
ignoring mother nature's best,

1072
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:26,756
the fruits, the vegetables,
the nuts, the beans,

1073
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:27,924
the seeds.

1074
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:31,794
You can't spend 20
years saying no to that,

1075
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:35,164
and then expect
people in white coats

1076
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,066
to come up with
something that's going

1077
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,868
to solve that, in five days.

1078
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,438
So what we have to
do is we have to see

1079
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,842
the error of our ways,
which was turning our back

1080
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,744
on mother nature,
and we have to turn

1081
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,146
towards her, for a solution.

1082
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,282
- Vitamin supplements
for example,

1083
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,118
we've got a lot of data
that, when you take them

1084
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,221
out of context, like that,
and use them that way,

1085
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,890
in the short run, yeah, it
looks sort of interesting,

1086
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:03,259
maybe they're looking
good for a little while,

1087
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,161
especially in people
that may be really low

1088
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:08,798
on them, but in
the long run, no.

1089
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,900
You know, they don't work

1090
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:14,036
and yet we're spending
32 billion dollars a year

1091
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,905
on nutrient supplements.

1092
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,541
- The most important
supplement for those

1093
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:21,944
eating plant-based diets, is

1094
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,213
a vitamin b12, a
regular reliable source

1095
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,382
of vitamin b12, it doesn't
have to be supplements,

1096
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,451
but they have b12
fortified foods.

1097
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,854
This is very important,
it's critical

1098
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,856
for everyone eating
a plant-based diet

1099
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,893
to get a regular reliable
source of vitamin b12.

1100
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:39,962
There's only two vitamins
not created by plants.

1101
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,231
One is vitamin d,
created by animals,

1102
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,901
such as yourself when you
walk out into the sun,

1103
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,904
and the other is vitamin
b12, not made by plants,

1104
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,906
not made by animals either,
it's made by little microbes

1105
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:52,875
that blanket the
earth, so, you know,

1106
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,243
it might've gotten enough

1107
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,979
from drinking out of a
mountain stream, or well water,

1108
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,081
but now we chlorinate
the water supply to kill

1109
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:02,018
off any bacteria, so we
don't get a lot of you know,

1110
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,320
b12 in our water anymore,
don't get alot of cholera

1111
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,923
either, that's a good thing.

1112
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,925
But because of the way we live

1113
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:12,328
you know, in our, you know
sanitized, modern world,

1114
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,497
got to get b12 from somewhere.

1115
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,532
Our fellow great apes get
it from you know, bugs

1116
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:21,070
during feces, but I prefer
a more sanitary route,

1117
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,506
which is one 2500 microamps
of it once a week,

1118
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,043
cost less than
five bucks a year,

1119
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:29,912
or vitamin b12 fortified
foods everyday.

1120
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,549
- We spend
more money on healthcare

1121
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,218
than any other
country in the world.

1122
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,987
Yet we have some of
the highest rates

1123
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,289
of chronic disease
on the planet.

1124
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,391
Fortunately, it seems
that some health insurance

1125
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,895
providers including
medicare, are beginning

1126
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:48,264
to embrace the concept
of disease prevention

1127
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,999
through diet.

1128
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,567
Instead of spending
millions of dollars

1129
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:54,203
trying to simply
manage the problem,

1130
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,138
when it might
already be too late.

1131
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,476
- So medicare now
accepts for reimbursement

1132
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,312
both the Dean ornish program,
for reversing heart disease

1133
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,181
as well as the pritikin program.

1134
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,318
And this is out of a
recognition that it's not only

1135
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,587
safer, it's not only
cheaper, but actually

1136
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,956
more effective than
kind of the traditional

1137
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,627
approach, which is
very costly surgery,

1138
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,029
and a lifetime of drugs.

1139
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,197
And so,

1140
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,166
I mean this is
great, from a whole,

1141
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:25,368
I mean, the most
important things,

1142
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,103
is reducing suffering
and saving lives,

1143
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,405
but from kind of a
fiscal responsibility,

1144
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,577
I mean, it's so much,
cheaper, so much more

1145
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,146
cost effective, that, and
who's footing the bill?

1146
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,048
Well, if it's medicare,
it's taxpayer,

1147
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,419
so they're saving money by
making people healthier.

1148
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,123
- For most
people, it is hard to imagine

1149
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,259
that anybody could perform
well as an athlete,

1150
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,162
without consuming
any animal products.

1151
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:55,298
Not to mention being
a world class athlete,

1152
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,466
or even a world champion.

1153
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,636
- I am a professional
triathelete,

1154
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,005
specializing in the
iron man distance.

1155
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:05,541
I'm also the ultraman
world champion.

1156
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,243
I have been racing for
triathlon professionally

1157
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:11,981
for 10 years, I've
finished 66 iron man races,

1158
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:17,053
and I love to train,
and race all the time.

1159
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,388
- I'm an ultra-endurance
athelete,

1160
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,425
most people have
heard of an iron man,

1161
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:25,428
if you haven't, an iron man
is a very long triathlon,

1162
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,030
during which, over the
course of a one day period,

1163
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,167
you swim 2.4 miles, you
ride your bike 112 miles,

1164
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:32,635
and then you run a marathon.

1165
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:36,138
While ultra man is essentially
double that distance,

1166
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,309
and in 2009, I was
the fastest American

1167
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,212
and 6th place
overall in this race.

1168
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,117
- I do believe that last season,

1169
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,586
on a plant-based diet
was my strongest.

1170
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,021
Than I've ever been.

1171
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:53,055
I did a couple of
iron man races,

1172
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:55,124
that were among the top five,

1173
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,259
best performances in my career,

1174
00:49:57,261 --> 00:50:00,262
and I was able to win the
ultra man world championship.

1175
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,764
- What you're also
seeing are atheltes like

1176
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:04,767
mma fighters, they're
realizing performance gains

1177
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:08,471
they're recovering more quickly
in between their workouts,

1178
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,574
you see nba players, NFL
players, NHL players,

1179
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,176
olympic athletes, all
kinds of athletes who are

1180
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:18,714
starting to experiment
and explore this way

1181
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,050
of eating, and
getting good results.

1182
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,695
I've been doing this
for over eight years

1183
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,463
right now, I've never
had a problem building

1184
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,432
lean muscle mass, i
continue to get stronger,

1185
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:41,103
fitter and faster,
and it's fine.

1186
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,039
- For me now, the proof
is in the pudding.

1187
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,709
I know that I am like
stronger than I've ever been,

1188
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,210
without animal products, and so

1189
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,114
I proved it really, like,
to myself and I've hopefully

1190
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:55,384
proved to other people
that it can be done.

1191
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,329
- I'm a neurofibromatosis
patient,

1192
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,666
I'm an ambassador for a couple

1193
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,169
of organizations, that
do philanthropic work

1194
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,104
for sick children.

1195
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,240
I'm an npst cancer survivor.

1196
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,645
Npst is a rare sarcoma,

1197
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,815
it's one of the most
aggressive and fast,

1198
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,186
infiltrating cancers that
there is on the planet.

1199
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:34,790
I've had over 325 tumors
removed from my body.

1200
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,629
I've lived a very, very
rigorous and painful last

1201
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:44,300
three and a half years,
battling for my life,

1202
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:49,171
and I had a decision to make.

1203
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,876
I'm either going to
let this take me,

1204
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,512
or I'm going to fight.

1205
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,348
Like giving up wasn't an option,

1206
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,550
I don't know what's
going to happen,

1207
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,385
but I'm not going
to die sitting down,

1208
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,355
or laying down, I'm going
to keep my hands up,

1209
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,324
my head tucked, and
I'm not going to stop

1210
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,392
swinging until it's over.

1211
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:12,862
And without a plant-based diet,

1212
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:14,430
I would not be here today.

1213
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,168
It kind of kept
my cancer at bay,

1214
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,569
and it's allowed me
to thrive in ways

1215
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,638
I didn't know was possible.

1216
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,441
The insane mindset that

1217
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,645
animal protein is the key

1218
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,413
to being very healthy,

1219
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,282
you know, almost killed me.

1220
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,385
I'm not saying plant-based diets

1221
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,289
cure, or they're
the end-all, be-all,

1222
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,691
but what I am saying
is that if you're

1223
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,194
going through some
type of health crisis,

1224
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,398
your odds are very,
very much greater

1225
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,569
when you embrace a
plant-based lifestyle.

1226
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,671
Those are just the facts.

1227
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,840
And my life is the living proof.

1228
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,356
- In 2006, I attempted suicide,

1229
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,860
while I was on 250
milligrams of Zoloft,

1230
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:20,196
for what the doctors
diagnosed as major

1231
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,530
depressive disorder.

1232
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,466
And I was told I'd
be most likely on it

1233
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:26,335
for the rest of my life.

1234
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:28,737
A week after that i
went into a personal

1235
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,374
development course,
and changed my beliefs.

1236
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,443
From there, I started
to look at what I was

1237
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:35,778
putting into my body.

1238
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,315
And I started to
look at nutrition,

1239
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,984
and nutritional healing,
and what I could do.

1240
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:46,722
And it led me to going within,

1241
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,290
and back to nature.

1242
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,926
I stripped away all
of the processed food,

1243
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,798
I went back to just
eating raw fruits

1244
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,301
and vegetables, and juicing,
and green smoothies,

1245
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:04,273
and I started to have
a sense of a natural,

1246
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:07,743
natural happy high started
to come into my body,

1247
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:11,947
and I was feeling better

1248
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:15,017
than I'd felt in many years.

1249
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:19,355
The symptoms of depression
started to drop away,

1250
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,824
the heavy, sluggish,
tired feelings

1251
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,660
that I couldn't cope,
the chronic fatigue,

1252
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,298
the aches, you know,
everything started to shift.

1253
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,869
And I started to
feel my cells were

1254
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,504
transforming on some level.

1255
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,941
I'd made the decision
that I didn't want to put

1256
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,879
ever again, the fear
of death and suffering

1257
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:48,417
of another life, and eating
animals into my body.

1258
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,687
And that translated to

1259
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:54,690
a shift for me, I cured
my own depression.

1260
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,026
And I've never looked back.

1261
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,437
- Eating tasty
food is one of the biggest

1262
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:09,738
pleasures in life.

1263
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,573
So many people might
argue that even though

1264
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:14,677
eating an unhealthy diet
is not good for them,

1265
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,680
they don't want to jeopardize
the fun aspect of it.

1266
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:20,516
And therefore, they continue
eating unhealthy things.

1267
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,052
But one thing that
i came to discover

1268
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:25,387
is that when you
transition into a healthier

1269
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:28,424
eating lifestyle, you do
not have to compromise

1270
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:29,792
on taste.

1271
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,494
Yes, you will go through
a transition period,

1272
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,530
but once your taste buds,
and your body's chemistry

1273
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,099
begins to change, you
will start to crave

1274
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,901
and really enjoy these foods.

1275
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,504
It is important to
find food you like,

1276
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,406
and once you realize
that almost every dish

1277
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,475
can be made plant-based,
you will see that

1278
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,544
it is not that hard at all.

1279
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,881
- There's such a stigma
with the word vegan,

1280
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,883
I guess that people
just get automatically

1281
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,719
turned off and just assume
that it's going to suck.

1282
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:57,986
But it's like it doesn't.

1283
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,388
If anything, to me, and
i mean, that was another

1284
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,557
big thing, why I do it,
because it's better.

1285
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,592
To me, I think food's
just way better this way.

1286
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,461
I would say just try it.

1287
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,396
You know, you'll
surprise yourself.

1288
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,531
- When you're
becoming vegetarian,

1289
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,367
and you've given up
the meat and the dairy

1290
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,435
and the eggs, the only
thing you know for food,

1291
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:14,937
you think you're going
to starve to death.

1292
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,773
You have to understand that

1293
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,742
marinara sauce, and
pasta, and lasagna,

1294
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:24,079
and bean burritos, and oatmeal,
and hash-brown potatoes,

1295
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,949
and so on, things you
love, that's where you get

1296
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,084
your calories and your
protein and your vitamins

1297
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,886
and your minerals.

1298
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,755
- There are so many
beautiful, wonderful

1299
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:36,392
amazing, delicious
plant-based foods out there.

1300
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,894
In fact, when I started
to do this a whole world

1301
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,530
opened up to me, and
when you begin to eat

1302
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:44,466
these nutrient dense
foods that are actually

1303
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:47,870
fuelling you, that are
actually nourishing you,

1304
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,905
with all of these
amazing vital nutrients

1305
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,708
and micronutrients,
you start to feel good,

1306
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,778
your cravings change, and
your taste buds change.

1307
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,913
You know, that cheeseburger,
that you couldn't

1308
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,948
get out of your mind, suddenly,

1309
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,750
you're not thinking
about that anymore,

1310
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,586
and you're actually
craving that Kale smoothie.

1311
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,054
And that's something
that happened to me

1312
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,023
that I would have never
thought would have happened.

1313
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,125
- People think that vegan
food just tastes like crap.

1314
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:11,727
And that's not true.

1315
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,128
I think that people
think that being vegan

1316
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,930
might potentially be strange,

1317
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,666
that people are weird, that
you have to be a hippie,

1318
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,768
or you have to embrace
wearing hemp clothes,

1319
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,203
or something.

1320
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,571
- You want to have a burger,
you can have a burger.

1321
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:23,872
You want to have
spaghetti and meatballs,

1322
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,841
you can have spaghetti
and wheatballs.

1323
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,209
You want to have fries,
you want to have chocolate

1324
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,479
mousse, you want to
have pumpkin pie,

1325
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,581
you want to have stuffing,
you want to have,

1326
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,484
you know, even hotdogs.

1327
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,653
- And so when you're looking at

1328
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,155
the idea of taking the leap,

1329
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,691
into this way of
eating and living,

1330
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:44,560
don't look at what
you're going to be

1331
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,963
not eating, embrace
and be excited

1332
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,766
about the adventure
of all these new foods

1333
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,634
you're going to be
bringing into your life.

1334
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,204
- Eating
healthy will not do you

1335
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:57,673
much good if you
can't afford it.

1336
00:57:57,675 --> 00:58:00,008
Or if it leaves a big
hole in your pocket.

1337
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,478
So my next question
was is it possible

1338
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,746
to eat healthy on
a tight budget?

1339
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,718
- A common misconception
is that a whole

1340
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,754
foods plant-based diet
is very expensive.

1341
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:17,726
I routinely post pictures
of my grocery receipt,

1342
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,495
and I take my whole
bounty that I bought

1343
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:22,030
at the produce market, and
put it out on the table

1344
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:25,667
so people can see, how
much I end up with,

1345
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,969
and they're shocked.

1346
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:29,671
Whole grains that
we buy in bulk,

1347
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,673
are very inexpensive.

1348
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,176
You're going to cut your
grocery bills in half,

1349
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,278
from a typical
standard American diet,

1350
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,747
in the beginning, it might
seem like a lot of effort,

1351
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,649
but in the long run, you're
saving all this money

1352
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,851
for all the new clothes
you're going to have to buy

1353
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,721
for the new slim
you that is produced

1354
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:48,690
from eating this whole
foods plant-based diet.

1355
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,659
- It's easy to go into
those markets and say,

1356
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,261
"there's no way
that I can do this."

1357
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:53,795
But the truth of
the matter is that

1358
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:56,164
it doesn't have to be expensive,

1359
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,766
it doesn't have to
be inconvenient,

1360
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,268
it doesn't have to be
difficult, it doesn't have

1361
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,036
to be time consuming.

1362
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,171
And my experience is
that it has actually

1363
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,707
simplified my life,
and it's been cheaper

1364
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,776
than eating the
other way around.

1365
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,913
- At this
point of my journey,

1366
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:12,681
I already had seen
enough evidence

1367
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:15,884
about the benefits and
safety of a plant based diet

1368
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,154
for adults, but was this
lifestyle also ideal

1369
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,089
and safe for children?

1370
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,727
- Not only can
children grow healthy

1371
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,563
on a plant-based
diet, they'll grow

1372
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,765
healthiest on a
plant-based diet.

1373
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,266
I mean, we have an
epidemic of childhood

1374
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:36,004
obesity, and children
raised plant-based,

1375
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,739
actually grow taller
by about an inch,

1376
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,775
they grow about an inch
taller than meat eating

1377
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:41,677
incumbents, and
most importantly,

1378
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,147
they grow less in a
horizontal direction, right?

1379
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:46,982
They don't have
the same problems

1380
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:50,586
with childhood obesity,
so Dr. Benjamin Spock,

1381
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,355
the most esteemed
pediatrician of all time,

1382
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,823
wrote one of the
bestselling books

1383
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,059
in human history,
recommended in his final

1384
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:00,195
edition, the 7th edition
of his book before he died

1385
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,998
in his 90's, that all
children should be raised

1386
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,068
with zero exposure
to meat and dairy.

1387
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,302
And he did this
because he saw what

1388
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:09,338
you know, the older
generations were dying

1389
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,674
from, and wanted to get
them off on a good start.

1390
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:16,812
I mean the leading
killers of our children

1391
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,315
will eventually be, same thing.

1392
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,117
Heart disease,
cancer, strokes, copd,

1393
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,620
diabetes, hypertension.

1394
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,021
These are diseases
that can be prevented

1395
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:28,824
in many cases arrested,
or even reversed

1396
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,859
with a healthy enough
plant-based diet.

1397
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,895
- As a new
father, I wondered,

1398
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:36,231
how could I get my
daughter to eat healthy?

1399
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,833
Since getting her to
eat anything at all

1400
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:40,202
can sometimes be a problem.

1401
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:41,803
There's so much
junk being marketed

1402
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,339
to kids out there, and
it is often difficult

1403
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,842
for parents to
transition their children

1404
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,744
to healthier food options.

1405
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,381
- I would not be
surprised at all

1406
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:56,284
that if in 15,
20, 25 years time,

1407
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,957
people will look back at
the last 10 to 20 years,

1408
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:06,862
and they'll say, "how did
those people give that food

1409
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,063
"to their children?"

1410
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,969
- A big question that
we get all the time

1411
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,772
is, "how can I get my
kids to eat better?"

1412
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:19,341
I think every parent
wants their kids to eat

1413
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:24,079
healthy, and it's
difficult, especially when

1414
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,881
everywhere you look, there's
a fast food restaurant,

1415
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:28,450
or a processed food snack
that is being marketed

1416
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,085
towards children.

1417
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:31,420
And the first thing
that I always say is,

1418
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:33,889
"you have to lead by example."

1419
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,324
As a parent, you can't
be eating lousy foods,

1420
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,927
and expect your
children to eat healthy,

1421
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,295
because you tell them to.

1422
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:43,398
So you have to walk your
walk, that's number one.

1423
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,867
The second thing is, i
encourage all parents

1424
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,073
to make the preparation
of meals and the shopping

1425
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,842
of food inclusive
with their children.

1426
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:57,245
The more you can bring
your kids into the fold,

1427
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:00,415
the more they're going
to develop an emotional

1428
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:03,719
attachment to where
their food comes from,

1429
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,053
how it's prepared,
and the impact that

1430
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,888
it's having on their health.

1431
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,423
- Really get inside their heads,

1432
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,826
and sort of think
how they would think.

1433
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:14,162
Keep telling them what
is good, what is bad,

1434
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:17,966
won't probably work, you
have to interact with them,

1435
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,302
you have to show
them what's possible.

1436
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:23,205
Get your hands dirty,
get the kids to help you,

1437
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,107
and let them own
what they're doing.

1438
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,211
If you always put
something in front of them

1439
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:31,813
in a silver platter,
and let them consume

1440
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,815
that information,
you know, it'll only

1441
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:33,815
work for so long.

1442
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:33,815
What you've got to do,
you've got to get them

1443
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:39,988
involved, let them have
the responsibility.

1444
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,290
The way I approach it
is that I try to make it

1445
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:45,427
as fun as possible, use
colors, use flavors,

1446
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,997
teach a little thing that
they never knew about,

1447
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:53,335
use gadgets that,
normal people won't see,

1448
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,837
but I want them to go
away with a feeling

1449
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,073
of accomplishment,
and something that

1450
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:00,909
they're eager to share
to their friends.

1451
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,211
Hopefully their parents.

1452
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,846
I think that's the best part.

1453
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,114
It's like holding a bird.

1454
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,949
You don't want to
hold it too tight,

1455
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:07,949
you're going to hurt the bird.

1456
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,318
You don't want to
hold it too loosely,

1457
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,920
or it's going to fly away.

1458
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,555
That's something that
each individual parent

1459
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,992
has a specific
knowledge of their kid.

1460
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,860
- I get the questions
all the time.

1461
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,896
"What do I do, how do I start,

1462
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,798
"how do I tell my kids,
oh, they're going to be

1463
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:22,798
"so disappointed that
they're not having

1464
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:27,202
"meat on their plates, that
they're not having dairy."

1465
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:30,272
Try a vegan burger, it's
basically the same thing,

1466
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,940
you just leave the meat out.

1467
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:31,940
That's great for
kids, because why?

1468
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:34,876
You're going to put
that burger on that bun,

1469
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,845
you're going to put all
the fixings on that,

1470
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:39,214
whatever your kids like, you
make it exactly the same,

1471
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,583
that's a great way
to get started.

1472
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:43,084
- When I think with
the younger generation,

1473
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,287
what's so exciting is,
is that they get to start

1474
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:49,958
young, I mean, I'm not
going to have any regrets,

1475
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,226
but it sort of bums me
out a little bit that I'm

1476
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,595
just now discovering
this in my 30's because

1477
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,997
I wish I would have done
this when I was younger,

1478
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,500
because just the thoughts
of like the energy,

1479
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,969
that I would've had in college.

1480
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,338
- I think the other
thing is to not have

1481
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,274
hard and fast rules,
with your children,

1482
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,845
you can't eat that, and you
know, you have to eat this.

1483
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:14,249
And instead, respect them as
independent sentient beings,

1484
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:16,551
who have you know,
the wherewithal

1485
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:19,521
to make conscious
decisions for themselves.

1486
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:23,058
So, at our home, we
serve plant based foods,

1487
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,993
all the time, we don't
have any animal products

1488
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,896
here, but when my 10
year old daughter goes

1489
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:31,166
to a birthday party, she's
surrounded by you know,

1490
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,269
chicken McNuggets, and
birthday cake and all of that,

1491
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:38,106
and we don't say to her,
"you can't eat those foods."

1492
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:41,243
We say, "have a great time
at the birthday party,

1493
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:44,045
"and make the right
choice for you."

1494
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,447
And that doesn't mean
that she always makes

1495
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:49,618
the right choice, that
way you are empowering

1496
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,953
them, this is a lifetime
we're talking about.

1497
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:54,389
This is a long road ahead,
so it's about getting

1498
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,958
your children to think
consciously about their

1499
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,261
own choices, so that
when they reach the age

1500
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:02,163
of maturity, they are
informed and educated

1501
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:06,902
and prepared to be responsible
stewards of the planet,

1502
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,170
and responsible stewards
of their own bodies.

1503
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,207
- I could not
make a film about food choices

1504
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,043
and not explore the
topic of organic,

1505
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,945
versus non-organic.

1506
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,280
It seems that
everybody's obssessed

1507
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,682
with those words, and
it's becoming increasingly

1508
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:24,986
adverse to foods that don't
carry an organic label.

1509
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,222
Others fear that consuming
more plant based food

1510
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,157
might be damaging
to their health,

1511
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:32,627
due to the increase of
pesticides in those foods.

1512
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,196
But should this really
be our biggest concern?

1513
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,567
- Fear of pesticides
should never keep anyone

1514
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,437
from maximizing their
fruit and vegetable intake.

1515
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,141
There, you know, so there's
been like chemic computer

1516
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:49,177
modeling studies that
suggest that, so for example,

1517
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,179
if half of Americans ate
a single more serving

1518
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:53,148
of fruits and vegetables
a day, we'd prevent

1519
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,451
20,000 cancer deaths every year.

1520
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,520
If just half the people,
just one more serving,

1521
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:02,357
20,000 people would not
have died from cancer,

1522
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,559
would normally have died
if they hadn't done that.

1523
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,728
So that's how powerful
fruits and vegetables are.

1524
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,365
But, because these
were conventional,

1525
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:12,567
pesticide laden
fruits and vegetables,

1526
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:15,470
they estimated that it
would, that the extra

1527
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,238
pesticide burden from
all those extra fruits

1528
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,175
and vegetables would cause 10

1529
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,609
extra cancer deaths.

1530
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:26,147
So in all it would only
prevent 19, 990 cancer deaths.

1531
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,983
But that's what we're
looking at a year,

1532
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,684
this tremendous benefit.

1533
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:31,252
Then a tiny bump in risk.

1534
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:33,688
So, okay, great, choose
organic whenever you can,

1535
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,291
why accept any risk,
why not get all benefit?

1536
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,227
Sure, but we should never
let concern about pesticides

1537
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,230
in any way dissuade us
from stuffing our face

1538
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:45,400
with as many healthy fruits
and vegetables as possible.

1539
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:47,769
- If you're eating meat,
and you're eating commercial

1540
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:50,138
meat, and you're worried
about switching to plant-based

1541
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,274
diet, and worried about the
pesticides in the produce,

1542
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:54,743
you're being ridiculous,
because you're getting

1543
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:57,746
a fraction of the pesticides
by eating the vegetable,

1544
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,248
that you can mostly wash it off.

1545
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,750
Remember, you can
wash, you can soak your

1546
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:04,219
vegetables and use a
wash to get pesticide

1547
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:04,219
residue off.

1548
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:08,123
You cannot wash the pesticide
off of the hamburger

1549
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,657
meat you're about to prepare.

1550
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,060
- I encourage people
just to go ahead and buy

1551
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:14,229
whatever produce
they can afford,

1552
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,097
whatever produce
looks the freshest

1553
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,099
that week in the grocery store,

1554
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,701
and whatever's on sale,

1555
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,436
so that's where they're
going to save money,

1556
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:24,039
is not worrying about,

1557
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,707
"i have to buy
organic bell peppers,

1558
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,143
"and they cost me
four dollars each."

1559
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:31,613
That's not a
sustainable lifestyle.

1560
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,758
- Besides
the health aspect related

1561
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,828
to our food choices, I also
realized during the production

1562
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,697
of this film, that there
was another very important

1563
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,734
factor, that is
often overlooked,

1564
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,602
ignored, or misunderstood.

1565
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,672
The connection
between food choices,

1566
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:57,672
and the environment.

1567
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:01,309
I was really shocked after
reading the united nations

1568
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,344
report on global warming.

1569
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:06,081
After all, it is hard
to grasp the idea

1570
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,116
that the burger, or
steak on our plates

1571
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:10,251
might be contributing
to things such as

1572
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,854
global warming, water scarcity,

1573
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:17,158
species extinction,
the destruction of
the Amazon forest,

1574
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,162
the depletion of our oceans,
and even world hunger.

1575
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:23,631
I had a hard time
understanding it at first,

1576
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:26,234
but once I began
digging a little deeper,

1577
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,269
the connection became clear.

1578
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,474
- Now, it's seven
billion people,

1579
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:34,876
what we eat, determines
how the whole planet

1580
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,779
is used, and what's
happening now

1581
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,181
is that, as we run out of land,

1582
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,549
to grow these
animals and the food

1583
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,486
for the animals, we
burn down rain forests,

1584
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,621
to aquire more land.

1585
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,123
And the number one
cause of all of that

1586
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,390
is our food choices.

1587
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,201
- It's expected to have a
40% shortage in fresh water

1588
01:09:00,203 --> 01:09:02,804
supplies by the year 2030.

1589
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:06,908
We have again, irreversible
loss of biodiversity,

1590
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,544
ecosystems, and extinction
of species faster than

1591
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:13,281
we've ever seen before, for
the past 65 million years.

1592
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:15,483
We have a world hunger
issue with a little less

1593
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,219
that a billion people on
earth suffering from hunger,

1594
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:22,290
with about 350 children
dying from hunger each hour.

1595
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,528
- You might
be asking yourself,

1596
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,563
how is all that possible?

1597
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:30,431
And I had the same questions,

1598
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:33,234
because in fact,
many of these issues

1599
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:36,237
are not only related
to our food choices.

1600
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,239
Many are very complex problems,

1601
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:41,276
with several social,
political, economic,

1602
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:43,444
and cultural variables.

1603
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,914
But here are some
intriguing facts.

1604
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:49,717
70% of our arable land
is used to grow crops

1605
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,420
for animals and not humans.

1606
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,891
It takes on average
2400 gallons of water

1607
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:00,228
and 12 pounds of grain to
make one pound of beef.

1608
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,432
Five million acres of
rainforest are destroyed

1609
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:07,936
every year, so companies
can graze animals

1610
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,737
and grow food for these animals.

1611
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,741
The excrements of 80
billion land animals

1612
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:17,579
killed every year for
food are not treated.

1613
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,781
And go back into
our water basins,

1614
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:23,384
and our oceans, creating
a lot of pollution.

1615
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,953
And these are just
a few examples.

1616
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,555
So when you consider
these facts,

1617
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,458
it all begins to
fall into place.

1618
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,295
- We need to focus
more, and understand

1619
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,431
more what the footprint
is, the complete

1620
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:40,301
life cycle analysis, ecological
environmental depleting

1621
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:44,339
footprint is of that
item is versus just how

1622
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:45,573
close it is to you.

1623
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,242
Or whether it's
even organic or not.

1624
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:49,377
It's much less of a
footprint to eat something

1625
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:52,347
that was grown 1500 miles away,

1626
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,949
if it was plant-based,
than it is to eat

1627
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,418
a food item that
was slaughtered,

1628
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,386
that was an animal product,

1629
01:10:58,388 --> 01:10:59,454
by your next door neighbor.

1630
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:00,755
And our largest footprint is,

1631
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,358
you know, across all sectors,

1632
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,892
our food choice
specifically as it relates

1633
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:04,892
to eating animals.

1634
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,764
- No matter
how green, or eco-friendly

1635
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,867
we try to be, the truth
is that by nature,

1636
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,837
we are a very
destructive species.

1637
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,805
Almost everything
we do has a negative

1638
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,540
impact on the environment.

1639
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,478
So many people often try to
minimize their footprint,

1640
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,713
by doing things like
switching to more effective

1641
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:29,017
light bulbs, taking
short showers,

1642
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:32,353
bicycling to work,
using solar energy,

1643
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,756
or even buying an electric car.

1644
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:37,058
And those are all great things.

1645
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,626
But the question is,

1646
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,795
are these actions
in fact the easiest

1647
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,665
and most effective when
it comes to helping

1648
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:46,434
protect our planet
and its' resources?

1649
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,704
- You look at the
four major problems.

1650
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,706
We've got overpopulation,

1651
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,408
and we're adding about
a million people every

1652
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,809
four days, net.

1653
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,511
Then you get to the way we live,

1654
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,446
and the way we consume stuff,

1655
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:01,649
all that stuff is coming
from finite resources

1656
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,352
which we are steadily depleting.

1657
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,454
So those first two factors
the overpopulation,

1658
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:09,657
and the way we live, are
driving the third one,

1659
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,493
which is our dependence
on fossil fuels.

1660
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,828
Look at the numbers.

1661
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,898
Since 1950, the
line for consumption

1662
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,967
of fossil fuels have
gone steadily up,

1663
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,970
every year, and there's
no end in sight.

1664
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:25,606
The fourth big driver,
of all of these

1665
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:29,110
environmental issues,
particularly global warming,

1666
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,446
is the way we eat,
is our consumption

1667
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:32,814
of the meat, dairy,
eggs and fish,

1668
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,415
and that keeps going up.

1669
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:38,019
It requires, per calorie,
over 10 times as much

1670
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,688
land, 10 times as much water,

1671
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,657
and 10 times as much energy.

1672
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:43,891
And it ranges.

1673
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,560
But the average is
well over 10 times,

1674
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:46,928
and that's a big number.

1675
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,063
Now the good news
is, we can change

1676
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,966
what we eat, any
individual over night.

1677
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,936
People say, "wow, what
would happen if everybody

1678
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,637
"changed at once?"

1679
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:57,939
Well, that's not
going to happen.

1680
01:12:57,941 --> 01:12:59,841
The bad news is, those
first three items,

1681
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:03,511
overpopulation,
over consumption,

1682
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:07,482
and dependence on fossil
fuels, each one of those would

1683
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:11,519
take decades, if not
centuries to fix.

1684
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,022
- With more
and more people embracing

1685
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:18,593
the idea of reducing their
intake of animal products,

1686
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:21,429
or adopting some kind
of a plant-based diet,

1687
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:24,031
it seems that things are
moving in the right direction.

1688
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,100
But are they, really?

1689
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:28,536
- You know, I hear people
saying, "things are

1690
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:29,837
"are getting better.

1691
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:31,806
"You know, we see
people putting solar

1692
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:33,508
"panels up, and more
people are eating

1693
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,676
"plant-based, and
there's vegan restaurants

1694
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:38,913
"going in down the street,
things are getting better."

1695
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,715
Well, not really.

1696
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,583
And not even close.

1697
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,951
For every individual,

1698
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:45,620
that's moving in the direction

1699
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,789
of a plant-based diet,

1700
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,791
there's a hundred people moving

1701
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:51,426
in the other direction.

1702
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:53,728
We've got to double
our food production

1703
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,597
in the next 40 years,
to feed the nine billion

1704
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,533
that we'll have by 2050.

1705
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,537
- When it
comes to global warming,

1706
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,672
the production of
animals for food

1707
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:07,975
currently contributes to
about 14.5% of the total

1708
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:10,111
global warming effect.

1709
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,079
A contribution larger
than the entire

1710
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,582
global transportation
sector combined.

1711
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:19,587
Livestock amounts to 53%
of nitrous oxide emissions,

1712
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,790
44% of methane gas,

1713
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,693
and 5% of the total
carbon dioxide

1714
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,595
released in our atmosphere.

1715
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,636
- Raising livestock
and eating fish,

1716
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,673
and also producing dairy
is one of the largest

1717
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:41,709
contributing factors
to climate change.

1718
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,544
And the public
needs to know this,

1719
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:46,647
and policies need to
be enacted to help

1720
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:46,647
eliminate that.

1721
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,550
It's one of the easiest
ways that we have

1722
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:53,754
to not just adapt to, but
to mitigate climate change.

1723
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:56,257
And it can be done as
easy as just changing

1724
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:57,859
out what you have on your plate.

1725
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,200
- Organic
grass fed beef

1726
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,169
seems to be the new trend.

1727
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,571
And the idea sounds
really appealing.

1728
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:14,542
Cows that live off grass
don't take any antibiotics,

1729
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,177
and therefore supposedly
provide a healthier

1730
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:19,113
food source for us,
when compared to factory

1731
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:21,148
farmed animals.

1732
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,817
But is there a catch?

1733
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,086
- It's a very large
movement today,

1734
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,554
and I think what's
happening is that

1735
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:29,590
there's been a shift
because of more and more

1736
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:31,592
people being concerned
about the humane

1737
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:33,861
raising of animals, and
moving away from factory

1738
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,998
farms, they're moving
toward grass fed operations,

1739
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,633
or pasture fed operations.

1740
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,769
It's a complete fabrication
by the meat and dairy

1741
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:44,171
industries to
continue perpetuating

1742
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:46,607
the slaughtering of
animals, because even though

1743
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,609
some animal might
be humane raised,

1744
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,311
they're still not humane killed,

1745
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:52,747
and all of the animals
that are still placed

1746
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,215
on your plate have
to be slaughtered

1747
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,883
in some manner, and
so there's still

1748
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,019
a humane issue there,
but from an environmental

1749
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:01,722
standpoint, in many aspects,
raising grass fed beef

1750
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:05,760
is less sustainable than
factory fed animals,

1751
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:08,963
and the reason is, because
it's so land intensive.

1752
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:11,899
It may require eight
pounds of feed to produce

1753
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,201
one pound of an animal
product, if it were beef,

1754
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,971
but in a grass fed situation,
sometimes, it's 10 times

1755
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:20,741
that much, it may be 70,
80 times from a grass fed

1756
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,777
to a grain fed beef.

1757
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,712
Additionally, from a
climate change standpoint,

1758
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:26,714
grass fed cattle
produce 40 to 60%

1759
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:29,850
more greenhouse gas
emissions, meaning methane,

1760
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:31,786
carbon dioxide,
land use changes,

1761
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:34,088
than a grain fed cow would.

1762
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,692
- Another thing
often taken for granted

1763
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:39,794
is the depletion of our oceans.

1764
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:42,797
We often think of
fish as a never ending

1765
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:45,900
self replenishing food source,

1766
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:48,736
but the truth seems
to be quite different.

1767
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,340
- Over 90% of all the
big fish in the oceans

1768
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:54,342
are already gone.

1769
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:56,978
80% of commercial fisheries
are over exploited,

1770
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,379
or depleted.

1771
01:16:58,381 --> 01:17:01,048
The fishing fleets are
chasing the last of the fish.

1772
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,917
And have to travel
further and further away

1773
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:05,686
from the land and deeper
and deeper into the ocean

1774
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:06,887
to catch them.

1775
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:08,356
I've seen illegal
fishing in Antarctica,

1776
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:11,058
and that's as far away
from land as you can get.

1777
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:15,763
- When someone sits
down at a table,

1778
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:18,799
to eat fish or seafood
on their plate,

1779
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,836
what they're really
doing is they're eating

1780
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:25,740
a target fish that's becoming
depleted to the point

1781
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:28,376
of near extinction,
but they're also eating

1782
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:31,379
baggage comes with it,
and typically it requires

1783
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:35,750
about five to twenty
times more other seafood,

1784
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:39,887
as by-kill, and
by-kill is the term

1785
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:42,390
that relates to all
those other sea life,

1786
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:45,760
living in the ocean that
are killed in the process

1787
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,396
of trying to get that
target fish to your plate,

1788
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:51,399
whether it's with purse
seine type of fishing method,

1789
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:54,368
or long line or bottom
trawling, or middle trawling,

1790
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:57,271
our oceans are expected
to be completely

1791
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:59,807
devoid of all fish
that we recognize

1792
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:02,109
commercially today
by the year 2048.

1793
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:04,011
- The oceans are
dying, and nobody wants

1794
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,413
to know about it.

1795
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:06,814
And if the oceans die, we die.

1796
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:07,848
It's as simple as that.

1797
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,917
And if you start
destroying them,

1798
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,318
you're basically
killing out the crew,

1799
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,853
and the life support
systems going to collapse,

1800
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,088
and there won't be
any air to breathe,

1801
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,356
and there won't be
any food to eat,

1802
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:16,157
and the climate'll
be out of control,

1803
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,292
and, not a good thing.

1804
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:20,261
But we have to humble
ourselves and recognize

1805
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:23,864
that we need this diversity,
we need these creatures,

1806
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,167
we need this interdependence,
and if we don't see that,

1807
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:29,770
then our chances of
survival are quite slim.

1808
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:31,472
My big concern is not
that we're going to wipe

1809
01:18:31,474 --> 01:18:34,008
ourselves out, out of
sheer ecological stupidity,

1810
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,444
but that we're going to
take so much with us.

1811
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,916
- So much confusion,
and so much debate.

1812
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,885
That it just boggles
my mind that we can't

1813
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,787
think like third graders,
and say, "why not

1814
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,989
"just address the
number one cause here."

1815
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,027
You know, we got ten
holes in the boat,

1816
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:55,496
the boat's sinking, which
hole do we fill first?

1817
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:56,964
Go to the big hole.

1818
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:59,467
Fill that big hole first.

1819
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:01,035
- I mean, so often we're
looking at just what

1820
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,837
we would like to eat,
because it satisfies

1821
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:04,772
our taste preferences.

1822
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:05,940
Well, we're at a point in time,

1823
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,476
in order to save
humanity essentially,

1824
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:11,212
save our species, which
is not an overstatement

1825
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:14,982
at all, we need to start
looking outside of self,

1826
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:17,084
and start looking at how
our choices are fully

1827
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,053
effecting those around
us, those species

1828
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:21,288
that we share this planet with,

1829
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,057
and especially
future generations.

1830
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,763
- A couple
years back, I saw

1831
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,265
a documentary
called, earthlings,

1832
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,033
that exposed the
conditions in which

1833
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:35,803
farm animals are slaughtered.

1834
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:37,938
It made a big impact on me.

1835
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,207
I knew that animals
got killed for food,

1836
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,276
but seeing how it
actually happened,

1837
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,513
and seeing the suffering,
pain and terror

1838
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:47,414
that these animals go through,

1839
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,950
put things into a new
perspective for me.

1840
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,319
I was already eating
mostly plant-based foods

1841
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:55,322
at the time, but after
seeing those images,

1842
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,925
I decided I could not
contribute to the killing

1843
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:00,394
of innocent animals any longer.

1844
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:03,531
So I became a 100% plant eater.

1845
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:06,200
I was not in a position
to judge anybody,

1846
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:09,904
after all, I ate animals for
over 30 years of my life.

1847
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:12,406
But I wanted to understand,

1848
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:14,341
how come in this day and age,

1849
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:17,011
such a massive
genocide was allowed.

1850
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,879
And how come us, the
general population,

1851
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:22,116
government and
corporations allowed

1852
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:23,551
for this to happen?

1853
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,931
- We love some
animals, and eat others

1854
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:41,468
because we have been
born into a invisible

1855
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,337
belief system that conditions us

1856
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,540
to compartmentalize when
it comes to animals.

1857
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,008
It conditions us to
think of certain animals

1858
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,111
as edible, and other
animals as inedible.

1859
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:53,981
And the invisible belief
system that conditions

1860
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:56,951
us to eat certain animals,
is what I call carnism.

1861
01:20:56,953 --> 01:21:00,087
One way carnism
remains invisible, is
by remaining unnamed.

1862
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,022
If we don't name it, we
can't even think about it,

1863
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,024
so we can't question it.

1864
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,492
When we don't see
something, obviously,

1865
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:07,595
it becomes much
easier to maintain

1866
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:10,898
this mythology that
there is no problem,

1867
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,199
there is no atrocity.

1868
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,437
- This is not
just something to eat.

1869
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,939
This is beautiful love,

1870
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:21,308
joy, work, action.

1871
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,345
This is life.

1872
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,951
- You're think
they're just animals?

1873
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,219
They have intelligence.

1874
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,022
They have language signal.

1875
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:36,423
They have love.

1876
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:38,092
So when they are
about to face deaths,

1877
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:39,660
in a death chamber,

1878
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:42,563
they fear, and they
sad, and they anger.

1879
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,365
- You know, everybody
talks about the holocaust,

1880
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:47,534
what about the holocaust we're
creating for the animals?

1881
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:49,103
Every year, we're killing
billions and billions

1882
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:53,340
of animals, and you
want peace on earth?

1883
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,144
Peace on earth is for
all living entities,

1884
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,513
not just humans.

1885
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,653
People just got
locked up in Utah

1886
01:22:05,655 --> 01:22:08,656
for photographing a
cafo, a concentrated

1887
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:11,058
animal feeding operation.

1888
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,295
These people keeping
the people ignorant,

1889
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:16,597
and it's sick, to make money.

1890
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,132
And if the truth gets
out, if people know

1891
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:19,400
where their food came from,

1892
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,936
or how their food was produced,

1893
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,704
they wouldn't eat that shit.

1894
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,539
- When you start to
threaten the dominant

1895
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:29,209
paradigm of society,
you're going to become

1896
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:32,046
a force to be reckoned
with, and they'll do

1897
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:34,715
everything they
can to destroy you.

1898
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:36,984
And that's exactly,
that's happening now.

1899
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,410
- There are still
people who'll see that,

1900
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,412
and they'll be resistant,
i mean, I was one

1901
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,681
of those people, you
know, I grew up in Texas,

1902
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:11,051
eating beef all the time,
and I loved animals,

1903
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:12,519
I always loved the
companion animals

1904
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:14,688
I grew up with, and
you know, I never

1905
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,491
really thought much, i
thought I was eating healthy.

1906
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,526
So I think a lot of the
resistance that people feel is

1907
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:22,096
because we're so conditioned
to eat these things

1908
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:25,199
all the time, we've
been conditioned from
a very young age.

1909
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:26,667
- And even if we make the
intellectual connection,

1910
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:29,069
even if we say, "yes,
I'm eating a cow."

1911
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,238
We still don't make the
emotional connection,

1912
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,108
because if we did, we
would feel the empathy

1913
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,710
that would cause us
to feel disgusted

1914
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:39,213
rather than appetized.

1915
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:41,081
- I couldn't pretend anymore

1916
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:44,451
that was, eating that
chunk of chicken breast

1917
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:46,587
was the same as the
broccoli next to it,

1918
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:49,223
it just didn't, I couldn't,
i couldn't fake it

1919
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,225
to myself anymore.

1920
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:52,393
- And there's a
reason why, you know,

1921
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:54,628
slaughter houses,
and feed lots are not

1922
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,398
located in densely
populated areas.

1923
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,433
It's not for lack of
space, it's because people

1924
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:02,169
don't want us to see it.

1925
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,271
Then those animals
go on a long journey

1926
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,440
to the slaughter house,
at night, usually.

1927
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,243
So we don't see a lot of
that, and that's by design.

1928
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,278
- Who's to say which
animals are to be tortured,

1929
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,813
and killed?

1930
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:14,581
We've decided in America,
in our part of the world,

1931
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:18,252
cows and pigs, and
lambs are to be eaten,

1932
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:20,154
but in some parts of
the world, they eat dogs

1933
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,588
and cats, and in some
parts of the world

1934
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,290
they eat snakes and monkeys.

1935
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,159
- Yes, it's true that
people have eaten animals

1936
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:28,262
for thousands of
years, but today,

1937
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:30,264
for many people in the world,

1938
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:33,267
there's absolutely no
need to eat animals.

1939
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:36,103
You know, we are
causing, as human beings,

1940
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:40,307
massive suffering, to
other sentient beings,

1941
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:44,278
suffering that is
completely unnecessary.

1942
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,313
When eating animals is
no longer a necessity

1943
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,549
for survival, then
it becomes a choice.

1944
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,818
And choices always
stem from beliefs.

1945
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,321
- There is a
popular myth that perpetuates

1946
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:57,324
the idea that fish
don't feel any pain.

1947
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:00,227
That makes it easier for
people to consume it,

1948
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,696
since it seems to
be more humane.

1949
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:05,566
But, is it really true?

1950
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,471
- Fish have proprioception,
they have feelings.

1951
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:12,372
And so there are a
number of researchers

1952
01:25:12,374 --> 01:25:15,609
that would tell you very
clearly that it's a very

1953
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,878
uncompassionate way to
eat, you're slaughtering

1954
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,481
between one and three
trillion fish per year,

1955
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:23,784
and all of those fish
have sensory reception,

1956
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,452
they all have feelings.

1957
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,288
- The industries
depend on keeping these

1958
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,257
facts out of our consciousness.

1959
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:31,592
So for example,
we learn to resist

1960
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:34,528
taking in information
from those who

1961
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:38,198
may help us begin
to question carnism.

1962
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,600
If you shoot the
messenger, you don't have

1963
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:42,669
to take seriously the
implications of their message.

1964
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:44,872
- So we need to
educate our children

1965
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:47,241
the true meaning of
what these animals

1966
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:51,512
really are, by showing,
and by awareness about life

1967
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:54,381
of the pig or chicken is
very much same as life

1968
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:55,516
of cat and dog.

1969
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:14,301
- Our time on
this planet is very short.

1970
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,904
And change can
sometimes be difficult.

1971
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:18,438
And slow.

1972
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,674
But by taking the right steps,

1973
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:23,877
we can point ourselves
into a better direction.

1974
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,382
As for myself, this was
the most exciting journey

1975
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:29,583
I ever took.

1976
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:31,418
And I look forward
to continue living

1977
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,888
a healthy, plant-based
lifestyle with my family.

1978
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:37,291
And to keep empowering others

1979
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:38,392
with this information.

1980
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,199
- It's so important for us
to take care of ourselves.

1981
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,800
For our own human
health standpoint,

1982
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:49,369
but it really won't
matter how healthy we are

1983
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:50,904
if our planet isn't healthy.

1984
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,308
- You know what's
unique about us?

1985
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:59,346
We are the only species
out of the millions

1986
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,482
that does not live in
Harmony with nature.

1987
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,885
- At least it's good
to educate yourself

1988
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,320
and be aware, and
then you can make

1989
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:07,521
the decision from there,

1990
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:08,322
because ultimately,
it's your choice

1991
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:09,556
to make, you know.

1992
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,391
It's not like, "hey, you
know, you're the worse

1993
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,893
"person if you don't do this."

1994
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:15,462
No, it's not like that, but
at least educate yourself,

1995
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:18,265
find out, you know, so
at least you just know.

1996
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:20,834
I mean, you can make
the choices on your own.

1997
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:23,637
- I don't believe there's
an evil cabal of doctors

1998
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,440
and government people,

1999
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:28,442
I believe there's
a system in place,

2000
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:31,411
and the world is so asleep,

2001
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,413
and they've
forgotten, intuitively

2002
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:34,982
that people just
follow the system

2003
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:38,285
without thinking,
without questioning,

2004
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:39,620
and it's because they're asleep.

2005
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:40,921
It's not because
they're stupid, it's not

2006
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,856
because they're not motivated.

2007
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:45,459
- I mean, it's really insanity
when you think about it.

2008
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:48,595
That we are sitting
here, in the modern day,

2009
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,764
and we've got to talk
about eating fruits

2010
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:51,999
and vegetables.

2011
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:53,734
You know, you go back
in any time in history,

2012
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:57,004
past, say the last 100, 200
years, and it was just like

2013
01:27:57,006 --> 01:27:59,339
everyone was doing it.

2014
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:03,477
- If you want to be a
responsible steward of our

2015
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,446
precious planet, and
its' dwindling resources,

2016
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:09,683
eating a plant-based
diet really is

2017
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,485
the only solution.

2018
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,553
And by voting with your dollar,

2019
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:15,689
and eating a plant-based diet,

2020
01:28:15,691 --> 01:28:18,892
you are saying no to
animal agriculture,

2021
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:21,461
and all the devastation,
all the havoc

2022
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,063
that it's wreaking
on our planet.

2023
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:25,499
- I think that every human being

2024
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,302
wants to do good.

2025
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,439
I think that every human being,

2026
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:35,909
in their core, wants
to do what's right.

2027
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,880
And I think that
if we look at it,

2028
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:42,382
and we say, "you know what?

2029
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:46,019
"What is it that I can do today,

2030
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:48,422
"to make the environment better,

2031
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:49,623
"to make my health better,

2032
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:54,494
"and to have
compassion for animals,

2033
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,363
"for our fellow creatures.

2034
01:28:56,365 --> 01:28:58,498
"What is it that I can do today?

2035
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,435
"I can start on the path
to a plant-based diet."
