1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,499
This is my story.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,979
Right.

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,619
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
My, my, my, Delilah.

4
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,539
Why, why, why, Delilah?

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,619
I could see that girl
was no good for me

6
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,939
but I was lost like a slave
that no man could free.

7
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,339
I saw the light on the night
that I passed by her window.

8
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,299
I saw the flickering shadow
of love on her blind.

9
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,419
She was my woman.

10
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,620
As she betrayed me I watched
and went out of my mind.

11
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,099
My, my, my, Delilah.

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,699
Why, why, why, Delilah?

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,979
I could see that girl
was no good for me

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,139
but I was lost like a slave
that no man could free.

15
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,299
At break of day when that man
drove away, I was waiting.

16
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,539
I crossed the street to her
house and she opened the door.

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,299
She stood there laughing.

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,859
I felt the knife in my hand
and she laughed no more.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,939
My, my, my, Delilah.

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,899
Why, why, why, Delilah?

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,860
So before they come to
break down the door

22
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,819
forgive me Delilah, I just
couldn't take any more.

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,380
Mr. Capello?

24
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,380
Mr. Capello, my pay's short.

25
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,460
Well, you're short
so now you match.

26
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,620
I mean, it's supposed to
be £25 and it's not £25.

27
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,260
- So sue me.
- It's supposed to be £25 and it's not.

28
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,820
You're more than welcome to go and see
if Zippo's will pay you any more.

29
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,979
Now, beggar off. We're on.

30
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,500
Well, what about... cooking?

31
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,180
Cooking?
Definitely no cooking.

32
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,940
- Oh.
- Ah!

33
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,739
What, no cooking?

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,259
I told you!

35
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,899
No cooking even
with a frying pan?

36
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,260
I told you, no cooking!

37
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,179
Alright, it's a deal.
No cooking.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,860
Alright, now fuck off.

39
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,019
Nello, ladies and gentlemen!

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,820
Can I help you?

41
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,460
Yes, I'm a friend of the Bishop.

42
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,980
And... which Bishop
would that be?

43
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,020
Bishop of Keele.
Bishop of Lichfield.

44
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,020
And the Archbishop of Canterbury is
also a very good friend of mine.

45
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,179
Could you give me a lift?

46
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,380
Of course, of course. Where would
you need a lift to, exactly?

47
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,179
Stoke-on-Trent.

48
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,260
Right. Well, that's
quite a drive!

49
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,100
It is, yes. Thank you.

50
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,659
- I didn't necessarily say that I'd...
- Have you had your breakfast?

51
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,940
- I have indeed.
- Oh. I haven't.

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,419
Very nice of you to ask. Thanks.

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,420
Right.

54
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,340
Yes.

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,580
Ok.

56
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,139
Ok, thank you.

57
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,620
I can take you as
far as Dumfries

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,060
and then your mum has arranged for your
local vicar to come and get you from there.

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,420
Marvellous.

60
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,820
You've got a tow
bar, haven't you?

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,579
A tow bar?

62
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,739
Why would I need a tow bar?

63
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,699
Is there any more toast?

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,860
Should he be wandering around the
country on his own like this?

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,700
He's clearly got special
needs of some sort.

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,220
Well, he doesn't have much
trouble finding help.

67
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,980
In fact, he seems positively
blessed in that regard.

68
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,259
Is he in the habit
of doing this?

69
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,460
Well, he does seem to view the Church as
being some sort of ecclesiastical AA.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,540
Oh.

71
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,860
He says he's a good friend
of the Bishop of Lichfield.

72
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,940
Yes, that's true.

73
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,460
And the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

74
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,140
Well, if Neil says he knows
someone, then he usually does.

75
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,539
How does he get to know them?

76
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,219
By being Neil.

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,780
Thanks!

78
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,180
Oh, that's quite alright.

79
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,259
Er, would you mind signing
this before you go?

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,539
A Bible?

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,060
Are you sure?
Slightly irregular.

82
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,739
Thanks.

83
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,500
No, not the front.

84
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,900
Er, that's for Bishops
and Archbishops.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,819
There's space above that
for regular clergy.

86
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,500
Right.

87
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,339
So there is.

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,700
I've got them all in there.

89
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,500
Desmond Tutu, Terry Waite...

90
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,980
Rowan Williams,
Jimmy Greenhoff...

91
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,099
I wasn't aware Jimmy
Greenhoff had been ordained!

92
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,700
He hasn't.

93
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,620
He scored 76 goals in 274
games for Stoke City.

94
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,100
- He was marvellous.
- Right, right, well...

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,899
There you are.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,699
Thanks. Thank you.

97
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,660
Your mum'll be
pleased to see you.

98
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,379
I bet she will. I'll
be pleased to see her.

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,820
The truth is, she's not
been so well lately.

100
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,339
Right.

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,820
And I know it's hard to
think about these things

102
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,259
but your mum's not
getting any younger.

103
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,860
No, she's not.

104
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,580
None of us are.

105
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,140
And that's life.

106
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,059
So we have to make
the most of it.

107
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,980
Hiya, Mum.

108
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,579
Oh, there's a sight
for sore eyes.

109
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,660
Let me have a look at you.

110
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,300
So how have you been keeping without
me to keep any eye on you, like?

111
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,939
I've been tip-top, me. Tip-top.

112
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,459
It's a robin.

113
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,420
Oh, he's back, is he?

114
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,419
He was here last week.

115
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,820
I bet he missed you.

116
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,139
Bet he did.

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,339
That's why he's come back.

118
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,579
Neil, love.

119
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,540
When I let you join that circus,
you said they'd look after you.

120
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,460
They did look after me.

121
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,540
Just that one ringmaster
took against me.

122
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,900
It only takes one.

123
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,140
I'm nice to people and
people are nice to me.

124
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,259
And if they're not nice to me, then
they're all the people who are.

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,860
I won't be here forever.

126
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,620
Don't talk like that.

127
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,259
Well, we all die one day, Neil.

128
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,500
Until Jesus returns

129
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,060
and raises his sleeping
followers from death

130
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,740
and grants immortality
to the faithful.

131
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,260
So there you are then.

132
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,019
Jesus 1, Mary Baldwin 0.

133
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,900
I want to know that you
can look after yourself

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,980
when I'm not here
to do it any more.

135
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,100
Don't get taken advantage of.

136
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,779
- Hold down a job.
- I've got a job.

137
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,540
- You've been sacked.
- A new job.

138
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,539
At the university.

139
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,459
Oh, that's lovely.

140
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,499
When did they offer you this?

141
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,379
Tomorrow.

142
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,420
When you first came to
Keele were you nervous?

143
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,259
I'm never nervous.

144
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,827
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.

145
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,540
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Hello.

146
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,614
I'm Neil Baldwin.

147
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,900
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Alright?

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,749
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.

149
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:12,199
- Welcome to Keele University.
- Hiya.

150
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,980
Hello. I'm Neil Baldwin.
Welcome to Keele University.

151
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,380
Hiya. I'm Malcolm.
Stoke City fan?

152
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,540
I am, yes. Very much so.

153
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,180
- Are you?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,540
Yeah, I am.

155
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,820
So, do you work here, do you?

156
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,339
Yes, I think I do.

157
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,979
Ta.

158
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,499
An explanation for
perceptual error.

159
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,460
The example of the Phantom Limb is a
pretty strong refutation of the notion

160
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,819
that our perception of reality and external
reality are one and the same thing...

162
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,700
The years go by as
swiftly as a wink.

163
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,579
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

164
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,140
Is that a chaffinch?

165
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,500
What exactly is it that
you do up there, Neil?

166
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,020
At the university?

167
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,900
It is a chaffinch, you know.
It's got wing bars.

168
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,540
Neil Baldwin.

169
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,539
As much as I love birds, I will not be
knocked off-course by plumage talk.

170
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,540
What are you doing
there, at Keele?

171
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,299
All sorts.

172
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,259
And what does it pay,
this 'all sorts'?

173
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,620
Look at the birds of the air.

174
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,300
They neither sow, nor reap
nor gather into barns.

175
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,819
Yet your Heavenly
Father feeds them.

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,500
When I started work, I read
my Bible every dinner break.

177
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,300
And they made fun of me.

178
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,859
They called me Holy Mary.

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,219
I could be a vicar,
then I'd be Holy Neil.

180
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,500
Is that why you don't
want a normal job?

181
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,739
Because you're worried
they'll pick on you?

182
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,539
I like the Church of England.

183
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,220
I like performing.

184
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,140
I believe in God.

185
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,139
That does put you three up on most of the
Church of England clergy I've encountered.

186
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,780
But there are other
things you need, Neil.

187
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,619
Bifocals.

188
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,300
I was thinking qualifications.

189
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,540
- You alright, Nello?
- Hiya, Steve.

190
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,139
Wigan on Saturday!

191
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,060
Who's that?

192
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,020
Steve. He's a very
good friend of mine.

193
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,140
You've never mentioned
him before?

194
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,859
Well... I only met
him yesterday.

195
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,820
Well, the good news is they are looking
for pot dippers at Susie Cooper's.

196
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,940
I used to work for
Susie Cooper's.

197
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,180
I was the recipient of many a
compliment on my eye for colour.

198
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,100
I think our Neil's got the same.

199
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,380
Thank you, but it's not
what I'm looking for.

200
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,739
What are you looking for?

201
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,740
What would you like to do, Neil?

202
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,180
I'd like to manage Stoke City.

203
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,300
Or be a vicar. Either is fine.
I'm flexible.

204
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,780
Ok. And... what are
you qualified to do?

205
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,259
I helped the students out at Keele.
And I'm a registered clown.

206
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,540
Are you indeed?

207
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,780
What have you gone and
brought that here for?

208
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,179
That's Nello.

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,539
Did you do this?

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,700
Just look at that paintwork!

211
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,620
Not a million miles
away from ceramics.

212
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,739
That's right, he's a dab hand.

213
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,220
It's an egg of, with your make
up on, and it's registered.

214
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,580
You can sue anyone who
steals your make up.

215
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,780
I don't think Elaine wants
to hear about all that now.

216
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,540
And are there any openings
in the circus right now?

217
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,380
Not at the moment, no.

218
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,940
Charlie Cairoli's a very
good friend of mine.

219
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,660
I've got his number,
if you'd like it.

220
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,380
Just say Neil said to ring him.

221
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,940
- I meant for you.
- 0272...

222
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,300
4960725.

223
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,900
Neil!

224
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700
Sorry. He does go off on
tangents now and then.

225
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,140
But you don't think
he has any vacancies?

226
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,140
For you.

227
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,420
Er, no.

228
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,980
That's why I mentioned the
vicaring or football manager.

229
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,019
Doesn't have to be Stoke, but
I draw the line at Port Vale.

230
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,500
There are schemes to
help people into work

231
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,260
who otherwise might have...
difficulties.

232
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,299
Why are you telling me that?

233
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,699
Fruit Pastilles do not count
as fruit and you know it.

234
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,780
You'll be turning me
vegetarian if I'm not careful.

235
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,780
If in doubt when I'm not
here, ask Doris on the till.

236
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,740
She'll tell you what's
healthy and what's not.

237
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,900
Doris?

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,780
She doesn't look all
that well to me.

239
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,099
She can keep an eye out for you.

240
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,100
Looks like I should be
keeping an eye on her.

241
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,739
Oh, for goodness' sake! All I want to know
is you can stand on your own two feet!

242
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,500
It's more than my
life's worth, Neil.

243
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,739
I thought eggs
were good for you.

244
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,940
Mary, you alright, duck?

245
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,340
Yes, yes.

246
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,699
Just the price of these tinned peaches.
Taken the wind right out of me.

247
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,979
Neil.

248
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,660
I have been praying very hard
about this, and you know what?

249
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,700
I think you're ready for
a place of your own.

250
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,660
I've got a place of my own.
This place.

251
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,340
A place of your very own. Not too far away.
A little flat.

252
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,819
Move out?

253
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,020
Of my home?

254
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,780
Well, somewhere nice, you know

255
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,100
where you can start to be more...
independent

256
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
and manage, you know.

257
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,979
But I do manage.

258
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,699
When have I ever gone without?

259
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,900
Do you think it's God's will?

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,740
Well, that's a difficult one,
but I think it might be, yes.

261
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,700
Not my mum's will?

262
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,300
I think on this occasion,
as is so often the case

263
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,779
your mother's will and God's will
might be one and the same thing.

264
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,380
Is that the choir?

265
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,660
Yes. Are you joining? We're
still short of baritones.

266
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,740
I'd love to help you out more but
I've got a lot of stuff to do.

267
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,620
Oh, really?
Like what?

268
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm behind on my bird-watching.

269
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,940
The Gerry Cottle
Circus are in town.

270
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,659
I'm writing an extra verse
for the Lord's Prayer.

271
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,379
You're not joking, are you?

272
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,460
There's still half your Stoke
City programmes up there.

273
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,339
I'll come back for them.

274
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,859
All grown up, eh?
My Neil.

275
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,179
Don't worry, Mum.
I'll not forget you.

276
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,980
This is very kind
of you, Malcolm.

277
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,940
Give to him who asks you. And from him
who wants to borrow do not turn away.

278
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,980
<font color="#804040">MATTHEW</font>: 5.

279
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,900
Oh, I wouldn't say no to half
a lager at the student union.

280
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,219
<font color="#804040">MALCOLM</font>: 1.

281
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,700
You alright, Neil?

282
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,379
Yes. Let's get this over with.

283
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,819
We'll have it dark.

284
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,659
Here, Malcolm.

285
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,779
Ok.

286
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,060
Don't know how all
that came loose.

287
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,859
Not got an eagle in
there, have you?

288
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,299
What do you think of that?

289
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,060
What's the Neil Baldwin football
club when it's at home?

290
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,620
My own team.

291
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,739
Picked by me, managed
by me, captained by me.

292
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,940
- At least you can't be dropped.
- Exactly.

293
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,579
You're Vice President.

294
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,100
Am I?
Right. Not President then?

295
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,739
Gary Lineker is President. I'm just going
to write to him to tell him the good news.

296
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,780
<font color="#808080">(RADIO)</font>
In other news, Stoke City have announced...

297
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,060
the departure of their
manager, Graham Paddon

298
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,940
after just 18 games in charge.

299
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,620
The club's board thanked him for
his hard work and dedication

300
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,459
and have said they'll act quickly
to find a replacement...

301
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,499
Come in, Mark.

302
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,139
Thank you for coming.

303
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,499
I'd use my own minister but he
tends to be more in demand.

304
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,900
It is addressed to Neil.

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,459
I can see that. That's
what worries me.

306
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,300
Remember that misunderstanding around
the payment for the coach hire?

307
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,300
I do.

308
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,100
It cast a long shadow over
the Alzheimer's picnic.

309
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,140
He isn't terribly
good with money.

310
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,979
And who can forget what
Paul reminded us in Romans?

311
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,940
Indeed.

312
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,580
Owe no one anything except
to love each other.

313
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm not sure that can be applied directly
to contemporary financial transactions.

314
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,579
I want you to steam open the envelope
and tell me what's inside it.

315
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,540
I don't know about that.

316
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,340
Well, I'm a Christadelphian
but you're Church of England.

317
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,700
How's that relevant?

318
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,139
Well, firstly, Neil is Church of England so,
spiritually speaking, he is of your flock.

319
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,537
And secondly, I think of
the Church of England

320
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:09,119
as having a less rigorous
moral code than my own.

321
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,899
What's he going to do when I'm
not here to look after him?

322
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,899
We can appoint trustees.

323
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,980
And he seems to manage.

324
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,499
He has his adventures and...

325
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,979
How much is it for?

326
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,179
You might want to bear in mind you're
talking to a woman with an enlarged aorta.

327
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,499
When was your last check-up?

328
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,699
£800.

329
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,500
Oh, I should never
have let him move out!

330
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,820
- This is my fault.
- No, Mary!

331
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,700
I'm sure there's a way of
paying this by instalments.

332
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,060
- I'll go over and see him right now.
- No, he's not there!

333
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,899
He's gone up to London.

334
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,300
Right.

335
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,459
On parliamentary
business, so he said.

336
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,699
Where are you going, mate?

337
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,059
House of Commons.

338
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,019
Figures.

339
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,700
Is Tony Benn in today?

340
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,579
Couldn't tell you that, sir.

341
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,780
Well, could you not find out
if he's clocked on or not?

342
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,099
I can't move from
here, I'm afraid.

343
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,260
Could you leave him this note?

344
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,619
I'm a friend of his son,
Stephen's, from Keele University.

345
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,419
Thanks.

346
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,340
Did you really meet him?

347
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,260
Yes.

348
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,659
He was very nice to me.

349
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,420
Poor Tony.

350
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,299
Poor Tony, yes.

351
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,980
Did you mention our
drains to him?

352
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,739
He was very busy.

353
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,500
They've not been right since next door
did that paella for their ruby wedding.

354
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,739
No.

355
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,860
They were going to go barbeque

356
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,419
but the forecast was for low
pressure from the east.

357
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,220
£800!
That's not right.

358
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,419
No, it's not right, Neil.
It's not right at all!

359
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,140
I buy an electric stamp, every
week, from the Post Office. £5.

360
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,260
Neil, that only pays off £60.

361
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,820
This is the electricity
you've actually used.

362
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,300
How do you even begin
to use this much?

363
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,220
I pay a fiver a week.

364
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,220
I buy a stamp. Ask the
woman at the Post Office.

365
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,979
How do you use that much?

366
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,860
I don't.

367
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,500
The budgies do.

368
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,620
I have to keep them
warm, don't I?

369
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,260
Please tell me you don't have that two-bar
electric fire on all day and night?

370
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,419
Why shouldn't I?

371
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,099
I pay it. I buy a stamp.

372
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,299
I've got it in a book somewhere.

373
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,259
- How are we going to find £800?
- Don't worry, Mum.

374
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,020
Neil, love.

375
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,819
The whole point of you moving out was so
you could learn to manage these things.

376
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,580
I'll pay it off when I
get the Stoke City job.

377
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,419
There is no Stoke City job.

378
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,499
They appointed Lou Macari as the
new manager this dinnertime.

379
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,060
Then I'll go and see him.
First thing tomorrow.

380
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,419
And Lou Macari's going to pay
your electricity bill, is he?

381
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,499
I wouldn't have thought so.
Why would he do that?

382
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,459
God bless Dad. Look after him.

383
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,859
And God bless Mum. And let
her not worry any more.

384
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,259
God bless the students.

385
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,619
And God bless Norman Barrett
MBE, of Zippo's Circus.

386
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,019
God bless Gordon Banks.

387
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,499
God bless...

388
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,459
Ken Dodd.

389
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,500
And God bless Lou Macari

390
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,460
and help him in his task to return
Stoke City to the top division.

391
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,019
Amen.

392
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,579
Or to the play-offs, at least.

393
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,659
For like Job we have
been sorely destined.

394
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,739
Why, why, why, Delilah?

395
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,899
So before...

396
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,980
- You can take us up, Lou.
- I hope so. I really hope so.

397
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,940
No, I mean I know you will.

398
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,380
Aye, good, great. Aye. Top man.

399
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,100
I told my vicar he'll make Bishop one
day, and I'll be right about that too.

400
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,699
Aye, right, great. That's...
that's great.

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,939
- Macari!
- Macari!

402
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,780
Not been waiting out
there all day, have you?

403
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,820
I have, yeah.

404
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,140
In case you needed me, like.

405
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,900
That's very good of you, but
have you not got work to do?

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,339
I'm out of work at the moment.

407
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

408
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,460
And what's your trade?

409
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,900
Circus clown.

410
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,180
Alright.

411
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,739
And what was your act?

412
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,620
Making people happy, you know.

413
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,860
I used to get chucked off the back
of a fire engine every night.

414
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,979
So how come you got sacked?

415
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,459
Face didn't fit.

416
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,180
Night, then.

417
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,379
Night.

418
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,539
A clown, you say?

419
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,379
How do you fancy
coming to work for me?

420
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,780
Kit man?

421
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,820
It'd be great, yeah.

422
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,540
I'll have to square it with the university,
like, but I think they'll be alright with it.

423
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,700
What do you do at
the university?

424
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,980
Help them out.
With the students.

425
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,540
What, you don't get flung off the
back of a fire truck there as well?

426
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,460
No, it's not really called for.

427
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,699
I suppose not.

428
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,780
Well, I'll see you
on Monday then, aye?

429
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,979
See you Monday, Lou.

430
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,739
Top man.

431
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,699
Are you absolutely sure
you've got this right, Neil?

432
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,220
The manager of Stoke
City, Mr. Lou Macari

433
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,300
offering you, Neil
Baldwin, a job?

434
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,219
Mr. Lou Macari of Manchester
United and Scotland, yes.

435
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm starting a file on him.

436
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,460
You want a biscuit?

437
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,620
No, but you have one.
Don't make crumbs.

438
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,539
You can only just see the
pattern on the carpet as it is.

439
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,499
I know better than anyone
how much you love football.

440
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,659
I know you love
football because of me.

441
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,259
It's just that...

442
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,339
What exactly does it
entail, this job?

443
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,020
Laying out the clean kit,
picking up the dirty kit

444
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,700
taking it to the laundry.

445
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,659
Well, you had me
believing you 'til then.

446
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,899
You've never so much as picked up
a dirty sock in your lifetime.

447
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,179
Your bedroom's like the
hold in Noah's ark.

448
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,660
Are you sure you've
got that right?

449
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,180
Are you sure you've
got this right?

450
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,819
Tell the boss Nello's here.

451
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,739
What can I say? He was the
right man for the job.

452
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,499
Thank you very much.

453
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,099
Come on.

454
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,220
O ye of little faith.

455
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,899
Wherefore didst thou doubt?

456
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,899
<font color="#804040">MATTHEW</font>: 14.

457
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,020
Come on, out of the way!

458
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,820
You don't want any
more injuries!

459
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,180
Who's that?

460
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,979
New kit man.

461
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,060
Keep it tight.

462
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,860
Get in behind that lumbering
fullback of theirs.

463
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,300
Defending corners
we leave Laino up.

464
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,940
But we need to get tight on
their two big lads at corners.

465
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,979
Paddy, you stick to that big fella like
glue. Alright? Don't let him breathe.

466
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,180
First to the ball. Don't
give them time or space.

467
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,580
Now, we do that in the first 10
minutes and they won't worry us.

468
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,939
Laino. What?

469
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,259
What is it, son?

470
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,659
Oh, for fuck's sake!

471
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,940
Get in here, you!

472
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,659
What the fuck, what the fuck,
what the fucking hell is that?

473
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,180
Well done, lads. Great
stuff out there today!

474
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,140
Well played, Paddy, son.

475
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,779
Well played, lads.

476
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,499
Oh fuck off!

477
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,859
Kick him out! He's trying to cheat!
He's trying to cheat!

478
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,819
I took the head off.

479
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,140
Just in time, by
the looks of you.

480
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,179
Bloody hell, Nello. A few spuds round
you and you make a roast dinner.

481
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,420
I talked a girl out of
killing herself once.

482
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,180
Young student.

483
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,539
What, dressed as a chicken?

484
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,140
No, course not.

485
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,060
Dressed as Father Christmas.

486
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,699
Oh, right.

487
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,459
And what's that got to do
with the chicken suit?

488
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,899
Fancy dress. Good for morale.

489
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,620
Charlie Cairoli taught me that.

490
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,019
He's a very good friend of mine.

491
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,059
Just out of interest

492
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,259
what did you say to that girl
who wanted to kill herself?

493
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,859
I said, 'we've all got to go sometime,
love, but why do you have to go now'?

494
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,779
Night.

495
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,900
- Alright, gorgeous?
- Alright.

496
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,060
- Ey up, how's it going, Nello?
- Good, yeah.

497
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,939
Nello! Nello!

498
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,620
Alright, mong?

499
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,939
Make sure that tea's ready
and waiting for tomorrow.

500
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,860
I'm not a mong.

501
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,299
I'm a registered clown.

502
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,380
That was a bit harsh.

503
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,539
You've got to carry on.

504
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,340
Didn't you feel he
was picking on you?

505
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,940
Because of your difficulties?

506
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,179
What difficulties?

507
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,299
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
O Lord my God

508
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:41,499
when I in awesome wonder consider
all the works thy hand hath made

509
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,540
I see the stars

510
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,620
I hear the mighty thunder

511
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,139
thy power throughout the
universe displayed.

512
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,139
Then sings my soul, my
Saviour God, to thee

513
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,179
how great thou art,
how great thou art!

514
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,499
Then sings my soul, my
Saviour God, to thee

515
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:31,379
how great thou art,
how great thou art!

516
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,579
You fat bastard!
You fat bastard!

517
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:56,020
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur

518
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:03,539
and hear the brook, and
feel the gentle breeze.

519
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,059
Then sings my soul, my
Saviour God, to thee...

520
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,099
- A shock signing?
- Well, he's a bit of an unknown quantity.

521
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,940
I don't even really want
to reveal his name.

522
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,780
Er, we'll let him do his
own talking on the pitch.

523
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,140
And he'll be given an opportunity
at pre-season matches.

524
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,299
We've got to get
some weight off him.

525
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,260
Er, he's not in the
best of condition.

526
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,419
But you know, I put my head
on the chopping block and...

527
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,740
and have taken that opportunity
and brought him here.

528
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,660
Let's just see what
lies ahead, Ivan.

529
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,659
Let's just take it
from game to game.

530
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,619
Well, he's, er...
He's Neil, isn't he?

531
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,539
You know what I mean.

532
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,339
I know. Neil, my son. Yes.

533
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,420
But he's just great
to have around.

534
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,340
He's, er, well, he's funny.

535
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,580
He doesn't always mean to be.

536
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,899
Aye, well that does make
it a wee bit funnier.

537
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,980
If you don't mind me saying.

538
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,739
No, not at all.

539
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,620
Couldn't fucking turn on
a fucking manhole cover.

540
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,139
You've got love handles like my
missus and she's six months pregnant!

541
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,699
Alright, Nello, got a
fucking brew on, or what?

542
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,619
Sorry about that, Mrs. Baldwin.

543
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,020
Where were we?

544
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,899
You were telling me why
you've given my Neil a job.

545
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,859
Well, he's... he's genuine.

546
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,420
He doesn't have an angle.

547
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,220
And you go a long way in this game
to find a bloke without an angle.

548
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,300
And the fact that...

549
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,980
well, that he isn't perhaps
as quick on the uptake...

550
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,540
Quick on the uptake?

551
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,140
We're talking about footballers
here, Mrs. Baldwin.

552
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,619
It's not exactly University
Challenge out there.

553
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,180
Even so, I had thought...

554
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,740
Well...

555
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,059
I won't be around forever, and I
have to be sure he'll be alright.

556
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,020
Of course.

557
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,900
What mother wouldn't want that?

558
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,820
I had put his name down for a monastery,
for when I'm not here, to keep an eye.

559
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,100
He seemed to like it there.

560
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,660
A monastery?

561
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,020
Neil?

562
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,980
Your son belongs in a
changing room, Mrs. Baldwin.

563
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,019
He loves it here.
And we love him.

564
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,979
God, he gives us all a lift.
And he's... indispensable.

565
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,140
- Paddy.
- Yes, boss.

566
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,020
You'll do for me, young man.

567
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,340
Thanks, boss.

568
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,380
- Laino.
- Yes, boss.

569
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,060
Just play.

570
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,540
How should I play, boss?

571
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,700
Play well.

572
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,380
And as for you, Thumper.

573
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,940
Bomber, boss.

574
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,699
I think you'll find Thumper's the
name of the rabbit in Bambi.

575
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,500
I'm the boss.

576
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,100
If I call you Thumper,
your name's Thumper.

577
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,500
Right, boss.

578
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,580
Let's just play the game right.

579
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,380
And the main thing is this

580
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,659
this is what you've got
to get into your noggins.

581
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,779
The main thing is: Go out there and
score more goals than the other team.

582
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,340
Thanks, Nello.

583
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,819
Was that supposed to be me, aye?

584
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,620
Brian Clough, boss.

585
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,299
Oh right. Cloughy.

00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,460
3 - 0, not surprised!

589

There might be a

590
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,940
It's the boat race. I
never miss the boat race.

591
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,620
Can't you tape it?

592
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,500
I don't watch it on the telly.

593
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,259
I'm on the river.

594
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,860
You might need to lose some
weight if you're coxing.

595
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm not in the crews.

596
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,620
I'm on the launch behind
with the umpire and that.

597
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,180
Hi, Neil.

598
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,100
Hiya, Molly.

599
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,379
How'd you wangle that?

600
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,540
I just asked.

601
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,460
You can't just get
things by asking.

602
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,139
Can't you?

603
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,820
I can.

604
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,740
Great win Saturday, Nello!

605
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,019
Up the Potters, Farouq!

606
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,340
Why would they let you
on the umpire's launch?

607
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,979
Tradition.

608
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,260
Hey, Nello. How long are you going
to be with those fucking pads?

609
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,260
Sort your own pads out.

610
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,300
Yes, Nello!
Get in there!

611
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,380
You tell him, lad!
You have him!

612

You flash bastard!

613
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,020
Did you put your wife's knickers
on by mistake this morning

614
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,100
or is there something
you want to tell us?

615
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,139
These are pure silk boxer
shorts, these, boss.

616
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,420
Kendall Mills, Deansgate.

617
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,580
If you're spending that much on
underpants I'm paying you too much.

618
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,060
Valuable cargo.

619
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,699
Can't keep the crown jewels
in a cornflakes box.

620
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,019
Hey, how much do you spend
on your underpants, Nello?

621
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,540
Nothing.

622
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,540
My mum buys them for me.

623
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,500
Very wise.

624
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,419
Might be because you're protecting
as little as possible, mate.

625
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,380
Well.

626
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,500
They weren't very nice to you.

627
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,779
There's always banter.

628
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,620
Nello. Nello!

629
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,899
Yes, boss?

630
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,779
Have you put on weight?

631
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,580
A bit.

632
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,340
Your mother will kill me.

633
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,899
I promised her I'd
help you lose weight.

634
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,180
Hey, come on!
Laino, I told you!

635
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,659
First touch!
First touch!

636
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,900
Where the fuck are
my boxer shorts?

637
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,340
Which one of you
bastards has had them?

638
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,740
Sixty fucking quid's worth.
That must be a blow.

639
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,220
Hang on!

640
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,940
My pants have gone too.
What the fuck!

641
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,620
Some thieving YTS lad has definitely
had them off. Million percent.

642
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,900
Yeah, that'll be it, yeah.

643
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,340
Those YTS boys, they'll steal
anything that isn't nailed down.

644
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,139
Who asked you?

645
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,099
No. No, Nello, you haven't?

646
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,859
Yours are on the bottom, and
they're a waste of money.

647
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,100
They're chafing right
up my undercarriage.

648
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,699
Oh fuck!

649
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,619
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
My, my, my, Delilah!

650
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,220
Why, why, why, Delilah?

651
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,820
So before they come to
break down the door

652
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,499
forgive me Delilah, I just
couldn't take any more.

653
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:08,259
So before they come to
break down the door

654
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,419
forgive me Delilah, I just
couldn't take any more.

655
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,219
Mum?

656
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,420
- Her eyes aren't what they were.
- Mary, can you watch this light for me?

657
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,179
She has bifocals.

658
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,620
Do you know where you are?

659
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,180
I don't think either
of them are right.

660
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,779
Do you know where you are?

661
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,340
- My dad died here.
- Hold my hand, Mrs. Baldwin.

662
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,140
- When he was young.
- Can you grip it tight?

663
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,900
And I was young too.

664
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,680
- That's good.
- I did very well.

665
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:03,619
And the other hand, can
you do that one too?

666
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,460
She has bifocals.

667
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,580
She's very healthy.
I'm not so healthy.

668
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,860
She eats salad. I eat chips.

669
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,540
She's always telling me.

670
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,260
We're going to get a consultant
down to look at her.

671
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,020
I'd rather it was a doctor.

672
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,940
He's better than a doctor.

673
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,260
When will I take her home?
I have to call a taxi.

674
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,860
She won't be going home tonight, I'm afraid.
She really is very poorly right now.

675
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,660
She is, isn't she?

676
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,780
I think we need to get that
consultant right away.

677
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,300
Yes, he's busy, but he'll be
right down as soon as possible.

678
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,019
Is it Mr. Saeed?

679
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,260
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Why, do you know him?

680
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,540
He's a very good friend of mine.

681
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,820
Neil.

682
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,940
How are you?
Everything ok?

683
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,340
Very well, thank you.

684
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,060
Are we going to beat
Portsmouth on Saturday?

685
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,700
If Laino's fit, we
can beat anyone.

686
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,660
I love your attitude. This
man is a force for good.

687
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,020
Has my registrar been
looking after you?

688
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,859
He's very young.

689
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,980
My mum has had an episode.

690
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,340
Ok.

691
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,420
Ok, well, let's see what
we can do, shall we?

692
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,180
Have you ordered a CT scan?

693
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,979
Bloods? BP? Come on,
what's been keeping you?

694
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,659
Ok.

695
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,579
Let's go and have a
look at her, shall we?

696
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,019
<font color="#808080">(ON TELEVISION)</font>
Third somersault... short.

697
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,963
That's the boner that cost me the triple.
Not big, but fatal.

698
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,731
That's why we're gonna start from the
beginning and make each move perfect

699
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:30,063
before we go onto the next.
I'll run it again for you.

700
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,860
Ey up, Nello!
How's it going?

701
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,260
Shocking.

702
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,180
Is Laino going to be
fit for Saturday?

703
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,060
Course he is, yeah.

704
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,139
Don't worry about that.

705
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,139
Thanks.

706
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,580
Now Neil, your mum has
had a heart attack.

707
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,540
And that is why the oxygen
isn't getting to her brain.

708
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,899
And that is why she's confused.

709
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,979
A heart attack. Yes.

710
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,459
So you are going to have to be strong for
your mum now because she needs you to be.

711
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,940
I'll pray for her.

712
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,939
That'd be a good idea.

713
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,540
And I'll visit.

714
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,980
Also good.

715
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,260
I'll get the Christadelphians
to pray for her too.

716
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,580
Excellent idea.

717
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,619
And you. At the temple.

718
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,140
More the merrier.
That's what I say.

719
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,739
Very wise.

720
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,420
Have her home in no time, eh?

721
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,259
Well, there is a possibility, Neil, that
she might not be able to come home.

722
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,099
Her health hasn't been very good
for a while now, as you know.

723
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,900
Social Services think they may have to
find her somewhere where she can live

724
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,059
and be looked after.

725
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,819
- Do you understand?
- I do. Yes.

726
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,939
Have her home in no time, eh?

727
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,539
Morning, boss.

728
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,380
You take as much time
off as you need, Neil.

729
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,660
Alright?

730
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,100
There's nothing more important
than your mother's health.

731
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,299
I don't need to take any time off.
She's going to get better.

732
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,779
How do you do it, Nello?

733
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,939
How do you stay so positive?

734
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,379
I've always wanted to be
happy so I decided to be.

735
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,579
Brilliant.

736
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,059
I'm going to write some
of this stuff down!

737
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,499
If bad things happen, you
think about good things.

738
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,059
Like what?

739
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,100
Like...

740
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,019
Best signing you ever made.

741
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,299
Oh.

742
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,939
I wouldn't know where to start.

743
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,619
With the shorts.

744
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,380
The cleaner the shorts
the better the player.

745
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,379
It means they've stayed
on their feet longer.

746
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,819
Well, if you don't mind me saying, that's
very much a kit man's point of view.

747
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,699
Cloughy thought it too.

748
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,979
Oh, so now I'm arguing with
you and Cloughy, am I?

749
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,339
I'm assuming the budgie's not
part of the food shop, son.

750
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,340
It's for me.

751
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,139
The man at the pet shop
gave me a discount.

752
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,779
I've got your shopping.

753
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,059
Did you not take a list, Neil?
I gave you a list.

754
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,420
I did it from memory.

755
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,219
Oh. Whose memory's this?

756
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,620
Not mine, that's for certain.

757
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,380
I've never eaten any of
this stuff in my life!

758
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,860
What did you pay for all this?

759
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,940
Wasn't Doris on?

760
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,500
- I've got it here somewhere.
- It doesn't matter really.

761
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,660
Just take the list
next time, will you?

762
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,699
I'll write you a new one.

763
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,299
Fetch me the writing pad.

764
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,099
I've been keeping my
flat clean as well.

765
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,659
Good.

766
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,660
What about you?

767
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,380
When did you last have a shave?

768
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,500
I'm going to call him Macari.

769
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,700
Who?

770
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,259
My budgie.

771
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,099
I'm going to call him
Macari, after Lou Macari.

772
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,459
Right.

773
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,099
Everything has to start
and end with love.

774
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,019
It's a simple message, but one
that we can forget all too easily.

775
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,699
Now, as it says in
<font color="#804040">CORINTHIANS</font>: 1.

776
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,299
'If I speak in the tongues of mortals
and angels but do not have love'

777
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,339
'I am a noisy gong
or clashing cymbal.'

778
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,619
Now I think we've all encountered one
or two noisy gongs in our lives.

779
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,220
You are looking after
yourself, aren't you, Neil?

780
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,459
Yes, I am.

781
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,179
I always have.

782
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,340
Well, with your mum
in the home and so on

783
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,579
I can't help noticing... well...

784
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,180
I think you need to maybe
take extra care of yourself.

785
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,059
So your mum doesn't worry
too much about you.

786
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,300
I've got the Lord.

787
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,139
You have indeed.

788
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,140
I've got the students.

789
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,020
Yes.

790
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,179
I've got Stoke City
and I've got my mum.

791
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,979
What I want you to
think about, Neil

792
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,140
is what you would do

793
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,379
if one of them wasn't there.

794
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,299
Well, I'd probably have the time
to join the choir, for a start.

795
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,219
Right.

796
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,020
Right!

797
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,419
Are you feeling better for
our little chat, Mark?

798
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,379
Yes.

799
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,299
Thank you, Neil.

800
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,900
<font color="#808080">(ON TELEVISION)</font>
Police would like to talk to anyone

801
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,420
who was in the area in the
early hours of Sunday morning.

802
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,500
More on that breaking story now.

803
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,740
We go over to the
Victoria ground

804
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,860
where Lou Macari has resigned
as Stoke City manager

805
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,740
to take up the vacant
post at Glasgow Celtic.

806
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,779
The club have said they have already begun
their search for a first-class successor.

807
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,980
I've no comments
to make right now.

808
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,820
But, erm, there'll be a
press conference later on.

809
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,939
So you can check that out,
see how we go. Alright?

810
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,580
During his time at the club.

811
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,619
Macari took the Potters to the
play-offs, automatic promotion...

812
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,019
Nello.

813
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,659
When Celtic come calling, a Glasgow
boy like me has to say yes.

814
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,499
I know that, yes.

815
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:03,219
And whoever takes over here, I bet
they'll find you as valuable as I did.

816
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,580
Do you want me to come?
To Celtic?

817
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,340
Oh, I'd love you to.

818
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,779
But I think you're Stoke,
through and through.

819
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,860
And I think the Rangers
fans might eat you alive.

820
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,059
You're right. I'll stay put.

821
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,019
With my mum in the
home and that.

822
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,299
She depends on me for shopping.

823
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,939
Exactly.

824
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,300
So no hard feelings then?

825
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,139
No hard feelings.

826
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,220
Are you staying on for
Tommo's testimonial?

827
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,539
Oh, I can do better than that.
I'm putting you on the bench.

828
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,780
I'm always on the bench.

829
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,179
Well, that isn't what I mean.

830
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,219
Come with me.

831
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,979
Midfielder or striker?

832
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,980
Oh, er, I haven't
thought about that yet.

833
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,860
I'm not as quick as I was.

834
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,540
Oh, I daresay.

835
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,340
But the first two yards are
in the head, eh, boss?

836
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,339
Exactly.

837
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,339
Don't be late, Baldwin.

838
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,579
No, boss.

839
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,939
I'll be there.

840
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,419
Hiya, Mum.

841
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,340
I see you've had a shave.
That's something.

842
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,460
Aye.

843
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,100
I've done all your
errands and all.

844
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,380
Have you now?

845
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,700
Can't have everything,
I suppose.

846
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,340
Skimmed milk.

847
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,500
Because it's good for
your faulty ticker.

848
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,020
Rice pudding.

849
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,020
Bananas.

850
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,140
The apples are tough on your
dentures at this time of year.

851
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,420
And a packet of
Immodium for your...

852
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,139
My indigestion, thank you.

853
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,579
Well, well, well.

854
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,419
You could do it after all.

855
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,739
I met Ken Dodd again last week.

856
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,779
He's a very good friend of mine.

857
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,779
The woman that runs
it, this place, like

858
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,980
she wants me to come in as Nello
the clown tomorrow. So I will.

859
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,620
That'll cheer everyone up.

860
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:03,220
I asked her if I could bring you
a canary and she said certainly.

861
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,460
I'll fetch you one in.

862
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,579
You're a good lad, Neil.

863
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,419
You know that business where
you wanted to be a vicar?

864
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,820
That's all water under
the bridge now, mum.

865
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,660
I didn't want to be bothered with
doing a degree and what have you.

866
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,460
I know, son, but...

867
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,260
I didn't want you thinking that I didn't
think you could do anything you wanted.

868
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,139
Anything at all.

869
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,499
I'm playing for
Stoke City tonight.

870
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,979
Come on, Mum. It's
only a testimonial.

871
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,860
Don't go just yet.

872
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,940
No, I won't.

873
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,859
Stay and hold my
hand a while, eh?

874
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,739
Course.

875
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,420
They used to call me
Holy Mary, you know.

876
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,059
I know, Mum. I know.

877
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,779
I'm very proud of you.

878
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,019
Nello. Go and warm up.

879
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,779
Nello!
Nello! Nello!

880
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,539
Paddy, get over here!

881
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,340
I'm going to bring
Nello on, right?

882
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,179
When he gets in the penalty
area, everybody get out.

883
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,060
Let him score, ok?

884
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,740
Now, tell our lads, and
tell the Villa lads too.

885
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,100
Alright, boss.

886
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,699
Nello, get over here.
You're going on.

887
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,500
Now, just hang about in the
penalty area, alright?

888
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,700
And cause them problems.

889
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,740
How do I do that?

890
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,140
Well you're causing me a problem just
looking at you so it shouldn't be too hard.

891
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,940
Ok, boss.

892
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,020
Anything comes near you, you hit it.
Alright?

893
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,020
Right-o, like a brick out-house?

894
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,660
No, no, I mean the ball,
not the other players.

895
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,700
Alright.

896
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,859
Hey.

897
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,860
Score one for your mum, Nello.

898
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,620
Ok?

899
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,739
Ok, yeah. She'll like that.

900
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,500
Good luck, Nello!

901
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,060
Well played, Thumper.

902
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,659
It's Bomber. Like a plane or something.
Not Thumper!

903
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,540
This really happened,
by the way.

904
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,540
Did it?

905
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,259
Yeah it actually did. How
could I let the fans down?

906
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,900
Did it really happen like that?

907
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,779
No.

908
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,900
Come on, Nello. Cheer up, mate.

909
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,580
It's only a fucking testimonial.

910
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,139
I think it must have hit a
bobble before I hit it.

911
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,179
Sorry I let you down, boss.

912
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,139
What?

913
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,820
- When did you let me down?
- Tonight.

914
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,420
After I slipped my marker.

915
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,620
I should've buried it.

916
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,660
I don't think slipping your
marker was the problem, Neil.

917
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,499
I think maybe when
you fell over.

918
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,380
The first time?

919
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,539
Well, to be honest, I don't think
the second time helped either.

920
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,540
I skived the shot
a bit, didn't I?

921
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,780
Aye, just a wee bit.

922
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,980
I think the ball's
still rising now.

923
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,380
I think Jodrell Bank
has just picked it up.

924
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,699
Must've hit a bobble.

925
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,180
Blinking groundsmen.

926
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,700
Happens to the best of us.

927
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,660
I wouldn't let it worry you.

928
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,339
All the best, boss.

929
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,459
It was you, by the way.

930
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,299
What was?

931
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,939
Remember when you asked me who the
best signing I'd ever made was?

932
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,179
It was you, mate.

933
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,539
No contest.

934
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,260
- Neil.
- You hadn't forgotten, had you?

935
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,540
I said I'd come as
Nello, and I did.

936
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,220
I bought a canary too.

937
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,020
It's not part of the
act, it's for my mum.

938
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,179
Could you come into the
office for a minute, duck?

939
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,299
It was very peaceful.

940
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,540
Yes.

941
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,740
She died in her sleep.

942
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,379
And she died proud of you.

943
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,499
We went in this morning
and found her.

944
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,739
This morning?

945
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,859
That's right.

946
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,539
I rang this morning.

947
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,820
We wanted to tell you in person.

948
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,219
We thought it was
better that way.

949
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,299
She didn't want me to leave.

950
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,339
Last night.

951
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,059
When I had to get my bus, she...
she didn't want me to leave.

952
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,499
- Morning.
- Hiya.

953
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,059
There aren't many mums who'd let their
sons run off to join the circus.

954
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,859
But my mum did.

955
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,900
And she used to worry about my weight
and she tried to give me salad.

956
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,540
But she meant well.

957
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,700
And after my dad died

958
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,140
we were a team.

959
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,100
Like Stoke City.

960
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,980
We were a team.

961
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,900
And she worried about me.

962
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,220
And she didn't have
to worry about me.

963
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,019
But she did anyway.

964
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,420
And she taught me good manners.

965
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,219
And that it's good to
be nice to people.

966
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,859
And that's what I try to be.

967
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,980
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

968
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:57,859
Thank you for coming.

969
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,660
Anything you need,
Neil, call me.

970
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,260
I'm doing well,
though, aren't I?

971
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,340
You're doing very well, yes.

972
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,779
I suppose I've got time
for the choir now.

973
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,740
Why not?

974
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,300
You ok for a lift?

975
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,299
You're coming with
me, aren't you?

976
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,860
Am I?

977
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,860
Oh... right!

978
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,619
Mary would have loved
the service today.

979
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,739
I'm doing well,
though, aren't I?

980
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,620
You are, Neil.

981
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,219
You really are.

982
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:43,020

in pastures green he leadeth me

983
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,659

01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:59,220

01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,979
How much did you say it was?

992
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,899
£8.27.

993
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,179
Is Doris not in?

994
01:13:54,240 --> 01:14:01,539
SINGING My table
Thou has furnished

995
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:08,939
in presence of my foes.

996
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:17,420
My head Thou dost
with oil anoint

997
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:23,859
and my cup overflows.

998
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,020
Neil!

999
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,579
Neil.

1000
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,979
- Are you going already?
- Yes.

1001
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,580
- How are you coping?
- I'm coping well, yes.

1002
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,179
I'm doing well, aren't I?

1003
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,980
That's it.

1004
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,699
In you go.

1005
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,739
In you go. That's it.

1006
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,539
Say hello.

1007
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,540
Sorry. Excuse me.

1008
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,459
Sorry.

1009
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,700
How've you been keeping?

1010
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,900
I'm doing well, everybody says.

1011
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,179
I've brought you a
bit of shopping.

1012
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,219
Thanks.

1013
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,340
I'm a bit worried about
you, to be honest.

1014
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,419
Haven't seen you at the match
the last three home games.

1015
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,900
I've been busy.

1016
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,260
Right.

1017
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,979
- Life goes on.
- Right.

1018
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,980
And I'm doing well.

1019
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,939
So you keep saying.

1020
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,179
How are the birds doing?

1021
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,340
They're doing well, yeah.

1022
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,459
Is that a new one?
The white one?

1023
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,820
It's a budgie from Zippo's.

1024
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,780
Norman Barrett give it me.

1025
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,700
It used to be part of his
act but it's retired now.

1026
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,899
Bloody hell, Neil. Even your
budgies are celebrities.

1027
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,780
Right. Freshers week
starts on Monday.

1028
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,260
You've got to get down there, snap up
the good players for Neil Baldwin FC.

1029
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,539
I don't know if I'll bother this time.
My hip's been playing me up.

1030
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,860
You know your mum would want you
to get out there, don't you?

1031
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,540
Doing what you're best at.

1032
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,579
Meeting people and that.

1033
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,380
She would. That's true.

1034
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,220
No time like the present.

1035
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,859
I don't know about that.

1036
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,539
I've heard the Union are
doing 2-for-1 hot dogs...

1037
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,539
Does that include onions?

1038
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,859
I should imagine so, yeah.

1039
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,180
Neil!

1040
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,020
What are you doing here,
this time of night?

1041
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,659
Waiting for my lift.

1042
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,779
Looks like they forgot.

1043
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,939
Come on.

1044
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,300
You shouldn't be hanging around on
your own at this time of night.

1045
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,700
I wasn't hanging around, I
was waiting for a lift.

1046
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,420
Which didn't come!

1047
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,539
No, but you did.

1048
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,099
What would you have done
if I hadn't turned up?

1049
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,780
You did turn up,
though, didn't you?

1050
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,779
I know. But what if I hadn't?

1051
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,979
Somebody would've turned up.

1052
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,860
You can't go through life relying
on something just turning up.

1053
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:23,900
Yes you can.

1054
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,099
Well, I can, anyway.

1055
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,740
Hiya, Gary?

1056
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,980
You don't actually know me, but I'm
calling on behalf of Neil Baldwin.

1057
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,180
He's a very good friend of mine

1058
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,140
and I just wondered if you'd be kind
enough to do us a huge favour...

1059
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,500
When do we play?

1060
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,740
Training every Sunday,
matches Wednesday afternoon.

1061
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,380
Right. Well, I play
central midfield.

1062
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,940
Oh, you play where I
tell you to play.

1063
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,900
I had trials for
Macclesfield Town.

1064
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,059
The problem is, son, I
play central midfield.

1065
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,099
This is a wind-up, right?

1066
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,380
I'm just the club
president, son.

1067
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,300
It's the gaffer who
makes the decisions.

1068
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,020
See.

1069
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,299
Right.

1070
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,420
Thanks a lot.

1071
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,459
- Yeah, thanks.
- See you at the weekend.

1072
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,540
You, young man.

1073
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,940
This is a ball.

1074
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,180
All you've got to do is stick that in
the back of the net. It's that simple.

1075
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,300
Neil.

1076
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,820
We're only playing
the Christian Union.

1077
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,060
That's part of the problem.

1078
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,739
They've got the
Lord on their side.

1079
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,739
You going to finish that pasty?

1080
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,460
Fitness problem, you have.

1081
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,779
I'm going to come on
in the second half.

1082
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,899
And play centre midfield.

1083
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,500
Eh, I played for Stoke City.

1084
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,100
Let's never forget that.

1085
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,740
No, I don't suppose
anybody ever will.

1086
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,340
I thought you said
you'd got a ref.

1087
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,820
He'll be here.

1088
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,739
Oh, it's not that lad
from Islamic Soc, is it?

1089
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,700
It looks like a strong wind
would blow that guy over.

1090
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,580
Premiership quality this time.

1091
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,820
Oh, right, premiership?

1092
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,179
Hi, Neil!

1093
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,580
Uriah!

1094
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,620
- How are you?
- Alright, Uriah.

1095
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,300
Good to see you.

1096
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,021
This is Uriah Rennie, everyone.
Uriah Rennie.

1097
01:21:14,121 --> 01:21:15,380
- Hi.
- Alright, mate?

1098
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,460
- Alright, Uriah?
- I'm good, mate. How are you?

1099
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,139
Good to see you.

1100
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,300
It's Uriah Rennie.

1101
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:28,060
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think.

1102
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:34,859
Enjoy yourself, while
you're still in the pink.

1103
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:41,179
The years go by as
quickly as a wink.

1104
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,939
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

1105
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:54,779
You worry when the weather's
cold, you worry when it's hot.

1106
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:02,099
You worry when you're doing well,
you worry when you're not.

1107
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:08,579
It's worry, worry, all the time,
you don't know how to laugh!

1108
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:15,299
You'll think of something funny
when they write your epitaph.

1109
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,899
Enjoy yourself, it's
later than you think...

1110
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,019
- Take it again, you're off your line.
- What? There is no line!

1111
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,019
Right, I'm booking
it for this end.

1112
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:35,739
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
The years go by as quickly as a wink.

1113
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:42,339
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself,
it's later than you think!

1114
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,940
<font color="#808080">(COMMENTARY)</font>
Good one-two... And a good shot! What a goal!

1115
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,459
What a goal!

1116
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,259
Nello!
Nello! Nello!

1117
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,739
Then he ordered the crowds
to sit down on the grass.

1118
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,860
Taking the five loaves
and the two fish

1119
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,219
he looked up to
heaven and blessed...

1120
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,139
and broke the loaves and
gave them to the disciples.

1121
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,339
And the disciples gave
them to the crowds.

1122
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,619
And all ate and were filled.

1123
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,259
One of my favourites, feeding
of the five thousand.

1124
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,819
Now, why doesn't that
surprise me, Neil?

1125
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,539
Never trust a man who
doesn't like his food.

1126
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,100
I'm glad you enjoyed the sermon.

1127
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,019
I always enjoyed your sermons.

1128
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,099
That's why I told you you'd
make Bishop one day.

1129
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,580
It was like the first
time I saw Mark Stein.

1130
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,660
I knew he was special too.

1131
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,780
Mark Stein?

1132
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,899
33 goals in 57 matches.

1133
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,619
I made you a card.

1134
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,460
To say well done, like.

1135
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,259
Thank you, Neil.

1136
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,899
Thank you.

1137
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,419
That means a lot.

1138
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,979
And I've got a cockatoo.

1139
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,940
Oh, no presents. I insist.

1140
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,419
- The card is more than enough.
- No, no, no.

1141
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,860
The cockatoo is for me.

1142
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,620
Fossett's Circus give it me.

1143
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,219
It's got something wrong with its foot
so it's not cut out for show business.

1144
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,539
It lands on my head every
night, without fail.

1145
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,500
He said he give it me because he
knew I'd look after it, and I will.

1146
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,100
I'm sure you will.

1147
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,059
Your mum always said you had a real
knack for looking after animals.

1148
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,939
She was proud of me, you know.
My mum.

1149
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,339
She was, Neil.

1150
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,699
She was indeed.

1151
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,220
Can you drop me off on the way?

1152
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,780
Well, it's not really on my way.

1153
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,380
It is if you go that
way to drop me off.

1154
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,939
Yes, of course, of course.

1155
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:50,059
Can we stop off at the Co-op? I've
got a spot of shopping to do.

1156
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,059
Why not?

1157
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,779
Why not.

1158
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,299
<font color="#808080">(SINGING)</font>
One Neil Baldwin!

1159
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,979
There's only one Neil Baldwin!

1160
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,819
One Neil Baldwin! Etc.

1161
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,999
One Neil Baldwin!

1162
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,499
There's only one Neil Baldwin!

1163
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:16,599
