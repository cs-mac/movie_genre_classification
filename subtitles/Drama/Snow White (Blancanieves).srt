1
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:06,693
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>in deep winter,

2
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,779
<i>a queen was admiring</i>
<i>the falling snow

3
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:13,408
<i>when she saw a rose</i>
<i>blooming in defiance</i>
<i>of the cold.

4
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,203
<i>Reaching for it,</i>
<i>she pricked her finger

5
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:19,998
<i>and three drops of blood fell.

6
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:27,255
<i>And because the red</i>
<i>seemed so alive</i>
<i>against the white

7
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,925
<i>she thought,</i>
<i>"If only I had a child</i>
<i>as white as snow,

8
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,430
<i>"lips as red as blood,</i>
<i>hair as black</i>
<i>as a raven's wings

9
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:39,058
<i>"and all with the</i>
<i>strength of that rose."

10
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:45,773
<i>Soon after, a daughter</i>
<i>was born to the Queen

11
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,402
<i>and was named,</i>
<i>"Snow White."

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,407
<i>And she was adored</i>
<i>throughout the kingdom

13
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:58,953
<i>as much</i>
<i>for her defiant spirit</i>
<i>as for her beauty.

14
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,944
We found it
in the woods.

15
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,322
It's injured, Mother.

16
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,407
It must have
broken its wing.

17
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,244
Don't worry,
it will heal in time.

18
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,579
I'll look after it.

19
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,415
You possess
a rare beauty,
my love.

20
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,418
In here.

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,504
Never lose it.

22
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,256
It will serve you well
when you become queen.

23
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,309
Be careful
you don't fall.

24
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,769
I'm just
getting you an apple.

25
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,854
Here you go.
Thank you.

26
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,189
William!

27
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,942
William!

28
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,574
<i>The next winter was</i>
<i>the harshest in memory

29
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,994
<i>and Snow White's mother</i>
<i>passed away.

30
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,790
<i>The King was inconsolable.

31
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>Taking advantage</i>
<i>of his grief,

32
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,420
<i>a dark and mysterious</i>
<i>army appeared

33
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,255
<i>and lured him into battle.

34
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,825
What devil
spawned this army?

35
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,410
Send them back to hell!

36
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:03,911
No prisoners!

37
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,393
<i>The dark army</i>
<i>was defeated,

38
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,939
<i>but what would</i>
<i>soon come to pass</i>
<i>was far darker.

39
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,106
Sire!

40
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,656
A prisoner.

41
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,244
Fear not,

42
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,579
you will come to no harm
from me or my men.

43
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,291
What is your name,
my lady?

44
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,129
Ravenna, sire.

45
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,553
<i>So enchanted</i>
<i>by her beauty</i>
<i>was the King

46
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,348
<i>that he forgot,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>
<i>his broken heart

47
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,894
<i>and the very next day,</i>
<i>she would become his wife.

48
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,273
You're so beautiful.

49
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,608
That's kind, child.

50
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,279
Especially when
it is said that yours

51
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,573
is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.

52
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,324
Come.

53
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,413
This all must be
difficult for you.

54
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,084
I, too, lost my mother
when I was a young girl.

55
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:18,462
I can never take
your mother's place.

56
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,881
Never.

57
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,925
But I feel that
you and I are bound.

58
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,430
I feel it there.

59
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,266
Your heart.

60
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,151
You will be
the ruin of me.

61
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,904
Indeed, my lord.

62
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,745
I was ruined
by a king like you once.

63
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,960
I replaced his queen,

64
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,879
an old woman.

65
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:47,885
And, in time,
I, too, would have
been replaced.

66
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,056
Men use women.

67
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:58,813
They ruin us and
when they are
finished with us

68
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,068
they toss us to the dogs
like scraps.

69
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,071
What have you given me?

70
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,741
When a woman
stays young and
beautiful forever,

71
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,535
the world is hers.

72
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:20,042
First, I will take
your life, my lord.

73
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,965
And then
I'll take your throne.

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,793
Welcome, brother.

75
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,129
My queen.

76
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,634
<i>She had tricked</i>
<i>her way into the kingdom</i>
<i>with a phantom army.

77
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,472
<i>She now welcomed</i>
<i>a very real one.

78
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:52,885
William!

79
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,595
Snow, get out! Snow!

80
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,847
I can't leave!

81
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,351
The Princess!
No!

82
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,269
Get out of here! Go!

83
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,449
William! Don't leave me!

84
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,868
Father, we must go back!
We must!

85
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,870
No!
We've lost her!

86
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,206
No! No! No!

87
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,794
Don't leave me!
William!

88
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,401
Out.

89
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,447
Out!

90
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,964
Mirror, mirror

91
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,842
on the wall,

92
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,475
who is
the fairest of them all?

93
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,974
It is you, my queen.

94
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,852
Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory.

95
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:55,484
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?

96
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,125
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?

97
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,005
To the sword.

98
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,843
Finn.

99
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,515
Lock her up.

100
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:31,395
One never knows
when royal blood
may be of value.

101
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,039
<i>So poisonous was</i>
<i>the reign of Ravenna,

102
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:54,001
<i>that nature turned on itself</i>
<i>and people</i>
<i>turned on each other.

103
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,919
<i>The land died

104
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,423
<i>and with it, hope.

105
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,428
<i>And all that time,</i>
<i>she kept Snow White</i>
<i>imprisoned

106
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,139
<i>high up</i>
<i>in the north tower.

107
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,579
Our Father
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

108
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,749
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

109
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,210
Give us this day
our daily bread,
and forgive us our sins,

110
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,546
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

111
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,589
Lead us not into temptation,

112
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,467
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

113
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,115
Hello?

114
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,077
Hello?

115
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,794
What is your name?
I am Greta.

116
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,962
What happened to you?

117
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,922
All the girls in our
village were taken.

118
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,800
I was trying to reach
Duke Hammond's castle
when I was caught.

119
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,635
Duke Hammond?

120
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,304
Is he alive?

121
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,515
Does he still fight
in my father's name?

122
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,184
You're the King's daughter.

123
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,438
The night the King died,
we were told all in
the castle were slain.

124
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,482
And William?

125
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,650
Is the Duke's son
still alive?

126
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,195
I don't know, Princess.

127
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,989
What will they do to me?

128
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,106
Do you remember
when we were children

129
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,528
begging for scraps
like those wretches?

130
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,613
Yes, sister.

131
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,949
Am I not kinder?

132
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,702
Yes.

133
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,751
These two were captured
leading an ambush

134
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,753
on one of our
supply trains.

135
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,139
Your son?

136
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,850
Handsome.

137
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,896
Obviously, a debt
owed to your mother.

138
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:30,569
There was a time
I would have lost my heart
to a face like yours.

139
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:35,490
And you, no doubt,
would have broken it.

140
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,367
lain, no!

141
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,014
You would kill your queen?

142
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,517
Such courage.

143
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
Such beauty.

144
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:08,482
But how strong
is your heart?

145
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,908
No. My son.

146
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,291
My son!

147
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,964
Leave him.

148
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,177
Let him return
to the Duke

149
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,223
and speak of the generosity
of his queen.

150
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:42,933
Out.

151
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,434
Out!

152
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,310
Magic comes
at a lofty price.

153
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,730
And the expense grows.

154
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,732
You look...
Old.

155
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,525
Tired.

156
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,489
My power

157
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,909
fades.

158
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,751
I have something
for what ails you.

159
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,179
Oh.

160
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,942
Greta?

161
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,654
Greta?

162
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,827
Mirror, mirror

163
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,620
on the wall,

164
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,291
who is fairest
of them all?

165
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,293
My queen,

166
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,548
on this day,
one has come of age

167
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,759
fairer even than you.

168
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,388
She is the reason
your powers wane.

169
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,056
Who is it?

170
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,976
Snow White.

171
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,520
Snow White?

172
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,690
She is my undoing?

173
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,611
I should have killed her
when she was a child.

174
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,280
Be warned.

175
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:48,410
Her innocence and purity
is all that can destroy you.

176
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,331
But she is also
your salvation, Queen.

177
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,626
Take her heart
in your hand

178
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,297
and you shall never again
need to consume youth.

179
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,384
You shall never again
weaken or age.

180
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,720
Immortality.

181
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,056
Immortality

182
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,058
forever.

183
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,812
Finn!

184
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,399
Brother,

185
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,651
bring me
the King's daughter.

186
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,640
Did I wake you?

187
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,654
Are you always awake
when I watch you?

188
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,119
You've never
come in before.

189
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,121
My sister won't allow it.

190
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,376
She wants you
all to herself.

191
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,336
I'm afraid of her.

192
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,340
And not of me?

193
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,509
No.

194
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,304
Fear not, Princess.

195
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:20,186
You will never again
be locked in this cell.

196
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,814
What does she
want from me?

197
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,193
Your beating heart.

198
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,588
Get me out of here!

199
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
No!

200
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,175
Greta?

201
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,721
Go.
Get me out of here!

202
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,681
No!
Go.

203
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:57,891
No!

204
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,464
Stop her!

205
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,594
Catch her!

206
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,312
Seize her!

207
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,458
Get to the gate!

208
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,489
Bring her back to me!

209
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:45,047
How is it that
an innocent young girl

210
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,134
makes a fool
of my brother?

211
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,222
Armed only with a nail.

212
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,810
If she'd had a sword,

213
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,229
she would have
taken my kingdom.

214
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,150
"Bring me
the King's daughter,"

215
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:10,907
and you let her slip
right through your
tiny little fingers.

216
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,825
How?

217
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,829
You swore that
you would protect me!

218
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,998
You swore!

219
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,378
Now there's no one
I can trust.

220
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,882
No one.
There's no loyalty,
no loyalty.

221
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,551
None, not even from you!

222
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,055
Where is she?

223
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,352
She was chased
into the Dark Forest,

224
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,853
where the men lost her.

225
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,774
She's no good to me
in the Dark Forest, lost!

226
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:49,028
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!

227
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,864
Have I not
given all to you!

228
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,541
Have I

229
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,210
not given you all?

230
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,256
Yes, sister.

231
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,225
Quiet.

232
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,063
I have no powers
in the Dark Forest.

233
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,901
You have to find me someone.

234
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,446
Someone who knows it.

235
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,742
Someone who can hunt her.

236
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,833
You owe me money
from my pocket

237
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,084
and money for the girl.

238
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,920
Well, you know,
I seem to have
drunk it all,

239
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,006
but you're welcome to it
when it comes out again.

240
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,932
You've gone too far.
I want my money!

241
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,976
Here it is!

242
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,643
The Queen
demands your presence.

243
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,062
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?

244
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:51,067
Trust me on this, sister.

245
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,279
All right! All right!

246
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,281
Hey!

247
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,959
My brother tells me
you are a widower.
A drunkard.

248
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:12,838
And one of few
who has ventured
into the Dark Forest.

249
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,048
Aye.

250
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,175
One of my prisoners
has escaped there.

251
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,802
Then he's dead.
She.

252
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,261
She is certainly dead.

253
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,016
Find her.

254
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,352
Bring her to me.

255
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,521
No,
I've been to that forest.
I'm not going back.

256
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,857
You will be
rewarded handsomely.

257
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,192
What good is gold to me

258
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,194
if I'm lying dead
with the crows
picking at my eyes?

259
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,199
Why is she of such value?

260
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,368
That is none
of your concern.

261
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,537
I'll determine what
concerns me, thank you.

262
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:48,082
You will do this for me,
huntsman!

263
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,711
And if I refuse?

264
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,466
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.

265
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,510
To his knees.

266
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:08,477
So you wish to be reunited
with your beloved?

267
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,606
You do not
speak of my wife.

268
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,028
You miss her.

269
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:30,624
What would you give
to see her again?

270
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,212
You know of my powers.

271
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,758
Bring me the girl

272
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:42,219
and I will bring back
your wife.

273
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,722
Nothing can bring her back.

274
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,265
I can.

275
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,273
A life

276
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,276
for a life.

277
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,085
She can't have gone far.

278
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,632
All right,
do exactly as I do.

279
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,677
It's a bad idea.

280
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:50,955
Stay here.

281
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,350
Come here.
No!

282
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:58,606
Will you help me?

283
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,317
Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.

284
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,484
Sure she is.

285
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,445
She's going
to rip out my heart.

286
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:06,655
Quick work.

287
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:08,532
Hey.

288
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,075
Well done, huntsman.

289
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,578
Hand her over.

290
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,041
What do you intend
to do with her?

291
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:18,959
Why do you care?

292
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,086
You want her... Hey!

293
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,297
Give me what
I was promised.

294
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,215
You did your job well.

295
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,052
Now, keep your word.

296
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,346
He'll kill us both.
Shut up.

297
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,473
He will.
I said, shut up.

298
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,183
No, no.

299
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,602
I'll keep my word
when the Queen keeps hers.

300
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:37,895
Where's my wife?

301
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,649
He's going
to betray you.

302
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:46,153
My sister has many powers.

303
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:50,991
She can take life away,
or sustain it,

304
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:56,914
but she can't bring
your wife back
from the dead, you fool!

305
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,416
I want her back!

306
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,190
I will find you!

307
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,534
Quiet. All right?

308
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,916
Hey, what the
hell's going on?

309
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,877
Who are you?
Why does the Queen
want you dead?

310
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,211
She wants everyone
dead, all of us.

311
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,629
What makes you
so damn valuable?

312
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:30,424
You should know,
you're the one hunting me.

313
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:36,597
Forget it.

314
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:42,394
I should have never
got involved in the
Queen's business.

315
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,396
What did I get in?
Stupid...

316
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,231
Where are you going?

317
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,569
Getting away from you.
You're trouble,
is what you are.

318
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,865
I need to get
to the Duke's castle.
There's an army there.

319
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:57,576
Oh, the Duke's army?

320
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,413
Bunch of farmers
and milkmaids
with pitchforks.

321
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,751
I know sheep that
have more fight in them.

322
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,044
I'm valuable.

323
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,254
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

324
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,801
If you return without me,
you're dead.

325
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,720
If you leave me,
I'm dead.

326
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:23,769
Just for argument's sake,
how much reward?

327
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:25,145
However much is enough.

328
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,273
At least thirty gold pieces...
A hundred.

329
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,569
Help me.

330
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:35,948
Who are you?

331
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:38,450
Maybe you should have
asked the Queen that.

332
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:39,952
I don't trust you.

333
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,622
I've given you my word.
I still don't trust you.

334
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,251
But you have a deal.

335
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,430
Give me that,
before you lose a finger.

336
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:09,815
She killed my brave lain
with just the palm of her hand

337
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:12,067
and then she drew a dagger
from her side with no blood.

338
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,986
She cannot be killed.

339
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,489
But there is more.

340
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:21,368
The Princess is alive.

341
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,706
Where is my son?

342
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:23,847
We have word
of the Princess.

343
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,392
Ravenna has kept her,
all these years.

344
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,896
She lives?

345
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,858
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.

346
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,403
I'm going after her.

347
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,197
We don't know
if she survived.

348
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,281
William!

349
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:43,700
What?

350
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:47,079
You ventured beyond
the castle walls again,
disobeying my orders.

351
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,081
We're all that's left,
don't you understand?

352
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,251
I cannot afford
to lose any more
of my men.

353
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,418
I'm going alone.

354
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,546
I will not lose
my only son.

355
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,967
You don't know
the Dark Forest.

356
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,135
Then I'll find
somebody who does.

357
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,429
I will not abandon her
a second time.

358
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,677
The forest
gains its strength
from your weakness.

359
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,982
Do you drink
to drown your sorrows?

360
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:58,984
Or your conscience?

361
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,528
What concern
is it of yours,
why I drink?

362
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,655
I suppose a man's
sorrows are his own.

363
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:07,326
What does
a young girl like you
know about sorrow?

364
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,381
Don't flatter yourself.

365
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:23,091
Now stay close.

366
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,768
You men know the dark forest?

367
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,735
Load and prepare.

368
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,821
You ride for
50 gold pieces.

369
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:49,743
Does it not trouble you
to serve her?

370
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,329
Who the Queen?

371
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,166
I serve no one.

372
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:02,422
Especially that old hag,
and any other royalty.
They're all damned.

373
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:07,219
The King and
his true queen
are not damned.

374
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,387
The King?

375
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:11,056
He's the one that let
the devil in the door.

376
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,393
It's his fault
the kingdom's
plunged into darkness.

377
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:17,646
From you?

378
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,064
You know nothing.

379
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,315
What? And you do?

380
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,735
What's a wee scrod like you
care about the King anyway?

381
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,612
You're barely old enough
to remember him.

382
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,739
The land is diseased.

383
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:29,408
Nature is upturned.

384
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,536
This, this is the legacy
of your precious king.

385
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:58,728
Do you need a bowman?

386
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:03,233
I have a bowman.

387
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,695
Kill him.

388
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,203
I said, do you
need a bowman?

389
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,053
Here, I want
to show you something.

390
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,809
Which is your lead foot?

391
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,190
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up

392
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:46,151
and you block,
and use their strength
against them.

393
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,237
You're small, so wait
until they're close

394
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:52,699
and you drive it
through their heart
to the hilt.

395
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:55,702
You understand?
Do not hesitate.

396
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,162
You look in their eyes

397
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:59,873
and do not pull it out
until you see their soul.

398
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,636
I couldn't do that.

399
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,640
Well, you might not
have a choice.

400
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:37,452
We have their trail.

401
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,042
Move on. Move on!

402
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:15,782
Wait.

403
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,619
Is this the edge
of the Dark Forest?

404
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,829
Aye.

405
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,332
What is it?

406
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:40,056
Troll!

407
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,819
Go!

408
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,370
Run!

409
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:33,086
I told you to run.

410
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,130
If I had,
you would be dead.

411
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,662
Only demons or spirits
pass through the Dark Forest.
Which are you?

412
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:10,707
We're fugitives
from the Queen.

413
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:13,001
We mean you no harm.

414
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:54,834
Where are all the men?

415
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,504
Gone.

416
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,402
Have you got
nothing to drink?

417
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,908
You have traveled far

418
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:30,745
and carried
a great burden.

419
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,248
I've had worse jobs.

420
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,545
Anyway,
she's not that heavy.

421
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,050
You don't know
who she is.

422
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:46,553
What do you mean?

423
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,101
Why? Who is she?

424
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,938
Maybe it needs a skirt,
or a dress or something?

425
00:55:57,522 --> 00:55:58,815
That's nice.

426
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:00,733
How about a face?

427
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:02,569
Your mother
wants to see you.

428
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,957
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,795
Because I'd think
it was too difficult a task?

430
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:22,463
You would be right.

431
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,137
I didn't trust you.

432
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,059
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

433
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,718
Our scars protect us.

434
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:12,138
Without beauty,
we are worthless
to the Queen.

435
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,891
It's a sacrifice we made

436
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,311
so we could raise
our children in peace

437
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,856
while their fathers
are at war.

438
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:23,942
And you,

439
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:26,361
your sacrifice will come.

440
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:32,700
You must rest.

441
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:58,017
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?

442
00:57:58,184 --> 00:57:59,936
Aye, I know the truth.

443
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:03,189
That's why she should
be as far away from me
as possible.

444
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,483
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.

445
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,111
Not this time.

446
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,570
She's safer here with you.

447
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,143
Lily! Lily, come on!

448
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,686
Come on!

449
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:49,819
Run, rats, run!

450
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,283
Find her!

451
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,703
Find her!

452
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:00,455
Come on!

453
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,292
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!

454
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,626
Lily!

455
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:36,551
In there, baby.
There you go.

456
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:40,638
Come on!

457
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,891
No! No!

458
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:49,897
Come on! Let's go!

459
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,440
No! We have to help them!

460
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,733
You will. Go.

461
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,819
Come on!
Go!

462
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,060
Your beauty is all
that can save you,
Ravenna.

463
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:33,482
<i>This spell will</i>
<i>make your beauty your</i>
<i>power and protection.

464
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:39,906
By fairest blood
it is done.

465
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:41,574
Here. Drink, drink!

466
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:47,830
But, be warned.

467
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:51,459
By fairest blood,
this spell can be undone.

468
01:01:57,632 --> 01:01:59,926
Avenge us!

469
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,002
I'm sorry.

470
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,841
I'm sorry.
You're not.

471
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:42,176
I am.
You left us.

472
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,640
We should never
have been there.

473
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,728
Hey, look at me.

474
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:55,731
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?

475
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,316
All right?

476
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,070
You have my word.

477
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:05,324
Wait!

478
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,712
This is our lucky day.

479
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,006
Oh, no. Dwarves.

480
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:23,050
The hedge-pig
I loathe most in the world
lands right in our lap.

481
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,427
Come on, Beith.

482
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:25,886
Is this how
you treat a friend?

483
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,764
Oh! No, no, no,
you puttock.

484
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:30,558
This is how
I treat a friend.

485
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,270
She's pretty.

486
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:36,564
And who's this?

487
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,400
Is this an errant apprentice
or captive?

488
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:40,568
This man is helping me.

489
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:41,861
We should kill them both.

490
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:43,404
He's caused us
nothing but trouble.

491
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:47,199
Skewer him
and leave her to rot.
I don't like killing girls.

492
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:49,201
I do.
Good.

493
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:50,619
Leave her alone, Duir.

494
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,750
He's got nothing.
One silver coin and
an empty codpiece.

495
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,711
Two days we sat here.
What for?

496
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:00,254
Nothing.

497
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,631
We should have
stayed by the river.
What a waste of time!

498
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,760
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.

499
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,929
It's not here,
it's hidden back
in the woods.

500
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,765
Shut your ugly mug,
huntsman.

501
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:14,310
If you had any pennies,
you would have pissed it
away on mead by now.

502
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:15,644
Cut us down,
then I'll show you.

503
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,313
Pull the other one,
you lying dangler.

504
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,483
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!

505
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:23,986
I have to take
this girl to Hammond's.
She's not safe here.

506
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,822
Well, my little heart
bleeds for you.

507
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,616
We should chop them up
and feed them to the wolves.

508
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:29,992
Yeah. Yes!

509
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:31,535
Who is she?

510
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,454
She's worth
a lot of gold to me.

511
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:35,998
Which I am happy
to share with you
stupid little dwarves.

512
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,583
Stop that!

513
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,294
Gold is worth
nothing to any of you
if you're all dead!

514
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:41,796
The Queen's men hunt us!

515
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:44,131
They're very close!
Shut up!

516
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,300
You have love
for the Queen?

517
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:48,761
We have no love
for the Queen.

518
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,054
Then you fight against her?

519
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,597
No one fights
against the Queen.

520
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,974
We lost everything
when the King died.

521
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,434
We fight only
for ourselves!

522
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:56,602
Yes.

523
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,656
Muir,

524
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:11,784
does she speak the truth?

525
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:15,830
Yes. She is of the blood.

526
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:20,292
She is destined, Beith.

527
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,339
I see an end
to the darkness.

528
01:05:29,802 --> 01:05:30,886
Riders!

529
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,179
They found us!

530
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:33,889
If you don't cut us down,
we'll all be killed!

531
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,183
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.

532
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,727
You'll find your weight
in gold if you
cut us down, now!

533
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:39,895
Shut up, Princess.

534
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:41,856
Queen's riders!

535
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:43,899
And they're coming
this way!

536
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,026
We'll take her,
but not him!

537
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,570
What?

538
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,029
No, both of us!

539
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,698
Cut them both down, Gort!

540
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,366
Let's get the hell
out of here!

541
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,243
Move it! Move it!

542
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:33,532
They're close.

543
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,230
Blasted fairy music.

544
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,816
Yeah.

545
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,360
Good thing there's
plenty of moss about.

546
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,993
Where are we?

547
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,496
They call it Sanctuary,
my lady.

548
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:04,540
It's the home
of the fairies.

549
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,045
Fairies.

550
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:29,023
Clear!

551
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:30,858
Coll?

552
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:35,404
Clear!

553
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,242
Set up camp!

554
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,536
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.

555
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,414
Gort, your mug.

556
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:08,145
Play louder,
you whey-face,

557
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,731
I can still hear
them harpy fairies.

558
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,906
Duir, would you really
have killed her?

559
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:20,574
Yeah.

560
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,242
Of course.

561
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:46,141
That seat's not taken,
if that's what you
were about to ask.

562
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:52,773
I want to thank you.

563
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,274
It's only a log.

564
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:56,985
There's no need
to thank me.

565
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:58,404
No, for before.

566
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:00,614
For defending me.

567
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:03,951
Ah. Your father
was a good man.

568
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:06,120
The kingdom prospered.

569
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:07,955
Our people prospered.

570
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:11,792
There were more of you.

571
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:13,377
Aye.
Yeah.

572
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,797
The men you see before you

573
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:20,759
and many, many more,
went deep into the caves.

574
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:25,305
We were noble gold miners

575
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:28,308
because we could see
the light in the darkness.

576
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:32,479
Gus. Gus?

577
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:36,984
You were just a boy,
but you remember.

578
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:40,154
When we returned
to the surface,

579
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:44,158
there was nothing.

580
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:45,826
The land was blackened.

581
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:48,954
Everything,
everyone was gone.

582
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:53,500
Was dead.

583
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:57,504
That was the month
your father died.

584
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,090
I'm very sorry.

585
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,510
As am I, Princess.
As am I.

586
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:07,347
Son, play a happy song.

587
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,685
<i>Why spend your leisure</i>
<i>Bereft of pleasure

588
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:15,022
<i>Amassing treasure</i>
<i>Why scrape and save?

589
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:18,734
<i>Why look so canny</i>
<i>At ev'ry penny?

590
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:21,695
<i>You'll take no money</i>
<i>within the grave

591
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,699
I know I'm a bit gicky,

592
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:28,202
but would you care
for a dance?

593
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:30,537
I'd be honored, Gus.

594
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:34,541
<i>Our glasses clinking</i>
<i>And round and round

595
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,544

597
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,717

<i>Because life passes

598
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:47,888
<i>Come fill your glasses</i>
<i>for another round

599
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:55,395
I don't trust her,
and I don't believe her.

600
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,898
No matter what Muir says.

601
01:11:58,065 --> 01:11:59,983
I feel peculiar.

602
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,568
Queer almost.

603
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:02,903
What? Since when?

604
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,406
I'm tingling all over,
but I feel lovely.

605
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,075
I feel lovely.

606
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,494
How's your gout?

607
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:11,912
Gout?

608
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:16,208
It's a bit better.

609
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,417
And my cough.

610
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:19,419
You know,

611
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,922
this is her doing.

612
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,258
How much have
you had to drink?

613
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,176
No, it was the mushrooms.

614
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,931
Send a log downstream.

615
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,103
<i>With hump for tramel</i>
<i>The scripture's camel

616
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,189
Still fleecing us out
of our bevvy, huntsman?

617
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,694
What do you say
we let bygones be bygones?

618
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:45,612
Not yet, nut-hook.

619
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:51,785
Hug.

620
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:54,580
<i>Come fill your glasses</i>

621

<i>Is iomaí slí sin</i>
<i>Do bhíos ag daoine

622
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,459
So what's in it for you?

623
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,087
What are you talking about?

624
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:04,047
I'm talking about the girl.

625
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:10,596
<i>Come fill your glasses</i>
<i>for another round

626
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,307
Is it really
just the gold?

627
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,143
I'm not sure, Beith.

628
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,188
If I had any sense,
I'd have abandoned
her long ago.

629
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,649
Muir says she's destined.

630
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:25,903
Question is, huntsman,

631
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:27,946
for what?

632
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:29,656
Hmm?

633
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:01,373
Get up.

634
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,810
Father?
What was that?
Father?

635
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:23,937
I know, son, I know.

636
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:25,772
It's him.

637
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,627
No, no, no, huntsman.

638
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,171
No one's ever
seen this before.

639
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,706
The white hart
bows before
the Princess, Father.

640
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:10,210
He's blessing her.

641
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,337
What are you talking about?

642
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,882
You have eyes,
huntsman,
but you do not see.

643
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:18,844
You, who have been
with her the longest.

644
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,680
She is life itself.

645
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,474
She will heal the land.

646
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:27,060
She is the one.

647
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:35,902
Can't you feel it?
Are your ailments not gone?

648
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:38,488
Gold or no gold,

649
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:41,491
where she leads,
I follow.

650
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:42,909
Aye.
I'm with you.

651
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,077
Yes, Father.

652
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,001
Ambush!

653
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:53,211
Aim low! Aim low!

654
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,474
Coll, Duir, take him.

655
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:09,769
Gus, go with her.

656
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,406
Stay with me.
Don't you wait for me.

657
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:31,041
You first.

658
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:33,084
I know.

659
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:52,604
Go. That way.

660
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,189
Go, go!

661
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,372
No, no, it's me!
It's William.

662
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:53,915
It's William.

663
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:11,224
I admire your fight,
huntsman.

664
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:15,061
Your wife was the same.

665
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:16,563
What do you know
of my wife?

666
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,064
I remember them all.

667
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,819
But especially

668
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:26,072
the ones with fight.

669
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:31,578
She screamed your name,

670
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:34,998
but you weren't there.

671
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:48,345
Now, you can beg
her forgiveness
in the Otherworld.

672
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:07,989
Sister,

673
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,909
heal me.

674
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,049
Forgive me, brother.

675
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,639
I feel...

676
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:02,710
Arrow!

677
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,522
Gus. Gus!

678
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,863
Gus, breathe.
Gus, breathe.

679
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,382
I won't leave you, miss.

680
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,720
We used to have pride.

681
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:38,890
And now we just
pilfer and drink

682
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,268
and dream about
when we didn't.

683
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:47,941
Every man here
would die for the chance
of becoming that man again.

684
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,611
So, we follow you, Princess,

685
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:54,072
in life and in death.

686
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,241
And we shall
have our pride again.

687
01:23:57,492 --> 01:24:01,037
On Gus's soul,
this I swear.

688
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:23,059
<i>Dark the stars</i>
<i>And dark the moon

689
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:31,317
<i>Hush the night</i>
<i>And the morning loon

690
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:38,741
<i>Tell the horses</i>
<i>And beat on your drum

691
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:45,498
<i>Gone their master</i>
<i>Gone their sun

692
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:53,339
<i>Dark the oceans</i>
<i>Dark the sky

693
01:24:54,090 --> 01:25:00,054
<i>Hush the whales</i>
<i>And the ocean tide

694
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:08,271
<i>Tell the salt marsh</i>
<i>And beat on your drum

695
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,734
<i>Gone their master

696
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:16,946
<i>Gone their sun

697
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:25,788
<i>Dark to light</i>
<i>And light to dark

698
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:33,254
<i>Three black carriages</i>
<i>Three white carts

699
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:43,556
<i>What brings us together's</i>
<i>What pulls us apart

700
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:54,651
<i>Gone our brother</i>
<i>Gone our heart

701
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:59,113
I'm sorry I left you.

702
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,325
You didn't.

703
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:06,371
If I'd have thought
you were alive,

704
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:08,539
I would have come for you.

705
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,125
We were children, William.

706
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:14,754
You're here now.

707
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:37,235
<i>Hush the whales</i>
<i>And the ocean tide

708
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:46,703
<i>Tell the salt marsh</i>
<i>And beat on your drum

709
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:56,963
<i>Gone their master</i>
<i>Gone their sun

710
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:33,207
Here.

711
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:53,060
She hasn't changed.

712
01:27:55,146 --> 01:27:57,732
She has that same
light inside her.

713
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,530
You must see it.

714
01:28:05,782 --> 01:28:07,950
You'd be blind
if you didn't.

715
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:16,542
Thought about her
every day since I
lost her.

716
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:22,590
I can hardly believe
I found her.

717
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,345
You should tell her
how you feel.

718
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:28,471
It'd be good for her.

719
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:29,555
No.

720
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:31,933
I wouldn't know how.

721
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,646
Your not telling someone
something like that

722
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:39,732
and living with the regret

723
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,235
is a lot worse.

724
01:29:06,551 --> 01:29:07,718
William.

725
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:13,474
It's as if nothing's
changed here.

726
01:29:16,477 --> 01:29:18,062
The world seems

727
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:19,689
beautiful again.

728
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:20,940
It will be,

729
01:29:22,108 --> 01:29:23,568
when you are queen.

730
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:28,614
The people of this
kingdom hate Ravenna
with every fiber.

731
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,451
I used to hate her.

732
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:36,205
But now I feel only sorrow.

733
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:38,708
Once people
find out you're alive,

734
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,042
they will rise up
in your name.

735
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:44,213
It takes more
than a name.

736
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:47,675
You are
your father's daughter.

737
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:49,844
The rightful heir.

738
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:53,890
If I had a choice,
I'd take you far away.

739
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:59,478
Keep you safe by my side.

740
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:03,733
But I have a duty.
And so do you.

741
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,319
How do I inspire?

742
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:09,822
How will I lead men?

743
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:14,076
The way you led me
when we were children.

744
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:17,830
I followed you everywhere.

745
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:21,959
I ran when you called.

746
01:30:23,628 --> 01:30:26,172
I would have done
anything for you.

747
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,550
That's not
how I remember it.

748
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:32,011
No?
No.

749
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:35,890
And we used to fight
all the time.

750
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:38,559
And argue.

751
01:31:06,879 --> 01:31:08,422
Do you remember that trick?

752
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:10,174
What trick?

753
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,495
You see, child,

754
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:43,958
love always betrays us.

755
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:03,310
Wake up.

756
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:40,222
By fairest blood
it was done,

757
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:44,977
and only by fairest blood

758
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:48,606
can it be undone.

759
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:53,736
You were the only one

760
01:32:53,903 --> 01:32:57,406
who could break the spell
and destroy me.

761
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:09,376
And the only one

762
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,504
pure enough

763
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,132
to save me.

764
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:21,806
You don't even realize
how lucky you are

765
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:25,351
never to know
what it is to grow old.

766
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:26,644
No!

767
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:53,170
No.

768
01:34:09,562 --> 01:34:12,231
No. No.

769
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:18,696
What are you looking at?
Do something!

770
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:20,406
You're dwarves, healers.

771
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:22,658
Save her. Help her.

772
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:30,916
No. This cannot be.

773
01:34:36,589 --> 01:34:39,592
Please, please.

774
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:22,635
Please.

775
01:35:25,262 --> 01:35:27,473
What do we do, Beith?

776
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:30,184
What we promised.

777
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:38,562
Well, here you are.

778
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:42,441
All dressed up,
like you're about to

779
01:37:42,608 --> 01:37:44,610
wake up and give me
more grief. Am I right?

780
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:57,956
You deserved better.

781
01:38:02,378 --> 01:38:04,880
I once had a wife,
Princess.

782
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:10,302
Sara was her name.

783
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:13,138
When I came back
from the wars,

784
01:38:13,222 --> 01:38:15,182
I carried with me
the stench of death

785
01:38:15,349 --> 01:38:17,476
and the anger of the lost.

786
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:22,398
I wasn't worth saving,
that's for sure.
But she did so anyway.

787
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:26,443
And I loved her so much.

788
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,780
I loved her more than
anyone or anything.

789
01:38:29,947 --> 01:38:33,826
And then I let her
out of my sight
and she was gone.

790
01:38:37,746 --> 01:38:40,290
And I became myself again.

791
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,751
A self I never cared for.

792
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:49,133
Until you.

793
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:55,097
See, you remind me of her.

794
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:59,935
Her heart. Her spirit.

795
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:06,358
But now you, too,
have gone.

796
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:10,571
You both deserved better,
and I'm so sorry I failed you.

797
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:13,031
I'm so sorry.

798
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:23,542
But you'll be a queen
in heaven now

799
01:39:24,418 --> 01:39:26,336
and sit among the angels.

800
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:16,178
She died for us!

801
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:18,388
For our cause!

802
01:40:18,555 --> 01:40:20,432
We cannot just hide
behind these walls

803
01:40:20,599 --> 01:40:22,476
and watch this land
die with her!

804
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,646
Your grief clouds
your judgment, my son.

805
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,734
My grief makes me
see clearer, Father.

806
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:36,949
My duty is
to protect those people
who come to me for help.

807
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:40,702
I will defend them
to the last drop of my blood,

808
01:40:41,787 --> 01:40:44,039
but I will not
abandon these walls.

809
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,062
The spell is lifted.

810
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:40,053
Death has favored you.

811
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,930
Death favors no man.

812
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:43,974
We must ride

813
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:47,519
like thundering waves
under the tattered battle
flag of my father.

814
01:41:47,853 --> 01:41:49,104
You must rest.

815
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:52,107
We have rested
long enough.

816
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:03,702
Frost to fire
and fire to frost.

817
01:42:08,749 --> 01:42:10,709
Iron will melt.

818
01:42:14,254 --> 01:42:17,382
But it will writhe
inside of itself!

819
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:21,470
All these years

820
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,640
all I've known is darkness.

821
01:42:26,892 --> 01:42:30,562
But I have never seen
a brighter light than when
my eyes just opened.

822
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:35,567
And I know that light
burns in all of you!

823
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:38,904
Those embers

824
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,907
must turn to flame.

825
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:46,453
Iron into sword!

826
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:48,580
I will become your weapon!

827
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:50,999
Forged by the fierce fire

828
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:53,293
that I know is
in your hearts!

829
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,798
For I have seen
what she sees.

830
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:01,635
I know what she knows.

831
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:05,931
I can kill her.

832
01:43:09,935 --> 01:43:11,770
And I'd rather die today

833
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:16,149
than live another day
of this death!

834
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,946
And who will ride with me?

835
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,031
Who will be my brother?

836
01:43:23,657 --> 01:43:25,117
Aye!

837
01:44:11,747 --> 01:44:13,498
Farewell, Princess.

838
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:39,024
Where are they?

839
01:44:39,191 --> 01:44:40,901
Amassed on the cliffs.

840
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:43,028
Their numbers
have swollen.

841
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:46,114
They say the King's
standard flies again.

842
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:48,617
Then let them come.

843
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:53,580
And let them
break their skulls
on these stone walls

844
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:56,208
and bring me my prize.

845
01:45:12,724 --> 01:45:13,767
My lord,

846
01:45:13,892 --> 01:45:16,061
we only have a few hours
before the tide comes in.

847
01:45:16,228 --> 01:45:18,396
Not long enough
to breach the castle walls.

848
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:19,981
Is there no other way in?

849
01:45:20,148 --> 01:45:21,441
There is another way.

850
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,489
Hi-ho, lads,
it's off to work.

851
01:45:27,656 --> 01:45:30,534
If he starts whistling,
I'll smash his face in.

852
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,581
Yes.

853
01:45:36,832 --> 01:45:38,834
We're promised gold
and what do we get?

854
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,085
Poo!

855
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:42,045
How low has
the dwarf race sunk?

856
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,633
That looks like one of mine.

857
01:45:46,967 --> 01:45:47,968
Hold this!

858
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:11,241
All right.

859
01:46:11,324 --> 01:46:13,076
The gatehouse
is 50 yards to the right.

860
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:14,953
And there's a whole
army out there.

861
01:46:15,287 --> 01:46:17,330
Six dwarves
against an army?

862
01:46:18,123 --> 01:46:20,000
I like them odds.

863
01:46:22,127 --> 01:46:24,588
We must ride now.
The portcullis will be open.

864
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:33,930
So, you're back from the dead
and instigating the masses.

865
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:40,020
You look very
fetching in mail.

866
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:45,942
We ride!

867
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:53,783
All right.
We move as one.

868
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,497
After you.

869
01:47:14,638 --> 01:47:17,474
Hey, go, go, go.

870
01:48:35,552 --> 01:48:36,761
Sorry.

871
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:41,891
What's happening, Coll?

872
01:48:42,142 --> 01:48:43,309
They're on the beach!

873
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:51,276
Release!

874
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:34,152
Ready! Release!

875
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:40,325
Release!

876
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:57,175
Go, go, go!

877
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,597
The summit's breached!

878
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:11,022
Back here, lads!
Come on!

879
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:12,690
Get back to it!

880
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:27,664
Pull!
Nion, get on that rope!

881
01:50:27,831 --> 01:50:29,582
Come on!
Go on!

882
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:31,751
Quert!

883
01:50:34,254 --> 01:50:35,296
It's a massacre
down there!

884
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:37,173
Gort, on that rope!

885
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,385
We must turn back!

886
01:50:40,677 --> 01:50:43,179
No! I gave them my word!

887
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:44,681
It's over!
Get on now!

888
01:50:49,894 --> 01:50:50,895
She's moving.

889
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:53,606
You done it, lads!

890
01:50:59,028 --> 01:51:00,697
Charge!

891
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:02,323
Ya!

892
01:51:12,208 --> 01:51:14,836
Form! Form!

893
01:53:01,276 --> 01:53:02,694
William!

894
01:55:27,213 --> 01:55:30,508
Come and avenge
your father

895
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:34,595
who was too weak
to raise his sword.

896
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,810
Ah.

897
01:55:53,865 --> 01:55:54,866
Go on.

898
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,453
Watch them die.

899
01:56:14,552 --> 01:56:16,220
How does it feel,

900
01:56:16,387 --> 01:56:19,223
knowing you were
the one who led them
to their deaths?

901
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,641
You see?

902
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:23,436
We're not that different,
are we?

903
01:56:26,105 --> 01:56:27,732
I'm everything you're not.

904
01:56:50,922 --> 01:56:53,799
You cannot defeat me!

905
01:56:54,926 --> 01:56:58,054
I've lived too many lives.

906
01:56:58,471 --> 01:57:00,932
Ravaged entire kingdoms.

907
01:57:01,349 --> 01:57:05,478
I have been given powers
that you could
not even fathom!

908
01:57:08,272 --> 01:57:09,690
I will never stop.

909
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:12,527
Never.

910
01:57:14,654 --> 01:57:17,281
I will give
this wretched world

911
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:21,869
the queen it deserves.

912
01:57:26,624 --> 01:57:29,669
By fairest blood,
it is done!

913
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:49,480
And only
by fairest blood
is it undone.

914
01:58:46,162 --> 01:58:48,539
You can't have my heart.

915
02:00:00,403 --> 02:00:04,323
In the name
of all that is good
and just in this land

916
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,450
I crown you queen.

917
02:00:49,076 --> 02:00:50,619
Hail to the Queen!

918
02:00:51,412 --> 02:00:53,289
Hail to the Queen!

919
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:55,332
Hail to the Queen!

920
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:57,334
Hail to the Queen!

921
02:00:57,668 --> 02:00:59,670
Hail to the Queen!
