2
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:10,851
No cigarettes, no sleep,
no light, no sound.

3
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,337
Nothing to eat...

4
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,211
No one to drink.

5
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:28,213
Sometimes all I need is the
air that I breathe and to love you.

6
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,773
All I need is the air that
I breathe and to love you.

7
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,844
All I need...

8
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,378
Watch where you're going, would ya?

9
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,557
Oh...

10
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,585
Hey!

11
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:54,016
Hey!

12
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,456
Delta team, check in.

13
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,455
Delta team holding.

14
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:21,857
Maybe the source is wrong?

15
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,037
The source is good.

16
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:27,013
It's 10 after, the source
said 4 a.m. on the dot.

17
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,729
Wait!

18
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,346
Creedence.

19
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,969
It's probably just a radio station
someplace outside of the city.

20
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,418
No.

21
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,131
It's him.

22
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,910
Do we have to listen to the whole song,

23
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:07,072
all 7 minutes and 40 seconds of it?

24
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,391
Why do you insist on asking that every time?

25
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,820
Gum, I don't mess with your superstitions.

26
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,369
God knows we don't want to fluck with the formula.

27
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,349
But how about a new band?

28
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:22,569
Over the last six years we have listened to the
entire "Creedence Clearwater Revival" songbook

29
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:25,690
over and over and...

30
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,173
Hello?

31
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,115
Hi, Sweetie!

32
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:30,057
Why are you up so early?

33
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,247
What?

34
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:34,337
Which one?

35
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,867
Which one? Oh, the Care Bears book.

36
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:39,630
Oh, okay, I thought you were taking the even pages.

37
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,441
Oh, okay, I'm supposed to color the evens.

38
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,130
Oh, okay, well, I'll take my turn as soon as I get home.

39
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,497
Save the purple crayon for daddy.

40
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:52,937
Well, I told you, your daddy
has to work, but guess what?

41
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,095
When I get home I'm gonna make
you those... those happy-face pancakes

42
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:57,756
that you like so much, okay?

43
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,556
I love you, Baby.

44
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,504
Okay, big kiss.

45
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,737
Don't.

46
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:08,466
What?

47
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:10,458
Actually, you wouldn't understand.

48
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,804
About Care Bears?

49
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,298
Parenthood.

50
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:14,473
No, no, you're totally right.

51
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:18,322
Every father talks to his little
girl before he commits a class H felony.

52
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,777
Absolutely normal, so sweet.

53
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:23,371
Hoyt, it's late.

54
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,893
4 minutes - it's not late.

55
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,398
Sensors are reset in 20,
4 minutes less from 20 is 16.

56
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,222
2 to enter, 3 for the wall,

57
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:35,468
10 to drill...

58
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,365
That puts us inside of 15 minutes.
That's not enough cushion.

59
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:41,504
Let's call it.

60
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:44,768
Dude is runnin' 5 minutes behind.
He's probably just takin' a dump.

61
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,336
We're not callin' it, we're good.

62
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:48,521
This is an ace boon swipe dung.

63
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:51,196
There's not another one of these
in the headlights for a long while.

64
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:53,930
I don't know.

65
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,359
Suddenly I'm not feeling so good.

66
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:57,434
Well then, relax.

67
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,903
Put on a little "Bad Moon Rising."

68
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:01,590
This is a Diamond Dog.

69
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,540
I'm in the mainframe now.

70
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,141
The blouse is open.

71
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,133
Undoing the bra strap now.

72
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,298
Fire alarms are down.

73
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:10,853
<i>Seismics are down.</i>

74
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,749
<i>Killin' the cameras now.</i>

75
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,096
<i>Good to go when you are.</i>

76
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:16,373
<i>Go radio silent 'til I say.</i>

77
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,097
The van's leaving.

78
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,406
Okay, fellas, as ready to rock as Riley's Diaphragm.

79
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,202
Really, Hoyt?

80
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,550
Sorry, Sugar.

81
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,206
Sir, I've go seismics, sounds like it blew a wall.

82
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,095
We got 'em.

83
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,586
It doesn't make any sense, it's too easy.

84
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,526
This crew doesn't do too easy.

85
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,087
3 minutes, guys.

86
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,167
Okay, let's go.

87
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,358
Okay, get 'er up.

88
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,661
- That's 3! Let's go!
- Move it!

89
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,734
Dude! Come on!

90
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:38,472
Okay, grab some extra stuff.

91
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,624
We're in tunnel now.

92
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,763
The proverbial hand is up the skirt,
headin' straight for the moose-knuckle.

93
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:06,719
Awesome.

94
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,581
That's why I love working with dudes.

95
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:12,179
It's all the clever variations you
can come up with for the word "vagina".

96
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:13,624
Vagina.

97
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:15,649
I need some air.

98
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:45,891
Drill's up. 3 minutes out.

99
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,597
They started drilling.

100
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:49,766
Wait... for my go.

101
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:20,112
Lock is out.

102
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,145
It's a go.

103
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:22,737
All right. We'll 'em.

104
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:43,138
Come on now, master at work.

105
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,769
You got 30 seconds.

106
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,233
Plenty of time.

107
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,250
Number 1's down.

108
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,949
You only got 15 seconds, come on.

109
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,718
Number 2, down.

110
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:08,569
Go!

111
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,146
- Clear!
- Clear!

112
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:15,008
What the hell's goin' on?

113
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,572
It doesn't make any sense.

114
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,192
They were casing this place for 3 weeks.

115
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:25,422
Seth! Get someone in that toy store!

116
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:26,737
Now!

117
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:30,933
We're in.

118
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:34,343
They're in the bank vault, Baby,
2 minutes until we're rich.

119
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,432
Jesus! Right!

120
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,392
It's like looking into heaven.

121
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,532
Stay focused!

122
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,950
Coming up on creepy toy store now.

123
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,908
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

124
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:53,933
<i>All clear.</i>

125
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,724
<i>Scary wall can't be now.</i>

126
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:01,070
<i>Common stage has not been breached.
Repeat, secondary the wall is intact.</i>

127
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,339
You know, I like bright, shiny things, Gummer.

128
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:06,878
This is the oldest and bright, shiny thing.

129
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:10,509
How much weight can you carry? Each one
of those bars weights 27 and a half pounds!

130
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,234
I played football

131
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:15,859
We got our 10 million right here.

132
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:18,851
Time!

133
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:24,435
Sir, I've got 500 meters of dark,
empty tunnel in front of me.

134
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,706
Somebody screwed up.

135
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,840
We're on the wrong block.

136
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,315
They're robbing the bank!

137
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,139
- Quick!
- Go! Go! Go!

138
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:48,748
Let's do it!

139
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,080
Bring that friggin' gear over here!

140
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:16,266
Get rid of the store!

141
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:19,779
Let's go! Let's go!

142
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,482
Go, go, go, go!!!

143
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:25,673
Open the door!

144
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,218
Let's go, Guys, c'mon, move it, let's go!

145
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:38,689
Go, go, go, go!!

146
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,176
...be in the vault!

147
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,236
Hey, what are you young fellas doing?

148
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,700
Just get moving!

149
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:57,504
- Did you have to hit him so hard?
- He saw our faces!

150
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,291
No. Put it down! No homicides!

151
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,183
No, I am not going back to prison, not again.

152
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,383
Fuck! In this bag for us to disappear,
no need for anymore jobs. Let's just go!

153
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,295
Come on, guys.
What the hell are they doing!

154
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,653
Damn!

155
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:18,772
I have been to prison, and I didn't like it.

156
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,673
In fact, I fuckin' hated it!

157
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:27,296
Oh, shit!

158
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:30,934
You shot me!

159
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:32,529
Let's find the back of this place.

160
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:36,125
Oh, my God!

161
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,016
Keep quiet!

162
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:39,875
What are you doing?

163
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,949
- What happened?
- Shawn shot me in the leg.

164
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,054
No, you shot me!

165
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,295
Oh, shit!

166
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,282
I left the money, I have to get the money!

167
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,177
What? No! We're heated!

168
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,818
Let's go, guys, come on, move it, let's go!

169
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:58,871
God!

170
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,157
This sucks!

171
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,219
I want this guy nailed!
Now everyone spread out!

172
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,281
- What the hell are you doing?
- He's on his own now, Baby.

173
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,547
No, Will!

174
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:16,451
Your rider's gone.

175
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:19,337
Hoyt! Hoyt!

176
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:27,625
Put your hands in the air!

177
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:31,655
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

178
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:59,130
All units, 217 on east side of Rampart.

179
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,571
Assault on 2 police officers.

180
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,379
Suspect has fled the scene of the police cruiser.

181
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:04,520
Oh, we got 'im!

182
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,776
There he is, straight ahead.

183
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:09,441
All units, Operaville and Burgundy.

184
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:31,713
On the upward ramp!

185
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:00,126
Shit!

186
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,536
God damn it!

187
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,581
Man! Don't shoot!

188
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:28,804
Get out of the way!

189
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:54,254
Bring out the money and yourself...slow.

190
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,191
Real slow.

191
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,859
Stop.
Turn around.

192
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,368
On your knees.

193
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,159
My wedding day.
The birth of my twins.

194
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:23,031
And now this.
Highlightsville. Fuckin' highlights.

195
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,710
Cuff him!

196
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:30,006
Hey! Where's the money?

197
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:38,043
Fletcher, you're doing well.

198
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,468
Hope you were raped every day.

199
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,181
Harlend wants to give you a lift.

200
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,503
He's not asking.

201
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:58,001
- Welcome home.
- Harlend.

202
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:04,602
- So, where to?
- Coronado and Prentiss.

203
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,663
So, how's the Federal penal system?

204
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,295
Not as tough as they say, huh?

205
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,975
- How's the wife?
- She's good.

206
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,191
- I guess.
- She left you?

207
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:31,647
- Four years ago.
- I'm sorry.

208
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,415
You ought to be.

209
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,421
Why did you pick me up, Harlend?

210
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:41,149
I thought you might pick up
where you left off.

211
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:46,623
- Now that you're free as a bird.
- Well, that's all behind me now.

212
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:52,002
You can probably afford to retire now with that
sizable withdrawal from Parish Community you made.

213
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:55,433
You knew, you got caught with that money,
you'd be lookin' at an extra 10 years,

214
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,673
so you ditched it somewhere.
And now that you're out,

215
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:03,479
I thought you'd go and get that 10 mill.
Aren't you, Will?

216
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:07,409
Much like a squirrel returning back to his
hoard after a long cold winter.

217
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:10,381
I'm not the squirrel playing
with his nuts here, Harlend.

218
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,594
I don't have the money.

219
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,621
You know that Vincent is dead, right?

220
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,971
I don't think he knows.
Do you, Agent Fletcher?

221
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:24,589
How does that make you feel?

222
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:28,752
He was my friend.

223
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:29,734
Yeah.

224
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,466
He had a tough time of it
after you left.

225
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,381
You being the brains behind the operation.

226
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,246
I guess he owed money to the wrong people.

227
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,781
Your ex-wife's place, huh?

228
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:51,381
- I'm not here for her.
- Do you really think your kid wants to see you?

229
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,377
I'm about to find out.

230
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,745
Grandma Harlend used to say,
"Love makes time pass,

231
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,883
but time is certain to make love pass."

232
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:05,479
Can I enjoy my day now?
Thanks for the lift.

233
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,119
Oh, Happy Fat Tuesday, Will.

234
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:18,619
I'm starting to think you liked the guy.

235
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,057
Admiring someone doesn't
mean you like him.

236
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:22,887
Let's go, Fletcher.

237
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:34,552
- What are you doing? You scared me.
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

238
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:35,833
I'm sorry.

239
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:41,703
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

240
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:43,613
I know I should have called,
I didn't have the number.

241
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:46,972
You look like your mom.
She's not here, is she?

242
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:48,964
She's in Shreveport.

243
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:52,228
- With Mr. Loeb?
- Yes, with David.

244
00:23:55,523 --> 00:24:00,141
This came for you this morning,
it was just left on the mat.

245
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:02,249
Thanks. Can we talk?

246
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,083
- I really should get going.
- Just for a few minutes.

247
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:17,927
I have something for you, I saw it
on the way in, reminded me of you.

248
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:29,737
Cool.

249
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,119
No one sets-out to be a criminal.

250
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,628
But through...
But through...

251
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:43,851
I've had so many conversations with you,
now that you're...

252
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,944
sitting across from me,

253
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,660
it's like my mind's going blank.

254
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,413
No one sets-out to be a criminal, Alison.

255
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,981
But through circumstances,
bad choices, needs...

256
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,101
unfor... unforeseeable obstacles,
unreliable friends,

257
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,416
dishonesty, life intervenes.

258
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,896
I not trying to justify it,
I'm not making excuses for it.

259
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:25,559
I was a bad man,
but I've... I've had eight long years

260
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,808
to get rid of that man.

261
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,753
To ready myself.

262
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,219
To get to know you.

263
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,228
I have to go.

264
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:51,933
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm late.

265
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,322
- Late for what?
- My shrink session.

266
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:58,658
- I go every Tuesday.
- Really?

267
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:05,496
Yeah, apparently I have abandonment issues.
Go figure.

268
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,363
I meant what I said, Alison.

269
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:28,031
Keep it!
I'm not seven anymore.

270
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,936
-Alison.
- Just go, please.

271
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:14,418
Thanks for the visual massage, Pete.

272
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:18,560
Riley, you are just too damn fine, girl.
And you don't give me the time of day.

273
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:21,470
How 'bout you call your wife and
see when you're available.

274
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:26,734
Ah, why do you gotta bring her up?
Talk about a buzz-kill. You have a good one.

275
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,130
You too.

276
00:27:28,992 --> 00:27:32,689
How is it that after eight years
you have only gotten younger?

277
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:39,127
Oh, God, Will!
I can't believe it.

278
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,017
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

279
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:44,031
You should have let me know,
I woulda come to pick you up.

280
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:46,794
It's all right, Agent Harlend was
kind enough to give me a lift.

281
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,501
You're kidding!
God, that guy needs to get laid like yesterday!

282
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:56,332
- Let me get you a drink. Tequila?
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,577
What the hell, Riley, you're
working in a cop bar?

284
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:04,332
Yeah, well, you know, it's a good way
to guarantee I don't go back to wrong.

285
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,818
"Back to wrong"?

286
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,769
Yeah, self-restraint was never my strong suit.

287
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,834
I'm honored to be your first stop.

288
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:21,068
- Actually I dropped by Alison's first.
- Ooh! And how is she?

289
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,916
Not as honored.

290
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,207
Don't worry, Will, she'll come 'round.
I missed you, Will.

291
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:32,633
You know, I never got to thank
you after all that with Vin.

292
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,632
Don't mention it.

293
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,726
I wasn't allowed to come visit,
my lawyer wouldn't let me, and um...

294
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,835
- Harlend never really stopped sniffing around.
- I know, I know.

295
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,030
But you not ratting us out,
really means something to me, Will.

296
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,876
Like I said...

297
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:51,514
You coulda ratted-out Hoyt though,
that I wouldn't have minded.

298
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:55,397
Which... yeah, yeah,
I'm looking for that guy.

299
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:57,692
And I take it you heard about Vince?

300
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,630
- Yeah, it's terrible.
- Yeah, I mean he went really dark.

301
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,734
Well, I mean, do they know who killed him?

302
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:12,148
No, I don't think so, He was hangin'
out with a sketchy crowd, you know.

303
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:17,930
- Looking for the new "you" I suppose.
- It's good to see you again, Riley.

304
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:26,529
I think we woke-up your package.

305
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:33,300
Riley, give Jake a tap.

306
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:36,989
- Two beers.
- Be right back.

307
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:46,516
Hello.

308
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:49,141
<i>Hello, Will Montgomery.</i>

309
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,529
Who is this?

310
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:59,587
<i>You don't recognize my voice, Gum?</i>

311
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,052
<i>Yeah, I wanted to be
there for ya at the prison.</i>

312
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:02,966
Vincent?

313
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,785
<i>Give you a welcome you when you got out,
but you know how it is, time just slipped away.</i>

314
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:11,575
Well, Hallelujah, man, you're alive.
Shit! You know what?

315
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:13,304
Everybody's tellin' me you're dead.

316
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:17,425
<i>Well, that depends on how you're
interpretation of the word "dead".</i>

317
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:19,976
<i>I'm clearly not "living".</i>

318
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,996
Where are you, can we meet?
How are you?

319
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,998
The years you've been gone
have not been kind to me, Gum.

320
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,776
Constantly running from loan sharks, the Feds.

321
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,938
<i>Broker than a dead-dick dog
that couldn't get another swipe.</i>

322
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:38,868
- I AM sorry to hear about that.
- You listen to me, Gum.

323
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:43,048
- I have waited eight years for this.
- Go ahead.

324
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,677
I had to change my name,
erase everything.

325
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,486
And then, that little matter
of the bullet in my leg.

326
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:50,179
A constant, friendly reminder

327
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:52,884
<i>of the partner who
ruined my life that night.</i>

328
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:55,465
Come on, man! Really, we gonna go back there?

329
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:57,490
- You did that to yourself.
- Semantics.

330
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:01,243
I want my share! I want MY share

331
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,864
<i>of the 10 million dollars</i>

332
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,880
<i>that was going to
change our lives forever.</i>

333
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:06,862
Vinny, there is no cash.

334
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:12,716
I had a feeling you'd say that, Gum.

335
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:15,997
I burned it just before
Harlend got to me.

336
00:31:16,422 --> 00:31:18,199
No. Stop it!

337
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,976
<i>It's true.</i>

338
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:24,181
- What's taking so long?
- Hold on.

339
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,339
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

340
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,707
<i>Who... who..</i>

341
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:29,331
- that voice, who is that?
- That's right, you don't know.

342
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:31,554
I'm a cab driver now.

343
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:36,080
My fare is this sweet little girl
trying to get to her shrink's office

344
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,061
so she can discuss her "daddy issues"

345
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:43,493
and how they have manifested into
an unhealthy disdain for the world at large.

346
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,652
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hold on, please, Gum.

347
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:51,775
All right, Miss, terrible Fat Tuesday traffic.
Be there in a jiffy.

348
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:54,307
See how it lays?

349
00:31:54,475 --> 00:32:01,277
<i>Now, Gum, it all depends on whether or not you're
gonna stick to your story about the burnt cash.</i>

350
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,016
You touch her and I'll take you down
the Levy and kick your fuckin' ass.

351
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,009
I don't know if you heard what I just said,
but this all depends on you.

352
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,503
VINCENT!

353
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:22,080
He's on the move.

354
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,448
Where are we going?

355
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,132
- What are we doing, why are we in here?
- I hope you understand this is not my preference.

356
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,770
Help me! No! Help!

357
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:58,900
I'm considering your father
an elemental end to your suffering.

358
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:05,715
But you see, Alison,
I've got a sickness.

359
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:07,358
I'm not well.

360
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:12,091
Your father abandoned me in my time of need

361
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,387
so I know what it is to
to be in the position you're in.

362
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,951
Really, I do. I know what it is to be
left high and dry by Will Montgomery.

363
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:25,946
And you and me...we are kindred spirits.

364
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:28,886
And I am going to make him pay for the both of us.

365
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:42,462
Relax!

366
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:51,534
Where's Alison?

367
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:54,492
Did you change your mind or are you
still sticking with that bullshit story?

368
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,461
Can I talk to her?

369
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:56,743
Alison.

370
00:33:57,155 --> 00:34:00,200
She's waiting for you to decide
whether she's going to remain fine.

371
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,302
Vincent, don't do this.

372
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:06,572
I'm  hangin' up now.

373
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,666
No, no! Wait! Okay! Wait! I can get it.

374
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,618
<i>I can get the money. I just need time.</i>

375
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:13,281
<i>It's not here.</i>

376
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:16,533
It's in Tuscaloosa, my lawyer has it.

377
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,557
In a truck, so I need 24 hours.

378
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:21,374
You got 12.

379
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:24,998
<i>A phone in your hand. I'll be
tracking you with it at all times.</i>

380
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:27,163
8 rings! 8 rings and you pick it up!

381
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:31,367
You miss a single phone call from me, Alison doesn't live.

382
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:32,023
Vincent.

383
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:35,137
This is my last chance to
to dance, Buddy.

384
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:38,946
You haven't seen me recently.
Let's just say I've got 2 left feet.

385
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,837
<i>Hello. Vincent!</i>

386
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:43,310
Hello.

387
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:33,996
- I need to get a phone.
- I'm sorry, Sir, you're gonna have to wait.

388
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,220
- Excuse me, Ma'am, I really need a phone.
- Sir, I will be with you in a moment.

389
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,412
- How much is this one?
- 29.99.

390
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:46,560
Want your change?

391
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:58,705
Passenger service to Tuscaloosa
now boarding platform 2.

392
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,710
Help, get me out of here.

393
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,182
Fletcher, I can't hear you.

394
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:14,139
You lost him on his first morning out. Shit!

395
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:18,122
- Will Montgomery is here for you.
- Send him in.

396
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:23,021
So your dead, former partner Vincent Kinsey

397
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,455
has kidnapped your daughter and
is holding her somewhere in New Orleans?

398
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,924
- In a cab.
- The cab, yes, that's right. In the cab, yeah.

399
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:29,319
And what does he want in return?

400
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:32,781
- 10 Million dollars.
- 10 Million dollars.

401
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:38,409
- Remind me why that's a familiar figure.
- I burned the cash.

402
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:48,149
Just before you grabbed me.
That's the God's honest truth.

403
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,956
'Cause I knew I'd get less
time if I ditched the money.

404
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:55,806
I don't have it but he has my daughter
and I need your help.

405
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:00,103
Why would I be here if I had the money?

406
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:02,056
I would just pay Vincent off and
get my little girl back.

407
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:03,519
This is how I see it, Will.

408
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:08,149
You're a thief, a crook and a scumbag,
but you're also a very clever tree frog.

409
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:12,350
So you concoct this "Kinsey is alive and
has snatched my kid" fantasy

410
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:16,834
so that A, you can show that you don't have the
money otherwise why wouldn't you pay the ransom,

411
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:22,515
or B, send us running around all over town
searching for your daughter and her abductor

412
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:25,369
to afford you the time to dig-up the dough

413
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:28,727
and jump onto a cigarette boat
and zip-down to the Bahamas

414
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,504
where you can sip rum for the rest of your days

415
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:34,404
and listen to classic rock

416
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:38,332
played by bands with muscular guitarists
and dead drummers.

417
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:43,906
Ah, my faithful buddy.

418
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:46,748
Couldn't find a couch in the living room.

419
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,363
This is Vincent's file.

420
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:53,198
The prints match as you can see.

421
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:56,064
They cut his body up before they burnt it.

422
00:38:56,103 --> 00:39:00,404
We managed to get the prints of
a few fingers that survived the fire.

423
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,503
- We can visit his grave if you want.
- No, we can't

424
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,602
because he's alive. He faked his own death.

425
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:10,823
Please, Tim, I'm running out of time.

426
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:14,285
I'm not being played by you again, Will.

427
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,777
All right, let's go.

428
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,215
Please help me.

429
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,630
Escort our pal out of the building, will ya?

430
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,773
A little help, guys.

431
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:35,139
Will Montgomery, on behalf of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

432
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,842
I'd like to thank you for stopping by today.

433
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,276
Hold up, hold up.

434
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,003
Harlend thinks you're some
kind of criminal mastermind.

435
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,244
A criminal mastermind?

436
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:58,009
I don't share this belief because criminal
masterminds don't go away for eight year jolts.

437
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,710
Or do they?

438
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,006
One more, please.

439
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,188
Thank you.

440
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:33,635
We called Montgomery's ex home and cell.
Both voicemails say she's out of town.

441
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:39,215
Have you tried his
daughter's cell phone?

442
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,618
Right, it says the account's been suspended
2 weeks per request of the stepfather.

443
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,308
I think I'll call local PD on it.

444
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,903
If she has been kidnapped,
we're FBI, we do something about it.

445
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,542
- You don't think he's telling the truth?
- No, I do not.

446
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,876
Hey! Is there anybody out there?

447
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:32,245
Jacobs.

448
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,836
Crap.

449
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:47,625
We have a problem.

450
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,698
That's good.
All right, well, keep trackin' 'im to Tuscaloosa.

451
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,110
If he deviates from the route
let me know.

452
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:43,555
You're are exactly the woman
I want to see in clothes that tight.

453
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:54,389
The only thing with any balls to
cover this town was The Hurricane.

454
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:57,268
Get away from the car!

455
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:01,229
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cab's off duty.

456
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:06,003
G'day, Mate, how ya doin'?
Look, look, I just gotta get to the...

457
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:07,275
The cab's off duty, man.

458
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,520
Yeah, Mate?. I just gotta catch
up with these chicks that I met...

459
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,264
Hey!

460
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:14,636
Please? Good on ya, Mate.

461
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:18,932
Help.

462
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,631
I haven't had my dong a dip since I got here, eh.

463
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,466
One of them was preg as heck.
Yeah, I know.

464
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,916
Mate, I better get of this blow.
This cabby's gonna chuck a wobbly.

465
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,385
All right, Mate, so, let me tell
you about those sheilas, eh.

466
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,898
So, the pregnant one is sayin
nice things to ya, I really don't know why.

467
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,918
But made me realize a guy that
was violent cab on a kit plant race.

468
00:43:55,781 --> 00:43:59,792
What the hell, the chicks are quite
different in New Orleans, eh, Mate?

469
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,316
New Orleans, it all comes back.

470
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,464
Heard you kid by the name King Louis 15?

471
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,393
King Louis 15 he don't know all this.

472
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:14,820
- Frenchman to cross the ocean to visit.
- It wasn't happening.

473
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,760
So in order to get some use out of it

474
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:21,131
finally he starts shippin' over
boatloads of French prisoners.

475
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,598
That was coal up your ass, bugger.

476
00:44:24,243 --> 00:44:29,946
Thieves, gamblers, prostitutes, murderers,
pirates, gypsies, pickpockets.

477
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:33,156
and psychopaths.

478
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:36,438
Is this me stop?

479
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,279
Those were the pioneers of this land.

480
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:50,595
And the forefathers of this town.

481
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:54,479
That you so casually dismissed.

482
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:22,326
All computers in this building are tracked.

483
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:26,462
This is the page that corresponds to the
exact moment in the video where he stops.

484
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:34,063
This is Agent Harlend, I need an assault
team at Apartment 9, 23 St. Claude.

485
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,771
Ya hear me! Shut up, stupid, stupid dog.

486
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,609
I'm gonna skin you and make
a pair of shoes out of you.

487
00:45:57,649 --> 00:46:02,152
I hate you and your owner.
Shut up.

488
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,448
- Jesus, Will!
- Shut up. Drop the bag.

489
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:11,267
That's my lunch.

490
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,832
- And that's my gun.
- Drop the bag.

491
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:23,306
That's for the last ten years.

492
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,157
- Where's Vincent?
- Vincent? Vincent's dead, man.

493
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:34,683
- Try again.
- I swear, I swear on my life.

494
00:46:34,717 --> 00:46:35,414
I haven't seen Vincent...

495
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:38,369
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it's
not your brains you care about.

496
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:43,211
A bullet to the stomach is the most painful.
And it takes hours to die.

497
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:46,069
Okay, look, look, look,
Mate, what do you want to know?

498
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:47,756
What does he have you doing?

499
00:46:48,332 --> 00:46:51,529
Nothing, baby, gee, you know,
bags drops, recons, stuff like that.

500
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:54,007
He told me to drop off the phone
for you so I dropped off the phone.

501
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,653
And my daughter? My daughter?!?

502
00:46:57,173 --> 00:47:00,008
You know, the whole bottom fell out of
our operation when you went away, Will.

503
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:02,130
I mean, look around you, does it look
like I'm puttin' on the Ritz here?

504
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:04,524
We want our share, just our share.

505
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:14,890
So help me God, Hoyt, you tell me where she is,
or I'll blow your lunch all over this carpet.

506
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:20,244
He's  drivin' around with her,
in the trunk of his cab.

507
00:47:20,494 --> 00:47:23,746
- In the trunk?
- And I gotta be honest with you, Will, 'cause

508
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:26,259
I didn't think the taking of
your daughter part was right.

509
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:31,210
I mean, bad idea to steal from
America's greatest bank robber.

510
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:42,416
After he had lost the leg,
something changed in him, Will.

511
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:46,467
He said he just felt numb to
everything, numb like a statue.

512
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:51,615
And he blames that on you, Will.
He blames the leg on you,

513
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:54,927
so he also blames the numb on you.

514
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:18,507
Go.

515
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,971
Let the squirrels squabble,
then we'll go after their hoard.

516
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:54,061
Hold it!

517
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:08,980
Let's go!

518
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:24,422
Will, stop.

519
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:03,557
Street level! Go!.

520
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,182
What the hell are you doing?

521
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,502
Man, are you listening, tapioca?

522
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:21,862
Just go, please.

523
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:24,491
Medallion.

524
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:43,262
License and registration, please.

525
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:46,731
Do you know why I pulled you over?

526
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:51,180
- I do not.
- Your brake light's out.

527
00:51:52,213 --> 00:51:54,340
- What's funny?
- Nothing, it's just...

528
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,889
it's Mardi Gras, and the streets
are filled with drunken lunatics

529
00:51:57,974 --> 00:52:01,275
and you pull me over for a broke, brake light.

530
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,065
Help.

531
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,488
That reminds me of my father
who's dying of bone cancer.

532
00:52:06,613 --> 00:52:10,895
all day he'd bitch about the nick he
got on his chin from shaving that morning.

533
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,402
I know what you're thinking:
Why would a dying man shave?

534
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:19,623
No, I wasn't thinking that at all.

535
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:22,648
Get this vehicle back to the barn
and get that light taken care of.

536
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,601
Please, can you hear me?

537
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:30,926
Because he had tremendous vanity.

538
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:38,010
Sir, you mind coming around
here and open the trunk?

539
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:45,338
He did not go gently, my father.
He screamed a lot.

540
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:49,010
The pain was agonizing, searing.

541
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:54,523
- Eels squirming through his veins.
- Buddy, I don't really give a damn.

542
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:39,676
Somebody help me.

543
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,412
Somebody please help me.

544
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:47,590
C'mon, you look more like him than I thought.

545
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:49,856
- No.
- You don't remember me?

546
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:52,754
You were young, Princess,
and I did look a little different.

547
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:56,073
I had all my fingers then and both legs.

548
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:00,358
Nice fingers, sweetie.

549
00:54:00,441 --> 00:54:03,296
You know that the FBI, they use these
little lines in order to find people.

550
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:05,099
Until they were looking for me, anyway.

551
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:08,516
But, one day, I came up with a plan.

552
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:12,241
Yeah, I dug up a body, see, it wasn't hard,
the resemblance was reasonable.

553
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:17,498
Then I cut him up into small pieces,
and added a little bit of myself to the mix.

554
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:22,361
I was a Golden Boy, dollface,
now I'm a freakin' Picasso.

555
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,721
And don't ever mess with my lights again.

556
00:54:35,923 --> 00:54:38,201
What are you looking at, shrimp?

557
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:47,321
Listen, brother, take the cab, take the money and
take the cab, I don't give a crap, but don't take me.

558
00:54:47,365 --> 00:54:48,609
- What is this?
- It's a meter.

559
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,479
No, I know what a meter is, asshole.
Not that, this.

560
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:54,238
This, GPS, everyone has 'em,
in case the cars are stolen.

561
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,721
- Tells you their location?
- Within a few blocks, yes.

562
00:54:56,806 --> 00:54:58,526
Okay, call your dispatch.

563
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:03,719
Man, you have got to clean out that backseat,
before you sign-off tonight.

564
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:08,000
Yesterday I had to put on a biohazard suit,
hip-waders, and rubber gloves

565
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:10,767
and I got the garden hoe and
scraped that crap outta there.

566
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:15,429
Looked like boogers or jalapeno jelly, asshole.

567
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:18,496
- I got a question for you.
- 9 inches.

568
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,082
And it can reload after 14 minutes and a tickle.

569
00:55:21,128 --> 00:55:22,066
<i>What else do you want to know?</i>

570
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:23,437
About the driver.

571
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,844
<i>Is this about me docking you pay
again on account that fender-bender,</i>

572
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:29,920
the same policy applies for
everybody and I ain't lippin'

573
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:35,682
- No, it's not about that.
- A white guy with a fake leg.

574
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,883
- It is a white man with a fake leg.
- Maybe missing some fingers.

575
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,728
- Really?
- Tell him.

576
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:42,486
And maybe missing some fingers.

577
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,639
Are you messin' with me today?

578
00:55:45,671 --> 00:55:47,170
<i>Whatchya want him fo?</i>

579
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,683
He cuts me off at the light.

580
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,243
<i>You think I give a snot, huh?</i>

581
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,725
Tell him he's stealing money,
you saw him pocketing fares.

582
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:56,006
- He's stealin' fares, pocketed.
- Wait!

583
00:55:56,049 --> 00:56:00,763
<i>Are you saying that this creepy, limpin' bastard
be runnin' around snitchin' my dough.</i>

584
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:03,368
- Get his location.
- Where is he right now?

585
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:07,929
- Whatchya wanna know dat fo?
- I confront him for you, get the truth.

586
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:15,325
- You would do that for me, Bertrand?
- You're a good boss.

587
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:19,825
In the French Quarter,

588
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:21,372
<i>Bugundy and St. Philip.</i>

589
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:26,166
- Thank you.
- Well done, get his medallion number.

590
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:28,841
- And his medallion number.
- Man.

591
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:32,520
He a freaky disk, dis guy, you best
be careful there, Berty Boy.

592
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,602
- Get out
- It's all yours, brother.

593
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:40,624
<i>It's 5-KILO-2-0.</i>

594
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:42,603
Again, that's 5-K-20.

595
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:44,368
Thanks, pal.

596
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:49,532
Lookie here, did you just turn
white on me all of a sudden?

597
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,007
Who dat is?

598
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:44,811
Do you remember where we dropped off Montgomery?
His daughter's address.

599
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:48,057
- Yeah, it's Coronado and something.
- Prentiss.

600
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:53,231
Boss, we got a matching Montgomery's
description just jacked a cab 5 blocks from here.

601
00:57:53,698 --> 00:57:57,523
Get this, the cabby said he was sweating about
a guy missing a leg and his fingers.

602
00:57:57,777 --> 00:58:00,129
The tracking is throwing the
cab back into the Quarter.

603
00:59:26,504 --> 00:59:28,295
- Don't hurt me, man.
- Who's cab is this?

604
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:31,304
It's mine, but that ain't my number.

605
00:59:33,063 --> 00:59:34,417
Open the trunk.

606
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:37,784
There he is, we got him.

607
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:42,415
What, that's someone else's GPS.

608
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:46,859
Montgomery!
Put your god damned knees on the ground.

609
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:49,904
Will Montgomery you are under
arrest for violation of parole,

610
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:53,980
illegally accessing confidential
FBI records, assaulting a federal agent,

611
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,738
and resisting arrest.

612
00:59:56,266 --> 00:59:58,982
- We're bringin' him back now.
- You gotta listen to me.

613
00:59:59,026 --> 01:00:01,464
- No, we don't.
- He's going to kill her.

614
01:00:01,507 --> 01:00:05,502
Oh, it's a neat story, Vincent Kinsey
has come back from the dead. Yeah.

615
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:11,185
Hey, if I were comin' back from the dead
it wouldn't be for daughter killin',

616
01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:14,898
it'd be to go to Rick's Cabaret
to see some naked ladies.

617
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:19,057
- I gotta take that.
- Ah, ya want me to take a message?

618
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:22,745
- I've got only eight rings to pick up that call.
- Hey, hey, sit back.

619
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:01,749
Hello?

620
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:05,582
I'm here.

621
01:01:10,684 --> 01:01:12,084
I'm here.

622
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:14,864
You're really comin' down to the
wire on this one, eh, Gum?

623
01:01:14,865 --> 01:01:17,184
We're gonna have trouble getting out of your pocket?

624
01:01:18,113 --> 01:01:20,988
I'm not, I just... I just...

625
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:22,626
Sounds like you're out of breath.

626
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:24,193
<i>Tell me something, Gum.</i>

627
01:01:24,273 --> 01:01:26,468
What's the scenery like down there in Tuscaloosa?

628
01:01:26,634 --> 01:01:28,544
I always wanted to take that ride along the Gulf.

629
01:01:28,593 --> 01:01:30,072
I don't have it.

630
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:34,070
And better yet, why don't you tell me how Hoyt's
doing since that's where you were anyway.

631
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:35,634
I don't have the money.

632
01:01:36,595 --> 01:01:38,631
What did I say to you about lying to me?

633
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:41,355
I'm sorry, I just... I just...

634
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:44,631
- Your daughter's dead.
- No, wait, wait!

635
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:47,873
You really don't have it, do you?

636
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:51,790
- I'll get you the money.
- Good.

637
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:53,392
May I ask how?

638
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:59,027
We're going back to "wrong".

639
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:11,834
You got a real 40 went down the alley,
okay, we gotta set-up a perimeter.

640
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:13,511
Move! Clear out!

641
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,486
Hello?

642
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,102
What's going on?
Where are the Feds at?

643
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:54,477
- There's no time, Vincent's alive.
- What? What are you talking about?

644
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:57,918
He wants 10 million dollars, he wants it
in 3 hours and he has Alison.

645
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,098
Oh, my God!

646
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:04,191
The bank we robbed that night,
there was something else in that vault,

647
01:04:04,284 --> 01:04:07,481
a gold reserve, it must've been 100 million, easy.

648
01:04:07,522 --> 01:04:09,480
There's no way you can walk in there

649
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:13,274
and steal 10 million dollars worth of
gold bricks in the middle of the business day.

650
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:15,594
That's why I need your help.

651
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:19,255
- I already told you, this isn't my life anymore.
- I know, I know.

652
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:22,484
- And it's not yours either.
- He's going to kill her.

653
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:29,239
I can... I can hear it in his voice,
He's not the same person.

654
01:04:31,646 --> 01:04:33,841
He's gonna kill my little girl.

655
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,402
- Are you LeFleur?
- Yes, Sir, I am. LeFleur, yes, Sir.

656
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,207
A guy jacked your cab a little while ago,
he was looking for someone.

657
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:09,368
Well, he was looking fo dat Mog...
Jimmy Morgan, Sir.

658
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:11,764
Be a peach and show me his hack license, will ya.

659
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:15,339
Yes, officer, Sir.
I'll look it up for you, Inspector.

660
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:19,288
He been with us two years, never any problem.

661
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:20,807
Although...

662
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:25,559
He do scare my kids when they come
to visit their daddy at work.

663
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:28,125
More kids are in their twenties.

664
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:33,369
That's him, Kinsey.

665
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,170
Much obliged. Let's go!

666
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,169
Fat Tuesday, everybody go crazy.

667
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,444
We're 6 blocks away from the bank,
do you realize that?

668
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:36,923
Have a little faith.

669
01:06:39,393 --> 01:06:42,482
I considered doing this for the last eight years.

670
01:07:19,496 --> 01:07:21,409
30 meters, then we go left.

671
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:31,933
Montgomery doesn't have the money,
but he NEEDS the money.

672
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:34,093
Which means he's got only one play to make.

673
01:08:34,182 --> 01:08:37,937
Give me a list of every bank that he stepped
into in the City of New Orleans.

674
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:41,458
My guess is one of them is
going to step into the game.

675
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:54,057
We're through.

676
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:58,418
- 5 minutes 'til the alarm.
- Is that going to be enough?

677
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:08,382
Here it comes.

678
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:55,428
Fire alarm just went off
at Parrish Community Bank.

679
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:57,305
That's him! Get up there now!

680
01:10:03,468 --> 01:10:05,187
Hurry up, boys!

681
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,311
The alarm will have
triggered by now, we gotta go.

682
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:27,830
Just wanna see if I can get
a little more gold out of it.

683
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:03,591
Would you hurry up, Sir?

684
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:07,550
Come on, Will, we gotta go.

685
01:11:10,494 --> 01:11:12,006
Come on!

686
01:11:25,752 --> 01:11:28,124
What do you know.

687
01:12:08,256 --> 01:12:10,294
So you worked all this out in the prison?

688
01:12:11,097 --> 01:12:12,498
I was bored.

689
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,311
Boss! Hey! Listen to this.

690
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:17,936
Say again.

691
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:19,326
<i>We have the key suspects.</i>

692
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,768
<i>They're in Riley's truck on North Peters
heading towards the ferry.</i>

693
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:23,849
Do not take them until
they're off the ferry,

694
01:12:23,858 --> 01:12:26,656
<i>I repeat, do not take them
until they're off the ferry.</i>

695
01:12:26,814 --> 01:12:28,769
We take 'em now, we got 'em boxed in.

696
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:30,514
If you want to corner a weasel,
this is the one that got bit.

697
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:32,160
Boss, I hope you
know what you're doing.

698
01:12:32,195 --> 01:12:33,992
Takes only eight minutes to get
across the river in that ferry.

699
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:36,019
Wait for "strength in numbers".

700
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,463
And when we get Montgomery, he'll
be as red-handed as the boy who put

701
01:12:39,464 --> 01:12:42,945
his palm on the gas stove to
see how hot it really was.

702
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:44,191
Okay.

703
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:54,853
Don't make a move until all 4 wheels
touch Louisiana soil.

704
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:56,414
<i>Copy that.</i>

705
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:26,301
Hands in the air. In the air, now!

706
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:31,412
Happy Fat Tuesday, officer.

707
01:14:25,186 --> 01:14:30,045
Come on, come on, come on, get up! Get out!

708
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:34,464
<i>Time's is up, good buddy.</i>

709
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,096
I've got it.

710
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:39,015
I am impressed.

711
01:14:39,097 --> 01:14:41,049
Do you listen to a little
Creedence before you went in?

712
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:45,098
No, I didn't listen to CCR, that didn't
work out so well the last time, did it?

713
01:14:47,307 --> 01:14:50,381
- I missed you, old buddy.
- I want to talk to her.

714
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,437
No, you'll talk to her when I get me the money.

715
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:54,644
I want to talk to my daughter NOW!

716
01:14:54,645 --> 01:14:56,620
<i>I want to hear her voice NOW!</i>

717
01:14:56,835 --> 01:14:59,080
- It's your father.
- Hello.

718
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:02,711
- Allison, Alison, did he hurt you?
- No.

719
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:04,778
<i>But he scares me.</i>

720
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:07,063
I gonna be there soon, honey,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

721
01:15:07,098 --> 01:15:08,948
<i>This is my fault.</i>

722
01:15:09,987 --> 01:15:13,568
Get my money to the fairgrounds NOW!

723
01:15:28,035 --> 01:15:28,936
Sorry, boss.

724
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:32,889
Finally thought I recognized the
skills of Will Montgomery, huh?

725
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:34,993
Do you have those listings
from the cab's dispatcher.

726
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,010
GPS breakdowns, why?

727
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:41,139
I told you Kinsey ditched his GPS in the
back of the cab in the French Quarter.

728
01:15:41,312 --> 01:15:44,190
I'm not interested in todays,
I want to see the last few weeks.

729
01:15:44,232 --> 01:15:45,666
Kinsey gonna get the money from Montgomery

730
01:15:45,753 --> 01:15:49,705
then he's gonna have some kind of
neutral rendezvous, and if that's the case

731
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:51,111
he's been casing it for weeks.

732
01:15:51,192 --> 01:15:53,831
Uptown, Lakefront, Beauvoir, Broadmoor, West Bank.

733
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:56,790
Beauvoir? Isn't that the fairground?

734
01:15:56,872 --> 01:15:59,321
Yeah, I think so.
20 minutes from out of town.

735
01:16:00,276 --> 01:16:01,355
Doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.

736
01:16:01,373 --> 01:16:03,868
It's the dough, Boss,
we'll actually catch this prick.

737
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:43,169
Where's Allison?

738
01:16:46,316 --> 01:16:48,897
In the trunk?

739
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:55,596
- You look good, Will. Same.
- Where is she?

740
01:16:56,266 --> 01:16:59,257
She's safe.

741
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:21,272
The money. Hand her over.

742
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,287
I said hand her over!

743
01:17:26,873 --> 01:17:30,152
You got the money, you win!
Vincent!

744
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,659
Over a janitor.

745
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:38,490
You piss away 14 years of friendship
over an old man janitor?

746
01:17:38,718 --> 01:17:41,415
We're not killers.

747
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:45,834
- Well, maybe not then.
- None of this has anything to do with my daughter.

748
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:52,011
But it does, Will, because you TRULY love Alison.

749
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,456
And in that single act of
betrayal 8 years ago, YOU

750
01:17:56,541 --> 01:18:01,934
destroy the only thing I ever truly loved.

751
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:05,378
Me.

752
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:13,538
No! No!

753
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:19,997
Daddy! Daddy, please!

754
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,881
Get me out of here.

755
01:18:32,984 --> 01:18:35,736
Help.

756
01:18:38,849 --> 01:18:41,508
Daddy, hurry, it's hot in here.

757
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,427
Help.

758
01:18:57,264 --> 01:18:59,948
No.

759
01:19:47,387 --> 01:19:50,044
Help.

760
01:20:54,554 --> 01:20:57,179
I got you, I got you.

761
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,372
Forehead. You're bleeding.

762
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:44,549
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

763
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:52,376
I don't want to be alone, so don't die.
Don't die, please.

764
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,869
Somebody help us.

765
01:21:59,076 --> 01:22:01,466
No, you can't die.

766
01:22:02,438 --> 01:22:04,588
Just stay with me.

767
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:15,455
They're coming, they're coming, hang in there.
Over here! Over here!

768
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:18,148
There.

769
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,780
It's gonna be okay.

770
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:43,081
No, no, no, he can't die.
You gotta save him.

771
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,476
Come on, let's get him out of here.

772
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:03,594
You gonna send him back to jail?

773
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:08,642
Now, why would I do that? I'm sure that
Vincent Kinsey stole that gold. Take her up!

774
01:23:11,604 --> 01:23:15,041
- Alison.
- I'm here, Dad.

775
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:13,280
Hi, Dad.

776
01:24:13,365 --> 01:24:14,766
I'll call a HAZMAT team.

777
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:16,878
- Why?
- You're cooking again.

778
01:24:18,807 --> 01:24:20,924
Wake me up if something happens.

779
01:24:38,929 --> 01:24:40,884
You ever clean your truck?

780
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:48,054
Honey, can you flip the shrimp in 3 minutes?

781
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:51,923
- Let go of control, Dad, I got it.
- I'm letting go.

782
01:24:57,351 --> 01:25:00,185
Definitely north of 3 hundred thousand dollars.

783
01:25:00,688 --> 01:25:02,838
The house could use a new roof and kitchen...

784
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:07,082
He's got it! He's got that missing 10 pounds of gold.
That's what they're talking about.

785
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,930
- That something enough for you?
- Yeah, that is something.

786
01:25:10,704 --> 01:25:14,089
<i>- Well, if you take that gold...
- I know, I know, they'll nail me.</i>

787
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:15,686
I can't see his lips.

788
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:18,815
<i>I'm gonna disappear it in... in the mud.</i>

789
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:24,058
<i>There.</i>

790
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:27,782
He's not going to throw it.

791
01:25:27,817 --> 01:25:30,081
He just might and if he does wink I'll jack 'im.

792
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:31,923
- Don't throw it.
- Look.

793
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:37,726
- Don't do it!
- Do it!

794
01:25:37,761 --> 01:25:40,934
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Do it!

795
01:25:46,564 --> 01:25:47,884
Yeah, sure! Keep it!

796
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:52,818
Sell it, get rich.
And then go back to jail.

797
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:59,040
No. All right.
Goin' in.

798
01:26:10,134 --> 01:26:16,209
Oh, thank you, Will.
I'll return to my life now.
