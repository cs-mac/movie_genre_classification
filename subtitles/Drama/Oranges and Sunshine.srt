1
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
<i>Sue, right now,
your baby needs to be safe</i>

2
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,354
<i>and you need a bit of support,
don't you?</i>

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,437
<i>I know you love her. Of course you do.</i>

4
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,234
<i>But this will give you a chance
to sort yourself out.</i>

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,068
<i>I couldn't get on top of it,
with everything...</i>

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,360
Don't, Margaret. Don't take her.

7
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Do you want to put her down, Sue?

8
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,880
Just put her in the carrycot.

9
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,438
You all right, love?

10
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,553
Yeah?

11
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,440
Put her down.

12
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,440
There you go.

13
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
You'll be able to see her tomorrow.

14
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
I'll take you to her and you'll be able
to see that she's fine.

15
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,311
Whoa, darling.

16
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't!

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Don't! Please! Margaret, please!

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,350
I'll do better, I will!

19
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
The thing I love about this group

20
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,720
is that you don't have to
explain yourself here.

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,920
We've all been adopted as kids

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,040
and OK, we've all had different
experiences after that,

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,237
but it's a big bottom line, isn't it?

24
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,590
Anyway, I'm glad to be here tonight.
I don't mind telling you.

25
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,676
I've been getting a lot of grief at work.

26
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,473
Things have been getting me down, really.

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,512
Been feeling a bit, a bit lonely.

28
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,438
You know, when you always think

29
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,756
is it because of what happened
when I was a kid?

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,792
You know, maybe I'll never be right.

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,798
But you can't always know that,
can you?

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,673
You just... you just always wonder...

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Is this where the Triangle Group is?

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes, that's right,
but we've finished for the night.

35
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,440
Charlotte. Charlotte Cooper.

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Can I have a quick word?
It won't take a minute.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
Well, what you're looking for
isn't really what this group does.

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,320
This is a local support group, really.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,840
I might be able to refer you to somebody
who'd be able to offer you counselling.

40
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,200
I don't want counselling.
I want to find out who I am.

41
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Well, this isn't really the way to...

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
I don't even know if my name
and birth date are right.

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,680
I remember leaving England -
I was four years old -

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,440
I was in a children's home
because my parents were dead.

45
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
They sent me in a boat to Australia.

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
All I know for certain is
I was born in Nottingham.

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,640
What do you mean
they put you on a boat?

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,280
They put us all on a boat for Oz.
Hundreds of us.

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Your adoptive parents were emigrating?

50
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,280
No. No parents, no guardians.

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
Just a couple of hundred kids,
they sent us away.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,960
- That can't be right.
- What do you mean?

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,240
It's simply not legal. There's no way
a group of unaccompanied children

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,277
would be shipped off like that.
- You calling me a liar?

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,833
No, of course not.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,836
That is the one thing I know...

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,680
I know about who I am.

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,400
Don't you tell me that's not true.

59
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,000
OK, look. I can see you're upset.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
Why don't you come to my office
on another day?

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,160
Take this. That's my name, that's all I've got to
tell anyone where I've come from.

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,280
It is 10:30 at night-

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,160
I can't find anything else.
I've tried everything.

64
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
I've been everywhere.

65
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,320
Now, my time's running out.
I'm flying back...

66
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,920
So you have a look, and you write
and tell me how wrong I am.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,037
You come 10,000 miles to find home,
they call you a liar.

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,839
Wait.

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>You're not a bloody saint,
You were tired.</i>

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,389
Yeah, I know,
but I should have seen it coming.

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,396
You can't always see it coming.

72
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,716
- Why's Ben out of bed?
- Oh, hello, miss. Ben spilled his juice.

73
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,991
- It wasn't my fault.
- What are you doing out of bed?

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,190
I can't sleep. Can I read?

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,994
No. Go on, go back up to bed
and I'll come tuck you up in a minute.

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,996
It's not fair, I'm older than him.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
- Happens all the time.
- Come on, up you go.

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,720
I just hope I did the right thing.

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Margaret, we're social workers.
There's no right thing.

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,440
There's social-work practice,
court decisions...

81
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
My professional judgment.

82
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Which means that sometimes
you're doing the right thing,

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
and sometimes
you're oppressing the poor

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,640
with the middle-class values
of a reactionary government.

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Don't make that face at me.
Kiss from Mummy.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Sometimes, you're just tired.

87
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Ooh, you're heavy. Now, then.

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,119
Mum?

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
Mum?

90
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Had bad dream.

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,720
Oh, sweetie. You OK?

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,200
What happened?

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,400
It was a long, long tunnel thing
and I couldn't...

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
You couldn't what?

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,240
Couldn't get out and I couldn't find you.

96
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
Darling, I'm here.

97
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,160
I lost you.

98
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Oh, sweetie. I'm here now.
I'm not going anywhere, OK?

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,080
All right?

100
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,832
You going to go back to sleep?

101
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,359
All right.

102
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,117
- I think you have to talk about it.
- Exactly.

103
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,196
I only told my husband
just this last year.

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,992
Good for you.

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,712
What do you think, Nicky?

106
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Um, well, I know what you mean,
but sometimes I think it sounds stupid

107
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,280
if I told everyone
what was bothering me.

108
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,480
What is it?

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Um...

110
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,920
It's my brother, my brother Jack.

111
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
Uh...

112
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,880
I don't really see him, you see.

113
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,553
Do you want to tell everyone
who Jack is, Nicky?

114
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Mmm...

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,911
Uh, yeah.

116
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,949
- That's my brother, Jack.
- That's lovely.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,000
He found me a few years ago.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
Um...

119
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,280
Just got a letter out of the blue.

120
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,920
'Dear Nicky, I think I may be
your brother Jack.'

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,195
And he was.

122
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Well, soon as I saw him, I knew.

123
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,680
I mean...

124
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,280
I remembered. That's right.

125
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,200
Once upon a time,
I used to have a brother.

126
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,560
So where is he?

127
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,720
Australia.

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,080
Can you believe it?

129
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,640
It was the Sally Army
who found me for him.

130
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,720
They'd taken us both in
and put me in my first foster home

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
and shipped Jack off to Australia.

132
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
So, uh...

133
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,480
I mean, I know I have family, I suppose,

134
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,474
but he's so far away,
and sometimes it's hard to feel...

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,833
Anyway.

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,320
So was he adopted
by an Australian family?

137
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,629
Uh, no. No.

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,750
It was just kids, Jack said.

139
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,588
A big ship full of kids from 5 to 13,

140
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,712
all being sent off to Australia.

141
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,910
You never told me that bit, Nicky.

142
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,794
- Didn't I?
- Well, that's what happened.

143
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>Could still all be
just coincidence.</i>

144
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,231
<i>Do you think so?</i>

145
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
<i>Well, if children did emigrate
to Australia in any numbers,<i>

146
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,358
<i>there must be some record of them,</i>

147
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,680
I was just wondering
if you had any records

148
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,560
of any unaccompanied children

149
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,160
sent to Australia in the 1940s and '50s.

150
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,880
I don't think we ever had those records in
Australia House.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,920
So there were children sent out there?

152
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,400
Um, do you know how many?

153
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,840
When? Why were they sent?

154
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,640
I've already told you.

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,960
We don't have any more information.

156
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
So who would know?

157
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Why don't you ask your own government?

158
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,510
They're the ones who sent the kids out there.

159
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,800
I know, I couldn't believe it.

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,680
I mean, I was still half thinking
that the story couldn't be true

161
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,240
and he just came out with it.

162
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,958
Yeah.

163
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
No, no. I think I'm going to...

164
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I think I'm going to still get the later train

165
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,840
and I'm going to try
St. Catherine's House now.

166
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,957
<i>See if I can find Charlotte's birth certificate.</i>

167
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,880
<i>If I can get her mother's name off that,</i>

168
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
<i>then I can probably find out
when she died,</i>

169
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,149
<i>and then when Charlotte
was placed in an orphanage.</i>

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,717
<i>we can start to trace her journey.</i>

171
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,550
<i>Maybe get some clues about why Nicky's
brother was sent away as well.</i>

172
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,360
Charlotte's mother wasn't dead.

173
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,720
Lovely to see you, Merv.
How was your day?

174
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Charlotte said
she was in an orphanage in 1950

175
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
because both her parents were dead.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Well, I found a record of a woman
with her mother's name

177
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,280
who got married in Nottingham in 1956,

178
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,920
not dead, very much alive
and eating wedding cake.

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,680
Might not be the same woman.

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
I've ordered up the certificate

181
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,320
but why would Charlotte have been sent
if she wasn't an orphan?

182
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,560
So if her mother was alive in '56,
she might still be alive.

183
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,280
- I know.
- So you going to follow that up?

184
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,909
Well, I'll find the address on the certificate
and follow the trail from there.

185
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Do you think it's her?

186
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
About the right age.

187
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,517
Hello, Vera. Yeah, not bad. And you?

188
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,438
Is that the time already?

189
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Thanks.

190
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,159
Hang on, I'll finish that up.

191
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Excuse me, are you Vera Wilson?

192
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,640
That's me. How can I help you, love?

193
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,960
I was wondering if I could
have a word with you in private.

194
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,200
It's something personal.

195
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll take you through. What's it about?

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,195
It's about your family.

197
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,910
Oh, my God.

198
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,640
I knew you'd come one day.

199
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,200
It's you, isn't it? You're my baby.

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,033
No, Vera, I'm a social worker.

201
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,600
Do you know where our baby is?

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,036
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk, in private.

203
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Where is she?

204
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,475
Does she have a family?

205
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,760
Is she happy?

206
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,600
Charlotte's in Australia.

207
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,718
She grew up in a children's home
in Australia.

208
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,160
In Australia?

209
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,277
What was she doing over there?

210
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,314
What was she doing
in a children's home?

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,680
I went back to get her

212
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,796
and they told me she'd been adopted.

213
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,040
I went back to get her.

214
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,440
They told me she was better off.

215
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,680
She was in a <i>real</i> family.

216
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,959
What's she doing in a children's home on the
other side of the world?

217
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,080
This flight
is now closed and will depart.

218
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,957
Final call for British Airways...

219
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
All right, let me take that.

220
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,040
- How was your flight?
- All right.

221
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,076
We'll go out this way to the car.

222
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,876
You ready for tonight?

223
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,000
That's, uh, my mother.

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,956
Your grandmother.

225
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,229
She was very strict, you know.

226
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,435
Well, you've got to understand
how things were 40 years ago.

227
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,789
No-one wanted... the shame.

228
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It was such a scandal.

229
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,870
Mother wouldn't have me in the house.

230
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,040
They took my baby away from me
at the hostel

231
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,600
and I tried to visit.

232
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,550
And then one day
they said she'd gone.

233
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,317
You had gone.

234
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
I kept this for you.

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,036
In case.

236
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,830
Well, I always kept it.

237
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,560
<i>I'm up to my eyes at work.</i>

238
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,079
<i>I know.</i>

239
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,076
<i>And we can't afford it.</i>

240
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,758
<i>I know.</i>

241
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,438
<i>And the kids?</i>

242
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,835
<i>We'll be fine here.</i>

243
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
Hey.

244
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,800
Oh!

245
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,760
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

246
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,040
Uh, Margaret. This is my brother, Jack.

247
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,920
It's very nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

248
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,360
Good to meet you too.
How was the flight?

249
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,720
Uh, yeah, good.

250
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,392
Get these into the car.

251
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,760
- You all right?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,200
Still OK to come
to the reunion tomorrow?

253
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,960
- Yeah Yeah, of course.
- You must be tired.

254
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,155
Yeah, a little bit.

255
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,960
So we are delighted

256
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,600
to see our usual wonderful turnout
of former Fairbridge residents.

257
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,040
This is a nostalgic and happy day
for all of us.

258
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,113
Now, just before I go,
this is Mrs. Humphreys,

259
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,116
who has come all the way from England

260
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,720
to join one of our old Fairbridgians
at the reunion today.

261
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,473
She'd love to hear any stories
you have about your time here,

262
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,114
so do take the time to talk to her,
if you can.

263
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,200
Hello, my name's Margaret Humphreys.

264
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I was recently contacted by a woman

265
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
who was sent here to Australia as a child

266
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,040
and has lost all contact
with her family in England.

267
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,510
And I'm here today to see if
any of you are in the same position.

268
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,360
If you want to talk to me,
just come and find me later.

269
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,554
All right. Thank you.

270
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,480
So is this all there is,
the bunkhouses, the farm buildings?

271
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,640
What about the school?

272
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,236
Well, you only got to go to school
if you finished your farm work first.

273
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,556
Jack told me some stories
about this place, didn't you, Jack?

274
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,600
Food was terrible, wasn't it?

275
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,920
What was it you used to have, Jack?

276
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,840
You could always tell the Fairbridge kids

277
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,400
because they were the ones
nicking the other kids' lunch boxes.

278
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,360
Do you know if all the other children

279
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,560
were sent out from Britain, the same as you?

280
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,840
I don't know, I don't know.

281
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,720
Do you know who sent you?

282
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,190
- It's a bit hot. I'll be out by the bus.
- Yeah.

283
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,999
Sorry, Margaret.

284
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,160
This woman you were talking about.

285
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,720
- Did you find any family for her?
- Yes.

286
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,160
She was told that her mother was dead
but we found her.

287
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,680
- You found her mother?
- Yes.

288
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,440
Do you think I've got a mother?

289
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,880
Everybody's got a mother.

290
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,040
- What year?
- What year are we talking about?

291
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

292
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Any records of
who the child migrants were

293
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,831
would be back in the UK
or with local state authorities.

294
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,389
More.

295
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,830
Oh, there's so many of them.

296
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,520
These migrations -
were they organised schemes?

297
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,478
I can't tell you, really.
It's not my area, I'm afraid.

298
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,280
So, why have I never heard about it?

299
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,800
Why has no-one ever heard about it?

300
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,360
I don't suppose
anyone was really that interested.

301
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,236
Stay there while I get a view of you two.

302
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,199
What's up, Jack?

303
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,871
I can't stand Mother's Day.

304
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
Get the same feeling every year,

305
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,800
like someone's twisting a knife
inside me.

306
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
So, normally I stay inside on that day
and I draw the blinds

307
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,919
and I let the phone ring.

308
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,640
I was married, you know. I've got three kids.

309
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
I never knew what was wrong with me.

310
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
You know,
I'd think about my mother all the time,

311
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
but I could never talk about it.

312
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
How can you talk about someone

313
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,591
when you've been told they don't even exist?

314
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
I went to see this doctor.

315
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,280
He put me on antidepressants.

316
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,440
That didn't really help, so I saved them up,

317
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,590
I saved them all up and then...

318
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,840
I mean, it wasn't my wife's fault, you know.

319
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,319
There's a...

320
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,316
..there's an emptiness in me.

321
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,080
There always has been and I think...
I thought...

322
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,600
I think that the only thing
that could fill it is her, you know?

323
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,036
- Is my mother.
- Jack! Jack!

324
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,360
There's a very strong memory.

325
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,591
I was in the children's home in the UK...
I was only ten.

326
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,560
This man in a suit,
he came to see me and he says,

327
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,040
'How'd you like to go to Australia?
The sun shines every day.

328
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,040
You'd live in a white house,
ride a horse to school

329
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,430
and you'd pick oranges off the trees
for your breakfast.'

330
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,120
When I didn't say anything, he says,

331
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,514
'Well, your mother's dead, you know,
so you might as well.'

332
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,520
So...

333
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,600
Now you're telling me that
she might not have been dead, after all.

334
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,000
No, I can't say that, Jack... We just don't know.

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,960
What we can do is
we can search for her records

336
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,916
and see what we can find.

337
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,360
I don't know. Of course, of course.
I don't know.

338
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,316
You found your sister.

339
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,757
She was so happy to see you, you know.

340
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,152
Nicky trusts you.

341
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,950
And I reckon I... I think I should too.

342
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,039
<i>There she is.</i>

343
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Hello, sweetie.

344
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,560
Hello, darling.

345
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,440
Good to see you. How was the plane?

346
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,960
It was all right, actually. Come on, guys.

347
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,200
- Did you get any sleep?
- Little bit, yeah.

348
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,474
You all right?

349
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,031
Oh, yeah. I'm tired. I'm exhausted.
But I'm very happy to be home.

350
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,920
That's what I found first.
By then I was desperate.

351
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,400
I've been searching court records,
children's panel, minutes, you name it.

352
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
No trace of the children anywhere.

353
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,800
I was just looking through newspapers
round about our date

354
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
and that leapt out at me.

355
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,160
Now you have
the name of the organisation.

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,360
- Fairbridge.
- It wasn't just Fairbridge.

357
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,760
All sorts of different charities
ran these schemes.

358
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,880
Churches, Barnardos.

359
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,440
Children from deprived backgrounds,

360
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,476
shipped off for a better life in the colonies.

361
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,600
This is it. This is all fitting together.

362
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
The scheme was run from the 19th century

363
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,440
'til - you won't believe this - 1970.

364
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,200
But there was a wave of migrations
to Australia

365
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
between the mid-'50s and the mid-'60s.

366
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
How big? How many kids?

367
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,240
I don't know exactly
but it must've been organised.

368
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
I mean, organised at the level of government.

369
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,120
These children were in care.
Local authorities were their guardians.

370
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,600
For so many of them
to be systematically deported,

371
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,440
it must have been government policy.

372
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,680
The Home Secretary would have to consent
to them leaving the country.

373
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,520
The Australian Government
must've wanted to receive them.

374
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
White Australia, I suppose.

375
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,280
You're talking about the organised deportation
of children in care.

376
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,480
I don't have any concrete proof yet

377
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,920
but the evidence doesn't
leave much room for doubt.

378
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,000
So, who's taking responsibility for
what happened to these children

379
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,911
once they reached Australia?

380
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,560
Oh, Merv.

381
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,920
I've got the names of
hundreds of people in my suitcase,

382
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,640
who all want to know who they are.

383
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,278
I know.

384
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,749
Who do I ask? Where do I start?

385
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,920
Are you going to look at all that stuff now?

386
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,280
Jet lag.

387
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,600
I thought you said you were working
in the morning.

388
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,034
I've got to. I've been summoned.

389
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,629
Merv?

390
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,840
I'm going to have to get back to Australia.

391
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,879
Well, catch your breath first, eh?

392
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,432
We can see you now.

393
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,348
..and sent it to the other department.

394
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,116
Shut the door, please.
To the other department?

395
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,200
OK. Take a seat.

396
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,952
Two weeks?

397
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,794
OK.

398
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,720
Well, as you know, Rita's filled me in
with what you've been up to.

399
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
I've read your report.

400
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,520
Look, I just want to say that
I have kept on top of my case load

401
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,360
and I went to Australia in my own time,
that was my annual leave.

402
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
- Well, I think that's appalling.
- What? What is?

403
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,160
That you had to use your own holiday
to pursue this.

404
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,720
Oh.

405
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm taking this to the social services committee.

406
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,756
Tell me. What is it you want to do?

407
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Well, uh, the people that I've met,

408
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,160
they want to find a record of who they are.

409
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,120
They just want to know where they came from.

410
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,880
- What do you need?
- Time.

411
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,160
Time to find their families.

412
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
How long?

413
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,479
Well... a year?

414
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
How about two?

415
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,320
Yes, that would be...

416
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,709
I'll make a recommendation to the committee.

417
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,200
So, are you talking about me
working on this full-time?

418
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,430
That is what you want, isn't it?

419
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,320
Yes Yes, it is.

420
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,720
Now, how are we going to fund you properly?

421
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,040
We're going to have raise your profile
to try and get some public funding

422
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,840
and we need donations.

423
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,673
Have you thought about going to the press?

424
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,999
Merv?

425
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,958
It's being printed in the papers
in Sydney and Melbourne too.

426
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
- They're all the same.
- I know.

427
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,120
'Dear Mrs. Humphreys,
I read the article in the paper.

428
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,960
Please could you help me
find my mother?

429
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,758
I was sent to Australia in 1957.
I have no birth certificate.'

430
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,317
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

431
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,278
Have I helped you understand all that, Bob?
It's a lot to take in.

432
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,880
They gave me the wrong name.

433
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
They'd given you the wrong name.

434
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,953
That's why it's taking so long
to find your birth certificate.

435
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
So, which name do I use?

436
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
Who am I?

437
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,880
You're the same person.

438
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,640
But I've got the wrong name.

439
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,553
You're using a different name
from the name on your birth certificate.

440
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,600
- Do you want to stop for a minute?
- No. No, I'm good.

441
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,512
So, what next?

442
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,116
Well, what would you like me to do next?

443
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,000
Thank you all very much
for your patience,

444
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,195
and I'll be with you as soon as I can.

445
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,280
- I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.
- Not a problem. I'm Dan.

446
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,793
- Dan, please come in.

447
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,480
Oh, I'm Len Connelly. I'm with Dan.

448
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,630
Oh, nice to meet you.

449
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,680
Well, I usually see people on their own, but uh...

450
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm moral support.

451
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,320
Right, well, Dan, you'll be fine on your own

452
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,880
but if that's what you want...

453
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
- It's all right.
- It's what he wants, yeah.

454
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,950
Well, nice to meet you, Mr. Connelly.

455
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,192
- Uh... right. Shall we?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,600
So, I reckon if I do have any family,
they might be around Doncaster.

457
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,477
OK, right. Doncaster.

458
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,600
Well, from what you've told me,

459
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,160
I will be able to start to trace
your mother's birth certificate.

460
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,520
Oh, I've tried all of that. I've had
the best in the business working on it.

461
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,800
- Len.
- Nothing.

462
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,000
Can't be done. Cost me a few bob too.

463
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,120
- Not that I'm short of a few bob...
- Excuse me.

464
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,240
I am trying to listen to Dan.

465
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,560
Well, I reckon you need to see me, as well.

466
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,600
- Were you a child migrant too?
- I've just told you that.

467
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,160
Well, I'm sure that tracing your family
is very important to you.

468
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,040
But right now, this is Dan's time.

469
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,400
OK, so there are three possibilities.

470
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,560
We might be able to find
your mother's birth certificate,

471
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,800
and obviously that is what we want
and what we're hoping for.

472
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,200
We might find her and then discover
that she's already passed away.

473
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,440
We might... we might not have any luck.

474
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm really sorry.
Excuse me?

475
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,600
What are you doing?

476
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,960
Could you put that down, please?

477
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,800
I was checking what you're up to.

478
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,160
I'm sorry, but if you interrupt again,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

479
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,840
When are you going to see me? I've got
documents the detectives found me.

480
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,920
They never found my mother.

481
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Well, if the world's best private detectives
weren't able to trace her,

482
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm not really sure what you expect me to do.

483
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,317
Well, I thought you could give it a go.

484
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm afraid I have a backlog of people
to see on this trip

485
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,680
and I won't be able to fit you in.

486
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
But if you want to send me your documents,

487
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,910
then I'll see what I can do.

488
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,960
Right, now, Dan.

489
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
What I'm going to need from you
is any recollections that you have

490
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,397
firstly from your early childhood...

491
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,200
Well, you've certainly caused
quite a stir, Mrs. Humphreys.

492
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,800
There's been a lot of comments

493
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
since you broke this story in the newspapers.

494
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, I didn't exactly break the story.

495
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
People are saying

496
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
what happened to
some of these children is an outrage.

497
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
Would you care to comment on that?

498
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,360
- Well, I'd say it was, yes.
- That's rather a strong word, though.

499
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,040
I met a woman recently who was sent
to Australia at five years of age

500
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
and she wanted me to tell you

501
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,960
that she lived with 15 other girls
in an unheated, unventilated hut

502
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,040
for ten years, and during that time,

503
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,000
her only possessions were one dress
and one pair of shoes.

504
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,600
And then at age 15, she was told

505
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,160
that she had to repay her debt
of board and lodging

506
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,680
and she was sent to work
as unpaid slave labour

507
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,520
on a farm that was 50 miles
from the nearest road.

508
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,440
- So what this-
- And in all that time, she never knew

509
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,080
that she had a mother still living in England

510
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,360
who had no idea where she was
or what had happened to her.

511
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,040
I'd like to know what word you would use

512
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,952
to describe what that mother
and daughter suffered.

513
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,200
Mrs. Humphreys!

514
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,400
I've got to talk to you.

515
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,280
I'd like to take you to dinner.
My treat. My treat.

516
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,920
- I can buy my own dinner, thanks.
- Come on, what are you?

517
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,440
- One of those lesbian socialists?
- Shut up, Len.

518
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
He's all right. Doesn't know what he's saying.

519
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,397
- She's turned crimson.
- He's all right.

520
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,629
- Hey, Mrs. Humphreys!
- Mrs. Humphreys, I want an appointment.

521
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
So, how long have you been doing this work?.

522
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,520
You know what?

523
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,399
I've been cleaning floors for 40 years.

524
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,000
First thing they did at Fairbridge
when I came off the boat,

525
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
put a mop in my hands.

526
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,880
'Stop your crying and clean that floor.'

527
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,438
How old were you?

528
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,237
I was eight.

529
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,720
I was crying too.

530
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,600
Didn't need to put a bucket of water on the floor.

531
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,830
I was dropping enough water on it.

532
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,840
That was it.

533
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,308
Scrubbing for 40 years.

534
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,676
Sometimes...

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,040
..when I was shining up those floors,

536
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,636
I'd think, 'I wonder what my old mum would think
if she could see me now.'

537
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,316
So you remember your mum?

538
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,680
Of course.

539
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,440
Course I do.
Can't ever forget your mum, can you?

540
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,750
Just don't know where she is.

541
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,840
He's been in and out of the hospital
for years now,

542
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,360
but we've never seen him
the way he was the other night.

543
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,280
When your program went out on radio,

544
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,040
he just... he just broke down, he just howled.

545
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,400
And then all he wanted to do
was get a hold of you.

546
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,676
- I'm glad I could be here.
- He's just over here.

547
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,957
I was only three.

548
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,119
Someone told me my parents were dead.

549
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,240
Then I was on a boat coming here.

550
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,913
I grew up in the orphanage.

551
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
You don't want to hear this, Margaret.

552
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,839
Yes, I do.

553
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,992
That's why I'm here.

554
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,840
<i>It was Christmas,
I was really excited.</i>

555
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,480
<i>I... was about seven...</i>

556
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,040
..by then.

557
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,239
I had this wonderful singing voice, you see.

558
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,640
Used to give concerts at the orphanage

559
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,520
and this... dentist and his wife

560
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,440
asked if I'd come to their home
for Christmas Eve

561
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,200
and you know, sing for them.

562
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,160
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

563
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,200
Oh, Merv.

564
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,590
<i>Thought I'd take a chance. Couldn't sleep.</i>

565
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,960
- What time is it there?
- <i>Three in the morning.</i>

566
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,960
- <i>Just wondered if you were OK.</i> 
- Oh, you know. Getting by.

567
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,400
- <i>What's wrong?</i> 
- Oh.

568
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,120
It's just... some of the things that I'm hearing...

569
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,520
<i>Get an earlier flight.</i>

570
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,480
<i>I'll come home just before
Christmas, like I promised.</i>

571
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,000
It's only a week away,

572
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,280
<i>They were going
to keep me over Christmas.</i>

573
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,751
<i>I was going to get presents,
proper Christmas dinner.</i>

574
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,640
Come here.

575
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,600
<i>They had a big party.</i>

576
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,000
<i>I sang Ave Maria.</i>

577
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,994
The woman said I was a little angel.

578
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,950
And the dentist...

579
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,960
..dentist and two other men,
they took me into the bathroom

580
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,720
and uh, they...

581
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,393
..they...

582
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,392
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

583
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,960
- What's wrong?
- We can't have that.

584
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,396
We can't have any of it!

585
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,760
Margaret? Margaret!

586
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Can't have this.

587
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,279
- We can't have any of this.
- Margaret. Hey, stop, stop!

588
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
So, what do I tell Ben and Rachel?

589
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,680
'Sorry, Christmas is cancelled.'

590
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,559
Oh, Merv, I missed you.

591
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,551
I missed you.

592
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm sorry.

593
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,394
Really sorry.

594
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,791
Christmas back on, then?

595
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,231
As long as I don't have to do any
bloody carol singing.

596
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,480
Jack?

597
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,640
Oh, my God!

598
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,960
Well, I thought you'd never hurry up
and find my mum

599
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,394
unless I came and helped you out.

600
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,960
Come in, come in.

601
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,840
- So you just got here?
- Yep, yep.

602
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,114
Wow!

603
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,520
OK.

604
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,080
Going to this address. Map-reading?

605
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,548
I think I can do that, yeah.

606
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,440
Yeah, it's 71 Lord Nelson Street
Thank you.

607
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,400
Yeah, no. Well, I'd be grateful
if she could give me a call.

608
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,560
Yeah. It's Margaret Humphreys.

609
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,920
Yes, yes, thank you.

610
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,320
- So, where are we off to?
- Right.

611
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,640
We're picking up Nicky from work
and we're driving to Tyneside.

612
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,790
Righto.

613
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,640
You're Jack?

614
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,512
You're little Jack? Oh, my God.
You used to sit on my lap.

615
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,080
- You know me?
- Yes.

616
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,189
- You knew me when I was a little boy?
- Yeah, yeah, I can see you now.

617
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,118
And you're Nicky.

618
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,200
- So you knew our mother?
- Yeah.

619
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,720
Oh, she was lovely. Where is she now?

620
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,640
Well, we don't know. We lost her.

621
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,240
We don't remember because
we were in children's homes.

622
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,074
- Oh, wait a minute, that can't be right.
- What?

623
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,440
Well, the woman I knew would never have put
her children in a home.

624
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,280
She lived for that little boy and girl.

625
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,840
We think that maybe her relationship went down

626
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,920
and she was on her own and she couldn't cope.

627
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,600
No, she wouldn't have ever lost touch
with her babies,

628
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,920
not while there was breath in her body.

629
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,357
Well, they sent us away,
so she wouldn't have been able to find us.

630
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,073
I see.

631
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,033
Oh, that would have broken her into bits.

632
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,638
What was she like?

633
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,840
What did she look like?

634
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:28,234
Let me think.
She looked a bit like you, actually.

635
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
<i>And that was
Margaret Humphreys</i>

636
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,520
<i>from Nottingham in England.</i>

637
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,080
<i>She's claiming thousands of kids
had been deported</i>

638
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,120
<i>without their parents' consent.</i>

639
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,800
<i>Now we will be taking your calls.</i>

640
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,560
<i>..today denied
allegations</i>

641
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,760
<i>surrounding their children's
home in Bindoon.</i>

642
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,720
<i>The Brothers are refuting the claims...</i>

643
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,720
..the British
nor the government here in Australia

644
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,160
have taken any responsibility for this -

645
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,920
how would you describe it - deportation?

646
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,840
Yes, it's clearly the organised
deportation of children

647
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,680
from one country to another.

648
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,480
And neither the charities
nor the church organisations

649
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,960
that ran those schemes
have been prepared to admit

650
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,033
- that any mistakes were made?
- No. No, they haven't.

651
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,240
How about a speech, Margaret?

652
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,600
No, no, really. All right, thank you.

653
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,000
Well, I want to say thank you to all of you.

654
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,360
This is the proper launch
of the Child Migrants Trust

655
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,600
and it has a home now - this house.

656
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,600
And without all of the donations
and without all of you,

657
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,680
none of this would have been possible.

658
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,280
So, thank you for giving me an office in it.

659
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,080
And I'm really glad
I don't have to spend another day

660
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,832
working in that hotel room.

661
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,595
- Cup of tea?
- Yes, thanks.

662
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,880
I'm heading off.
You know, long drive home.

663
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,200
- Oh, are you sure, James?
- Yeah.

664
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't really know any of these people.

665
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,960
I'm sorry. I don't
want to spoil your party.

666
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,640
You don't know any of them?

667
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,235
Well, yeah, yeah.
I know the Bindoon boys, of course.

668
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,431
- Right.
- See you, Margaret.

669
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,840
Margaret Humphreys.

670
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,440
<i>Listen, you bitch.</i>

671
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,080
<i>You tell those whinging bastards
to stop talking about Bindoon.</i>

672
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,360
<i>If they tell one more lie about the Brothers,</i>

673
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,040
<i>just one more, we're coming over there</i>

674
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,270
<i>and I'll fucking finish you myself.</i>

675
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,200
Do you enjoy running this slanderous
publicity machine of yours?

676
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,240
I'm afraid I don't recognise
that description of my work.

677
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,840
I don't represent any newspaper
or any television station.

678
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,480
But you'll happily declare
your wild allegations to any of them.

679
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,960
I haven't made any direct allegations
to the press.

680
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,920
Some of the boys who were sent
to your children's home at Bindoon

681
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,480
chose to speak to the press
when they were approached.

682
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,392
But none of those contacts
were initiated by me.

683
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,040
Well, since you've stirred things up,

684
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,040
the Christian Brothers have been forced to
conduct an internal inquiry

685
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,720
into the Boys Towns at Bindoon
and elsewhere.

686
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,520
Now, how have you any idea

687
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,280
how much distress
you have caused to elderly men

688
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,840
who only sought the best?

689
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,040
I'm hearing an awful lot about
the distress caused to the Brothers.

690
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,160
No-one's talking about the distress
caused to the children

691
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,469
who were supposed to be in their care.

692
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,196
You're doing all right then, aren't you?

693
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,750
They paying you OK, are they?

694
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,233
This probably isn't the best way
to start this conversation, is it?

695
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,000
I don't think you like me very much,
Mrs. Humphreys.

696
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,240
All right, I'll be honest with you, then.

697
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,880
I don't know about the man
sitting opposite me.

698
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,840
But I'm sure that there's
a hurt little boy somewhere inside

699
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,320
that I'd like very much.

700
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,834
We're just going to have to
take the time to find him.

701
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,433
And how do I know that you're qualified
to do that, Mrs. Humphreys?

702
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,520
You'll have to make your own
judgement on that, Mr. Connolly.

703
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,988
You'll just have to trust me.

704
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,071
It's, uh...That's Len Connolly's
first step on Australia over there.

705
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,280
Then we were processed in here.

706
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,160
All these little kids quakin' and shakin'

707
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,754
and wondering what on earth
they'd been dropped into.

708
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,160
Brothers were sent one way, sisters another.

709
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,600
They were all crying into their sleeves, thinking,

710
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,795
'God. It can't be this hot all the time, can it?'

711
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,760
Then we were put on the buses out here.

712
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,560
It was when I was shoved onto one of them,

713
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,640
I realised Theresa wasn't coming with us.

714
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,400
She was, um, one of the girls
who looked after us on the way over.

715
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,280
She'd taken a shine to me.

716
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,360
Yeah, I was just a little scrap, you know?

717
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,720
She made a bit of a pet of me
on the voyage over.

718
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,440
I think I charmed her.

719
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,200
So when I realised Theresa wasn't coming,
I went crazy.

720
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,200
I was bloody fighting to get to the back.

721
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,998
I was climbing over everything,
trying to get to her.

722
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,080
Anyway, by the end of that day,
I was with the Christian Brothers.

723
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,400
They'd taken all my clothes.

724
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,360
They gave me an old shirt
and a pair of shorts to wear and, uh...

725
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,353
I was cleaning out the rubbish pit at Bindoon.

726
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,393
Yeah.

727
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,320
Yeah, come on.

728
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,640
We don't need to talk about that.
I just want to find my mother. That's it.

729
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,560
Help me with that if you can.
I don't need anything else.

730
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,240
I'm not offering anything else.
That's not my place.

731
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,400
All I'm asking is have you imagined
what it might be like if we do find her?

732
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,600
Well, let's just find her first, all right?

733
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,240
OK, we'll try, but what do you want?

734
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,400
To find her, to know who she is.

735
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,200
You know? To know who I am.

736
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
You've got absolutely no hopes
or expectations beyond that?

737
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,640
Look, Mrs. Humphreys...Thanks, mate.

738
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,640
I'm sure that you see old boys and girls
day in, day out,

739
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,160
bawling their eyes out, telling you how
much they miss their dear old mum.

740
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,240
Well, the truth is,
our mums shot through, didn't they?

741
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,000
We didn't just fall out of our prams
and fly off with Peter Pan, did we?

742
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,840
No, our mums didn't want us.
That's why we're here.

743
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,520
Isn't that the truth?

744
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,640
No. The truth is actually
much more complicated in most cases.

745
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,120
No, she didn't want me.
She put me in a children's home.

746
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,600
Well, that's all right.

747
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,200
Let's just put a face to the old dear.

748
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,800
I can sit here all day if you like

749
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,560
and plead on about what a hard life
I had at Bindoon.

750
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,680
All right, let's talk  about Bindoon.

751
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,320
Look, Mrs. Humphreys, I've paid my debts.

752
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,800
I've sourced the Brothers' farm tools
through my company.

753
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,440
I've made donations to the Christian Brothers.

754
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,880
I've paid my debts.

755
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,800
Your debts? What do you owe them?

756
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,040
Oh, I don't.

757
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,720
Look, they raised me, fed me,
clothed me, whatever,

758
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,600
and I've paid it all back.

759
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,040
I don't see how an eight-year-old boy,
who's working to grow his own food,

760
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,120
who has one pair of shorts,
one shirt and no shoes,

761
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,120
can be said to be running up much of a debt.

762
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,240
Well, no-one can say I owe them anything.

763
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,912
No, I don't think you do.

764
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,551
But maybe that's the monster
living in your head.

765
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,720
I don't like the idea of you walking around

766
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,870
with a monster like that in your head.

767
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,879
<i>Mummy!</i>

768
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,480
I'm afraid this won't do.

769
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,320
I'm here to give somebody
some really important news.

770
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,880
They'll remember this day
for the rest of their lives.

771
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,633
Can you show me something else?

772
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,831
Jack... Come in.

773
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,679
Take a seat.

774
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,797
That's... that's beautiful.

775
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,234
Yes.

776
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,240
So Merv telephoned me last night.

777
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,437
And we've had the results

778
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,720
Have you found my mother?

779
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,312
Yes.

780
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,440
We were too late.
She's dead, isn't she?

781
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,556
- Yes, she is.
- Yeah.

782
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,753
Uh...

783
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,880
When did she die?

784
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,440
Last year.

785
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,112
Oh.

786
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,673
So we were just too late, then?

787
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,080
<i>Mrs. Humphreys,
no-one is suggesting for a minute</i>

788
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,600
that the people you represent
have not suffered.

789
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,000
<i>But this has to be placed
in its historical context.</i>

790
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,080
<i>What was done was done with
the very best intentions.</i>

791
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,640
<i>These children were placed
in children's homes.</i>

792
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,760
Without casting any blame, their
family situations were far from ideal.

793
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,600
A more modern sensibility might suggest

794
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,560
greater effort should have been made
to keep families together.

795
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,320
But at the time, it was genuinely believed to be
in the children's interests

796
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,880
to give them a fresh start.

797
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,520
Ultimately, these children were in
the care of the British Government.

798
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,200
And it was the Government of Australia
and Britain

799
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
who were responsible for authorising
the migration schemes

800
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,160
and if we're talking about historical context,

801
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,280
I'll remind you the last migrants
were only shipped out 17 years ago.

802
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,760
But we're not here for recriminations.
There's no need for that.

803
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,640
Now the Child Migrants Trust has been created,

804
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:54,520
we can offer you an opportunity
to redress some of the damage

805
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,353
for which your organisations
were responsible.

806
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,000
These people were deported
as children, young children.

807
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,120
They've been deprived of their family,
their identity.

808
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,120
They need to find the families they lost.

809
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,669
I know that you're
all going to help them do that.

810
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,520
I think my organisation would be prepared
to make a contribution

811
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,320
if some trustee arrangement...

812
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,788
You can't be a trustee.

813
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,440
We have to be able to say
to these children - well, adults now -

814
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,600
that they're safe.

815
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,398
It has to be a neutral service.

816
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,360
What we are offering you, the Government,

817
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,440
is an opportunity to take responsibility
for what happened to these children.

818
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,080
If you could at least tell us whether you have
any records of the child migrants

819
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,960
to which you could give us access.

820
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,640
.. over 100 years and I can assure you
that we're doing everything...

821
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,269
Look, they just want to know who they are!

822
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,560
Well, we said it, didn't we?

823
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,040
Oh, yes.

824
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,640
Excuse me, Mrs. Humphreys.

825
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,800
Can I just have a minute of your time?

826
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,520
You say you're speaking as a mother.

827
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,760
But please,
take consolation in your own family

828
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,440
rather than meddling with all this.

829
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,360
I mean, how could you possibly understand

830
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,000
the real circumstances
of these unfortunate children?

831
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,480
They were living in slums.

832
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,640
They were children of drunks
and degenerates.

833
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,755
Come away, Margaret.

834
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,480
<i>So you don't accept the British
Government has a case to answer?</i>

835
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,520
<i>We have every sympathy
with the feelings of child migrants.</i>

836
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,200
<i>But you take no responsibility?</i>

837
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,120
<i>We have no
actual responsibility.</i>

838
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,600
<i>Whatever Margaret Humphreys alleges,
the fact is...</i>

839
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,440
<i>They were the responsibility
of the British Government.</i>

840
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,640
<i>The fact is this may have been
a distressing episode in history.</i>

841
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,840
<i>But there's no profit
in playing the blame game.</i>

842
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,680
<i>Right. Well, thank you very much...</i>

843
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,800
We've got them rattled now.

844
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,640
Legally, they're responsible.
They know it, we know it.

845
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,440
We find the paperwork, that nails them.
They know we will.

846
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,680
- They know the paperwork's out there.
- Yeah.

847
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,640
I'm gonna find it, Margaret.
You know I am.

848
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,914
Yeah.

849
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,800
You all right?

850
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,320
Just tired. I've got an early start.

851
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,560
Len's flight gets in at 6.

852
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,840
Here, let me do that.

853
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,600
No, never let it be said
I didn't take care of my own family

854
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,440
before I started meddling with others.

855
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,840
Hey, hey.

856
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,159
Hey.

857
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
So it's just us now.

858
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,920
No help coming.

859
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,160
We keep putting them on the spot.

860
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,799
But right now, it is just us.

861
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,111
8,000 miles and I finally get a return trip.

862
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,320
Well, as long as she accepts me,
that's all, isn't it?

863
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,595
As long as she doesn't turn me away.

864
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,360
Got a good memory, though.

865
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:26,120
I remember walking up a green hill
with grass under my bare feet.

866
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,880
There was someone pulling me by the hand

867
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,760
because I couldn't walk very well yet.

868
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,600
I was angry

869
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,040
'cause I'd been promised a penny
or a sweetie or something

870
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,519
and I didn't get it.

871
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,314
It would have been her, wouldn't it,
holding my hand?

872
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,600
What's that?

873
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,920
It's a cheque. You can fill in what you like.

874
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,600
You can decide.

875
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,720
You can have that or you can
have my loyalty. I don't mind which.

876
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,950
As long as we're square.

877
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,712
All right, then.

878
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,320
Oh, you see that? See that?
She's in there.

879
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,280
- Len?
- Yeah?

880
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,760
You want me to go in with you?

881
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,680
No, no, no You'll be right.

882
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,480
No, get yourself a cab back.

883
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,156
- Or there's a cafe up there that...
- Len, I'm going to be fine.

884
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,399
Thank you, Margaret.

885
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,160
Thank you.

886
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,832
You're very welcome, Len.

887
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,320
Right.

888
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,629
Here we go, then.

889
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,000
<i>The boys' home
at Bindoon was closed some time ago.</i>

890
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,120
<i>I understand that.</i>

891
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,600
<i>The Christian Brothers
have been victimised...<i>

892
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,280
<i>- Come back to...</i> 
<i>- We're considering legal action</i>

893
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,080
<i>to prevent journalists
trespassing on church property,</i>

894
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,120
I heard you.

895
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,600
Don't think you can come to Perth
and tell any lies.

896
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,080
Excuse me?

897
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,000
Good brothers and sisters
ran decent homes for those children.

898
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,040
I do not tell lies.

899
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,840
You know how much you'll hurt
the holy fathers with your lies?

900
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,068
I do not tell lies ever.

901
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,600
It's Margaret Humphreys from
the Child Migrants Trust in Australia.

902
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,320
Yes, he'll know what it's regarding.

903
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,232
We've had extensive correspondence
on the subject.

904
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,675
Yes.

905
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,120
Well, I would like him to return my call.

906
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,080
Um.. Yeah.

907
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,992
- And if he doesn't, I will call you back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

908
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,200
You bitch! You fuckin' evil whore!

909
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,800
Fuckin' open this window! Come on!

910
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,994
Come on!

911
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,560
I'm gonna rip you apart!
Fuck, you'll get it!

912
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,278
I can get in any time I like!

913
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,959
Ahh!

914
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Get out! Get out!

915
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,160
Get out!

916
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,280
Arggh! Bitch!

917
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,200
I can get you any time I like, you bitch!

918
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,000
You tell lies about the Brothers
and you see what you get.

919
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,800
You fucking whore!

920
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,552
I'll get you!

921
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,200
Get home.

922
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,555
<i>No, I can't.</i>

923
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,120
Call the police. Get out of that house.

924
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,396
- People are depending on me, Merv.

925
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,720
I've got a load of appointments.
I've got to go.

926
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,075
I'll call you back later.

927
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,400
I heard Bob went out to Bindoon
with a camera crew.

928
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,520
Yeah.

929
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,590
That'll stir things up a bit.

930
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,750
Theo said you didn't want to go along.

931
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,554
No, I didn't.

932
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,638
Yeah. Here, stop!

933
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,200
I'll wait for you here.

934
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,520
No, you don't need to wait for me.
I'll get a taxi.

01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,880
I really should get a car.

You don't need a taxi,
you don't need a car. I'll wait for you.

01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,509

Jack, what are you doing here?

961
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,960
Well, Merv rang and asked me to come over.

962
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,040
He thought you might need a bit of company.

963
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,560
What did he say?

964
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,835
He said you needed me here.

965
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,760
Sorry, Margaret. Just bringing your tea.

966
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,159
Sorry.

967
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,160
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

968
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,760
I thought I might sleep out on the verandah.

969
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,120
Don't much like sleeping under a roof.

970
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,190
All right. Whatever you want.

973
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,760
You right in there, Margaret?

974
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,352
Yeah.

975
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,200
I...

976
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,160
I... I can't breathe.

977
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,400
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

978
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,160
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

979
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,080
It's my heart. It's my heart.

980
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,548
- Calm down, darling.

981
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,360
<i>..sit down and eat your cereal.</i>

982
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,158

983
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,673

01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,159
Mum?

985
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,680
Tell them you have to stay here.

986
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,440
Tell them you belong to us.

987
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,158
Rachel.

988
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,040
Rachel.

989
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,634
No, my darling, it's just...

990
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,160
I'm taking you to the doctor.

991
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,440
- I don't need to go.
- I'm taking you.

992
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,035
Oh, for God's sake,
I can get myself to the doctor.

993
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,840
Look, I only came
because my husband insisted.

994
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,320
I just wanted to set his mind at rest.
I know there's nothing wrong with me.

995
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,960
I think you have post-traumatic stress disorder.

996
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,360
I'm sorry but that is rubbish.

997
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,520
Nothing happened to me,
it all happened to them.

998
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,038
Absorbing other people's pain
is a stress of its own.

999
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,680
I can't stop.

1000
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,640
There's no-one else.

1001
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,232
If I...

1002
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,680
<i>And she hasn't stopped.</i>

1003
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,960
<i>Oh, Margaret, Lovely to see you,</i>

1004
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,840
Hello.

1005
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,680
Margaret, hi.

1006
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,716
Hope you don't mind us dropping in on you.

1007
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,600
I was just telling them, Margaret,
we had such a good day.

1008
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,520
I really wanted to invite you
but we know you're so busy.

1009
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,040
30 years I was working at that pub.

1010
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,720
And they never knew I had a daughter.

1011
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,640
She was really keen for me
to come over for the retirement party

1012
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,360
but we didn't know
what we were going to tell people.

1013
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,680
- Then Bill says...
- Bill's one of the regulars.

1014
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,560
'Who's this lovely young lady, Vera?'

1015
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,120
He's ancient, see, so...

1016
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,480
And I said, 'This is my daughter, Bill.

1017
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,760
My daughter Charlotte.'

1018
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,960
- And he says...
- Never even blinked.

1019
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,840
..'She looks just like you.'

1020
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,480
- He could tell.
- Anyone could tell.

1021
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,000
And there we were in front of them all, together.

1022
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,760
Mother and daughter.

1023
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,880
- I tell you, Margaret...
- It was the happiest moment...

1024
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,960
- Of my life.
- Both of us.

1025
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:33,760
We just... We just felt... whole.

1026
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,880
At last.

1027
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,160
Nothing missing.

1028
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,120
I said, 'We have to come and tell Margaret.'

1029
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,360
But we didn't even know
if you'd be here, you're so busy.

1030
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,557
So when are you back off to Australia?

1031
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,954
Well, as soon as this lot can spare me.

1032
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,120
There's a chilled chardonnay
on the table there for you.

1033
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,320
Margaret River.
Bit young but hitting its stride, I reckon.

1034
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,520
I didn't come here to drink, Len.

1035
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,280
I thought you wanted to talk.

1036
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,840
I do. I've got some soup too. It's home-cooked.

1037
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,000
I can cook, you know.

1038
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,520
I'm sure you can.

1039
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,200
- You look hungry enough.
- I've already eaten.

1040
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,120
What was it you wanted to say?

1041
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,157
You're a difficult woman to entertain,
Mrs. Humphreys.

1042
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,629
All right.

1043
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,440
Look, um, all this TV coverage,
it's stirred everything up, Margaret.

1044
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,960
It's got the boys talking.

1045
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,320
And, um, I've been watching
how the boys are around you,

1046
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,835
and, uh, not speaking out of turn,
you know what I'm talking about.

1047
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,320
You're like a sister to them.

1048
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,880
You're family after everything you've done.

1049
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,240
You know? Only family
most of us will ever have anyway.

1050
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,480
I'm not sure that family is really the right word.

1051
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,440
Well, that's how we feel.

1052
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:37,309
No, but you're right, it's... it's not real.

1053
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,040
'Cause you haven't been there, have you?

1054
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:46,040
You've heard about our childhood
but you haven't touched our childhood.

1055
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,760
'Cause you haven't been there.

1056
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,080
Where?

1057
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,560
To Bindoon.

1058
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:56,078
I'm, uh... I'm asking you
to come to Bindoon with me.

1059
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,358
No.

1060
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,320
Well, have a think about it, Margaret.

1061
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:10,760
Look, Len, what you all suffered
at Bindoon, that's your history.

1062
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,273
But it's not mine.

1063
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,160
I have to be careful.

1064
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,320
I...

1065
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:23,400
I'm not, um... It wouldn't be appropriate for me
to get too close to all of that.

1066
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,640
It's... Well, it wouldn't be right.

1067
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,040
No, no, you'll be right.
I'll look after you.

1068
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,315
No, Len, I don't want to.

1069
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,434
I don't have to go there and I don't want to.

1070
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,840
OK, OK, but look at it
from the old boys' point of view.

1071
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,040
That's like saying that
you can't look at who they are.

1072
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,120
Is that what they're saying?

1073
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,960
Well, you have a think about it, Margaret.

1074
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,720
Maybe that's the monster living in your head.

1075
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,440
I don't like to think of you walking around

1076
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,431
with a monster like that in your head.

1077
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,360
Well, we should be there in a couple of hours.

1078
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,400
It used to take six before they graded the road.

1079
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,120
God You should have seen it -

1080
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,640
40 or 50 little nippers bouncing around
in the back of an open truck,

1081
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,480
eating dust and flies, crying for their mums.

1082
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,472
We thought we'd been dropped off
at the end of the earth.

1083
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,119
You right?

1084
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,150
See it from here first.

1085
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,280
Is it what you expected?

1086
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,874
I didn't know it would be so big.

1087
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,040
And I didn't know it would be so beautiful.

1088
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,760
The boys put every stone
of that building together.

1089
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,751
I know.

1090
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,080
The cement would burn your feet.

1091
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,720
We'd no shoes.

1092
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,960
The cement would burn the cuts on our feet

1093
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,520
and the sores on our hands and knees.

1094
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:47,640
All day, in blazing heat, no rest, no water.

1095
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:54,239
I was nine years old and I was lifting rocks
the size of my upper body.

1096
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,760
And he's yelling at us,
'You weak, weak, pitiful sons of whores.'

1097
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,880
We built stations of the cross.

1098
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,000
But who was crucified, huh?

1099
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,911
Tell me that.

1100
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,960
You all right to go down?

1101
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,840
Suppose they don't let us in.

1102
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,720
There's a swimming pool
at the back of the building.

1103
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,632
I paid for it. They'll let us in.

1104
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,600
He had this... he had this big knobby stick.

1105
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,480
And he would crack you over the skull with it.

1106
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,120
Leather belts. Fanbelt from the tractor.

1107
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,157
Anything that would give you
a good wallop, you know?

1108
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,112
They'll still be having their breakfast.
Feel like a cup of tea?

1109
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,199
Come on.

1110
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,678
Morning, brothers.

1111
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,400
I've brought Mrs. Humphreys

1112
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,868
to have a look around the old place
if that's all right.

1113
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,959
Come through.

1114
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,599
There we go.

1115
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,592
Is there any chance of a cuppa?

1116
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,711
We can do better than a chipped cup,
can't we, brother?

1117
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,280
<i>We'd hear one of the brothers coming.</i>

1118
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,080
Just his footsteps on the wooden floor.

1119
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,080
You'd be lying there in the wet sheets
and you're thinking,

1120
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,880
'Oh, please, God...
Please, God, don't let it be me.'

1121
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,360
He would make you strip naked

1122
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,960
and get on the tables
with everybody watching you.

1123
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,760
Don't know where I thought I could run to,
there's nothing there for miles.

1124
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,320
He came after me on horseback.

1125
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,595
When he caught me...

1126
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,880
..he tied me to a tree.

1127
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,880
And he, uh...

1128
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,678
He...

1129
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,233
<i>You probably can't believe me.</i>

1130
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,995
<i>Of course I believe you.</i>

1131
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,557
The fucker raped me, Margaret.

1132
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,640
Hey, I think you might have
forgotten something, brother.

1133
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,671
I'll fix it up, shall I?

1134
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,800
Didn't matter if he split your skull open,
he'd keep whacking away.

1135
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,600
You just thought...

1136
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,520
'I'm nothing now.

1137
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,988
Nothing at all.'

1138
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,913
Who's gonna... Who's gonna look after me?

1139
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,269
Who's gonna look after me? I'm nobody.

1140
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,360
Have I disturbed you, brothers?

1141
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,272
Have I frightened you?

1142
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,360
What have you got to be frightened of?

1143
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,828
Grown men like you.

1144
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,440
Look at that, Margaret.

1145
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,228
Can't see another house. Nothing but bush.

1146
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,069
No-one would find you here.

1147
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,840
He'd wait for me after dark, Brother Norman.

1148
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,080
He took a shine to me.
I was a favourite, I suppose.

1149
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,674
I don't know.

1150
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,557
You just think, 'I'll live through this.
It'll stop one day.'

1151
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,437
Bloody years.

1152
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:16,040
Margaret, have a look at that.
Black cockatoo.

1153
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,080
Oh, there'd be flocks of them
over here sometimes.

1154
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,400
They'd sound like trains going over your head.

1155
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,480
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1156
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,040
You've gone a funny colour.

1157
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,758
I'll just get you a drink.

1158
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,793
There you go.

1159
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,400
- You right?
- I'm fine. It's just the heat.

1160
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,520
OK.

1161
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:51,840
Know what your problem is, Mrs. H?
You don't look after yourself properly.

1162
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,560
You won't let anyone else do it either.

1163
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,760
Len, it's not for anybody else to look after me.

1164
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,320
I've been loved and looked after my entire life.

1165
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,360
It's your turn now.

1166
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,200
But you'll never get it.

1167
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,080
Everybody thinks there's going to be
this big cathartic moment

1168
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,480
when the wrongs are righted
and the wounds healed,

1169
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,040
but it's not going to happen.

1170
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,555
I can't give you back what you've lost.

1171
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,920
Well, there's plenty of other people
in that boat.

1172
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,037
Well, its not enough, is it, Len?
It's never enough.

1173
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,640
Jeez, old Bindoon,
it shook you up all right, didn't it?

1174
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,073
No, I'm fine.

1175
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,160
It should shake me up.
I'm the one who should be shaking.

1176
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:40,240
But even if I was lying here in the dirt
bawling like a kid,

1177
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,920
I couldn't feel it all, could I?

1178
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,717
Isn't that what you'd tell me?

1179
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,560
I had to stop crying when I was eight.
I don't know how to start now.

1180
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,600
But you feel it.

1181
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,160
You feel it for all of us
because we can't, you do.

1182
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:59,400
No, you're fighting for us, Margaret.
You're in there for us.

1183
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,920
You're on our side.

1184
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,280
So let the rest go.

1185
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,239
Just let the rest go.

1186
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,350
What you're doing is enough.

1187
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,680
It's more than anyone
else has ever given me.

1188
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,591
Happy Christmas.

1189
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,199
- And happy Christmas.
- Oh!

1190
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,119
Ooh!

1191
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,034
Happy Christmas, darling.

1192
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,832
Here you go, love.

1193
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,840
Happy Christmas.

1194
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,760
So, what are you going to give all of us
for Christmas, Ben?

1195
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,513
I gave you my mum.

1196
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,680
So you did.

1197
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,240
So you did, darling, and we love you for it.

1198
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,798
Hear, hear.

1199
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,040
Hey, don't do that. Don't do that.

1200
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,759
Don't start snivelling.

1201
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,073
Bloody hell, woman,
what are you trying to do to me?

1202
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,398
- See you in a couple of weeks.
- See you in a couple of weeks.
