"Are you Daddy's little girl?"

00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,444
Shit!

14
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,458
Any other needs, sir?

15
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:47,390
Let's see. Ladies, gentlemen,
John, would you like something?

16
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,645
I think we're fine, thank you.

17
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,694
Tell Cheryl that this is spectacular.
She's outdone herself.

18
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,654
-Just fabulous.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,220
All right, everybody.

20
00:02:56,364 --> 00:03:00,562
Napkins, please, on the laps.
This is quail, and it tastes great.

21
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,185
You're gonna love it.
The grapes look like flowers.

22
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,092
Everything's perfect.

23
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,642
And a terrific sauce.

24
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:10,551
Slice little pieces off
and then dip it in the sauce.

25
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:12,112
Hi, Katie.

26
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:15,146
Well, well, well. What an honour.

27
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,677
Only a half hour late.

28
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:21,720
-May I ask where you've been, Charlie?
-Hi, Daddy. I've been at the liberry.

29
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,691
The "liberry"?

30
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:27,130
Is that any relation
to the institution known as a "library"?

31
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,752
Can't we have one dinner
where we don't argue?

32
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,732
I hope so. But I've told you.

33
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:35,929
If you must wear that ridiculous
gold tooth, do it outside, not in my house.

34
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,230
And take your jacket off, too.

35
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,349
What were you guys doing
before you decided...

36
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,048
...to become rap artists
and cut your first album?

37
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,078
What that got to do
with what we talking about?

38
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:56,326
I came here as a businessman,
coming to do business with you...

39
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,375
...and your establishment
and you're giving me the rundown...

40
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,941
...on this shit like you're the police.

41
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,804
Isn't this place a recording studio?

42
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:08,000
It is a recording studio.
I'm trying my best to accommodate you.

43
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,897
I'm a kid coming up out of the street, man.

44
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:16,587
Trying to do my thing, trying to get on.
Make music, live a better life.

45
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,426
-Graduating this year?
-I sure am.

46
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,778
God willing.
With a little luck and a few bribes.

47
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:26,258
Dad, why you always
gotta say shit like that?

48
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,241
Why can't you just be normal?

49
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:31,475
-Why do you have to be such a nut?
-A nut? Excuse me?

50
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:35,657
You don't see me coming in here
and talking about your problems.

51
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,338
You know? Why do you always
gotta fuck with me?

52
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:43,258
Rich is the guy behind the Cream Team,
is that correct?

53
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,695
Rich is the mind behind Cream Team.

54
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,107
-And his name is Rich--
-Rich Bower, yeah.

55
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,568
The guy meeting us here is Rich Bower?

56
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:52,315
Tell me what you heard.

57
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:56,301
Just stories and gossip about some trouble
you guys might've been in.

58
00:04:56,762 --> 00:05:00,072
That's in the past. This is the present.
What are we gonna do?

59
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:03,154
Actually, Cigar,
to be totally honest with you...

60
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:06,750
...l can't give you a firm answer now.
We're really jammed up.

61
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,857
-What's going on?
-You still negotiating, nigga?

62
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,695
-Thought we had a deal.
-This is the cat who owns the studio.

63
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,111
Arnie Tishman. Nice to meet you.
Feel free to look around.

64
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:20,044
By the way,
which library were you studying at?

65
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,798
-Surely you remember the name.
-I don't remember.

66
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:28,633
She was studying at a library an hour ago.
But ask her where and she can't remember.

67
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,680
What do you mean you can't take cash?
What's wrong?

68
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:33,754
-Money ain't green?
-Don't want cash?

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,353
-You don't like me?
-No--

70
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,622
Cash is king! What's wrong with you?
You sound like you're mad.

71
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,328
You're acting like you're on drugs.
Drugs are bugging you out.

72
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:46,918
-Who's your lawyer?
-What do lawyers got to do with it?

73
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,689
You're the police or something?
We just want some studio time.

74
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,607
What you talking about my lawyer?

75
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:55,565
You don't treat me
like you do everyone else.

76
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,286
Don't start with comparisons.

77
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,671
-Katie's so perfect.
-Katie's nine years old.

78
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,569
But you think she's so perfect.
And I'm just a disgusting leech...

79
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,972
...that you have.
With my friends, I don't feel that way.

80
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,923
I'm having a good day, hanging out
with my friends, going to the library...

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,478
...and you ruin it.

82
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,302
You have to cut your first album
somewhere else.

83
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:18,217
You'll use this studio in the future.

84
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,791
This is why people get hurt.

85
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:24,598
You make a person feel a certain way,
then you shut him down.

86
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:27,741
-Is that a threat?
-We don't make threats.

87
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,085
We said we'd be back. That's a promise.

88
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:35,097
There's a time and a place for this.
But I don't think that now is the right time.

89
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:39,146
Let's just all sit here,
enjoy this quail and have a meal together.

90
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:51,994
-Hello.
-Hey, Charlie.

91
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,674
-Hold on, Wren.
-You lighting up?

92
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,734
-I missed you after school.
-Right.

93
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,873
I listened to Rae pour out
all her boyfriend problems.

94
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,471
That's good for Rae.
I'm glad she's doing that.

95
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,737
-Do you love me?
-Of course I love you.

96
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,909
You do? I love you, too.

97
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:10,093
-Hello.
-What up, girl?

98
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,811
What's up, Rich? What you doing?

99
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,042
-I'm gonna call you back, okay?
-Wait a second, Charlie.

100
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:19,094
-Shut up. I'll call you back.
-Who are you talking to--

101
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,451
-What's up? What you doing?
-Just chilling.

102
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,836
-Did you have fun today?
-What can I say?

103
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,056
-It was nice, right?
-It was all right.

104
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,147
-I would go for it again.
-When?

105
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,554
-Whenever you're ready.
-Okay.

106
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,801
Let me get up.

107
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,073
I'm gonna go down there
and see what's going on.

108
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,318
The motherfucking D.A.'s son.

109
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:03,008
What the fuck aspect they get from
having this motherfucker working for me?

110
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,861
I gotta talk to you about some shit
we ain't talked about yet.

111
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,570
That some major shit that's going down.

112
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:16,406
You gotta deal with it right away.

113
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,114
There's some disrespect going down
and you can't allow this to happen.

114
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,873
Just between you and me.

115
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,223
No, me and you
and everybody else in here.

116
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:27,563
I need to talk to you about some shit.

117
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:31,746
-I know Rich will slap the shit out of him.
-What about?

118
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,290
And his father's the fucking D.A.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,151
You can't be coming to my joint
blowing a spot like that.

120
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:43,892
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm doing this for you. Not for myself.

121
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,326
I work for you.
You know what I do with my life.

122
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:49,625
These guys open a club on your turf
without calling or asking you.

123
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:53,936
And no compensation. It's bullshit.

124
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,318
So you're gonna tell me
what's going on in my hood?

125
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:01,067
I know these cats. Scotty, Eric
and all these other motherfuckers.

126
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,873
White cats that I know
that are opening up this club...

127
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,533
...in your hood with no calls, no nothing.

128
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,407
I don't think it makes sense.
What you gonna do?

129
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:13,287
What am I gonna do? What's your point?
You gather information, right?

130
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:17,449
Just keep the information coming in
and you'll see what I'm gonna do.

131
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:20,058
I understand. I overstand what I gotta do.

132
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:43,877
What's up?

133
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,521
-He wanna be a rapper.
-Yeah.

134
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:49,932
I was tellin' him
not everybody can be a rapper.

135
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,389
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, no doubt.

136
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,593
-What's up?
-You all right?

137
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,497
What's going on, man?

138
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,492
What's up, Greta? What's going down?

139
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,336
-This is a nice spot.
-You like it?

140
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,542
-Why don't we go look outside?
-Let me show you....

141
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,701
I ran into your man, Will,
on my way up, man.

142
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,441
He had a wild look in his eyes.

143
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,425
Looked like he had something on his mind.

144
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,304
-Just a white boy trying to be a nigga.
-Didn't even say, "What's up?" to me.

145
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,620
Fuck all that. How's your game going?

146
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:25,191
-Come see me play sometime.
-Guaranteed.

147
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,858
"Young people are always more given
to admiring what is wild...

148
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,241
"...than what is reasonable."
That is a quote from Delacroix.

149
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:41,596
I want to examine today, with you,
the question of identity.

150
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:45,141
Is culture involved
and is race a factor? Charlie?

151
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:48,754
I wanna be black.
I wanna get into the hip-hop thing.

152
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:51,950
Times are definitely different now
and things are different.

153
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:56,833
Obviously now you see
a lot of white kids...

154
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:02,107
...that admire and look up
to the black community...

155
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,423
...and hip-hop and rappers.

156
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:08,013
I think that people are struggling
with who they are.

157
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,335
That's a big thing.
And being a teenager is a transition...

158
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,590
...from being a kid to being an adult.

159
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,491
When you're an adult,
you have to know who you are.

160
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,940
What's not healthy about choosing a style?

161
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,742
You're saying I should treasure
my Russian heritage...

162
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,136
...and then get all caught up
in what's going on in Russia now?

163
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,589
I don't give a fuck! It'll never affect me!

164
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:32,581
You don't wanna be
what people expect of your race.

165
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:36,478
People say you're white,
you have to be this way.

166
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:41,225
You can't walk around and talk...

167
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,708
...Ebonics, you know...

168
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,914
...and they're saying....

169
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:51,601
Sometimes you just don't wanna be
what your race is supposed to be.

170
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:55,317
I'm like a little kid.
Little kids go through phases.

171
00:11:55,551 --> 00:12:00,022
I like it now. I'll stand up for it
and say, "l'm into hip-hop."

172
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,907
But when it comes down to it,
I'll be over it soon.

173
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,738
But right now while I'm in school
and I've got comfort...

174
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:08,006
...and I'm okay and my friends are into it...

175
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,224
...l can go hang out with them
and I can be a part of that.

176
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,155
I can do whatever I want.
I'm a kid, in America.

177
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,992
First of all, not everybody in here is white.

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,750
I'm from the hood, and I don't live there
anymore. I don't wanna go back.

179
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,029
I go there to visit some friends
and they're trying to get out.

180
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,122
They wanna go on to a college education.

181
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,743
They stay in school and get their grades
so they can get out.

182
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,108
And I have friends that do wanna rap.

183
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:37,172
And they rap about stuff so they
can get out of the hood.

184
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,973
We're trying to move up
and y'all trying to go down.

185
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,847
I wanna leave you with a quote
on the subject of identity.

186
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:46,600
It's from Shakespeare's Othello.
Iago, who has no identity, says:

187
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:50,661
"l am not what I am."

188
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:07,946
Excuse me, my name is Sam Doneger
and this is my husband Terry Doneger.

189
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,315
I am a freelance documentary filmmaker.

190
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:14,288
I'm doing a project on a phenomenon
that I've followed in America...

191
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:17,416
...of white high school kids
who imitate black hip-hop life.

192
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,298
I would love to include you
in my documentary.

193
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,697
This is very important to me.
I have a vision.

194
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,109
I want it to be very real, raw and honest.

195
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,616
-You think we fit this description?
-I think you do.

196
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,802
So you wanna know
why we call ourselves niggas?

197
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:36,683
You actually use the term "niggers"?
lsn't that a derogatory term?

198
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:42,435
"Nigger" is a derogatory term.
"Niggas" isn't.

199
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,263
"Niggas" is like, "These are my niggas."

200
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,019
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

201
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,312
We should introduce her to Will.

202
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:54,274
You gotta meet Will, his brother.
He's the true nigga.

203
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,982
This is my girl Kim, I'm Marty, that's Wren.

204
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,840
Raven and Wren's girl Charlie.

205
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,159
I'm Sam, this is Terry...

206
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,193
...and include me in your day, all right?

207
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:09,137
-So you're gonna make us famous?
-Whatever I can do.

208
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:13,835
-Where'd you learn how to make movies?
-I went to NYU film school.

209
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:18,293
The 14th is no good.
We can do it on the....

210
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,796
Let's make it the 13th at 2:00.

211
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,483
Hold on one second.

212
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:27,270
-Arnie!
-I'll call you back.

213
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:29,355
-How you doing?
-Good to see you.

214
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,725
-I think you know Rich.
-Absolutely. We met yesterday.

215
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,897
And I believe you know Cigar.

216
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:39,001
And this is Dean. He's a point guard
on the Rider's basketball team.

217
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,627
I love watching
those smooth moves you got!

218
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:46,022
I suggest that you guys take a look
downstairs and get a run of the joint.

219
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,735
Steve and I will talk business up here.

220
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:51,667
-Friendly business.
-This is gonna be big for everybody.

221
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,605
It's a ball to see you, baby.
Have a seat right over here.

222
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:58,987
I'm so glad that you called
and we got this thing straightened out.

223
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,126
These white motherfuckers kill me!

224
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:05,459
Yesterday me and Gar come in here
by ourselves, no fucking deal.

225
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,804
Today we bring in another cracker
and it's all good.

226
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:13,512
-Could you explain this shit to me?
-That's just your reputation preceding you.

227
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,070
That's all gonna change now.

228
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,381
What I cannot afford is a corpse
in my lobby.

229
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:23,005
A Biggy Smalls, a Tupac,
a body in my elevator.

230
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,473
You know, that's not good for business.

231
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,055
What did you think about me
and Greta getting back?

232
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,633
Back and forth. It's your game, baby.

233
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,942
Do what you want.
Whatever turns you on.

234
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,759
She's writing her
anthropology graduate thesis on race.

235
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:36,918
Good for her.

236
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,190
-I think we're gonna make it this time.
-Let me ask you a question:

237
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,137
What do you think these white people
really want from us?

238
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:46,374
You know. White motherfuckers
trying to imitate us...

239
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,388
...trying to rap, dress black
and all this shit.

240
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:52,827
Bitches throwing pussy all over.
What's going on with this shit?

241
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,973
A lot of people think it's like size.
The myth....

242
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:59,978
Niggas got bigger dicks and shit.
But I don't think that's it.

243
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,185
I think they think they're gonna
get some kind of life force...

244
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,148
...some shit from fucking with us.

245
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,988
Had some white chicks
in the park with me the other day.

246
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,752
Some preppy little chicks,
freaking them off.

247
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,466
Pops is an investment banker.
Central Park West living and all that.

248
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,898
I don't know what she thinks
she's gonna get from being around me.

249
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,352
I'm probably trying to get a little of her
information and see what I can do with it.

250
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,866
White people are as different
from each other as black people.

251
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,124
You can't lump them together like that.
The thing I got with Greta, it's different.

252
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:35,213
"The mind is a terrible thing to waste

253
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,667
"Especially smoked out,

254

00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,183
-What up, kid? What's up, baby?
-Hi.

266
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,496
-What's going on?
-How are you?

267
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,842
Sneaking up on us.

268
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,918
I'm not sneaking up on you.
I can't believe this is happening.

269
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,569
-We're gonna make hits, I'm telling you.
-Congratulations.

270
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:30,592
-Where's Rich?
-Rich is right up there talking to Dean.

271
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,666
They're not in jail. They're professionals
and they just want to work.

272
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:40,570
And I'd really appreciate
if we can work here with you.

273
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,892
-What's up?
-How are you?

274
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,692
This is like real shit!

275
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,424
Just trying to do my biz
and make a record.

276
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,176
-Are you proud of me, baby?
-Yes, I'm proud of you.

277
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,759
I just want you to know,
that I care about you a lot.

278
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:01,346
If you do feel like you're going
into a bad route....

279
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,299
If I do, I'm gonna come see you
and get my blessings.

280
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:05,983
Good, then you know.

281
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,725
Just keep them blessings
in your heart for me, that's all.

282
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:12,743
Four words: You've got a deal.

283
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,801
Thanks. All right, man.

284
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,167

Damn, life is just fucking crazy, man.

295
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,337
You could be living in heaven
and still living in hell.

296
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,507
I'd be thinking,
can you change who you are?

297
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,609
Do you love the Other,
more than you love yourself?.

298
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,958
Do you wish you were another way?

299
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:01,172
If you're black, can you bleach?

300
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,224
If you're white, can you dye?

301
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:05,748
Can you be ghetto
without living in the ghetto?

302
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:10,128
Do you look in the mirror and see your
face or do you close your eyes and dream?

303
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,670
What do you want?

304
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:14,453
Can you look within
and embrace your soul or not?

305
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,529
Can you change who you are?
You can look at me as long as you want...

306
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,088
...but I'll always be me
and you'll always be you.

307
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:25,831
I've got one for Kim.
She said something earlier about:

308
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,243
"l don't wanna eat dick tonight,
just eat my pussy right."

309
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:30,774
-Dirty mouth.
-Is that--

310
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,956
-You know that's Little Kim. It's a quote.
-She's a rapper.

311
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,677
But that's also Big Kim right here.

312
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,915
If you're making that assumption,
is it that you want to have...

313
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:43,043
...a girl eating your pussy
or you don't want dick that night?

314
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:46,614
I'm just saying that guys for so long
have been taking what they want...

315
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,633
...getting their come on.
It's time girls fucking get their come on.

316
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:54,697
What about you guys?

317
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,332
Your husband's obviously gay.
What's that about?

318
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,239
Love. That's what it's about.

319
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,113
My husband is a very sensitive
and complex person...

320
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:04,832
...and we're crazy about each other.
Right, darling?

321
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:07,781
Absolutely, my angel.
I have a question for everyone.

322
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:10,389
Origin of the word "fuck." Who knows it?

323
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:14,533
What's the origin of the word "fuck?"
Tell them the origin of the word.

324
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:20,149
17th century, Charles l:
"Fornication under consent of the king."

325
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:24,929
Tell me what they can offer you.
What do they offer you?

326
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,241
Why do you wanna be involved in it?

327
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,785
-It's like safety.
-Safety from what?

328
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:33,004
Safety from anyone
who wants to fuck with us.

329
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,040
Hi. I'm Mark Clear.

330
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,894
How are you doing, Mark?

331
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,355
-You're Dean.
-That's me.

332
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:54,925
-You're the point guard on the Rider team.
-Yeah, man. Good luck.

333
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,120
Good luck with what?
What does that mean?

334
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,433
That's my way of saying see you later.

335
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,859
Really? That's too bad 'cause...

336
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:05,515
...l had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

337
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,398
What's that?

338
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,663
I was just wondering if you wanted
to make $50,000. $10,000 up front.

339
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:15,197
-Are you a quiz show host or something?
-No. I'm your future.

340
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,840
I think you got the wrong guy.

341
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,256
So some rinky-dink basketball game
that nobody gives a shit...

342
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,153
...what the score is tomorrow is more
important to you...

343
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,342
...than making $50,000 in cash?

344
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,428
-I'm starting to think you're serious.
-I'm totally serious.

345
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,660
I don't know about this.
This is criminal stuff.

346
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,555
In what way, though?
It's a crime against...

347
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:43,097
...the federal government.
It's not a crime against some old woman.

348
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:45,884
You're not hurting anybody.
Only the Federal Government.

349
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:47,714
Do you care about them? I don't.

350
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,589
What have they done for you?
They haven't done much for me.

351
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,701
-You haven't been drafted yet, have you?
-No.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,877
What happens after you graduate?

353
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:59,160
I got more interesting things
going on than throwing a game.

354
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,739
If you don't want it, don't take it.

355
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:04,119
-What if I turned you in right now?
-Turned me in?

356
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,265
I don't think you'd turn me in.

357
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:10,656
Would this be the worst thing
you ever did in your life?

358
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,613
What? A few bad passes,
a few missed lay-ups.

359
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:16,406
Who the hell would ever know?

360
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,553
-What's in it for you?
-Don't worry about me.

361
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,163
I'll bet what I want on the game.

362
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,466
I'm gonna make more money than you will.
Think about it.

363
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:27,129
Tomorrow if you're around at noon,
Time Cafe downtown?

364
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,860
Okay.

365
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,393
900 words? No way.

366
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,776
I need at least 1,800.
This is a major article I'm writing.

367
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,850
Look who's sitting there.
District Attorney King.

368
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,515
You boys were playing football.
What's the verdict?

369
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,590
He's got good hands.

370
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:49,276
Runs in the family.

371
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:59,017
Billy, an odd-looking guy
keeps staring at you.

372
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,385
-Looks like he knows you.
-Maybe he does.

373
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,394
I should make my way over
and introduce myself to our illustrious D.A.

374
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,164
George Wayne, Vanity Fair, writer.

375
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,460
I read your column every month.
You're wonderful.

376
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:13,529
You're the much loved, much praised...

377
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:17,291
-...District Attorney of Manhattan.
-I don't know if I'm praised and loved.

378
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,570
And you are Sheila King,
formerly Sheila Blair.

379
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,636
Assistant D.A. in charge of sex crimes.

380
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:24,907
Very good.

381
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,915
I've interrupted your lunch because
I'm having a meeting with my editor...

382
00:23:29,377 --> 00:23:32,528
...and we're thinking about doing a story:
"Ten Who Run New York."

383
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:37,589
And you're on the short-list with the likes
of Donald Trump and the Mayor.

384
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,087
What do you think of that notion?

385
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:44,384
Maybe you should interview
some of his past wives, too.

386
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,079
-Wives?
-He's got two others besides this woman.

387
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,893
You should meet my brother Will.
He's got a nice resume, too.

388
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:53,743
Is Will studying to be a lawyer?

389
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:57,015
He's on his way to law,
but in a different sense.

390
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,228
-My son has a vivid imagination.
-I've got a good imagination, George.

391
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:04,331
-Call my office tomorrow.
-Sounds like a great idea.

392
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:08,453
-We can lock it up.
-I like that notion. "Lock it up."

393
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:10,773
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks for the intrusion.

394
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,707
What's wrong with you?

395
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:23,153
-The guy's a journalist.
-This is a great opportunity for your father.

396
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:25,816
What do you care?
What's it have to do with you?

397
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,888
-It's his fucking career.
-Watch your mouth.

398
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:31,007
Are you serious? Watch my mouth?

399
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:34,458
Since when do you say watch my mouth?
Since she's around?

400
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:38,040
Don't you ever disrespect my wife
or me in front of a stranger again.

401
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:43,061
I'll cut you off. Be with your brother.
Buy your fancy Avirex and Kangol hats.

402
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:48,186
-Go uptown and hang out with him.
-You're really scaring me, Pop.

403
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,207
Go. Why don't you leave right now?

404
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,799
Go home, pack your bags,
move out of our house.

405
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,029
What's that supposed to be, a punishment?

406
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,717
You bet it is.
Either play by my rules or get out.

407
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,632
Do you hear me? Support yourself.

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,575
-Nobody.
-You don't trust me?

447
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:34,478
I'm listening to a guy
and the way he was coming at me--

448
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,869
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

449
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:39,770
The guy who approached me
was a gambler.

450
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,023
So what's your point?

451
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:47,038
He offered me $50,000 to throw the game.

452
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:50,701
That's the kind of thing Luke used to do
when I was living with him.

453
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,261
He would bribe players.

454
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,120
Why'd you live with someone like that?

455
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,668
-Someone like you?
-What's that supposed to mean?

456
00:27:56,864 --> 00:28:00,140
He paid bribes, you're gonna take a bribe.
What's the difference?

457
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,637
Should I do it or not?

458
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,288
Just be true to yourself.

459
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:14,790
So, we have no alcohol sponsor,
no liquor sponsor, nothing.

460
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:17,205
And we're gonna open up a club
in three days?

461
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:19,415
We do have a sponsor.

462
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,687
Celebrity plus models equals a bash.

463
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:24,616
It's gonna be sick.

464
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,208
Hook me up.

465
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,185
Get on the phone and check on that.

466
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:31,429
If you don't stop stressing,
you're gonna die before you're 25.

467
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:33,476
I want it to be right.

468
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:38,132
White boys.

469
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,817
Get a fucking representative up.

470
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:44,505
-Who's the man in charge?
-Back up.

471
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,049
-Who's in charge?
-I am.

472
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,039
-You in charge?
-Yeah. Scotty.

473
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,800
You here with me?

474
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,225
Everybody shut the fuck up
and let me handle my business!

475
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,371
You white boys came to the hood.

476
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:01,933
You all some blind motherfuckers
for trying that.

477
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,770
-Ain't this a bitch.
-Just quit this shit.

478
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,556
-You know where you're at?
-Yeah, I know.

479
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:11,507
I don't think you know. I didn't get
any phone calls from you or your people.

480
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:13,437
-You know who I am?
-I think so.

481
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:15,992
I need 75 percent of this joint right here.

482
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:19,813
75 percent me,
25 percent for you and your guys.

483
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:21,576
What are we getting for 75 percent?

484
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:26,327
Who the fuck are you?
I thought he was the fucking spokesman.

485
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:28,961
Do you understand?
Turn around and look at him.

486
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:31,313
You understand what I'm talking about?

487
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,209
I don't want this fucking shit
happening here.

488
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:36,449
All right.

489
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,134
I don't know. I don't have any money.

490
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:41,322
It's not my money, it's somebody else's.

491
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:44,775
Then why did you step up
like you're the man in charge then?

492
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:47,725
'Cause I didn't know who you were,
I didn't know.

493
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,840
Shut up, all right? Please.

494
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,964
Don't watch my gun.
Guns don't kill people, people kill people.

495
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:55,698
-Tell him who your uncle is.
-Fuck his uncle!

496
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,144
-Take down his phone number.
-Are you down with the mob?

497
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,987
-You want my number?
-Yeah, your number.

498
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,414
555-2975.

499
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:10,177
-I'm sorry, man. What was your number?
-555-2975!

500
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,541
White boys, you all got heart.

501
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,126
Tell him Rich Bower.

502
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,703
-Come to the gym tomorrow.
-What gym you talking about?

503
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,428
Where Tyson trains.

504
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:24,701
You motherfuckers make sure
you get your shit right 'cause I'll be back.

505
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:29,879
Tell the boys to reach out for me.

506
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,083
Scotty, we had nothing to do with that.

507
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,140
What the fuck is going on?

508
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:53,988
Do you know those guys?

509
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:56,324
Who are those fucking guys?

510
00:30:56,482 --> 00:31:00,555
Nigger motherfuckers come in here.
Who the fuck are they?

511
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,258
-So we're on?
-What makes you so sure?

512
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,660
You showed up.

513
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,363
Yeah, I'm here.

514
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,578
-Did you tell anybody about this?
-No.

515
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,087
-Nobody.
-Nobody.

516
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,566
-Not even your girlfriend?
-How do you know I got a girlfriend?

517
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,137
I don't know you have a girlfriend.
I just assume you do.

518
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,738
I mean, you're a young man. You know.

519
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,325
-So did you tell her?
-Why would I tell my girl?

520
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,236
If you do, we're fucked.
You don't wanna fuck me.

521
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:46,080
I thought about it, but I think I'll pass on it.

522
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:49,127
Seriously, you don't wanna fuck me, right?

523
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:52,552
-You're asking me some strange questions.
-This will be a fuck fest.

524
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:56,760
Both of us are gonna be fucked
if you say anything to anybody.

525
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,425
I don't think you wanna do this.

526
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:03,414
You act like you don't.
So do you want me to say no?

527
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:06,268
I don't want you to say no,
just what you wanna say.

528
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:09,021
If you wanna do it, I want you to do it.
If you wanna...

529
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,443
...basically take a lot of money
to fix a game.

530
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,146
I want you to be clear with this.

531
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:16,611
You're committing a felony.
You're losing a basketball game for money.

532
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:20,202
I want you to understand
that you're breaking the law.

533
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:22,309
If you're fine with that, then so am l.

534
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:25,039
I know what I'm doing.
You got the money or what?

535
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:28,061
I got the 10. Then you get the 15,
then the 25.

536
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:29,808
Where is it?

537
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,004
It's in the bathroom.

538
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,534
It's not in the bathroom,
it's in my underwear.

539
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:42,111
I think we should go
into the bathroom to get it.

540
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:47,240
I could get it out of my underwear now
but I think we should go in the bathroom.

541
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,217
All right. Let's go in the bathroom
and get your money.

542
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,885
Let's go to the bathroom
and get out my underwear.

543
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,989
This is crazy.

544
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,218
The things we do
to throw a basketball game.

545
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:15,307
So?

546
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,399
-Don't try no funny stuff, man.
-Funny stuff?.

547
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:27,689
You look like a pervert or something.

548
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,706
I'm not a pervert.

549
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,843
You are mighty strange.

550
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:38,354
Will you stop fumbling around
and give me the money?

551
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,261
What is that supposed to mean?

552
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,475
-Bad? Strange? What?
-Take it how you want it.

553
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:11,315
-How are you?
-Chilling.

554
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:15,860
Went down there and checked out
that club you told me about.

555
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:19,075
Glad to be of service.

556
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:22,609
-What's happening?
-Same old same old. Taking care of shit.

557
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,721
Taking care of what?

558
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:30,370
Nothing, just come from down the street.
Smoke a little weed, see some girls.

559
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:33,384
-Who's down there?
-Just some girls I saw.

560
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,923
Nothing belonging to me down there?

561
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:39,411
Four guys, three cows,
two sheep, anything you need.

562
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,308
You got a sick mind.

563
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:46,415
White boy gets into
some crazy shit sometimes.

564
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,223
Fucking D.A.'s psycho son.

565
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:55,703
This right here is the infamous Will.

566
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,020
Sam Doneger. Nice to meet you.

567
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,838
I'm you're fan, aren't l?

568
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,612
I'm doing a film on your brother.
This is my husband Terry.

569
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,912
She found us
and she's doing this documentary.

570
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:14,019
Who are these guys?
Will you introduce us?

571
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:16,315
-No.
-No?

572
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:19,277
What up?

573
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,868
I'll be over there at the wall.

574
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:25,854
What's the wall?

575
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:29,050
The wall is where they're from.
It's where they congregate.

576
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,712
Can we go to the wall? Can we do that?

577
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,033
No, you can't go to the wall.
Don't go to the wall.

578
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,914
We'll go to the wall. It's a free country.

579
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:40,985
Don't go to the wall.
Don't follow them there. Don't do it.

580
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:43,754
Why don't you get back downtown?

581
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:45,141
Let's go to the wall.

582
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:48,159
Why don't you go downtown?
I'm as much from here as you are.

583
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,517
-Why can't we go to the wall?
-We can go if you wanna go.

584
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:55,260
-Why has he gotta be so possessive?
-Let's go. Let's go to the wall.

585
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,569
My brother's a pretty cool guy, isn't he?

586
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,672
Are you guys imitating a black culture
or a black lifestyle?

587
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:22,246
We're not imitating it,
we're influenced by it.

588
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,395
Did you always have that way of speaking?
ls that the way you were brought up?

589
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:29,612
Whatever. It just happened.

590
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,609
If you moved to London right now,
in two years you'd be talking...

591
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:35,093
...like some English person.

592
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,606
You talk like this to your parents?
How do they feel about it?

593
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:41,592
They hate it,
but their parents hated what they did.

594
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:44,098
So, it is about rebelling
against your parents.

595
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,315
It's about doing what the fuck
you wanna do.

596
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,578
Sam? Oh, my God!

597
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:58,566
Hi. How are you?

598
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:01,758
You've changed so much.

599
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:05,819
I have. I'm a filmmaker.
I'm doing a documentary.

600
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:06,857
Really?

601
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,373
What's your name?

602
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,935
Scott.

603
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:13,257
-Howdy, Scott.
-How you doing, pal?

604
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:16,464
What do you want?

605
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,898
-Nothing. Just watching.
-Watching what?

606
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,551
The approach to Staten lsland.

607
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,893
Are you married?

608
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,343
Yeah, I'm married.
I live on the Upper East Side....

609
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,745
-I don't mean to be strange or pushy or...
-Well, you are.

610
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,493
...come off like a cushion pusher to you.

611
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,855
I don't understand.

612
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,651
Why do you guys always gotta come up
and talk to me?

613
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,443
I'm not gay. Do I have a sign on me
that says "fuck me" or something?

614
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,713
-'Cause I don't like dick.
-Right.

615
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,604
I'm going to my girlfriend's house.
Girlfriend, girlfriend.

616
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:51,283
-What's his name?
-His name. Real funny.

617
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,112
I'm married, too.
Actually, that's my husband.

618
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,600
Back up. Every day I got
one of you freaks coming up...

619
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:00,852
...and trying to hit on me.
I don't understand. What's the deal?

620
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:04,511
Do I look gay?
Am I wearing a G-string and Daisy Dukes?

621
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:08,856
-It's more of just an energy.
-Let me know if you see it.

622
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:11,756
-'Cause I don't know what it is.
-I just saw you walk in.

623
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:15,866
-Is my walk feminine or something?
-Let me see. Give me a walk.

624
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:19,165
-Did you see it when I walked in?
-I wasn't paying attention.

625
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,173
What makes you think
I wanna go with you?

626
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:22,531
It's your energy.

627
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:25,868
-There's nothing to do about it?
-I don't know if it's internalised.

628
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,240
Do you go up to people randomly
and bother them?

629
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,779
-Yes.
-You're bothering me.

630
00:38:29,927 --> 00:38:32,157
-I don't mean to.
-Can you leave me alone?

631
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:33,540
Certainly--

632
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:36,798
All right. Nice meeting you.
Let's leave it at that.

633
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,052
-Goodbye. Take care.
-Very well.

634
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:46,363
-I don't know about this shit.
-Just trust me on this shit.

635
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:49,692
-This is Brett Ratner right here.
-Rich, good to see you.

636
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,470
-Cigar, what up?
-Good to meet you.

637
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:54,540
I heard your record. I'm a big fan.

638
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,656
-It's incredible.
-I don't make records.

639
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,229
He sent me the demo.

640
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,883
I sent him the tape,
the demo of the Cream Team.

641
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,718
Why do you think I came out here?

642
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,512
I hope you came out here to do work.
That's what we want.

643
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,505
I'm here to sell records for you.

644
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:13,941
Every time I call this nigga,
he be having a joint, playing.

645
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:17,223
I'm doing Hollywood films,
you got a hit record.

646
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,962
I wanna do a video. Because
if I do it, it's gonna cross over.

647
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:23,217
I've never been to Staten lsland before.

648
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,947
But I know what you
and your music are about.

649
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:27,782
And I know what you're saying.

650
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:30,895
I respect what he do,
but we ain't the same type of people.

651
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:32,585
We're black, he's white.

652
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:36,005
The truth is, I'm white, I'm from Miami.
But I love your music.

653
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:39,148
I'm just here to make it look great.
That's my job.

654
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,399
He gonna Hollywoodise it for us.

655
00:39:41,574 --> 00:39:43,690
I'm gonna give you the production values.

656
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:46,905
He gonna make it look like it's Hollywood
even though it ain't.

657
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:51,327
-We're gonna take it from the purest form.
-I know what your audience wants...

658
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,051
...and I know how to cross it over
at the same time.

659
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:58,803
All I want to say is,
if my man believes in you, I believe in you.

660
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,927
-What's going down?
-Sorry. Sam Doneger.

661
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,250
I'm doing a documentary.

662
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:07,025
Rolling up on a nigga
with a camera and all this shit.

663
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,994
This is a camera.
I'm just working with myself.

664
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,334
I'm doing a documentary
on this phenomenon I've witnessed...

665
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:16,155
...all over America.
Hi. Sam. What's your name?

666
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,310
Brett Ratner.

667
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:19,331
Brett. Rush Hour. Great.

668
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:23,312
You said you were going to the wall.
Is this the wall?

669
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,381
Okay, I want to interview you.

670
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,496
Holly shit! Brett fucking Ratner!

671
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,744
Why didn't you tell me he was coming in?

672
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:42,636
I know you know this cat, man.

673
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:46,419
We're doing a video here.

674
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:50,306
Now I know I gotta watch my back.
I'm fucking with analogue niggas.

675
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:57,281
You know these motherfuckers?

676
00:40:57,433 --> 00:41:00,345
-I don't know them.
-They bought your record.

677
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:04,840
Don't leave me out.

678
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:08,113
What goes on? Oh, my God.

679
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:10,585
This the pesky lady
with the camera right here.

680
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:13,247
-Yeah, I'm doing a documentary.
-Miss Doneger.

681
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:16,287
-Sam's my name.
-What you be needs to know?

682
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:20,201
-I wanna know about the wall.
-All right, I'll tell you about the wall.

683
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:24,605
This wall is a monument
to two former soldiers that lived out here.

684
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:29,186
America is definitely eating its young.
It's time we did something about it...

685
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:32,101
...and took responsibility
for our ways and actions.

686
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:35,976
That's why you got,
"Can it be all so simple?"

687
00:41:36,634 --> 00:41:37,783
It ain't that simple.

688
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,477
It's never that simple. That's why
after the laughter there's always tears.

689
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,759
You'd be surprised how many white kids
do know what time it is.

690
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:47,331
The same way we was taught
when we came here...

691
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,953
...on the slave ships, we teaching now.

692
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,831
So who are the slaves today?

693
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:54,502
We still the slaves.

694
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:58,439
-The average working man is a slave.
-We all sharecropping.

695
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,927
But the thing is,
this music is so influential and so real...

696
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,236
...there is not a wall built
that can hold it down.

697
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:17,596
Me and Charlie wanna come
hang out with you.

698
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,311
You all got too much
extra baggage around.

699
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,863
-If we lose our boyfriends, can we come?
-What did I just tell you?

700
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,097
-I'll say I'm not feeling well.
-I wanna go.

701
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:06,223
When we get off the ferry,
let's jump in a cab and ditch them.

702
00:43:07,216 --> 00:43:09,446
Let's get something to eat
when we get back.

703
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:11,704
Let's get it when we get to Chinatown.

704
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,845
There's only one cab.
There's not enough for everybody.

705
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:43,676
We have to stick with these kids.

706
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,061
-You wanna meet up later?
-We gotta take two cabs.

707
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,128
-I'm just gonna chill out.
-Let's go over to my house.

708
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,485
Let's go.

709
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:53,587
-Charlie, wait!
-We'll talk tomorrow.

710
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,769
-I can't find my nose ring.
-Something's fucked up. Let's follow them.

711
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,603
This is fucking bullshit.

712
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,444
-What's wrong?
-Get in. Go.

713
00:44:43,218 --> 00:44:45,095
Come on, I ain't got all day.

714
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,042
You're under arrest.

715
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:52,593
For what?

716
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,950
I want you to understand
that you're breaking the law.

717
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:04,142
If you're fine with that, then so am l.

718
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,469
Just tell me you understand
what you're doing.

719
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,885
I know what I'm doing.
You got the money or what?

720
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,349
I got the 10. Then you get the 15,
then the 25.

721
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,310
Where is it?

722
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,881
What you want from me?

723
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,844
-Rich.
-Rich?

724
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,424
Rich is not even in--

725
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:30,563
He's just the biggest gangster in Harlem.

726
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,799
Rich is into entertainment, rap.
He's not a street hustler.

727
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:37,099
Okay, then you go to jail.

728
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:38,862
What's this all about?

729
00:45:39,017 --> 00:45:42,612
It's about you going to jail
unless you give me Rich. You're fucked.

730
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,913
I'm a fucking New York City detective.

731
00:45:47,107 --> 00:45:49,462
You're under arrest. You're fucked.

732
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,486
For $50,000.

733
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:01,844
You and Cigar arrange that meeting
at the gym for me?

734
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:04,916
You know I handled that.
2:00, he wants to talk.

735
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:06,720
Everybody gonna be there.

736
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:11,877
-Who is it?
-Wren and Marty to see Charlie and Kim.

737
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:13,123
Oh, shit!

738
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:15,815
Yeah, let them in.

739
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:19,003
-What the fuck are they doing here?
-I don't know, but chill.

740
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,463
Charlie, come on, I want to talk to you.

741
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,958
No, not now. What do you want?

742
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:33,552
-I want to talk to you. Please.
-Tell me now. What?

743
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:36,652
-Can we talk?
-What do you want to talk about? Stop it!

744
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,420
-Calm down, man.
-Get off it.

745
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:42,176
Don't be starting with him.
It's my problem.

746
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,875
What do you mean,
don't be starting with him?

747
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:48,746
It's my fucking problem.
I don't even want to talk to you about it.

748
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:50,755
Chill out with that bullshit.

749
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:53,747
-I thought I could trust you.
-You can. What did I do?

750
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,116
I thought you were going to Kim's house.

751
00:46:56,294 --> 00:46:59,286
I thought I was going over
to Kim's house, too. But Rae--

752
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:02,262
I didn't know that you knew
these people like this.

753
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:05,984
They were talking about this place,
and I'd never been here.

754
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:08,096
So I said, "Take me there."

755
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:11,296
You've never gotten into a cab
and changed your mind? Ever?

756
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,825
She didn't even know.
We would've told you.

757
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:18,523
You come here
and you're disrespectful to everybody.

758
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,960
Disrespectful? What?

759
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:25,856
It was a chill, mellow environment
until your ass showed up.

760
00:47:26,404 --> 00:47:29,874
It was cool in here.
We were all relaxing, smoking joints...

761
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,639
...watching television.

762
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:34,901
-You said you were going to Kim's.
-And then we changed our minds.

763
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,680
-In the middle of the cab drive.
-Why are you here?

764
00:47:37,873 --> 00:47:42,071
Alright, let her chill out.
Help me finish this. Come on.

765
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:47,390
It's cool.
Everybody's a little crazy right now.

766
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:51,943
Why do you gotta be getting
involved with my problems?

767
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,127
What do you mean, why I got
to get involved with your problems?

768
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:57,941
When he's around
you always disrespect me.

769
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,368
So fucking what?

770
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,144
You're always telling me I'm your pussy,
I'm this, I'm that.

771
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:06,268
You gotta chill on that shit.

772
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:08,962
-Is that Mike Tyson?
-Yeah, that's Mike Tyson.

773
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,948
-Are you filming everything?
-It's part of the documentary.

774
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:14,667
-Check the joint out.
-Give me this shit.

775
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:19,379
Come on, it's part of the documentary.
I'm not doing anything bad with it.

776
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:21,885
Okay, this is me.

777
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:25,791
-This is what I look like.
-Yeah, I can see you right there.

778
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,474
-Is that really Mike Tyson?
-Yeah, that's Mike Tyson.

779
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:32,839
-Women in the Palaeolithic Era.
-The Golden Age.

780
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:34,700
Yeah. Goddesses.

781
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:38,844
-They ruled.
-No one understood procreation.

782
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,449
How would anybody know
without being told?

783
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,467
-People just go on being naive and angry.
-It makes perfect sense.

784
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:49,175
-We didn't go to the bookstore.
-We'll do it tomorrow.

785
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:52,504
-Keep well.
-You too. Bye.

786
00:48:56,026 --> 00:49:00,338
Did you know that women
in the Palaeolithic Era were like....

787
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:04,567
-What's the matter?
-I'm fucked.

788
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:07,976
-The game didn't work out?
-Nothing worked out. The guy was a cop.

789
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,282
-The guy who approached you?
-The guy who paid me!

790
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:13,848
You took the money.

791
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:17,257
You act surprised.
You thought I should take the money, too.

792
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:19,811
I said, "Do what you want,
just be true to yourself."

793
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:21,847
What was that supposed to mean?

794
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:26,398
That means free will, your choice.
And you chose to take the bribe.

795
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:30,640
-So what's the problem now, you regret it?
-Yeah, I regret it. I got caught!

796
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,688
Suppose you hadn't been caught.
Then what?

797
00:49:34,644 --> 00:49:37,078
Then you would've felt good
about yourself, right?

798
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:42,549
So, who you are is based on external
judgements and not any conviction.

799
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:46,488
Are you listening to yourself?.
I'm in the worst trouble of my life...

800
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,205
...and you're examining it
like it's a term paper.

801
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,079
What happened? Did he arrest you?

802
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,415
-I guess.
-What do you mean you guess?

803
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,454
-He didn't want me.
-Who did he want?

804
00:49:56,662 --> 00:50:00,132
He wanted me to rat out Rich
because of the shit he's doing.

805
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:02,808
-Then he'll let you go?
-That's what he said.

806
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:05,197
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

807
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,594
I thought Rich was your friend.

808
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,872
We grew up together.
He went his way, I went my way.

809
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,130
All this is about fucking with the law.

810
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,177
-And you've been straight?
-That's right.

811
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:21,102
-Now you broke away and got nailed?
-Are you saying I'm supposed to go to jail?

812
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,911
-I'm saying be true to yourself.
-What would you do?

813
00:50:24,103 --> 00:50:25,297
It doesn't matter.

814
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:35,910
-Sorry. Are you having a private moment?
-Yeah.

815
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:42,810
-Excuse me, brother?
-I'm sorry, my heart is pounding right now.

816
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,310
I'm just so excited to meet you and stuff.

817
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:53,227
If I could just have a minute of your time
to tell you some things I have to get rid of.

818
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:56,964
-What can I do for you, my friend?
-I'm Terrence Doneger.

819
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,058
What can I do for you?

820
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:02,620
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

821
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:07,499
I met you in the Versace store...

822
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:11,680
...in Los Angeles a while back,
and I was a little drunk, and--

823
00:51:12,814 --> 00:51:13,963
I don't know you.

824
00:51:14,106 --> 00:51:18,497
No, I didn't say that we knew each other,
just that I had met you before.

825
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:20,733
I wanted to apologise if I said anything--

826
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:24,738
-I don't remember.
-Good. 'Cause I barely remember myself.

827
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,225
Don't worry about it. You're okay, man.

828
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:42,819
I had a dream about you.
This was what I wanted to say.

829
00:51:43,048 --> 00:51:45,323
It's why my heart is racing
and I'm so fluttery.

830
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,140
If I seem strange, I'd like to apologise.
I had a dream about you two weeks ago.

831
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:54,469
That's funny, because you were wearing
a shirt like the one you're wearing now.

832
00:51:55,977 --> 00:51:58,207
-And in the dream--
-Listen.

833
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,363
I'm on parole brother. Please. Let's....

834
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:06,809
-Am I annoying you?
-I just wanna....

835
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:10,631
-I'm having a peaceful moment. Please.
-Okay.

836
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:15,294
In the dream, you were holding me,
that's all.

837
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:21,670
Motherfucker!

838
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,312
Sam, are you getting this?

839
00:52:23,752 --> 00:52:25,902
Don't talk to me like that again!

840
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:32,472
God! What are you doing?

841
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:34,473
Don't fuck with me, come drinker!

842
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,452
I'm sure Mr. Tyson would rather
speak to so many other people right now.

843
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:45,331
I'm Sam.

844
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:53,442
She got that on tape.
That isn't right. You ain't right.

845
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:57,855
I don't know anything about this
white fag shit. White guys do this shit.

846
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,611
Listen, I'm from a different culture.

847
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:03,271
Steady on the assault and battery now.

848
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:07,455
I was in the penitentiary.
They said I raped somebody, so just....

849
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:12,045
-Do you wanna talk to me about it?
-That's okay.

850
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:14,209
I'll take your word for it.

851
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:18,115
They put you underneath the penitentiary
for the white women.

852
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:19,934
Is there a difference?

853
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:23,166
What's the difference between
a white woman versus a black woman?

854
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:27,142
Don't touch no white bitch.
They got me with that other.

855
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,019
Do you want me to turn it off?.

856
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:32,336
-Please, now.
-Do you want me to turn it off?.

857
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,230
Please! You're not dealing with an animal.
This is not a study of animals.

858
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,075
It's off. Okay?

859
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:41,450
Please allow me....
Just leave me here, please.

860
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,418
-Okay.
-Please.

861
00:53:43,865 --> 00:53:48,302
Can I just introduce myself to you?
ln all honesty, I'm a fan.

862
00:53:49,662 --> 00:53:52,096
Go ahead with that strange individual.

863
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:55,717
I don't think he meant any harm.
I really don't.

864
00:54:02,256 --> 00:54:03,655
What's his name?

865
00:54:04,258 --> 00:54:06,010
-Whose name?
-The cop.

866
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:07,821
Mark Clear.

867
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,103
What does he look like?

868
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,178
-What does he look like?
-Yes.

869
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:14,498
What difference does it make
what he looks like?

870
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:16,002
Just curious.

871
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:18,646
He looks like what he is.

872
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:21,579
So what are you gonna do now?

873
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:30,861
You're definitely beautiful to look at.

874
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:33,704
-You really believe that?
-Why would I say that?

875
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,549
Do you think I want you mad at me
for lying? I'm not gonna lie to you.

876
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:42,406
Of course I wouldn't be angry 'cause
no one ever told me that I was gorgeous.

877
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:46,084
But you are, you really are. Come on!

878
00:54:46,545 --> 00:54:48,740
You've got beautiful eyes.

879
00:54:51,466 --> 00:54:55,254
And I'm in the phone book. Sam Doneger.

880
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:08,190
Hold on. A chick named Greta
wanna holler at you.

881
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:13,214
Greta? What the fuck she wanna holler
at me for? What's going on here?

882
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,773
Are you okay, honey? That was great.

883
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:18,999
Rich right here. Speak to me.

884
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:21,808
Listen, I've gotta see you right away.

885
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:25,126
-What's on your mind?
-Not on the phone.

886
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:26,964
You're in a lot of trouble.

887
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:29,837
I wanna help you,
but you have to come out and meet me.

888
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:32,529
What do you mean
I may be in a lot of trouble?

889
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:35,350
What the fuck are you gonna help me with?

890
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:40,754
Be at The Roger Williams Hotel.
Room 406, in one hour.

891
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:44,704
-Meet you at a hotel?
-That's right.

892
00:55:45,348 --> 00:55:48,658
-Why you can't tell me over the phone?
-Just be there. Trust me.

893
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,639
Let's get this shit straight.

894
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:05,753
Ain't no funny business going on here.

895
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:09,544
Me and my man Dean been down
for too long since we was kids.

896
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,623
Like five years old.
You know I what I'm saying?

897
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:14,901
All right.

898
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:29,546
-Come on, baby, I gotta take a piss.
-Go right ahead.

899
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,967
-So, you think Dean is your friend?
-Yeah, Dean's my friend.

900
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,576
What would you do if you knew
that Dean was approached by a gambler...

901
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,966
...and offered $50,000
to shave points on a game?

902
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:50,061
$50,000? I'd probably tell him to take it.
I'd take it, depending on the circumstance.

903
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:52,923
And if you knew he took the money,
threw the game...

904
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:55,995
...then found out that the gambler
was really a cop?

905
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:58,360
Then I'd say Dean got trouble on his hands.

906
00:56:58,538 --> 00:57:02,008
And suppose the cop wasn't really
after Dean but after his friend Rich.

907
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,920
And Dean decided to sell him out,
let him go to jail so he could stay free.

908
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:07,200
What would you do?

909
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:11,728
I'd have to be a 100 percent sure before
I even thought about doing anything.

910
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:13,600
-You can be.
-Is that right?

911
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:15,351
That's right.

912
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,717
-So what would you do?
-Might have to do something to his girl.

913
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:23,288
-Like what?
-Depends. Whatever turns her on.

914
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,195
Whatever excites her.

915
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,308
And what about Dean?
What would you do to Dean?

916
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:31,935
Don't worry about Dean.

917
00:58:06,056 --> 00:58:07,808
Take a break, Raoul.

918
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:11,634
We'll go get some pasta.
I'll take you to a sports bar.

919
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:15,368
I wanna go there. I've never been there.
'Cause I need to go there.

920
00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:16,721
Get a nice bite.

921
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,495
The only thing I got to do
is go home and see my wife...

922
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:23,333
...and get a morning run.
Take my kids to school...

923
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:27,690
-...and come back and go to the gym.
-Then we'll go next week.

924
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:29,904
The guy be here, Chucky.

925
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,424
What's up, my man?

926
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:37,065
This is Cigar. My friend Chuck.

927
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,698
That was some crazy shit last night.
That weird-ass white motherfucker.

928
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:46,525
-Just came to get some wisdom from you.
-Really. Tell me about wisdom.

929
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:51,271
I've made too many mistakes
to be a man known for his wisdom.

930
00:58:51,555 --> 00:58:54,547
Except you can't make
the same mistakes twice.

931
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:56,980
I've made quite a few.

932
00:58:57,269 --> 00:59:00,625
Not the same, but I always get
the same consequences: pain.

933
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,929
All this shit boils down to pain.

934
00:59:03,357 --> 00:59:05,188
You know that cat Dean?

935
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:10,232
He got arrested for some bullshit
and he's trying to stagnate my process.

936
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:14,978
Where I came from,
as to where the fuck I'm going.

937
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,966
Age-old story, brother. Deceit, treachery.

938
00:59:19,372 --> 00:59:21,840
The dude is in a squeeze.

939
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:26,286
He's gonna fuck me,
he's gonna get me rocked...

940
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:28,619
...so he can save himself, basically.

941
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:33,218
He's gonna try to....
It's police business and all that shit.

942
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,003
So, this is what you're telling me.

943
00:59:36,178 --> 00:59:39,295
This is what I'm deciphering
from your vernacular.

944
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,933
You fucked with a nigger...

945
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:45,718
...he got in trouble and he told on you.

946
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:48,512
There are two possibilities.

947
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:50,964
I could kill the motherfucker
or not kill him.

948
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:55,620
If I don't kill him, I'm going to jail.
What's your suggestion?

949
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:59,339
You got a problem with somebody,
you got to solve it, take care of it.

950
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:03,495
You're angry. You're angry about people
that you feel have betrayed you.

951
01:00:04,245 --> 01:00:08,124
If you're not willing to be nice to somebody
constantly, you should kill them.

952
01:00:08,373 --> 01:00:11,809
If you're not nice to them, and you
have them around and empower them...

953
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:13,795
...they'll kill you or hurt you.

954
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,794
So, you're telling me I should murder him.

955
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:20,301
No, my friend, I said nothing of the sort.

956
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:24,066
I'm too fastidious with my words.
I choose them very carefully.

957
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:28,092
What I said is you have a problem.
Deal with the repercussions of it.

958
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:31,307
Would you deal with the responsibility
of going to prison?

959
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,035
I've been there. You don't want to go.
Random strip searches, kicks in the ass...

960
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:38,384
...having dogs look up your ass.

961
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:42,480
Having a pervert guard playing
with your asshole and your balls.

962
01:00:42,696 --> 01:00:44,015
Is that what you want?

963
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:46,305
-You're fucking with words.
-I'm not playing.

964
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:49,004
You're very articulate and all this bullshit.

965
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:50,395
Oh, my God.

966
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:52,966
We're from the same
motherfucking part of town.

967
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:57,167
I don't even understand
whatever the fuck it was you just said.

968
01:00:57,959 --> 01:00:59,790
In other words...

969
01:01:01,837 --> 01:01:03,634
...a bug needs to be stomped on.

970
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:07,422
But listen, I love you as a brother,
always will love you.

971
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:11,445
I like Dean, too,
but your guy chose this life.

972
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:14,474
Deal with that problem.
You should call me with the scores.

973
01:01:14,682 --> 01:01:17,913
I got a fucking headache,
you're talking some fucking scores.

974
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:20,543
I'm out of here.

975
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:22,405
Gotta go, gotta go.

976
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:28,392
See you tomorrow night, Mike.

977
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,765
Chucky-Chuck. What up, Chuck?

978
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:40,022
Mr. Roberto, talk to me.

979
01:01:41,956 --> 01:01:44,948
There was some trouble
the other night in the club.

980
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:49,400
-Motherfucking right, there was trouble.
-First of all, this is Scotty, and that's Frank.

981
01:01:50,214 --> 01:01:52,774
-Tell me what happened.
-I'll tell you what happened.

982
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:55,116
I wanna hear this. He tried to take half.

983
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:59,853
Clubs opening in the neighbourhood
where I've lived all these years of my life.

984
01:02:00,472 --> 01:02:03,748
A 20-block radius
that me and my crew rule.

985
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:07,855
We're gonna work something out.
I got something else we'll deal with later.

986
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:10,460
As for this, it's solved.
We'll take care of it.

987
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:13,644
Shake hands with my nephew.
Come on, shake hands.

988
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,793
Shake hands!

989
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:20,545
All right, no more problems, no more.

990
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,733
There will be no more problems.
We'll work out what we gotta do.

991
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,952
All right, guys, I'll see you at the opening.

992
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:34,974
Next time you go to him first
and work with him.

993
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:38,841
You make me sound like an asshole.
This guy comes in here and calls me soft.

994
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,763
I do business with him. He's a good guy.

995
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:45,802
You shut the fuck up!
Just shut up, let him talk.

996
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:24,864
Excuse me, are you lnspector Deck?
Nice to meet you. I'm Sam Doneger.

997
01:03:25,424 --> 01:03:28,063
I'm a really big fan.
This is my husband, Terry Doneger.

998
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:30,932
Would you do me a favour
and introduce me to your friends?

999
01:03:31,137 --> 01:03:34,846
-I'm going over there anyway.
-Would you mind? I'd really appreciate it.

1000
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:37,791
Hi. I'm Sam.

1001
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:42,726
Nice to meet you.

1002
01:03:42,898 --> 01:03:46,368
We were talking about
how your music influences kids today.

1003
01:03:46,609 --> 01:03:48,167
-What's your name?
-Sticks.

1004
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,674
-Why Sticks?
-It's what I do every night.

1005
01:03:51,196 --> 01:03:52,595
"Sticks." What's it mean?

1006
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:55,776
It means don't let me catch you
on a late night walking around.

1007
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,656
What's going on? You all right?

1008
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:07,754
-How do you like the club? Looks good?
-It's nice.

1009
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:12,421
-Rich, how are you?
-I could use that favour right about now.

1010
01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:16,633
-You got it. What is it? No problem.
-There's a dude and I need to get him hit.

1011
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,116
I want one of your boys to take care of it.

1012
01:04:19,304 --> 01:04:21,977
-Tonight?
-Tonight. Right now.

1013
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:24,458
It's opening night.
You want me to kill a guy?

1014
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:27,316
Let the place warm up a few weeks.
Give me a break.

1015
01:04:28,813 --> 01:04:32,522
Listen, the guy will be here in two days.
It can't wait two days?

1016
01:04:32,775 --> 01:04:34,094
I ain't got two days.

1017
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:36,590
You want me
to go kill the guy myself tonight?

1018
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:38,177
I'll deal with it.

1019
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:44,460
-Do you feel exploited by it?
-It's just bullshit.

1020
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:47,858
Tell me why. What's bullshit about it?
What's a crock about it?

1021
01:04:48,497 --> 01:04:52,570
It's like the big-ass-tourist bus
that be riding through Harlem...

1022
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:56,156
...looking at us like we're on display here.

1023
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:59,618
So you're saying you cannot know it
unless you live it.

1024
01:05:00,884 --> 01:05:04,763
Shit is kinda proper.
Gentlemen, what's the word?

1025
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:12,621
I just can't comprehend it.
It's just too much.

1026
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:16,084
-It's like a tumour in my brain.
-That's true.

1027
01:05:17,064 --> 01:05:18,179
Help.

1028
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:20,803
I'm sorry. I'm so scared.

1029
01:05:21,235 --> 01:05:23,908
I'm just trying to have fun, too.
I thought we share!

1030
01:05:24,113 --> 01:05:26,069
We do. We share.

1031
01:05:26,698 --> 01:05:28,848
Let me hit that.

1032
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,629
-What is that you're wearing?
-This?

1033
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,647
The cologne.

1034
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:40,499
It's Aramis.
You remember Aramis, don't you?

1035
01:05:40,752 --> 01:05:43,266
-That's the same that I wear.
-Come on.

1036
01:05:43,463 --> 01:05:45,294
-I swear to God.
-You're shitting me.

1037
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:48,938
Oh, my God. Is that just nuts?

1038
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:52,474
She's gone. Who cares?

1039
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,591
She was pretty smart. What's your name?

1040
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:58,837
-Terry Doneger. What's your name?
-Casey. It's nice to meet you.

1041
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:00,330
It's my pleasure.

1042
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,322
Where you been?
I've been looking for your little ass.

1043
01:06:03,523 --> 01:06:05,912
-What's going on?
-Watch the do.

1044
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:08,861
Come on, your do's fucked up anyway.
Stop this bullshit.

1045
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:11,234
What do you think of the gig?

1046
01:06:11,488 --> 01:06:14,400
This shit is right.
What's up with you though?

1047
01:06:14,616 --> 01:06:16,971
-Chilling, feeling the vibe.
-You feeling it?

1048
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:21,213
Hi everybody, how are you?
How you doing, baby?

1049
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:24,742
Mom, nice coat.

1050
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,357
You borrowed my coat?

1051
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:29,860
It's my coat, not yours, baby.

1052
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:31,637
I'm Sam Doneger.

1053
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,627
I'm doing a documentary on your
daughter and all of her friends.

1054
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:39,104
It's about how we're into hip-hop and shit.

1055
01:06:39,304 --> 01:06:42,296
I got some serious shit
I need to really get at you.

1056
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:45,747
I'm the one. What do you need?

1057
01:06:45,976 --> 01:06:49,207
You the one? You don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

1058
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,714
You got all the boys,
but I take care of the serious shit.

1059
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,172
-You live like that?
-I'm live like that.

1060
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,069
-Your balls look kind of small to me.
-'Cause these pants is big.

1061
01:07:01,282 --> 01:07:05,036
-I need you to do something for me.
-I'm the one. What you need to do?

1062
01:07:05,828 --> 01:07:07,147
You sure you up to it?

1063
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:11,083
Depends. But most of the time
I can deal with what you need me to do.

1064
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,972
Depends on what?
What do you mean "most of the time"?

1065
01:07:14,168 --> 01:07:18,127
-Either you're with it or you ain't.
-I'm with it. You need me to do what?

1066
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:20,337
You up to do a murder?

1067
01:07:22,134 --> 01:07:24,364
This is a club. What're you talking about?

1068
01:07:24,553 --> 01:07:27,590
Don't give me this "club" shit.
I don't give a fuck about that.

1069
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:29,375
You up for it?

1070
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,312
Who do you need to get murdered?

1071
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:33,342
Dean.

1072
01:07:34,854 --> 01:07:38,893
I don't know about that.
What the fuck, Dean--

1073
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:41,947
What you mean you don't know?
You said you were with it.

1074
01:07:42,902 --> 01:07:46,736
I am with it. But what the fuck?
Dean is like your boy, he's like my boy.

1075
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:51,585
-What the fuck's up with Dean?
-What he did to me? ls that important?

1076
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:54,429
-So you wanna do this right away?
-What do you think?

1077
01:07:54,622 --> 01:07:57,614
I need you to do it right away.
I need you to do it now!

1078
01:07:57,832 --> 01:08:01,029
It's done. I'll do it.
I'll do it for you, no problem.

1079
01:08:01,252 --> 01:08:03,925
-You gonna do it?
-Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

1080
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:07,136
I said I would.

1081
01:08:14,972 --> 01:08:18,282
-Remember me?
-What's up, baby? How you doing?

1082
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:20,429
-What is going on?
-What you mean?

1083
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:22,991
-What is going on?
-What you talking about?

1084
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:26,943
Don't act like you don't know.
You've walked around the club four times...

1085
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:31,184
...having little conversations with people.
What is this? Look me in the eye.

1086
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:35,040
What the fuck is going on?
You're full of shit. I can tell.

1087
01:08:48,419 --> 01:08:51,855
Fucking silencer.
What the fuck am I doing?

1088
01:08:56,718 --> 01:08:59,027
That's what the fuck I really ought to do.

1089
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,122
-Yeah.
-You ready?

1090
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,996
-Ready?
-Ready to roll. Your time's up, pal.

1091
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,665
There's a lot ofstuff about Rich
I don't even know.

1092
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,254
You got enough on him
just like I got enough on you.

1093
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,760
-Where you gonna be at 8:00?
-The gym.

1094
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:30,389
-I'll be waiting outside.
-I'm gonna make a lot of enemies.

1095
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,902
My heart's breaking for you, Dean.

1096
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:48,882
Go on, I'm not playing.

1097
01:09:49,473 --> 01:09:52,545
-You ain't playing? You finished?
-I'm finished for the day.

1098
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:17,268
Just stay right there. Don't move.

1099
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:18,912
Relax.

1100
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:22,041
Just fucking stay right there!
You know what you did.

1101
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:24,672
You don't understand.

1102
01:10:25,004 --> 01:10:27,518
Don't try to fuck with my head.
You stay there.

1103
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:30,389
-Let me and him talk about it.
-Rich don't wanna talk.

1104
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:34,347
You're going to shoot me? Relax man.

1105
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:37,236
Don't let him get in your head.

1106
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:39,943
Don't you try to fuck with my head.
Stay there.

1107
01:10:40,143 --> 01:10:43,260
-Don't you take another step.
-Me and you will talk about it.

1108
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,040
I swear to God,
don't take another fucking step.

1109
01:10:46,315 --> 01:10:47,794
Don't let him do this.

1110
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:50,417
Fuck you. Just stay back.

1111
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:53,136
-Just relax.
-Fuck you.

1112
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:25,973
Attention, units. We got a report
of a homicide at a basketball court: 1-8-7.

1113
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:28,990
All units in the vicinity, please respond.

1114
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:33,419
Again, we've got a report of a homicide,
City Rider basketball court.

1115
01:11:33,775 --> 01:11:36,972
1-8-7: possible homicide. Please respond.

1116
01:12:43,336 --> 01:12:46,214
Hi. What's so urgent?

1117
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:51,606
-What's so urgent?
-Remember? That's the word you used.

1118
01:12:52,219 --> 01:12:53,618
Yeah. Hi.

1119
01:12:56,056 --> 01:12:57,125
Yeah?

1120
01:12:57,849 --> 01:12:59,760
You wanna start out like that?

1121
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:02,816
Wait a minute. What is this?

1122
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:06,876
This is our....

1123
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,119
Doesn't this place bring back any....

1124
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,121
Doesn't it conjure up any....

1125
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,200
No. What is this about, Luke?

1126
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,763
-That guy.
-What guy?

1127
01:13:24,956 --> 01:13:27,106
That guy, what's his name...

1128
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:29,309
...the basketball player.

1129
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,009
-His name's Dean.
-Right, it was. Dean.

1130
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:37,554
What do you mean "was"?

1131
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:42,164
He's dead.

1132
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:46,587
You didn't know that?
You didn't hear it on the news?

1133
01:13:46,809 --> 01:13:47,844
No.

1134
01:13:52,272 --> 01:13:56,390
You know what fascinates me?
It's very interesting to me.

1135
01:13:56,651 --> 01:14:00,644
There's this guy. This weak,
greedy, fucking corrupt asshole...

1136
01:14:00,905 --> 01:14:03,135
...that you fall for, that you leave me for.

1137
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:06,126
You get all crazy about him.
Then I tell you he's dead...

1138
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:10,878
...and you have less of a reaction than
if I told you a squirrel was hit by a van.

1139
01:14:12,124 --> 01:14:14,592
-You know about this?
-No, I don't.

1140
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:17,511
Don't lie,
'cause I can tell when you're lying.

1141
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:19,528
How was he killed?

1142
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:22,140
-I didn't say he was killed.
-Yeah, you did.

1143
01:14:22,341 --> 01:14:24,411
I said he was dead.
I never said he was killed.

1144
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,265
It's the way you were saying it.

1145
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:29,100
You're lying to me.
You know about this, don't you?

1146
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,547
I never said he was killed.
I said he was dead.

1147
01:14:31,724 --> 01:14:34,238
-Did you have something to do with it?
-No. Did you?

1148
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:37,188
No. I can't believe we're having
this conversation.

1149
01:14:37,854 --> 01:14:40,414
I wish we could get together
and talk about us.

1150
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:42,006
How was he killed?

1151
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:45,843
He was shot in front of his locker.
'cause he was a weak, greedy...

1152
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,903
...bribe-taking motherfucker. That's why.

1153
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:52,668
-How would you know that?
-How would I know that?

1154
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:57,273
There's stuff I know that you don't know.

1155
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:59,135
-What's your name?
-What?

1156
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,884
After you became a detective,
did you change your name?

1157
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:03,639
-Yeah.
-To what name?

1158
01:15:05,295 --> 01:15:07,570
-To what name?
-Mark Clear.

1159
01:15:15,054 --> 01:15:17,284
-You fucking Rich Bower?
-Fuck you!

1160
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:19,703
-You're fucking Bower, right?
-Fuck you!

1161
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:22,531
Let me get this straight. Dean told you...

1162
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,322
...then you told Rich 'cause it turned
you off that Dean would be so weak...

1163
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:30,035
...to actually open up to you.
Like when I left, you considered it weak...

1164
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:32,472
...that I'd do something to change my life.

1165
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,406
To actually turn my life around.
That's weak!

1166
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,867
You're so fucking twisted.

1167
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,389
Don't you get it?
God! You haven't changed.

1168
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,510
You're the same guy,
except now you're hiding behind a badge.

1169
01:15:48,584 --> 01:15:50,779
So when are you gonna come back to me?

1170
01:15:54,256 --> 01:15:56,770
Why is that so crazy?

1171
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,755
In local news, the killer of City Rider
Dean Carter is still at large.

1172
01:16:29,996 --> 01:16:32,635
Police continue to investigate
this tragic shooting.

1173
01:16:32,915 --> 01:16:35,065
Carter was found dead
outside his locker room...

1174
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,763
...a gunshot wound to the chest.

1175
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:40,753
If you have any information,
please call our crime watch hotline.

1176
01:16:41,131 --> 01:16:44,567
555-1234.

1177
01:16:45,009 --> 01:16:46,761
And now, for the weather.

1178
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:50,397
Once again, it will be mild tonight
with temperatures in the 50s.

1179
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,257
Did you know I got locked up in Memphis?

1180
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,832
-What the fuck were you doing?
-Being black.

1181
01:16:58,062 --> 01:16:59,177
You're right.

1182
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,829
In the South, you've gotta figure
what time it is and where you're at.

1183
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:05,827
I was in the middle of the street
signing autographs.

1184
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:09,338
Nigger pulled up, pulls me over to the side.

1185
01:17:10,074 --> 01:17:12,827
Came back and just maced me
over the top.

1186
01:17:13,326 --> 01:17:15,681
Maced me right in my eyes.

1187
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:17,743
Shit was burning, face on fire.

1188
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:22,335
And they locked me up after that.
It was bad though.

1189
01:17:22,585 --> 01:17:24,735
You got up out of that shit.

1190
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:28,329
Then I served my night,
went to see the judge.

1191
01:17:28,548 --> 01:17:29,981
A night for what?

1192
01:17:30,174 --> 01:17:34,053
A night for obstruction of traffic
and motherfucking resisting arrest.

1193
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:40,100
It was bad,
but they did it because I was black.

1194
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:42,459
That's where Martin Luther King got killed.

1195
01:17:49,484 --> 01:17:51,634
Loving you, biting the ear and shit.

1196
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:53,093
My nigga.

1197
01:17:53,862 --> 01:17:55,261
Look what you did.

1198
01:17:55,406 --> 01:17:58,796
My niggas burning each other up,
dropping shit on my rug.

1199
01:17:59,992 --> 01:18:02,711
Damn, man! Come on, man!

1200
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,790
I'm lucky you all know I got cash pool.

1201
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,640
You got these cats disrespecting your crib.

1202
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,515
It ain't no disrespect, it was an accident.
You know how I play the game.

1203
01:18:16,215 --> 01:18:19,525
I don't know about that thing
we discussed at the gym.

1204
01:18:19,802 --> 01:18:21,679
When you moved on this kid, what's up?

1205
01:18:21,887 --> 01:18:24,355
Did you take care of it
on your own or what?

1206
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:26,907
-I hired somebody to do the shit.
-Hired who?

1207
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:30,372
A brother member, a family member?

1208
01:18:30,562 --> 01:18:32,757
Not your brother or my brother.

1209
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:36,021
That's a bad move.
You're playing dirty pool.

1210
01:18:36,484 --> 01:18:37,963
What are you talking about?

1211
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:41,826
You can't send no child to do a man's job.
You have to handle it on your own.

1212
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:44,794
As soon as he needs a fix or something,
you're burned.

1213
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:48,263
You don't know nothing about him,
what his weakness is.

1214
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:51,489
I'm just trying to save your ass.
You got somebody to do it--

1215
01:18:51,706 --> 01:18:55,824
Save my ass? Come on, man.
I was taking your advice.

1216
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:58,200
But you wasn't man enough
to do it yourself.

1217
01:18:58,378 --> 01:19:00,653
You gotta be a man.
When you make moves--

1218
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,474
You're assassinating my character.

1219
01:19:03,675 --> 01:19:06,473
Assassinating your character?
Your manhood?

1220
01:19:06,677 --> 01:19:09,510
-You got some kid you don't know, l--
-I know him!

1221
01:19:09,888 --> 01:19:12,925
-Hi. Is this District Attorney King?
-Yes, it is.

1222
01:19:13,684 --> 01:19:16,437
I'm Mark Clear.
I'm a detective with the NYPD, sir.

1223
01:19:16,644 --> 01:19:20,353
I have a bit of information
about your son Will...

1224
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:22,968
...that I'd like to meet you about.

1225
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:26,179
What information are we talking about?

1226
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:30,479
It's very important.
I think I should meet you in person.

1227
01:19:30,991 --> 01:19:34,142
I'm free from 2:00 to 2:30
tomorrow afternoon.

1228
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:38,520
No, tomorrow isn't good.
I'd say in an hour would be best.

1229
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:40,427
Right away would be really good.

1230
01:19:40,582 --> 01:19:43,654
You should drop everything
you're doing right now and meet me.

1231
01:19:43,877 --> 01:19:45,469
If you know what I mean.

1232
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,655
So where's your friend Charlie?

1233
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:52,088
She don't want none of this dick today?

1234
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:53,612
She's angry at you.

1235
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:55,558
What the fuck she angry about?

1236
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:59,350
-Because of the other night.
-What happened the other night?

1237
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:02,022
You disrespected her.

1238
01:20:03,227 --> 01:20:05,422
She got what her hand called for.

1239
01:20:06,147 --> 01:20:09,696
Anyway, you think
I can't satisfy you by myself?.

1240
01:20:09,942 --> 01:20:12,661
-I don't know.
-Why don't you let me show you?

1241
01:20:12,861 --> 01:20:16,376
You can show me. But I still think
of you and Charlie as a team.

1242
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,360
Oh, shit.

1243
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:51,338
Mr. King?

1244
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:55,933
-Hi, I'm Mark Clear. How you doing?
-Can I see some...

1245
01:20:57,025 --> 01:20:58,902
...identification?

1246
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:06,215
I'm a detective with the 15th Precinct.

1247
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:10,905
I have some photographs to show you.

1248
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,803
You heard about the murder
of that basketball player, Dean, from City?

1249
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:19,671
Yes, I've heard of it. I'll be prosecuting
the case as soon as we catch the killer.

1250
01:21:20,337 --> 01:21:22,771
-Can I see the photographs?
-Yeah.

1251
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:37,311
Those were taken about two minutes
after your son shot and killed the victim.

1252
01:21:38,854 --> 01:21:40,890
I don't want to arrest your son.

1253
01:21:41,106 --> 01:21:43,939
Does anyone else know
about these photographs?

1254
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,307
Nobody.

1255
01:21:45,444 --> 01:21:47,674
-What do you want?
-Redemption.

1256
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:52,060
-I'm a D.A., I'm not a priest.
-That's why you can help me.

1257
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:55,878
A priest can't help me here.
Let me tell you something about myself.

1258
01:21:56,537 --> 01:22:00,166
My dad is a lawyer.
He's a very liberal lawyer.

1259
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,771
My mom was involved in voter registration
in the South in the '60s.

1260
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:06,561
She put her life on the line
for causes she believed in.

1261
01:22:06,753 --> 01:22:09,506
I went a different way
and became a gambler and a cheat...

1262
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:12,024
...l stole, basically, did everything wrong.

1263
01:22:12,217 --> 01:22:15,892
I was rebelling against what they were.
I don't know whatever the hell it was.

1264
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:20,577
I also was very creative as a kid.
I actually made guitars.

1265
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:22,969
I made my own clothes.
I'm good with my hands.

1266
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:25,498
I can talk my way in and out
of a lot of situations.

1267
01:22:25,687 --> 01:22:29,760
It's gotten me into trouble a lot in my life.
It's also done incredibly well for me.

1268
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,521
Have you ever heard of...

1269
01:22:35,572 --> 01:22:38,484
...Saul of Tarsus?
Do you know who that was in the Bible?

1270
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:40,621
He became St. Paul the Apostle.

1271
01:22:40,784 --> 01:22:43,252
He was an epileptic
who had this conversion.

1272
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:46,331
He decided not to persecute Christians
but to become one.

1273
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:50,930
The most zealous Christian ever.
Six years ago, I had a big change in my life.

1274
01:22:52,753 --> 01:22:54,345
I decided to become a cop.

1275
01:22:55,047 --> 01:22:59,086
I had this girlfriend who was just
not even a fucking girlfriend.

1276
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:01,697
She was more like the only woman
I ever loved.

1277
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:05,128
She was just really fucking with my head.

1278
01:23:05,431 --> 01:23:07,899
I think she got off on the fact
that I was a criminal.

1279
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,456
And when I had a change in my life,
when I decided to do something...

1280
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,804
...to persecute these fuckers....
When I became who I am now...

1281
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:18,095
...she couldn't deal with it, she left.
She left and she--

1282
01:23:18,484 --> 01:23:21,954
-What do you want from me?
-I'm trying to explain what I want.

1283
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:24,585
I'm leaving in one minute.
What do you want?

1284
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:28,330
I want to explain to you.
Before I became a cop, I was a gambler...

1285
01:23:28,577 --> 01:23:31,171
...l got involved
in some very bad situations.

1286
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,759
There's one situation
that I got involved with...

1287
01:23:33,956 --> 01:23:36,516
...that's coming back now,
it'll come across your desk.

1288
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:39,859
This guy named Jimmy Fordo.
There's a basketball fix.

1289
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:41,281
I know the case.

1290
01:23:41,629 --> 01:23:45,781
I think I understand
where you're leading this.

1291
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:51,049
Do you? 'Cause there's a really
simple solution to this problem here.

1292
01:23:51,472 --> 01:23:54,748
I can help your son out, you can
help me out, we can help each other.

1293
01:23:54,975 --> 01:23:56,408
I don't know.

1294
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:58,376
What you don't...

1295
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,988
...know about my son and me is that...

1296
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:07,228
...we're not close.

1297
01:24:10,196 --> 01:24:11,345
Will and l...

1298
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:15,335
...we haven't seen each other
for two years.

1299
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:19,505
I don't know if I wanna help Will...

1300
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:23,178
...and I know I don't want to help you.

1301
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:27,979
But I will have to speak with my son
and I'll need some time.

1302
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,603
All right. Okay.

1303
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:37,779
I don't wanna tell you
how you wanna live your life...

1304
01:24:38,055 --> 01:24:40,410
...but I think you should help your son.

1305
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:42,836
I think I can help you help your son.

1306
01:24:48,356 --> 01:24:49,789
What do you want?

1307
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:53,171
What's going on?

1308
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,374
What's up with you?
Why you out here like this?

1309
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:59,423
I don't want those hands on me right now.

1310
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:02,892
I don't know where they've been.
What's up with you and white girls?

1311
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:06,111
-Me and white girls?
-You said you'd never go there.

1312
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:09,720
You're acting like it's my girl or something.
What're you talking about?

1313
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:14,429
I just had to walk in and see a white girl,
with hair down to her ass, blue eyes...

1314
01:25:14,713 --> 01:25:17,671
...with granny underwear
on with fucking flowers on them.

1315
01:25:17,882 --> 01:25:21,272
We ain't married or nothing.
I don't see no ring on your finger or mine.

1316
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:24,422
I'm just trying to give you a reality check...

1317
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,990
...on how you're living right now.
It's foul and disgusting.

1318
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:30,950
Won't you come over here
and make my house a home?

1319
01:25:31,144 --> 01:25:33,374
I shouldn't have
to make your house a home.

1320
01:25:33,604 --> 01:25:37,882
-I told you how I felt a long time ago.
-You're used goods. I don't want you.

1321
01:25:39,693 --> 01:25:44,483
You know what you need? You need
to go inside and do some searching.

1322
01:25:45,114 --> 01:25:47,947
Figure out who the fuck you are
before it's too late.

1323
01:25:54,498 --> 01:25:56,693
Can you pop the trunk, please?

1324
01:25:57,751 --> 01:25:59,070
Thank you.

1325
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:11,266
See you in a week. We're off to the South.

1326
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:13,454
-Honey.
-What?

1327
01:26:13,806 --> 01:26:15,683
Come on. What's the matter?

1328
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:19,698
-Please.
-I'm not sure.

1329
01:26:19,895 --> 01:26:21,533
I'm not sure that I'm going now.

1330
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:25,523
-Don't do this again. Every time we fly....
-Just go solo.

1331
01:26:25,818 --> 01:26:28,252
Solo? What's the matter with you?
Get in the car!

1332
01:26:28,445 --> 01:26:30,595
-I'm not going.
-You are going. Stop it!

1333
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:34,568
I am tired of living this lie. Every time
we got down there we pretend--

1334
01:26:34,825 --> 01:26:38,135
Stop it. Get in the car.
Just get in the car, okay?

1335
01:26:41,539 --> 01:26:44,815
I'm a come guzzler. Mike nailed it!

1336
01:26:45,085 --> 01:26:47,474
-Stop it! Okay?
-I don't wanna pretend anymore.

1337
01:26:48,546 --> 01:26:49,979
Richard, I'm gay!

1338
01:26:50,131 --> 01:26:52,884
-Richard does not care.
-Richard's known.

1339
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,848
What do I do?
She's out of town with boys in here.

1340
01:26:56,053 --> 01:26:57,930
Am I a fag or what?

1341
01:26:58,096 --> 01:27:01,327
Stop it, please! So what? You're a fag.
Who the fuck cares?

1342
01:27:01,641 --> 01:27:04,235
Everyone knows but you.
You won't even admit it.

1343
01:27:04,476 --> 01:27:06,671
I do admit it. I admit everything.

1344
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,891
I'm fine with it.
I am so fine with it. Stop it!

1345
01:27:10,148 --> 01:27:13,220
You're staying here. Get a life, get a man!

1346
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:16,079
You were so into Mike the other night.

1347
01:27:16,571 --> 01:27:20,769
You want a big black man,
not a little, stingy queen.

1348
01:27:21,826 --> 01:27:24,704
I was doing it for you,
trying to save him from hurting you.

1349
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:26,989
You're the one that was
so excited about it.

1350
01:27:27,163 --> 01:27:29,472
You're in denial. I'm taking your bags out.

1351
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:32,226
Can you pop the trunk again real quick?

1352
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:36,757
It's like The Day of the Dolphin, right?
Where you say you don't love me.

1353
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:39,519
Pa says he doesn't love the dolphins
because it's safe.

1354
01:27:39,717 --> 01:27:41,912
Pa loves cock. Sorry.

1355
01:27:54,688 --> 01:27:57,248
I don't get it. I just don't fucking get it.

1356
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:06,457
Just go! Go! Keep fucking going!

1357
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,430
He'll come back.

1358
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,061
I really feel spooked about that kid, Will.

1359
01:28:22,254 --> 01:28:25,246
I think he's gonna be a threat
to us down the line.

1360
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:32,662
Pop?

1361
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:42,803
Billy.

1362
01:28:45,483 --> 01:28:46,518
Sit down.

1363
01:28:54,116 --> 01:28:57,392
Number one,
the motherfucking nigga pops is the D.A.

1364
01:28:57,619 --> 01:29:00,770
Forget about it. We gotta get away
from that kind of thinking.

1365
01:29:00,997 --> 01:29:04,512
All that shit is in the past.
The only hits we're doing is on wax.

1366
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:07,959
We ain't killing nobody no more,
you all understand?

1367
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:10,805
A police officer...

1368
01:29:12,299 --> 01:29:14,255
...took these photographs.

1369
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,478
He doesn't want you.

1370
01:29:19,764 --> 01:29:23,803
What he wants is,
he has a case coming before me...

1371
01:29:25,353 --> 01:29:27,150
...where he's indictable.

1372
01:29:30,148 --> 01:29:32,184
He wants me to throw the case out.

1373
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,312
You know that white kid
wasn't right for that shit.

1374
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:37,887
You know that.

1375
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:44,610
There's no way I'm letting you go to jail.
We're going to have a new beginning.

1376
01:29:45,828 --> 01:29:48,501
We can't do this shit. We're not doing it.

1377
01:29:49,665 --> 01:29:52,896
Let me take the stance for all of that.

1378
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:24,455
'Cause he acting like
we don't know what time it is.

1379
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:28,204
I don't see you working it, nigga,
for what you need to work 'em for.

1380
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:30,698
A Detective Mark Clear.

1381
01:30:33,163 --> 01:30:36,200
This is Detective Mark Clear.
Now listen to me very carefully.

1382
01:30:36,457 --> 01:30:39,733
I know what you did.
I know everything that you did.

1383
01:30:40,586 --> 01:30:44,374
-I don't know what you're talking about--
-Shut up and listen, asshole.

1384
01:30:44,631 --> 01:30:46,986
You may think
you got away with what you did...

1385
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,769
...and think, "My life is free now. "
Right? It isn't.

1386
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:52,847
Sometimes people get second chances.
I got a second chance.

1387
01:30:53,055 --> 01:30:55,615
I'm Saul of Tarsus. I'm not gonna blow it.

1388
01:30:55,808 --> 01:30:58,720
You're gonna blow it.
Maybe not right away, but you will.

1389
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:02,166
And when you do,
I'm gonna be right there to nail your ass.

1390
01:31:02,397 --> 01:31:05,867
I'm gonna annihilate you, asshole.
You're going the fuck down.

1391
01:32:28,306 --> 01:32:29,898
I am so fucked up.

1392
01:32:47,824 --> 01:32:52,739
In the Palaeolithic Era, people believed
that the female body was sacred...

1393
01:32:53,204 --> 01:32:55,434
...because it was creating a life on its own.

1394
01:32:55,622 --> 01:32:58,341
They didn't make a connection
between the sexual act...

1395
01:32:58,584 --> 01:33:00,859
...and a child being born nine months later.

1396
01:33:01,044 --> 01:33:05,674
So, for thousands of years people
considered that men were unnecessary.

1397
01:33:05,965 --> 01:33:08,160
Yes, okay, I know that's right.

1398
01:33:08,342 --> 01:33:10,139
They were decoration.

1399
01:33:11,637 --> 01:33:13,673
And women were everything.

1400
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:17,024
They still are, baby, they still are.

1401
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:30,654
I told everybody that your hair
and make-up look great.

1402
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:54,016
Now there ain't no boundary.
We're all in it together.

1403
01:33:54,216 --> 01:33:56,411
Black people, white people, Asians.

1404
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:59,513
You know what I'm saying?
lndians, whoever.

1405
01:34:00,722 --> 01:34:02,838
You look on TV and see Japanese cats...

1406
01:34:03,016 --> 01:34:05,610
...hopping around, doing hip-hop,
singing your record.

1407
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:09,358
There's a Japanese Cigar out there.
You ever thought of that?

1408
01:34:09,605 --> 01:34:12,995
I don't think a lot of people really
wanted this shit to exist like that.

1409
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,030
And they have no control over it.

1410
01:34:15,193 --> 01:34:18,868
Nobody can manage hip-hop.
Hip-hop is just fucking hip-hop.

1411
01:34:19,113 --> 01:34:21,343
You got your morals
and your common sense.

1412
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:24,049
You gotta bring out
the true talent in yourself.

1413
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:27,474
It's all about getting up. Don't be afraid.
