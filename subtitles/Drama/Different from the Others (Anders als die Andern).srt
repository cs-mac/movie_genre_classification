1
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,478
The kingdom, Niklaus, the kingdom.

2
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:54,070
You must defend the kingdom.

3
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,002
These pieces, these soldiers,

4
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,374
they're your only defense of the kingdom.

5
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,661
The kingdom.

6
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:47,879
The kingdom.

7
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:14,055
Welcome, Jane.
It's good to be here.

8
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,951
Well, this time around.

9
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,389
I completely understand,
Jane, and it's good to see you too.

10
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,741
Amy is very excited
to be going home.

11
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,310
So, tell me, are you still
at the same address?

12
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:28,485
I am.

13
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:32,291
And that's the same address where...

14
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,598
Well, we're not going
straight home, Doctor.

15
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,077
We're actually visiting relatives

16
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,365
at a really nice bed-and-breakfast,
Anders Manor.

17
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,062
I thought...

18
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,196
neutral territory,
familiar faces, her cousins.

19
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,460
She was really close with
them when she was little.

20
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,810
Jane...

21
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,335
I'm worried about her
flashing back to the...

22
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:53,989
accident.

23
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,687
Well, we're going.

24
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,251
What is this, Father?

25
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:43,971
This... it's a game, Niklaus.

26
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,301
Like checkers?

27
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,870
No, checkers
is for the simpletons.

28
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,351
For the babies,
like tic-tac-toe.

29
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,199
This, this is chess.

30
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,529
The game of kings.

31
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,535
The game of kings.

32
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,937
So, happy birthday.

33
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,176
Are you excited
to see the family?

34
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,114
A little bit.

35
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,813
I remember
Uncle Ethan was funny.

36
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,470
Aunt Eva was weird, but caring.

37
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:26,995
Trevor was always nice.

38
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,409
I don't know. It seems like
such a long time ago.

39
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,565
Everything's kind of a blur.

40
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,241
I just can't believe you're 18.

41
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:38,678
I can't either.

42
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,681
It's like I woke up with tits all of a sudden
and they let me out of the loony bin for it.

43
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:42,489
Hey.

44
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,055
Well...

45
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:48,993
Are you sure you're ready
for this?

46
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,125
Because you and I can go
to a hotel by ourselves.

47
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,150
I want this.

48
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,763
We both deserve a vacation
at this point.

49
00:06:58,722 --> 00:06:59,636
Well...

50
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,160
let's go have some fun.

51
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,974
Ladies.
A gracious new day to you both.

52
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,715
Come in, come in. Please.
Thank you.

53
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,132
Welcome to Anders Manor.

54
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,158
I am Niklaus Anders.
I am Jane.

55
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:27,055
And this is my daughter, Amy.
Amy, nice to meet you.

56
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:31,122
We're Jane and Amy Hunter. My sister, Eva
Clark, made the reservations for us.

57
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,341
Is she here yet?
She's not here at the moment.

58
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,387
They're on an outing,
but they'll be back

59
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,500
and they've instructed me
to remind you...

60
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,635
Let me take your bags, please.
Thank you.

61
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,071
And let's get you all...

62
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,987
nestled in snugly here.

63
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:46,988
Thank you.

64
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,316
This place is lovely.
How long have you been here?

65
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,211
Sometimes it seems like forever.

66
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,692
This was my father's place.

67
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,956
His father built it by hand
over a hundred years ago...

68
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,394
Am I a king, Father?

69
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,048
Well...

70
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,137
you may be a prince.

71
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,313
And I the king.

72
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:12,337
The king of Anders Manor.

73
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,558
So, we've set aside
a particularly lovely room

74
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:18,759
that I think will be perfectly
suitable to the young lady.

75
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:22,240
It's just down here.
Your first door on the left.

76
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,852
So, if you would.

77
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,724
You know what, I'll take mine as well.
Sure.

78
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,489
Amy.
No.

79
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:56,753
Um... I think someone's
already staying in there.

80
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,192
No, not possible.
It's a room I rarely rent out.

81
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,020
It belonged
to a dear cousin of mine.

82
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,696
Amy, see? There's nobody
in that room, sweetie.

83
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,613
No. No, it's fine. It's fine. There's
nothing in there, right, Mom?

84
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,029
Right. There's nothing in that room.
Nothing there.

85
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,336
Okay. She's fine.

86
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,148
So, your daughter...

87
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,150
She has a mental illness,
I'm afraid.

88
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,674
Well, I am so sorry.
She's such a lovely girl.

89
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,503
She is a very sweet girl.

90
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:35,313
It's just, sometimes she sees
things that aren't actually there.

91
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,466
Well, I can assure you that, for as
long as she's here at the manor,

92
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,971
she'll have all the peace
and tranquility that she needs.

93
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,452
Thank you so much.

94
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,890
That's why we're here, you know,
we just want a fresh start.

95
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:49,589
Well, toward that point,

96
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,635
we will be having additional guests
here this evening, some hunters.

97
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,135
They'll be joining us for dinner
at 4:00 p.m.,

98
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,032
after which, we'll be having
a cotton candy social,

99
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,860
and a bonfire on the grounds.

100
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,274
I think I'll catch up with my
sister tonight, but thank you.

101
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:04,255
As you wish.

102
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,871
Teach me to play, Father.

103
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,615
Well...

104
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,488
This is the king.

105
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,143
The most powerful piece
on the board.

106
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,536
And yet, the weakest,

107
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,103
the most vulnerable.

108
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,848
The outcome of the game
depends on his survival.

109
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,766
Like a father,
he leads and loves.

110
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,247
He loves and leads.

111
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:42,772
And when he dies...

112
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:45,862
that's it.

113
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,647
The game is over.

114
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,718
Jane.

115
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,331
Oh. Christ, Jane,
it's been so long.

116
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,182
I know.

117
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,682
You look great.

118
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,597
Please, I've been driving all day.
You look great, as always.

119
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,580
Hello, Janie. Who doesn't lie
about things of beauty?

120
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,974
You look just like you did
at the wedding.

121
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,846
That was 20 years ago, Ethan.

122
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,283
Hi, guys.
Hi.

123
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:17,764
Let's go catch up.
Okay.

124
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,201
Sweetie, it's time for dinner.

125
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,227
I'll be down in a minute.
Okay.

126
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,629
Oh, happy birthday, Amy.

127
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,588
Thanks.

128
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,765
You remember
your Uncle Ethan, right?

129
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,550
We haven't seen you since you were
ass-high to a grasshopper, but...

130
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,292
you used to play with Trevor
and Blair in the backyard.

131
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,555
I remember.

132
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,209
Well, it's good
to see you again, honey.

133
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,038
Hi, Aunt Eva.

134
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,213
Hi, sweetie.

135
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,912
Hi, Blair. Hi, Trevor.

136
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,829
Hi, Amy. It's nice to see you
again, too, and you look great.

137
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:08,962
Well, it has been awhile.

138
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,772
So, how were things
at the funny farm, coz?

139
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,208
Damn it, Blair, come on.

140
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,514
Highly inappropriate,
young lady.

141
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,866
And Blair, is your ass jealous from all the
shit that just came out of your mouth?

142
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,891
Damn it, Trevor.

143
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,936
You know, Trevor,

144
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:29,983
I really would like to see things
from your point of view, but...

145
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,681
I can't get my head
that far up my own ass.

146
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,945
Wow, your children really have
grown up so much, haven't they?

147
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,055
Blair and Trevor,
I love you both very much,

148
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,732
but if you don't stop,

149
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,822
you won't believe what happens next.

150
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,956
Excuse me, please.

151
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:49,959
I'm not hungry.

152
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,311
Welcome to the fun.

153
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,839
If you'll excuse me.

154
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,952
The huntsmen have arrived!

155
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,849
Gentlemen, welcome, welcome.
Come in, come in, come in.

156
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,131
Welcome to Anders Manor.
Thank you, sir.

157
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,158
I trust that your travels were without
undue difficulty? All good, sir.

158
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,137
You would be Brett, I presume,
and these your compatriots.

159
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,075
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,532
My brother, Darsaw.

161
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,210
Very nice to meet you.
Much obliged, Mr. Anders.

162
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,320
And I cannot thank you enough for
opening up your fine grounds to us,

163
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,714
so we may kill and eat
some indigenous wildlife.

164
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,411
Yes. And this would be?

165
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,698
And Ole.
Ole, pleasure to meet you, sir.

166
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,005
Pleasure, sir. My name's Ole.

167
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,964
Outstanding, Ole.

168
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,096
And may I say,

169
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,859
you have a lovely looking
establishment here.

170
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,971
Well, thank you very much.

171
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,889
Dinner's being served presently.
Put your bags down, please, relax.

172
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,215
The Reverend Thomas
will be joining us presently.

173
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,130
He's on his way.

174
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:57,592
He'll be presiding later this evening
over a cotton candy social and bonfire.

175
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,900
Thank you, sir. In reference
to our arrangement for our rate,

176
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,053
my brother Darsaw here, will be
willing to cut your firewood up.

177
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,034
Very good.
I will?

178
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:06,644
Yes, you will.

179
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,605
Well, I'm assuming
you're all hungry, correct?

180
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,302
Very.
Please, come with me.

181
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,922
"Very."

182
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:34,542
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to present to you,

183
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,609
Darsaw, Ole, and Brett,
the Bayton boys.

184
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,983
They're here to do some
buck hunting this weekend.

185
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,332
Hey, y'all.

186
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,213
Damn, Darsaw, you sure
know how to clear out a room.

187
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,181
Back at the manor.

188
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:07,768
Our annual fall prison sentence.

189
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,837
Mm, I love it.

190
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,840
Mm-hm.
I fucking hate this place.

191
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,277
You know what I did love...

192
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,168
...was the meal that
Charlie Manson served.

193
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,517
Oh! The gray matter?

194
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,215
The gray matter. It was very nice.
Delicious.

195
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,240
Did you see the eyeball
in the teeth?

196
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,503
The guy scares me.

197
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,350
He's the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

198
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,201
Mm.

199
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,572
Oh, speaking of the which, um...

200
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,859
Did you see those three hunters
that showed up?

201
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,427
Maybe.
They were cute, weren't they?

202
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,473
Maybe.

203
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,128
It's been about an hour and a half.
You haven't fucked anybody yet?

204
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:46,222
You mean, like you fucking your
cousin the last time we were here?

205
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,182
Hm.

206
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,010
That happened.

207
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,883
You're adorable.

208
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,712
You are adorable. Hm.

209
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,412
Hey, lady.

210
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,243
Come on, are you serious?

211
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,682
No, I'm not in town
this weekend. I'm...

212
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:16,359
with my family at this place
we go a couple times a year

213
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,254
and desperately try
to act normal.

214
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:23,564
Yeah, it's called Anders Manor.

215
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,653
It's so lame.

216
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,743
No.

217
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,832
Look, do you remember, um...

218
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:34,444
that cousin that I told you
about, the super crazy one?

219
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,643
Yeah, well, she checked out of
the loony bin today,

220
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,279
so we're all here to throw her a
"Welcome Back to the Family" party.

221
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:09,325
Amy, do you understand that even
though you may feel a shock,

222
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,568
it will not break the hypnosis?

223
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,547
You will relax immediately,

224
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,661
noting only the pain,
and its lesson.

225
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,534
You will remain in a trance.

226
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,971
Do you understand that, Amy?

227
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,147
Yes.

228
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,062
Very good.

229
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:32,241
Now, Amy,
you are a tiny caterpillar,

230
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,417
crawling across a leaf.

231
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,506
What are you, Amy?

232
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,118
I'm a tiny caterpillar.

233
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,907
Very good, Amy.

234
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,713
Now, we're gonna
spin you a cocoon of good drugs

235
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,193
and helpful therapy.

236
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,872
And while you're in that cocoon,
you won't feel any pain.

237
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,875
And when you emerge
from the cocoon...

238
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:01,401
you will be
a beautiful butterfly.

239
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,963
I'm sorry. I was a complete and
total asshole to you at dinner.

240
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:46,117
I didn't want to come this
weekend and my parents made me

241
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,490
and I'm pissed at them,
not at you.

242
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,189
Still cousins?

243
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,846
Look, I feel really bad, okay?

244
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,198
Friends?

245
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,291
Well, boys, you like?

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,901
I like.

247
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,382
That MILF, you see those titties?

248
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,100
Man, wait until you see them
True Believers.

249
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,343
The what?

250
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,651
The True Believers, man. They're
a church group or something.

251
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,393
Man, church girls
don't put out no poon.

252
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,612
Yeah, well, these ones do.

253
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,354
Universalists, or some shit.

254
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,096
What about that retarded girl?

255
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:29,663
Kind of cute.

256
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,012
"Butterface" cute.

257
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,103
Ole, man, listen to me
right now, all right?

258
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,324
That girl broke in the head.
You stay away from her.

259
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,504
I remember playing superheroes
with you and...

260
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,202
pushing you on the swing
when we were six.

261
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:49,770
You were totally normal.

262
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,296
What happened, Amy?

263
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,081
I got sick.

264
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:59,301
That's all.

265
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm taking meds for it now.

266
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,785
Yeah, but, like,
crazy sick though, right?

267
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,137
Sometimes I don't know
what's real.

268
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,444
And it seems real to me.

269
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,837
Like...

270
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,448
Playing superheroes, but...

271
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,688
But thinking that you're
actually a superhero.

272
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,670
Like an acid trip.

273
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,065
People know they're
hallucinating on an acid trip.

274
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:33,770
Is there anything I can do to make
up for what I said at dinner?

275
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:36,904
Yeah.

276
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,168
Do you know how to do makeup?

277
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,610
Step into my office.

278
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,154
I'm gonna make you look
so expensive.

279
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,440
Mm-mm-mm!

280
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,139
Like a ripe, juicy fruit.

281
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:39,662
You're going to get pregnant.

282
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,448
Actually,
I'm on the pill, shithead.

283
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:44,537
Syphilis then.

284
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,583
Why are you guys
so mean to each other?

285
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,151
Love.
Love.

286
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,435
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

287
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,393
The curlers hurt my head.

288
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,288
Beauty is pain, Cousin.

289
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:00,204
Anyone who tells you otherwise
is selling some bullshit.

290
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:28,755
This is it, True Believers.

291
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:36,415
Let's set it up.

292
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,460
Come on, True Believers.

293
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,334
Set it up.

294
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,124
Let's party with the Lord!

295
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:52,692
Who is it?

296
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,626
It's the Wicked Witch
of the West.

297
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,497
Open the goddamn door.

298
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,674
Come on in, Eva.

299
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,439
Hello.
Hi, honey.

300
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,488
Come over here and have
a drink with me by the window.

301
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:09,317
And let's watch boys
carry heavy things.

302
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,972
What are we, 16 and 18 again?

303
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:15,541
Well, let's just pretend
we are, okay?

304
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:19,414
I mean, I haven't seen you
since the funeral.

305
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:22,809
That's true.

306
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,593
Oh.

307
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:29,269
Yay!
Mm.

308
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:31,644
Oh.

309
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,124
Look, I've gotta tell you...
Oh my gosh.

310
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,494
...I've got dibs on the one
with the fur hat.

311
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,303
♪ Screaming in colors...

312
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:47,224
Well... boys, I'll leave you two
to get settled.

313
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:48,835
Darsaw...

314
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,968
Thanks for chopping
that firewood there, Pumpkin.

315
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,928
Brett don't chop no wood.

316
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,863
Relax, you big babies.

317
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,499
I'll be back,
and I'll have beer.

318
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,158
We all come together,

319
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,117
and we all go apart.

320
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,557
I said we all come together!

321
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,211
And we all go apart.

322
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,431
Like atoms...

323
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:05,955
like stars.

324
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,393
Did you get cotton candy?

325
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,308
Ice cream?

326
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,790
So nice to know
your bodies are nourished.

327
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,098
Now, it's time
to nourish our souls.

328
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:19,969
If you would...

329
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:22,189
breathe in with me!

330
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,192
And breathe out.

331
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,762
Breathe in with me!

332
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:34,462
And breathe out.

333
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:39,728
Welcome...

334
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,577
my True Believers.

335
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,519
You, stay.

336
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,615
So, how do you think
she's adjusting?

337
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,401
Well, Ethan,
I already see a difference.

338
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,102
Well, Niklaus did it again.

339
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:08,322
Everything is wonderful,
as always.

340
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:22,641
Good. It's good.

341
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,339
Thank you.

342
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,648
Thank you.

343
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,191
God loves you.

344
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,564
Jesus loves you.

345
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:36,872
Muhammad loves you.
Shiva loves you.

346
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:39,005
And the Goddess love you.

347
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,572
It doesn't matter
if you believe.

348
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,228
It doesn't matter at all,
love doesn't care.

349
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,405
Brothers and sisters,
love doesn't care.

350
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,539
So, let's crank up the tunes.

351
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,760
Fire up the pit.

352
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:57,676
And let's rejoice.

353
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:01,090
Let's rejoice,
in the name of love.

354
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,738
Hello, brothers and sisters.

355
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,090
What can we do for you, um...
Darsaw.

356
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,179
Darsaw Bayton.

357
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,442
You see,
I was just feeling the spirit,

358
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:28,334
and I figured I'd come over and
lend a friendly hand to you all.

359
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,147
Uh, Trevor. Trevor Clark.

360
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,410
Genuine pleasure, Trevor.

361
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,716
I'm Blair.

362
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,806
Blair Clark.
Ma'am.

363
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,679
And you are?

364
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:51,140
Actually, my business is with you, Trevor.
Can I borrow you for a minute?

365
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,445
Me?
Of course I can.

366
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,253
Seriously?

367
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:58,669
My brother, Ole... He pulled
his back out stacking firewood.

368
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:01,672
You know, he's as useless
as tits on a bull, that one.

369
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:05,613
And, well, I got a ton of gear in my
truck and it's a two-person lift.

370
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,877
Help a brother out, would you?
Say yes.

371
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:12,117
I mean, I love that girl
with all of my breaking heart,

372
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,708
but we didn't know
what we were getting into.

373
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:18,931
I know. I've heard so many stories
of heartbreak when people adopt.

374
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,499
I mean, you just never know what
family history you're gonna get.

375
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,350
Nice and easy, okay?
Okay.

376
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:28,786
Nice and easy, okay?
Careful, my hand...

377
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,855
It's slipping.

378
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,813
Nice and easy.

379
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,862
There's precious cargo in here.

380
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,126
What the hell.

381
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:44,739
So...

382
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,220
I gotta ask you...

383
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,050
What's up with you
and old "Barbie?"

384
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:55,228
Who, Amy?
Yeah. She's hot as hell, man.

385
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:56,577
Oh...

386
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,361
Dude, she's my cousin.

387
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,365
Big deal.
What, you've probably seen her

388
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,325
three, four, maybe five times
in your life?

389
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,979
Cousin, schmousin.

390
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,242
It's fair game, in my book.

391
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,644
What the hell...

392
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:24,823
Her and I...

393
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,086
we had a thing.

394
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:28,783
You and her?
Yeah.

395
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,873
Me and Amy,
last trip to the manor.

396
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:34,354
Yeah, I... I was...

397
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,748
16, and she was 14.

398
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,275
I knew that I liked you.
Well, I... It was weird.

399
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,104
I mean, I... It was weird. It...

400
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,194
Weird now even being back here.

401
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,457
I'll bet it is.

402
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:51,414
Look, we were...

403
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:54,722
young, you know?

404
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,550
Exploring.

405
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,552
Nothing-better-to-do kind
of stuff.

406
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,732
I could be way off base, but I
think you still kind of like her.

407
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:11,913
Well, maybe, tonight you guys
can rekindle some of that

408
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:13,543
"manor magic."

409
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,659
No, I don't think so.

410
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:23,509
But I... I will take
another beer.

411
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,467
(clears throat

412
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,318
All right.

413
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,451
Now you're speaking my language.

414
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,325
You like taking pictures?

415
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,023
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

416
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,982
Uh, yeah.

417
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,292
Don't be scared.

418
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,078
I like taking pictures, too.

419
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,037
Yeah?
Yeah.

420
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,344
But I like being in them better.

421
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,695
Hey, come on,
take a picture of me.

422
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,350
What?
Yeah, that's right.

423
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,918
I'll even pose
right nice for you.

424
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,572
Hmm.

425
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,661
Okay.

426
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:08,772
Okay, got it.

427
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,232
Okay, okay, let's shoot.

428
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,931
I'll pose again for you.
I'll give you another pose.

429
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:17,848
We're good.

430
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:19,154
Let me see.

431
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,026
Excuse me?

432
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,266
Can't you show me
on that little screen of yours?

433
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,181
Uh, I really should get going
back to the party.

434
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,704
You ain't going nowhere.

435
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:38,739
It's a good shot.

436
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,655
You sure can take
a good picture.

437
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,052
Thanks. Uh, I really should
get back to the party.

438
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:49,880
You have a nice night.

439
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,405
Yeah. You, too.

440
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,351
Your hair looks so good like this.
Thanks.

441
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,333
I'll teach you how to do it.

442
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,643
Hey. I'm Ole.

443
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,515
Ole Bayton.

444
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,128
You sure are purtier
than when I saw you earlier.

445
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,003
Don't go.

446
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,613
Stay.

447
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,808
Just wanna be friends.

448
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,051
Excuse me, sister, uh...

449
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,552
You mind if I rap to you
for a minute at the gazebo?

450
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,360
Um-hm.

451
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,798
Brother, you don't mind
if I talk to the sister?

452
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,018
Let me rap for a minute.
Are you all right with that?

453
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,533
If you can forgive
my bluntness, but sister...

454
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,537
Your aura right now
is screaming, like, whoa!

455
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,279
Um...

456
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,107
I'm sick.

457
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:28,501
In my brain.

458
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,851
Bummer.

459
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:38,163
You're funny.
No, sister, it's called charm.

460
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:39,947
True love.

461
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,210
Compassion.

462
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,517
What makes you sick, sister?

463
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,696
Acute paranoid schizophrenia
with mild hallucinations.

464
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,527
Sometimes, my imagination is real
to my brain, and I can't tell.

465
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:56,616
And sometimes...

466
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:00,315
my imagination's
really fucked up.

467
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,492
Bummer.

468
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,543
Are you on any
kind of treatment right now?

469
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,938
Um, I just got out of in-patient
for four years.

470
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,593
Today?

471
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,466
Yeah... today.

472
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,254
Intense.

473
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:33,435
Five, four, three, two, one.

474
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,091
Are you relaxed?

475
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:42,357
Can you hear
the sound of my voice, Amy?

476
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,492
Yes.
Good.

477
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,843
Now, let's talk about the night
of the accident.

478
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:52,715
I don't want to.

479
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,676
Okay.
Let's talk about something else.

480
00:35:58,243 --> 00:35:59,983
Tell me about your dad.

481
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,377
Tell me about David Hunter.

482
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,424
I did a bad thing.

483
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,168
What bad thing, Amy?

484
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:14,781
I hurt my dad.

485
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:19,786
He was bleeding.

486
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,136
He stopped moving.

487
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,096
Why did you hurt your dad?

488
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,190
Bastard demon,
Aka Manah, tricked me.

489
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,063
Still.

490
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,109
He's still tricking me.

491
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,503
Aka Manah.

492
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,420
It's a demon that tries
to tell me what to do.

493
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,163
Amy, did you say, "Aka Manah"?

494
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,296
Yeah.

495
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,081
It's a demon.
It's part of my psychosis.

496
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,475
But it's... It's made-up.

497
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:57,737
The doctors told me.

498
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:03,656
Well, Amy, I don't mean to give
you hallucinations, but...

499
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,314
Aka Manah
is not a made-up demon.

500
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:12,230
He isn't?

501
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,538
Tell me about Aka Manah,
the demon.

502
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,369
He scares me.

503
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,680
He tells me bad things.

504
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:31,814
What kind of bad things?

505
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,344
It's okay.

506
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,171
You can tell me.

507
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,957
You're safe under the trance.

508
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,829
He said,
"Kill him, or die, Amy,"

509
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:48,962
and I did.

510
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:53,749
He tricked me...

511
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:58,145
like he's still tricking me,
because I'm his...

512
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,629
I'm his fucking puppet.

513
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:07,502
Very good, Amy.

514
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,508
Aka Manah literally means,
"evil mind."

515
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:16,381
Listen...

516
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,079
I'm gonna give you my card.

517
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,561
You give me a call...

518
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,390
when you need to hear
a friendly voice.

519
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,090
Or if you just need somebody
to remind you...

520
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:31,918
what's real.

521
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:35,922
Rap at you later, sister.

522
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,193
You know what?

523
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,238
You're all right.

524
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,632
You are all right.

525
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,200
Not so bad yourself.

526
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:57,944
You know, I was thinking...

527
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:03,166
'cause you're a cool cat,
and I'm obviously a cool cat,

528
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:06,822
maybe we could get
your purty lady,

529
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,324
and I could find
a purty lady of my own.

530
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,352
And we could explore
this here manor.

531
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:19,531
And, I don't know, just happen
to stumble into my room,

532
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,535
and polish off
these beers, and...

533
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:27,582
get to know each other
a little better.

534
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:35,503
So, sister,
how are things with Amy?

535
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:39,115
She killed her damn husband because she
thought he was some sort of sex demon.

536
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,384
Well, apparently,
I need to get some fresh air.

537
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:03,072
Ma'am, when I first saw you,

538
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,901
you reminded me
of a beautiful spring day.

539
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,254
And I have been trying to get you alone for just
one moment, from the minute we locked eyes.

540
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:13,125
Oh, my goodness.

541
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:16,414
Well, Darsaw, I do declare,

542
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,939
you... flatter.

543
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:24,702
Well, if you are a kind woman,
you'd put me out of my misery,

544
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:27,642
by allowing me
your fair company, ma'am.

545
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,131
I would just completely
stay away from that guy, Ole.

546
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,569
Thank you
for looking out for me.

547
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,093
It's sweet.

548
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:46,879
Yeah.

549
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:52,711
And I like you a lot.

550
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:02,460
And I want you.

551
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,245
You... You're my cousin.

552
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:09,728
Yeah... I'm adopted.

553
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:20,956
Want some?

554
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,834
This is the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

555
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,618
I know.

556
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,012
I love sunsets.

557
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,450
I wasn't talking about
the sunset.

558
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,863
I was looking at you.

559
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,193
Oh...

560
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:42,891
Thank you.

561
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,982
I knew there was a sweetie
underneath all that flannel.

562
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,464
Well, that's very nice
of you to say,

563
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,510
but now that I think of it,

564
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,644
it really is a very beautiful
place they got here, ain't it?

565
00:41:57,427 --> 00:42:01,146
It's funny, because I just really, really
didn't want to come here this time.

566
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,522
But now that I'm here,
I kind of like it.

567
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:06,959
You know, it's nice.

568
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,309
Quiet.

569
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:14,943
And, I haven't had the urge
to check my phone

570
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:18,536
ever since somebody
walked through the door.

571
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:25,630
Well, you know, it's kind of
like the great scholars say,

572
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:29,895
"Less is, in fact, more."

573
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,463
I like that.

574
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,705
Well, you know, the manor does kind
of have its own unique charm to it.

575
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,513
Yeah.

576
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,691
Yeah, I like wandering around and looking
at all the weird little trinkets.

577
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:45,171
Yep...

578
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,347
the accommodations
ain't bad, either.

579
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:50,393
The rooms are kind of nice.
Yeah.

580
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:52,700
Mine's pretty cozy.

581
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,397
Oh yeah?

582
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,159
Mine ain't too shabby, either.

583
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,576
Oh, is that right?

584
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:03,687
I wonder if the, uh, layouts
are the same?

585
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:05,733
The couch is in the same spots...
Yeah.

586
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:07,343
...and the lamps.

587
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,563
I wonder. I'm so curious.

588
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,850
Say, I'll tell you what...

589
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,723
if you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

590
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:19,031
I can roll with that.

591
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,652
Oh my God!

592
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:20,658
What the fuck?

593
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,916
When I first saw you,
it was like a spring day.

594
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:06,878
I'd appreciate the pleasure
of your company.

595
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,204
No!

596
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:12,511
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Stop! Stop it!

597
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:14,775
No! No! No!

598
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,539
Quiet! Quiet!

599
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,171
Amy?
What is that?

600
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,758
Amy, honey, what's going...?

601
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,676
Amy? Amy? Amy, it's Mom.

602
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,006
Amy, it's Mom. It's Mom.

603
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:31,223
Hey, Mom...

604
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:34,028
Mom, I need my meds.

605
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,488
Okay, okay. We'll get you them.

606
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,598
Okay. It's okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

607
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:40,948
Come on, it's just you and me.

608
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,993
It's just you and me. Come on.

609
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,498
We'll go to bed.
Remember, it's just you and me.

610
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,722
Am I like a king, Father?

611
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,336
You are but a lonely pawn,
my son.

612
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,382
A pawn? I don't understand.

613
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:02,863
Well...

614
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:06,736
each piece is different.

615
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:09,652
Each one has
a different role to play.

616
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,220
They're unique.

617
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,050
Some people say that one piece may
be more powerful than another...

618
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,401
or have a higher rank,
but I disagree.

619
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:24,015
Each piece is as powerful,
or as weak,

620
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,974
as the circumstance
it finds itself in.

621
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,432
At the beginning of the game,
they are all equal

622
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:32,893
and depending on
the strategy used,

623
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,853
the positioning,
the circumstances of the play,

624
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:39,334
any piece could be the weakest.

625
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:43,164
Or any piece
could be the most powerful.

626
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:25,815
I like your hat.

627
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:27,817
Really?

628
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,211
Give it to me.

629
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:32,450
You want it?

630
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,084
Mm-hm.

631
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:36,846
All right.

632
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:43,374
You know what?
Hm?

633
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:44,723
It looks better on you.

634
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,140
It really does.

635
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,273
You know, um...

636
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:50,753
I have a surprise for you.

637
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,081
Turn around.

638
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:57,021
Close your eyes.

639
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:58,587
I won't look.

640
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,634
Maybe get started
on that belt buckle for me, huh?

641
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,245
Don't gotta tell me twice.

642
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:08,396
Doctor, I have Amy for you.

643
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,789
Thank you.

644
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:12,009
Hello, Amy.

645
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:16,752
Well,
it's your last day with us.

646
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:18,232
Yeah.

647
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,060
How do you feel about that?

648
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,107
Um, a little scared.

649
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:25,674
Four years is...

650
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:29,504
a long time
to be away from everyone.

651
00:50:31,158 --> 00:50:32,551
I feel like I've changed a lot.

652
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:34,944
I'm hoping outside
has changed, too.

653
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,860
You have. It has.

654
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,603
We've all come a very long way,
you especially.

655
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:42,778
Thank you.

656
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:44,954
We've made fantastic progress.

657
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:49,002
Although, there have been
some incidents.

658
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:51,570
And the nightmares.

659
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:54,442
Are you still having
the nightmares?

660
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,879
Um...
The demon?

661
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,186
Aka Manah.

662
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,092
What is it?

663
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,593
Doctor, Mrs. Hunter is here.

664
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:07,421
Could you tell her
we'll be with her in a moment?

665
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:08,465
Yes, Doctor.

666
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,012
Amy...

667
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:14,645
I'd like for you to consider remaining
in some programs here at Fairview.

668
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:16,105
I have to be frank with you,

669
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:20,782
I am worried that your episodes
may turn dangerous

670
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:23,461
if you are not
in a controlled environment.

671
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:25,593
I have to stay here?

672
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:27,702
No. No, no.

673
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:29,878
No one is trying
to force you to stay here.

674
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:32,663
I am simply talking about
a day treatment program.

675
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:33,297
No.

676
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:36,169
God, if I don't have to...

677
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,650
and I mean, have to stay here...

678
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:41,609
I'd really like to go back.

679
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,307
Oh my God.

680
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:48,268
I had no idea
it had gotten so bad.

681
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:52,098
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Do you not
remember about Dave's funeral?

682
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,642
What a horrible thing to say,
Ethan.

683
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,971
Yeah,
it's the concussion talking.

684
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,757
Oh.

685
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:00,889
Oh, are we okay?

686
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,259
The pills should put her out
for the night..

687
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:04,719
Janie, it's a heartbreak.

688
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,394
I don't think I could do it.

689
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:09,855
Jane, you've got
the patience of a saint.

690
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,400
So, the girl...

691
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,208
She'll be asleep soon.

692
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:18,361
Good, good. Sleep is good.

693
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:22,583
To wit, if there's nothing else,
I would like to retire.

694
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,062
Thank you so much
for everything, Nik.

695
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:25,368
You're a prince.

696
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:26,804
And you're a very nice lady.

697
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:29,396
So, breakfast in the morning,
seven to nine?

698
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:31,398
Goodnight, everybody.

699
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:42,322
Here... is just a white pawn,
right?

700
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:45,369
No.

701
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,459
Just a white pawn

702
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,984
until he becomes,

703
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:53,507
the white pawn.

704
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:56,138
And he clashes.

705
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:58,314
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

706
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,340
I am the white pawn

707
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,405
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

708
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:04,102
I am the white pawn

709
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:06,409
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

710
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:07,652
I am the white pawn

711
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:10,152
I shall raise my sword

712
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:12,459
In defense of my queen
Clash, clash

713
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:14,417
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

714
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,853
I am the white pawn

715
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:17,855
I shall raise my shield

716
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,336
To protect my king Clash, clash

717
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,295
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

718
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,668
I am the white pawn

719
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:26,734
I shall die honorably in battle

720
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:28,039
I will, clash, clash

721
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,998
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

722
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,782
I am the white pawn

723
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:35,873
I'll be the first to die
If to die I must, clash, clash

724
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:38,223
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

725
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:40,467
I am the white pawn

726
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,341
I am the white pawn,
clash, clash.

727
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:55,284
That chess set has
always creeped me out, Ethan.

728
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,136
Well, maybe that's
what I like about it, Jane.

729
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,268
I'm going out to the gazebo.

730
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:01,072
To get stoned.

731
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:02,639
Yeah, to get stoned.
What the hell?

732
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,404
Why don't you have
another fucking drink, Eva?

733
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:06,754
I'll be right back.

734
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:09,670
I thought he'd never leave.

735
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:12,736
Hey, be happy that you have
someone to annoy you.

736
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,893
Like I need a hole in the head.

737
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:20,377
All right.

738
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:25,207
No, I shouldn't. Amy's a mess.

739
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:28,428
That's an argument for,
not against.

740
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:29,908
Go on.

741
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,093
My God, Eva, keep drinking.

742
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,835
Just drink yourself
to death, please.

743
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:55,586
Yeah.

744
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:57,588
Oh.

745
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:05,378
Fucking animals.

746
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:07,424
God, I hate this place.

747
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:09,382
I need to piss.

748
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,580
Eva...

749
00:57:13,604 --> 00:57:14,779
Come here.

750
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:16,389
I got something for you.

751
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,554
I think I'll join you, son.

752
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:36,801
Who are you?

753
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:41,980
Ah.

754
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:13,881
Have a good night, son.

755
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,584
I've been waiting for so long

756
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:22,649
Time again

757
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:26,590
Time and time again

758
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:41,822
It's when I want you so bad

759
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,587
I mean, especially at my age,
I mean...

760
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,743
Who the hell is that
at this time of night?

761
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:51,504
What?
What?

762
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,592
Ladies.

763
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:56,445
I'm sorry,
I hope I didn't startle you.

764
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,294
Evening, ma'am.

765
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:02,515
I got a car downstairs that's
full of buckshot and water,

766
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,778
and some deer piss.

767
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:09,502
And, well, I need my brothers to help
me unload it into the pickup truck,

768
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:12,766
but, uh, they don't seem
to be answering their god...

769
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,987
Their phones. Um...

770
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,903
So, without sounding rude, um...

771
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:21,906
have y'all seen my dumb-ass
brothers anywhere?

772
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,822
We haven't seen them
since dinner with you.

773
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,061
Would you like some wine?

774
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:27,738
Hm.

775
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:30,479
Yes.

776
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,330
Nah, I'd better not.

777
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:37,071
Uh, I... I'm gonna go upstairs

778
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:40,422
and check to see where Tweedledee
and Tweedledumbass are,

779
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:42,143
but y'all ladies
have a good evening,

780
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:47,061
and maybe a raincheck,
or something like that.

781
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:48,778
I'll wait. It's all right.

782
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,893
Yes, thank you very much.

783
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:56,157
I used to spend my nights out
In the barroom

784
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:01,661
Brought me back

785
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:05,602
From being too far gone

786
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:16,569
Oh, shit.
What?

787
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:18,397
Where the fuck is Blair?

788
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:22,357
Shit. Shit, that fucking hick.

789
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:27,667
Darsaw!

790
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:30,864
Goddamn numbhead.

791
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:32,759
Fucking stupid asses.

792
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:35,632
Darsaw!

793
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:40,637
Ole!

794
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,639
The fuck you at, man?

795
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:44,597
Goobers!

796
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:54,302
You guys better stop...
fucking around.

797
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,310
She didn't even unpack.

798
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:03,747
That's not like her.

799
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,162
Okay, then he put his hand
up my skirt and he yelled...

800
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,056
Here, come here.

801
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,518
What the fuck
does that even mean?

802
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,891
I have no fucking idea,

803
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:20,633
but whenever he did it,
I just nearly came.

804
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,830
Our baby!
Hey.

805
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,788
Hey, so beautiful and grown.
Hey.

806
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:27,572
Why are you out of bed?
You feeling better?

807
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,314
Yeah, Mom, have you seen Blair
come through here at all?

808
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:32,229
No, not since dinner, why?
Yeah, why?

809
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:33,124
Um...

810
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,953
Because she has
my cell phone charger,

811
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:38,496
and, uh, my-my battery's dead.

812
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,282
There's no network out here,
and I'm dying, so...

813
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:43,110
Well, I would check upstairs...
Yes.

814
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:45,571
...or the local nightclubs.
Definitely.

815
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,158
Did you see your dad out there?
Nope. No, Ma.

816
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:50,141
Come on, Amy. Gotta go. Okay.

817
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,250
Mmm, it's just like
when we were kids.

818
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,798
Um-hm.

819
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,756
Do you have any more wine?
Um-hm.

820
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:33,793
Blair!

821
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:36,970
Blair, what the fuck?

822
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,366
Blair!

823
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:43,411
Blair!

824
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,206
This is, this is...

825
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:04,693
She-she's not answering
her phone.

826
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,002
Well, shit...

827
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:12,025
I thought we would have caught
her bawling her brains out

828
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:14,703
in some redneck threesome
free-for-all.

829
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,141
No such luck, huh?
No. No luck.

830
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,230
I-I think we better get
the 'rents involved.

831
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:22,775
One... One of those cult freaks
could've made off with her,

832
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,429
or she could've hitched a ride
with that cotton candy vendor.

833
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:27,823
I think he... was cute.

834
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,303
I think the True Believers
were good.

835
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,372
I mean, they were nice people.

836
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,481
Yeah, oh, they're nice.

837
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,352
Yeah, that's how they get you
to join their cult.

838
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,485
Next thing you know,
you're shaving your head

839
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:39,293
and your selling flowers
at a fucking airport. Come on.

840
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,531
Amy, take your time.

841
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,925
And don't be in a hurry to take
your finger off of the piece.

842
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:05,363
Okay,
I think I got it this time.

843
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:08,279
So, make your move.

844
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,415
Bishop to queen's bishop three.

845
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,723
Check.
Very good.

846
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:22,075
You know, I can still take
your bishop with my rook.

847
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,861
Maybe.

848
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:28,081
Okay then...

849
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:30,170
rook takes bishop.

850
01:04:34,348 --> 01:04:37,762
Queen to queen's knight five.

851
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:39,939
Checkmate.

852
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,529
Oh, son of a bitch, Amy.

853
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,966
I finally got you.

854
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:44,881
Three moves ahead.

855
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:47,100
Nicely done.

856
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,949
Thanks.

857
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,952
Sorry.

858
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:16,192
I didn't mean to startle you,
just looking for my brothers.

859
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,628
Have you seen them?
Um-mm.

860
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,698
I'm sorry.
I just took a nap and woke up.

861
01:05:20,394 --> 01:05:23,093
And these two here got stone fucking drunk.
Mom?

862
01:05:23,397 --> 01:05:24,442
God...

863
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,357
We need to find Trevor.

864
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:29,142
All right, I'll come with you.
I've got a flashlight in the car.

865
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:37,934
Ole!

866
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:39,718
God damn it.

867
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,764
Darsaw!

868
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:46,725
Oh my God.

869
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:50,207
Is that real?

870
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:52,818
Man, that's fucking real.

871
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,938
We're sorry...
What the fuck?

872
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,964
...you have reached a number that has
been disconnected... You kidding me?

873
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:09,182
Fuck!

874
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:15,536
I remember seeing
a landline inside, all right?

875
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:16,973
Come on,
let's go see if that one works.

876
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:22,979
Come on.

877
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:29,986
God damn it, Darsaw.

878
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:33,641
Come on, we need to go find
"Thelma and Louise."

879
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,926
Go see if you can find the phone somewhere.
Okay.

880
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,517
I think I see it over there
near the window.

881
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:43,086
Ma'am? Ma'am, wake up.
Ma'am, please.

882
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,217
Ma'am?

883
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,264
Ma'am?

884
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:49,851
Call 911, Amy!

885
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:50,634
Call the police!

886
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:55,944
The phone, is it working or not?

887
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,015
Fuck!

888
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,465
Stop! Stop!

889
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,389
Ah.

890
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:13,611
The omnipotent, noble knight.

891
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,553
I shall mount
my mighty barbed steed

892
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:26,232
and take great lengths
upon this land,

893
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,864
paired with my bishop
in defense.

894
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:33,196
Serve upon this war, its end.

895
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:06,142
Happy birthday.

896
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,519
Make a wish.

897
01:09:41,525 --> 01:09:43,048
I wish this would end.

898
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,144
Where's my mom?

899
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:55,191
Why, right there, of course.

900
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:58,803
Who's that?
Where's my mom? Where's she?

901
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:01,458
Follow the bread crumbs.

902
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:47,982
Now, the bishop...

903
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,724
a wily soldier,

904
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:52,770
but an honorable man.

905
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:58,123
And I shall preach
the good word, sire,

906
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:01,126
and bring our enemies
to God's fire.

907
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:04,260
Pray for their souls
upon the hour

908
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:07,480
as death's dragon doth devour.

909
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,868
The kingdom, Niklaus,
the kingdom.

910
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:50,673
You must defend the kingdom.

911
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:52,308
The kingdom?
The kingdom.

912
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,530
These pieces, these soldiers...

913
01:11:57,835 --> 01:12:01,229
They're your only defense
of the kingdom.

914
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:03,623
The kingdom.
The kingdom.

915
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,366
The kingdom.
The kingdom.

916
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,107
The kingdom.

917
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:16,419
The kingdom.

918
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,425
Mama! Oh, my God!

919
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:33,321
I'm so sorry. Okay, Mom.

920
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,573
Hello, Amy.
No!

921
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,923
Did you like my gift?
Let my mom go!

922
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,446
Yeah, about that...

923
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,275
Jane, we're not going
to be needing you anymore.

924
01:13:54,299 --> 01:13:57,104
No, I'm sorry,
the king has sacrificed you

925
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:58,888
so that we could put
our queen back on the board.

926
01:13:58,912 --> 01:13:59,976
No.

927
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,568
Happy birthday to you

928
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,528
Happy birthday to you

929
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:10,596
Happy birthday, dear daughter

930
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,664
Stop!

931
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,362
Oh, Amy, you're being silly.

932
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,559
Yes, yes. Do you not understand?

933
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,933
I'm your daddy. It's true.

934
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,459
Your mother was my cousin,
the beautiful Elizabeth Rosen.

935
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,220
No!
Listen to me,

936
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:31,162
I knew the moment I saw you,
that you were my Amy Anders.

937
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,251
My father made us give you up.

938
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,123
But now you're back.
Now we can win.

939
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:42,260
You're Aka Manah.

940
01:14:44,436 --> 01:14:45,872
You killed them all.
Amy...

941
01:14:46,786 --> 01:14:48,416
They were just game pieces.

942
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,618
This is the game of kings.
Do you not understand?

943
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,738
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

944
01:15:05,762 --> 01:15:07,546
I am the white pawn

945
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:09,916
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

946
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,681
I am the white pawn

947
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:14,486
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

948
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,207
I am the white pawn

949
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,533
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

950
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:20,056
I am the white pawn

951
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,189
I shall raise my sword

952
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:24,583
In defense of my queen
Clash, clash

953
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:26,541
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

954
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,369
I am the white pawn

955
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:32,155
I shall raise my shield
To protect my king

956
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:34,593
Clash, clash I am the
white pawn Clash, clash

957
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:36,029
I am the white pawn

958
01:15:36,053 --> 01:15:39,075
I shall die honorably in battle

959
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:40,947
I will, clash, clash

960
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:42,601
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

961
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,385
I am the white pawn

962
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:49,608
I'll be the first to die
If to die I must, clash, clash

963
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,199
I am the white pawn Clash, clash

964
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,178
You killed Trevor.

965
01:15:55,202 --> 01:15:56,900
No, not true.

966
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:58,554
That was your demon.

967
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,339
He made me.

968
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:05,125
I was just his puppet, and you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

969
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:07,519
And you know what else?
He's gonna make you do it, too.

970
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:11,784
No.

971
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:14,570
Amy, Amy, Amy...

972
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:18,811
Listen to me very carefully...

973
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:20,706
You're not my father!

974
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:24,405
You are a beautiful
monarch butterfly...

975
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,063
...emerging from the cocoon.

976
01:16:32,762 --> 01:16:34,328
Preparing to take flight...

977
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:36,330
and be free.

978
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,602
Queen to queen's knight three.

979
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:50,518
Remove now, the black queen
from the board.

980
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:10,060
Good daughter.

981
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,889
Now, come here...

982
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:15,935
and give Papa a big hug.

983
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:05,251
Hello, Reverend Thomas.
It's Amy Anders.

984
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:08,341
It's actually Anders now.

985
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,321
My mom left me here to recover, and Nik
had to leave town for a little while

986
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:13,975
and take care of family
down south.

987
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:15,044
And he left me in charge, and...

988
01:21:20,788 --> 01:21:23,376
I thought, you know, we could
use a lot of help around here,

989
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,097
and maybe we could
work something out?

990
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:37,501
Great.

991
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,025
I look forward to it.
