DA BAN RE-EDUCATION CAMP
VIETNAM, 1981

2
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,073
APRIL 30, 1975
VIETNAM FALLS UNDER COMMUNISM

3
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,825
Honey! What are you doing?

4
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,666
Long!

5
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,094
Long! Son!

6
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,203
Mai! Where are you going!

7
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,700
Mai!

8
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,799
Long!

9
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:42,969
Long!

10
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,204
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come home?

11
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,445
I can't go with you.

12
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,377
- Here, take these.
- What are you saying?

13
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,138
What about your mother and Lai?

14
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,274
All our plans?

15
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,841
Take mother and Lai to the boat.

16
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,316
The Americans will still wait.

17
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,714
Wait for what?

18
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,549
Wait for your dead corpse?

19
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,682
Our family doesn't work without you.

20
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,885
Look at these!

21
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,091
Flyers! How do we expect to
fight a war with flyers?

22
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,530
The Americans have abandoned us.
They've broken their promise.

23
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
Then we should go.

24
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,996
Everyone is leaving, too.

25
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,197
If we don't fight for our country,
then who will? Who will?

26
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,969
The war is already lost.

27
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,802
What's left to fight for?

28
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,775
- The Americans have left us!
- Screw the Americans!

29
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,248
Do you think things would be
any different if they had won?

30
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,118
Long!

31
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,549
Mai.

32
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,517
Take mother and Lai for me.

33
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,621
This family isn't going anywhere
without you. Nowhere.

34
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,620
I don't want to take this
family down with me.

35
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,129
I've made up my mind.

36
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,766
This is my decision, and mine alone.

37
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,198
Why?

38
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,067
Why are you the only one who gets to
decide what happens to this family?

39
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,075
Please. Please understand.

40
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,877
Go without me.

41
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,575
The whole family stays.

42
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,375
Son.

43
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,448
This room is nice.

44
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,246
But I liked my old one better.

45
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,417
Shut up! I don't want to hear
another word out of you!

46
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,691
Get in!

47
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,361
Hey! Remember to wake me up
for dinner!

48
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,195
Just shut the hell up!

49
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,471
That's right.

50
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,603
Make sure you're this loud.

51
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,227
CA MAU -VIETNAM, 1979

52
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,398
Because Le Loi forgot to return the sword,

53
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,731
there was no rest in the country.

54
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,234
The Chinese returned
with a greater army.

55
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,740
They drove Le Loi's army deep into
the mountains until there was no way out.

56
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,640
The Ming army was evil.

57
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,913
They didn't want to kill Le Loi.

58
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,951
They wanted to see his whole
army starved to death.

59
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,150
Le Loi knew

60
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,520
if they stayed in the mountains
too long, they would all die.

61
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,162
Why didn't they fight?

62
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,300
When you are really hungry you can't do
anything, except wait for death.

63
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,032
If they all died,

64
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,705
then why tell me this story?

65
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,364
- Who said they died?
- You did.

66
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,267
You said that they all
starved to death.

67
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,669
I just said,

68
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,673
that if they starved,
then they would die.

69
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,372
There!

70
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,176
You see?

71
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,917
That means they’re all going to die.

72
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:38,508
Quiet!

73
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,077
- He's over there!
- Don't hurt me.

74
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:41,987
Move!

75
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:42,983
Someone got caught.

76
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,888
- Are you boat people?
- No!

77
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,788
- Is it the secret police?
- Hush.

78
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,654
- You'll rot in prison for this.
- But I'm not a boat person.

79
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,058
It's late.
Go to sleep, son.

80
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,597
But I'm not sleepy.

81
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,029
I said go to sleep!

82
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,869
Go to sleep, son.
We can draw tomorrow.

83
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,171
Mai,

84
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,967
when will they get here?

85
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,799
Either tonight or tomorrow.

86
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,472
What does that mean?
Are we leaving tonight or tomorrow?

87
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,072
You should get some rest.

88
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,849
I'll wake you if anything happens.

89
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,658
Grandma will leave it here
for tomorrow.

90
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,085
Go to sleep now.

91
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,029
- Grandma.
- What, son?

92
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,425
What happened then,
if they didn't die?

93
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,265
A great sacrifice.

94
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,534
Le Lai was a great General,
who had a plan to save Le Loi.

95
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,446
"Re-Education is good. "

96
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,985
VINH LONG -VIETNAM, 1975

97
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,932
Take your reports!

98
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,166
Can't you understand Vietnamese?

99
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,805
Everyone out!

100
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,670
Go!

101
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,977
Move!

102
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,881
Move it!

103
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,481
Keep moving.

104
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,419
You there.

105
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,286
Sit over here.

106
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,115
Private, shut the door.

107
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:26,954
Yes, sir!

108
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,723
We know you were a
high ranking officer.

109
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,830
You don't have to write any
more self evaluations.

110
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,062
We already know about all your crimes.

111
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,604
I've committed no crime.

112
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,897
"No crime?"

113
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,807
You sided with the American imperialists.

114
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,101
Waged war against the revolutionaries.

115
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,110
You're a traitor to your country.

116
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,205
To your own people.
Understand?

117
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,650
"Traitor to my country?"

118
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,083
I fought to keep my country free.

119
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,820
"Fought to keep your country free. "

120
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,688
People like you don't even know
what it means to free Vietnam.

121
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,895
Only now is Vietnam truly free.

122
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,997
Now that the Americans
have abandoned their posts.

123
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,325
Your crimes are many.

124
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,170
You dared oppose the revolution.

125
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,303
But we succeeded.

126
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,239
All across the land,

127
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,208
we freed the people of Vietnam.

128
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,705
Did you free the people?

129
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,638
Or did they free you?

130
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,712
That kind of ungrateful talk

131
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,778
will only get you killed.

132
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,950
Death is nothing.

133
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,888
The day Saigon fell is my memorial.

134
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,386
What's wrong?

135
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,392
Where's your smile?

136
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,665
Want me to open the window?

137
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,198
Are you apolitical prisoner
or just a prisoner?

138
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,703
The world is so screwed
up these days.

139
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,475
You try to leave by boat,
and you're a traitor.

140
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,508
I told them straight.

141
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,710
I'm not abandoning Vietnam.

142
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,609
I just don't want to live
in a communist opera.

143
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,587
Your index finger.

144
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,784
Whose work is that?

145
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,053
This?

146
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,921
It's my work.

147
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,496
Bored-bored-I-count-my-toes.

148
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,659
When-the-draft-comes
this-one-will-go.

149
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,933
You dodged the draft

150
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,903
by cutting off your own finger?

151
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,864
It was either my finger
or my charming smile.

152
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,968
So I sacrificed the finger.

153
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,510
You should have yanked
your damned teeth out.

154
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,011
In this war,

155
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,344
Communist or Nationalist,
North or South,

156
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,289
I couldn't care less.

157
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,489
My fathers before me,

158
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,961
in their fight against
the French and Chinese,

159
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,994
they all fought for
noble causes.

160
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,391
But with me,

161
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,134
liberating Vietnam from Vietnam?

162
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,766
Nothing noble about that.

163
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,567
Clowns like you,

164
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,901
have no causes.

165
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,372
That's why I became a
boat person.

166
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,941
But I'm jinxed.
Keep getting caught.

167
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,747
Caught and tossed in a camp.

168
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,679
Then tried to escape.

169
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,883
Now I'm sitting here with you.

170
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,116
This life is like
being in a box.

171
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,216
But this box is inside
another box.

172
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,622
If you feel this way,

173
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,455
Then,

174
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,296
why bother trying to
escape the country at all?

175
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,424
To find a bigger box.

176
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,031
You crying?

177
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,043
SUOl MAU CAMP
VIETNAM, 1977

178
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:19,378
If you cry, then I won't have the strength
to make it through this place.

179
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,521
I need you to tell me
that you are happy.

180
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,885
Tell me that our family

181
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,895
is well

182
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,986
and not in want of anything.

183
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,797
I'm happy.

184
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,261
I'm happy.

185
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,304
Lai is at home with your mother.

186
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,671
Everyone is doing very well.

187
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,506
I hear that everyone is going to
"The New Economic Zone".

188
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,879
If the opportunity comes,
I want you to take the family.

189
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,612
Did you get any sleep?

190
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,118
No, mother.

191
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,820
You should take better care of your health.
If not for yourself, then for Lai.

192
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,759
Don't worry about me, mother.

193
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,961
I know how to take care of him.

194
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,472
Why do you tell him
the story of Le Loi and Le Lai?

195
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,264
It's a part of history.

196
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,737
Everyone should know
the history of our country.

197
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,947
But you're telling it wrong.

198
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,044
It's not what you say that’s important,
it's when you say it.

199
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,777
I don't think now is the time either.

200
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,554
Lai needs to hear this story.

201
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,250
He misses his father.

202
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,968
Forget it, mother.

203
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,901
Please wake up Lai for me.

204
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,705
It’s time to get ready.

205
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,343
Wake up, son.

SUOl MAU CAMP
VIETNAM, 1977

208
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,520
You have been fooled.

209
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,861
You are all here today,

210
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,693
because you have let the Americans
and their puppet government

211
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,067
fool you!

212
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,106
All of you have sold out
our beloved nation

213
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,507
to help the Americans
and their puppets.

214
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,044
They keep relocating us.
How is my family supposed to visit me?

215
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,806
Don't be so naive.
It's part of their plan.

216
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,448
Stop whining.
Just be glad we're not dead.

217
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,648
If I were dead,

218
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:56,057
at least my spirit would be free
to find my wife and daughter.

219
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,252
Trai.
Don't worry, Trai.

220
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,331
My wife, Quynh,
has a plan to get us out.

221
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,428
Your crimes deserve death!

222
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,232
This country will never forgive you!

223
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,636
Heaven will not acknowledge you.

224
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,038
And when you finally die,

225
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,008
even Mother Earth will not
receive your rotten corpse!

226
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:18,573
But,

227
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,051
the Party is different.

228
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,221
The Party will not
imprison you for5 years...

229
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:24,981
or10,

230
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,313
or20 years.

231
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,491
The time that you spend
in re-education

232
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,398
is up to you!

233
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,062
From Quynh's description,

234
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,630
He's the one.

235
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,695
But his face is not

236
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,704
trustworthy.

237
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,141
What if he cheats you?

238
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,108
I know it's risky,
but I assure you,

239
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,709
we will die if we stay here.

240
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,949
Let me warn you now,

241
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:56,484
The barbwire security of this camp
may appear to be harmless,

242
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,624
But I dare you to cross it.

243
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,794
Lastly, you should know
that re-education

244
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,929
will reform you into
the kind of person

245
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,829
society will deem

246
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,923
as moral and upstanding.

247
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,865
To meet the standards
of our Socialist Vietnam.

248
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,496
Enlightened.

249
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:15,632
Free.

250
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,335
And prosperous.

251
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,873
Never forget the immortal words

252
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,807
of our founding fathers,

253
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,740
back on September2, 1945,

254
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,644
"Nothing is more precious
than freedom!"

255
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,292
Grandma, how am I supposed
to draw her if she turns?

256
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,797
Let grandma see.

257
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,831
It's beautiful.

258
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,001
If only your father could see this.

259
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,408
Hurry, let's put this away.

260
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,044
- Who is it?
- Tuan. It's time to go.

261
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,225
- Who are they?
- This is Phuong. She'll be coming with us.

262
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,283
- Hello.
- Hi.

263
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:09,991
And this is my brother.

264
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,121
- What's your name?
- "Sun". He's a mute.

265
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,489
We'll split into two groups.

266
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,600
- You and Phuong will go with Sun.
You two come with me.

267
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,601
No, I want to go with my grandson.

268
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,466
We can't all go together.
Big groups are easy to spot.

269
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,005
- I want to go with grandma.
- Quiet!

270
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,303
- He's so small.
Does he even know the way?

271
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,843
- Don't worry. He knows.
We'll meet up on the boat.

272
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,539
- You need to change. Hurry!
You can't blend in wearing that.

273
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,841
- Give me a few minutes.
- I don't want to go.

274
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,346
- What is it now?
- Son.

275
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,375
Go with your mother.
We'll see each other again on the boat.

276
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:35,949
Lai.

277
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,190
- Grandma.
- Come on, this way.

278
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,421
In Le Loi's darkest hour,

279
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,396
Le Loi's great General, Le Lai,
made the ultimate sacrifice.

280
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,938
He borrowed Le Loi's cloak and armor,
and twelve of his best warriors.

281
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:01,475
Late at night, Le Lai rode out
with his men to fight the Chinese.

282
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:08,042
His plan was to create a rift in the blockade
just big enough for Le Loi to escape.

283
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,517
Le Lai knew that as long as
Le Loi was alive,

284
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,789
our country would still have hope.

285
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,899
After all, Le Loi still had
Kim Quy's sword.

286
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,335
At first Le Loi was very angry.

287
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:31,737
But when he looked across the battlefield,
and saw the rift opening in the blockade,

288
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,347
Le Loi knew then what he must do.

289
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,230
Grandma!

290
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,162
What?

291
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:00,931
You want oranges?

292
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,337
I'll get you some. One kilo please.

293
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,498
- And a pineapple, too.
- Don't buy that.

294
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,971
- Why not?
- Bad luck. Pineapples have eyes.

295
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:07,703
Really?

296
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,770
No pineapples. Just the oranges.

297
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,982
- Thank you.
- Hurry, let's go.

298
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,829
Are you running away?
Because I can run way faster.

299
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:26,994
What?

300
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:27,724
Bite me?

301
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,527
I'll bite you.

302
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,898
This cricket is huge.

303
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,764
It's a rice cricket.

304
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,204
He's as big as a praying mantis.

305
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,439
Don't waste it.

306
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,044
In this camp, a cricket like that
is equivalent to a bowl of rice.

307
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,881
This guy? One bowl?

308
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,847
He's more like half a bowl.

309
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,824
This is the fifth time I've been
caught escaping by boat.

310
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,224
The first few times, I was cheated.

311
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,190
Third time, I got caught by
the coast guards.

312
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,091
The time after that,
I made it past the coastline.

313
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,334
The boat sank.

314
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,961
Swam back. Nearly died.

315
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,773
The last time, I got as far
as the open waters.

316
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,401
A huge freighter pulled up.
Thought it was American.

317
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,541
Turned out to be Russian.

318
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,404
They towed us back.

319
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,182
You always escaped by yourself?

320
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,144
My wife and son are in Vinh Long.

321
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,721
She's coming up to visit
this weekend.

322
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,382
What about you?

323
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,185
My mother,

324
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,492
wife and son escaped in '77.

325
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,402
Any news?

326
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,195
They were,

327
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,366
The coast guards sunk their boat.

328
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,038
They suspected the boat
was smuggling people.

329
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,969
How did you find out?

330
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,280
At the Xuan Loc camp,
our neighbor visited.

331
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,012
She told me.

332
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,118
Here.

333
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:04,888
Have some rice.

334
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,725
Breaded cricket.

335
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,823
Then fried.

336
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,231
You mean butter-fried cricket,

337
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,829
Or stir-fried cricket?

338
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,400
Rip off the head,
stuff its belly with a peanut.

339
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,070
Roll it in flour.

340
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:19,833
Deep-fry,

341
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:20,744
and then,

342
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,440
dip it in fish sauce with ginger.

343
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,742
That's not tasty.

344
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,840
You have to stuff it with a peanut!

345
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,009
You get the head.

346
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,546
Respect the elders.

347
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,951
"Elders", my ass.

348
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,884
I still got it.
Give me the body.

349
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,990
I get the ass, you get the head.

350
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,993
No. I want the body.
It’s the richer part.

351
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,116
How smart of you!

352
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,095
Hey! Don't wash out the flavor!

353
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,065
I have to wash out the piss!

354
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
That's the flavor. Hand it over.

355
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:46,995
Hurry up!

356
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,996
Damn. Another land mine.

357
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,272
Another poor soul.

358
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,877
Look out!

359
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,535
Log coming!

360
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,943
Log coming down! Log coming down!

361
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,174
Damn! Can't a man even eat?

362
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,683
I hope that Quynh can
get us both out of this place.

363
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,410
When will you realize

364
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,923
that they'll just take your money
and screw your wife?

365
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,050
I just need one honest, corrupt guard.

366
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,528
Log!

367
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,793
DA BAN CAMP
VIETNAM, 1979

368
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,029
- Everyone be careful!
- Take the rope.

369
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,434
- Watch your heads.
- Pull together!

370
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,501
Pull! Pull!

371
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:25,867
Heave!

372
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,739
Pull!

373
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,506
Get ready!
Here comes another!

374
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,706
Watch your head!

375
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,643
Long! Pull the rope over your head.

376
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,650
- Take it over!
- Get it. Hurry.

377
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,379
- Now pull!
- Pull! Take it up!

378
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,512
Take it up!

379
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,354
Up you go!

380
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,287
Heave!

381
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,186
Watch your legs!

382
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,231
Man down!

383
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,323
Someone help!

384
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,732
You're very lucky.

385
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,736
Your leg is broken,
but you can still work.

386
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,242
They said you were injured
while trying to escape.

387
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,959
In times of war, these scraps
of paper mean so much.

388
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,894
But more and more, I realize...

389
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,965
That I did not fight to earn
these scraps of paper.

390
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:29,164
In fact, what has become meaningful
to me has nothing to do with the war.

391
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,168
Take for example,

392
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,665
These bowls.

393
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,604
I bought these in Hai Phong...

394
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,045
When I had heard that my
aunt and uncle in Saigon

395
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,984
were so poor that they
ate from coconut shells.

396
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
For over a year,

397
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,549
I carried these bowls in
my shoulder bag,

398
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,557
careful not to crack them.

399
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,360
Most times,

400
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,954
I ate from a tin can.

401
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,791
I wanted to save them

402
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,734
as an independence day gift
for my aunt and uncle.

403
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,906
But then after April 30th,

404
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,741
I paid them a visit in Saigon.

405
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,613
They invited me in for dinner.

406
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,882
I saw for the first time,

407
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,422
a set of bowls, porcelain bowls,
imported from China.

408
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,961
These bowls never touched
their hands.

409
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,025
In yourself-evaluations,

410
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,095
you said that April 30th

411
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,838
is the day you considered
as your memorial.

412
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,540
Sometimes I think that

413
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,574
things would be different
if we all felt this way.

414
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,845
But it's not necessary

415
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,244
to include these thoughts
in your evaluations.

416
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,574
Because you are injured,

417
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,952
I'll arrange for you to
work in the com field.

418
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,714
Try to escape again,

419
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,053
And I'll kill you.

420
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,357
Where are we?

421
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,326
You wouldn't know
even ifl told you.

422
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,095
Watch your step, son.
These things have thorns.

423
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,369
Step over this.

424
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,045
Don't push!
We'll all fall.

425
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,005
Here, stand.

426
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,006
Take my hand.
Come.

427
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,585
Mom, when are we
going to see grandma?

428
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,520
Just past the taxi up
ahead and we're there.

429
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:32,029
- "Taxi"? I thought we were going by boat?
- Here, they call a canoe a taxi".

430
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,234
- How long before we're there?
- Stop asking! First mother and now son.

431
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,498
- Step over this, son.
- Watch your step.

432
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,239
Climb aboard.
Give me your bag.

433
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,178
Go on, son.
I'll lift you.

434
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,110
What's wrong?

435
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,339
I lost my sandals.

436
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,309
Get up. I'll look for it.

437
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,845
Hurry, miss.

438
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,453
Here, I found one.

439
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,055
Come on, miss.
It's just a sandal. Hurry!

440
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,649
Leave it!
It's just a sandal.

441
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,695
- It's gone. We're losing time. Gotta go.
- I can't go without my sandal.

442
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,821
Quiet.

443
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,623
It was mine.
I want it.

444
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,493
Quiet!

445
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,370
- I can't go without my sandal.
- No more!

446
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:13,436
Put on your straw hat.

447
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,405
When we're outside,
make like we're vendors.

448
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,407
Water the fruits with your hands
to make it look real.

449
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,670
- Yes.
- Please help me untie the canoe.

450
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,672
- Done?
- Let's go.

451
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,897
Let mommy take that.

452
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,632
Are you still holding on
to the sandal?

453
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,828
Crazy boy.

454
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,605
Mom, where's grandma?

455
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,604
Lai? Grandma's down here!

456
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,506
- Grandma.
- Please keep it down.

457
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,743
Make room down there.

458
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,836
- Grandma.
- Coming down!

459
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,642
Grandma was so worried.

460
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,307
- Where's your mother?
- She's up there.

461
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,848
- You her daughter?
- Yes.

462
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,648
She's been asking for you all night.

463
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,619
I'm so glad we’re all here.

464
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,021
Mai, sit over here.

465
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,981
How long have you been here?

466
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,358
We got here about an hour ago.
We took a motor canoe.

467
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,324
I thought you two had been caught.

468
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,829
Grandma.

469
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:48,956
How did that happen?

470
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,227
It got stuck in a ditch.

471
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,326
Don't worry. Grandma will
buy you a new pair.

472
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,732
Here, son, you can
wear mom’s sandal.

473
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,351
Mom.

474
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,084
Who are all these people?

475
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,381
They're also leaving.

476
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,423
No more questions.
Try to sleep.

477
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,420
Lean back on grandma, son.

478
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,431
Stay down here, brother,
until we reach the open sea.

479
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,270
- What's happening?
- The coast guards...

480
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,374
They're chasing another
group of boat people.

481
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,671
What should we do?

482
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,269
Nothing.
Listen, everyone!

483
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,109
Be very quiet.
The coast guards are very close.

484
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,185
We'll wait till it dies down,
and then we'll go.

485
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,552
Okay?

486
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,157
Sleep now.

487
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,613
Keep it down.

488
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,983
It's late. Sleep already.

489
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,389
Trai, Trai.

490
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,798
What?

491
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,636
- I'm leaving tonight.
- What? Tonight?

492
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:40,710
Yes, tonight. But Quynh says that
there's only enough money for one.

493
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,741
What? Why?

494
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,977
I don't know why.

495
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:52,789
I know I promised that we would
both get out, but now Quynh tells me

496
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,424
she doesn't have enough
money to get two people out.

497
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,389
You said it was a sure thing.

498
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:07,629
If you leave me in here now,
what is my wife and family supposed to do?

499
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,506
Please understand, my friend.

500
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,837
In these last two years,
we've been like blood brothers,

501
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,182
I beg you, please understand.

502
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:37,164
Phuong. Do you know how much
Daddy misses you?

503
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,973
Is anyone mistreating you?

504
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,009
I'm sorry I can't be there
to protect you.

505
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,936
Daddy is useless.

506
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,415
I see my mistakes now.

507
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,719
Binh.

508
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:04,422
Please deliver this photograph to my
daughter when you get to America.

509
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,524
This is the last photograph I have of her
before she escaped by boat.

510
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,158
Please tell her that

511
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,260
her father has always loved her,

512
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,098
that I think about her every day.

513
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,508
How can I deliver,
if there’s no address?

514
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,408
Please do me this last favor.

515
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,709
If you make it to America, please try.
I'll be so grateful to you.

516
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,417
- Trai, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Promise me that you'll do it, please.

517
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,847
Okay? Take care of it.

518
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,186
You. Get up!

519
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,391
- Get up! Move out!
- What are you gonna do?

520
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,327
- Get out!
- What do you want?

521
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,829
- Move!
- Where are you taking me?

522
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,304
Where are we going?

523
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,006
Where are you taking me?

524
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,611
He's running!

525
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,680
Shoot him.

526
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,283
They killed Binh as if he was a pig.

527
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,319
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'm getting out.

528
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,359
The river is our best way out.

529
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,898
The fields are better.

530
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,165
What do you have in mind?

531
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,101
Swim down the river,
they'll shoot you for sure.

532
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,640
If you go through the fields,
even their mothers won't chase you.

533
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,199
What about the unexploded mines?

534
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,615
To get to life,
you have to cross death.

535
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,741
It's too dangerous.

536
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,917
You play the odds.

537
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,359
My wife says she wants to take
the kids to visit her mother.

538
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,724
Where’s that?

539
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,526
Escape.

540
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,001
The "New Economic Zone"?

541
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,007
You know the best way
to plan an escape?

542
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,103
How?

543
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,344
You don't talk about it.

544
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,283
- Time for dinner already?
- I've had it with you.

545
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,537
Grandma.

546
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,676
- I don't feel well.
- Try to bear it, son.

547
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,483
Rub some eucalyptus
oil on, grandma.

548
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,382
Here's a towel.

549
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,251
How long have we been sailing?

550
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,627
Probably two hours, now.

551
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,689
Open the hatch!
I can't breathe.

552
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,926
Keep the hatch closed until we
are out of the harbor!

553
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,494
Try to throw up, honey.
You'll feel better afterwards.

554
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,239
- Mom, it won't come up.
- Just try, sweetie.

555
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,944
- Don't breathe the exhaust.
- Rub some oil on your nose.

556
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,308
Stick out your tongue.

557
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,179
Can I have some water?

558
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,784
Drink some water, Lai.
Drink it.

559
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,455
Go on, drink.

560
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:28,597
Just try.

561
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,792
One more sip for me.

562
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,597
- It tastes like gasoline.
- Take another sip.

563
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,806
Don't worry, honey.
Just throw up in this bag.

564
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,669
Mommy...

565
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,646
...sister threw up on my head.
- It's okay, honey, we're almost there.

566
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,024
Trai!

567
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,396
Trai, oh God! Look what
they've done.

568
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,626
Try not to move. Just look at me.

569
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,966
Trai, please look at me.

570
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,303
What do you want?

571
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,901
You want your glasses?
Hang on.

572
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,905
Here, let me put your
glasses on for you.

573
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,312
Just keep your eyes on me.
I'm putting your glasses on.

574
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:34,648
There, your glasses are on.
You'll be okay, now.

575
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,927
Who would have thought that this
camp was once a lush jungle?

576
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,664
We now produce 10 tons of
corn each harvest,

577
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,791
not to mention production
of hay and lumber.

578
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,901
My dream is to cultivate
the rest of this land.

579
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:27,100
But there's no dirt, just mines,
plagued with mines.

580
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,679
I have your friends to thank
for making that discovery.

581
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,915
There is a French philosopher

582
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,315
by the name of E.M. Cioran.

583
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,521
He published a book called,

584
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,627
"La Tentation d'Exister"
(The Temptation to Exist).

585
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,086
Do you speak French?

586
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,922
He was an existentialist.

587
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,491
His philosophy

588
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,260
is that

589
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,234
most of our discoveries

590
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,428
are the result

591
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,703
of acts of total violence.

592
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,104
Personally,

593
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,909
I don't follow existentialism.

594
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,246
But under the circumstances,

595
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,710
I think Cioran has a point.

596
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,552
After the next harvest,
I will bum the fields.

597
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,464
Since you and I share the same will,

598
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,628
I want you to lead the team of prisoners

599
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,805
who will help me clear the rest
of the unexploded mines.

600
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,344
Do you know why we won the war?

601
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,509
Because...

602
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,917
because of blind luck?

603
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,488
Faith.

604
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:50,325
We believed that we were
fighting to free Vietnam.

605
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,125
Funny.

606
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,928
At this moment,

607
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,028
I don't feel

608
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,662
the least bit free.

609
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,876
You are a prisoner of
your own ideology.

610
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:12,446
No amount of re-education will help you
understand what it means to be free.

611
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,043
Major.

612
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,416
Would you like to hear a joke?

613
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,018
What is the difference

614
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,919
between a re-education camp

615
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,722
and other prisons?

616
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,830
What's the difference?

617
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,434
In a normal prison,

618
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:41,703
you know what your crime is,
and how long your sentence lasts.

619
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,947
Do you know why people are more afraid of
Communists than they are of Death?

620
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,655
I don't know.

621
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,653
Because everyone knows

622
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,688
that communists have
no sense of humor.

623
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,985
Take him to the box.

624
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,325
DA BAN RE-EDUCATION CAMP
VIETNAM, 1981

625
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,068
Are you thirsty?
Would you like some orange?

626
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,298
Thank you.

627
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,969
Why are you by yourself?

628
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,179
My mother is in Saigon.

629
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,285
She wanted for me
to have a better future.

630
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,484
But she didn't care for herself.

631
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,015
Why is that?

632
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,328
She wants to be buried
next to my father.

633
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,126
When did he pass away?

634
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,624
Last year.

635
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,429
He died in a re-education camp.

636
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,506
We don't know where
his body his.

637
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,370
Then how will they bury
her next to him?

638
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,877
I've asked her that, too.

639
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,242
She said...

640
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,843
"I have no reason to leave. "

641
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:12,944
"If I die...

642
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,459
...then I want it to be
in my homeland. "

643
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,799
My husband also died
in a re-education camp.

644
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,328
In Suoi Mau.

645
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:35,305
They said he stepped on a mine
while working in the corn field.

646
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,912
How did your son
take the news?

647
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,242
He doesn't know.

648
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,420
With mother it’s different.

649
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,226
She refuses to believe it
in her heart.

650
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,929
She wants to see his
dead body with her own eyes.

651
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,828
Every night she cries.

652
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,672
But this family is a stubborn one.

653
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,186
Today is your lucky day.
You have a visitor.

654
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,194
Get up!

655
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,868
You don't know me,

656
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,366
But you know my husband.

657
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,332
Mr. Trai Van Le.

658
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,106
Two years ago,

659
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,542
I went to visit my husband at the
Suoi Mau Re-Education Camp.

660
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,445
They had told me then

661
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,711
that my husband was dead.

662
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,953
This is Phuong,

663
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,322
my daughter,

664
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,035
recently sent me this,
along with two letters.

665
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,803
Looking at this photograph,

666
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,639
I wonder whether my husband's spirit
had flown to America

667
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,775
to find my daughter.

668
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,015
After I read her letter,

669
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,847
I learned that my husband was still alive,

670
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,785
and living in this camp.

671
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,257
For the two days that
I was on the train.

672
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,562
I tried to imagine

673
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:46,160
what my husband must have
said to my daughter

674
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,064
each time he looked at
this photograph.

675
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,468
I cooked for him
his favorite dish,

676
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,506
Two more hours, I rode
on an ox cart to get here.

677
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,143
I hoped.

678
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:07,745
I prayed.

679
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,827
"Let me see my husband. "

680
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,221
To see his face,

681
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,565
when he eats his favorite dish

682
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,967
cooked by my own two hands.

683
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,170
The first question they asked

684
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,144
was what did I have in my bag?

685
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,246
They made me dump it out.

686
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,214
They poked at it with their guns.

687
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,817
They searched here and there.

688
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,551
At the end,

689
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,130
they took me out

690
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,533
to my husband's fresh grave.

691
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,272
They have lost their humanity.

692
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,538
- Shut your mouth!
- Oh, Trai!

693
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,637
- No crying allowed!
- What did he do?

694
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,181
- Quiet!
- What did my husband do?

695
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,545
- Shut up!
- Sit down!

696
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,050
My husband is dead.

697
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,383
- Give me back my husband!
- You, sit down!

698
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,422
Give me back my husband!

699
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,684
I'm not afraid of you.

700
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:28,993
This dish

701
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,163
I give it to you.

702
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,474
You're very lucky.

703
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,277
Your son is very smart,

704
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,109
and also very talented.

705
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,182
Keep hope alive.

706
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:43,980
I'm going now.

707
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,023
Keep hope alive.

708
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,512
"Use leaves in toilet. "

709
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,635
"Dear Dad,
I miss you very much. "

710
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,173
"Please return this book to me
when you are free. "

711
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,250
Done at last.

712
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,923
Let's hear how it sounds.

713
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,661
Check the engine!

714
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,037
- What's wrong with the engine?
- Don't know.

715
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,540
It happens all the time.

716
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,735
You can come up now.

717
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,641
- Why are we stopped?
- Is the boat broken?

718
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,805
The engine is overheated.
It needs to cool down.

719
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,942
Please let me know.
What's really going on?

720
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,216
We left from CaMau
fourteen hours ago.

721
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,587
Here is Malaysia.

722
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,421
But our boat is stuck here.

723
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,655
If we can't fix our boat,
we'll drift towards Cambodia.

724
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,390
This is the Gulf of Siam.

725
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,030
The region is filled with pirates.

726
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,897
Can we avoid it?

727
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,637
Not if we hit a storm.

728
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,072
I have to dive under
to check the motor.

729
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,441
Is Tuan helping you?

730
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,671
Tuan was caught by the police
along with the last group.

731
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,143
He didn't make it.

732
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,256
Today, Comrade Tuan, you will take
this group to clear the mine fields.

733
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,293
Yes, sir.

734
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,417
Move!

735
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:13,270
Comrade Huong, take this next group
out to clear the corn fields.

736
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,774
- Yes, sir.
- Move!

737
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,053
Stay where you are!
Don't run!

738
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,362
You'll trip the mines!
Follow the marked path!

739
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:09,931
Follow the red flags!

740
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,461
This way to the exit!

741
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,592
Slow down! Slow down!

742
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,569
This way. Go this way!

743
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,606
Thanh!

744
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,741
Long!

745
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,936
Long, are you all right?

746
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,841
Do you still have room
on your boat?

747
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,377
- Yes, yes.
- Let's go!

748
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,681
Long, keep running!

749
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,379
- Come on, let's go!
- Wait!

750
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,657
Help me with him.

751
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,021
- No way. He's a guard.
- Do it!

752
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:37,325
Down.

753
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:38,584
Down.

754
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,088
Up.

755
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,528
One. Two. Three.

756
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,723
Follow me.

757
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:46,600
Toss him up.

758
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,470
Toss him up.
One. Two. Three.

759
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:50,964
I'll go first.

760
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,585
Long, where are we going?

761
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:12,692
East.

762
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,320
Through the jungle to the fall.

763
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,590
Go this way.

764
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,003
Hurry up!

765
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,442
Long!

766
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,869
Damn it!

767
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,539
Why are you always falling?
Hurry, get up.

768
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:36,716
Put your leg down.

769
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,735
Thanh, did you hear that?

770
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:03,977
Yes.

771
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,847
Behind that bamboo patch.
I'll go check it out.

772
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,043
- I'll go with you.
- You stay here.

773
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,147
Thanh.

774
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,643
It's just an old woman.

775
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,182
No need to hide.

776
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,914
Come out here.

777
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,387
Thanh.

778
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:24,323
Thanh.

779
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,022
Where are you?

780
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,430
- Thanh.
- Long, I've got her. Long!

781
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,658
I caught her, Long!

782
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,394
Thanh, what the hell are you doing?

783
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,093
- Long, come quick!
- What are you doing?

784
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,171
- Take the knife in her basket!
- Why did you grab her?

785
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,264
Quick, the knife is in her basket!
She'll tell everyone if we let her go.

786
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,741
Lady! Listen, lady.

787
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,041
If we let you go, you can't tell anyone!

788
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,044
Long, we can't take a chance
on letting anyone know.

789
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,048
Lady!

790
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,847
Swear before heaven and Buddha
that you won't tell anyone!

791
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,355
- Let her go.
- You crazy? She'll tell everyone!

792
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,390
Let her go!

793
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,529
Do it!

794
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,361
Leave, lady.

795
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,365
Thank you. Thank you.

796
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:09,593
Are you nuts?

797
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,500
Get lost, lady!

798
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,374
Have you gone nuts?

799
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,234
Why did you grab her?

800
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,541
What were you thinking?

801
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,242
Leave already!

802
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,758
Keep it down, old man.

803
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,197
Let them shoot you in the leg
and see how you take it.

804
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,138
That's what you get.

805
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:53,743
You were really going to kill
that old woman today.

806
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,879
Let's hope she keeps her word.

807
01:07:58,183 --> 01:08:00,583
If you had killed her,
you would be just like them.

808
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,948
She's probably a communist, too.
Just you wait and see.

809
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,052
Have a banana, cry baby.

810
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:13,261
These plantains make me
think of banana desserts.

811
01:08:13,899 --> 01:08:17,062
Fried bananas...
or sticky rice and bananas.

812
01:08:20,505 --> 01:08:24,066
Here... look at what my son drew.

813
01:08:28,046 --> 01:08:29,070
That's him.

814
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:32,773
You really think you'll find them?

815
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:37,513
He drew this in America.

816
01:08:39,124 --> 01:08:42,787
No matter what happens,
I have to get this book back to my son.

817
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:56,070
Let's hope we make it
to the boat in time.

818
01:09:00,946 --> 01:09:02,709
Kill the lights, old man.

819
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,189
Take this porridge to Nam.

820
01:09:46,624 --> 01:09:48,319
- Excuse me.
- Have some porridge.

821
01:09:48,493 --> 01:09:49,824
Thank you, miss.

822
01:09:58,036 --> 01:10:02,097
Do you think that lamp is bright
enough for other boats to see us?

823
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,202
The moon is full.

824
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:08,108
Let's hope they can see us.

825
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,705
Today is already mid-August.

826
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,041
You're right.

827
01:10:13,385 --> 01:10:15,410
Today is the Moon Festival.

828
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:19,219
So much has happened,
I forgot all about it.

829
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:31,697
I remember the first time Lai's father
helped him light his first festival lantern.

830
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:36,135
I don't think I'll ever
forget these memories.

831
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:39,973
You can celebrate the
Moon Festival anywhere.

832
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:43,171
But it won't have
the same atmosphere.

833
01:10:44,716 --> 01:10:46,377
I know what you mean.

834
01:10:47,185 --> 01:10:49,449
I remember going to the temple,

835
01:10:50,422 --> 01:10:52,549
Giving thanks for the harvest,

836
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,817
- and eating sticky rice.
- With hot tea.

837
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,189
That's right.
With hot tea.

838
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,733
I wonder if the young ones
will miss Vietnam the way we do.

839
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:09,930
Lai knows that he's
leaving his homeland.

840
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:15,170
But I don't think he will ever
understand why we had to leave.

841
01:11:15,914 --> 01:11:17,279
Sleep now, Sun.

842
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,444
Wake up, Lai.

843
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,352
Have some porridge.

844
01:11:24,622 --> 01:11:25,816
Miss Phuong.

845
01:11:25,957 --> 01:11:27,254
Please have some porridge.

846
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:28,324
Thank you.

847
01:11:46,044 --> 01:11:46,976
What was that?

848
01:11:47,078 --> 01:11:48,272
- What was that?
- What just happened?

849
01:11:48,379 --> 01:11:50,279
Get down!
Everyone, get down.

850
01:11:56,454 --> 01:11:58,752
- Hurry, Mai. Run away!
- Mother!

851
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:02,892
- I beg you, please.
- Spare me, please!

852
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,423
- Mom!
- My baby!

853
01:12:06,131 --> 01:12:06,722
Mommy!

854
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:09,228
My baby! My baby!

855
01:12:11,169 --> 01:12:11,863
Mai!

856
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,834
Mom!

857
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:13,495
Let me go!

858
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:18,607
Go! Run!

859
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,678
Go this way, Sun!
Run away! Run!

860
01:12:20,812 --> 01:12:21,642
Mai!

861
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:22,542
Let her go!

862
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:24,214
Get off me! Get off!

863
01:12:24,782 --> 01:12:25,806
Hands off!

864
01:12:27,118 --> 01:12:28,016
Mai!

865
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:29,586
What have I done?

866
01:12:30,588 --> 01:12:32,385
Please, please. I beg you!

867
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:42,090
I have nothing! Nothing!

868
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:45,561
Let him go!

869
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:48,197
Leave him alone!

870
01:12:51,476 --> 01:12:52,170
No!

871
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:52,876
Sun!

872
01:12:53,645 --> 01:12:54,443
Sun!

873
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,012
No! I beg of you!

874
01:13:03,154 --> 01:13:04,178
I beg you!

875
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:11,896
Oh God, no!

876
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,291
Please, God!
Don't let them take my daughter!

877
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:15,692
Don't take her away!

878
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,889
My baby!

879
01:13:18,903 --> 01:13:20,336
Take me! Not her!

880
01:13:21,639 --> 01:13:24,301
Let go! Let go of me!

881
01:13:26,044 --> 01:13:26,840
Let go!

882
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:28,976
Don't touch me!

883
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:31,741
Phuong!

884
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,017
Let me go!

885
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,217
Mai!

886
01:13:36,988 --> 01:13:37,818
Phoung!

887
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:39,916
Phuong!

888
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:40,786
Mai!

889
01:13:40,892 --> 01:13:41,654
Mai!

890
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:42,985
Mai!

891
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,052
Phuong!

892
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:51,527
Open this lid!
I want my daughter, Hong!

893
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:54,869
Hong! Hong!

894
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:56,796
My daughter!

895
01:13:57,709 --> 01:13:59,939
Hong!
Give me back my baby girl!

896
01:14:07,118 --> 01:14:10,281
Hong! Hong!
Don't leave me!

897
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,163
Long.

898
01:16:15,213 --> 01:16:16,202
Long!

899
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:19,549
Are you okay, Long?

900
01:16:24,389 --> 01:16:25,879
What do we do now?

901
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:27,685
You see that rock?

902
01:16:27,825 --> 01:16:28,757
Yes.

903
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,088
We have to make it past that.

904
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:31,995
It's too rocky.

905
01:16:33,398 --> 01:16:37,459
If you lose your footing, cover your head,
and let the current take you out.

906
01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:39,366
- Okay.
- Play the odds!

907
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,002
- Play on!
- Go!

908
01:17:26,651 --> 01:17:28,016
Find them!

909
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,618
Is this him?

910
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:43,484
Is this him?

911
01:19:14,425 --> 01:19:19,522
And so it was that the great General
Le Lai sacrificed his life to save Le Loi.

912
01:19:20,731 --> 01:19:24,565
As promised, the emperor
escaped the mountains alive.

913
01:19:27,004 --> 01:19:31,304
This time, Le Loi would not forget
his promise to the great turtle god.

914
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:36,545
But first, he had a war to finish.

915
01:19:44,922 --> 01:19:48,050
ORANGE COUNTY
USA, 1981

916
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,546
Why were you fighting
With those boys?

917
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:25,748
Because they called me a bastard.

918
01:21:25,856 --> 01:21:28,450
Pay no attention to them.
You have a father.

919
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:29,555
Grandma?

920
01:21:29,794 --> 01:21:32,024
How long will father be in prison?

921
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,461
Grandma doesn't know.

922
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:35,294
Well then, do you think
he misses us?

923
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:36,799
Of course he does.

924
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:40,700
Every time he receives a letter or sees
Your drawings he thinks about you.

925
01:21:40,838 --> 01:21:42,965
Then how come he
doesn't write back?

926
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:45,800
Like grandma said before.

927
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,104
He's not allowed to write
letters in prison.

928
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:51,544
What if we waited all this time,
and they never let him out?

929
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,184
Son.

930
01:21:56,353 --> 01:22:00,653
Even if they keep him there forever,
will you ever forget about him?

931
01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:04,383
No.

932
01:22:06,397 --> 01:22:08,695
Then he will never forget
about you.

933
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:11,665
Grandma?

934
01:22:11,902 --> 01:22:14,803
Don't tell mom about
what happened today okay?

935
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:18,500
I won't tell,

936
01:22:19,009 --> 01:22:21,534
if you promise to keep
our letters a secret.

937
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,407
Okay.

938
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,913
- Promise?
- Promise.

939
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:33,847
Lai!

940
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:35,514
No shoes in the house!

941
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:38,819
Mommy.

942
01:23:40,457 --> 01:23:41,617
- I'm here.
- Oh?

943
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:43,555
You're home early tonight.

944
01:23:44,295 --> 01:23:47,389
Today is a holiday,
so they let us out early.

945
01:23:48,432 --> 01:23:49,660
What happened here?

946
01:23:49,767 --> 01:23:50,699
Nothing.

947
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:53,997
What's going on?

948
01:24:03,347 --> 01:24:04,609
Your hair is too long.

949
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,079
I'll take you to get
it cut tomorrow.

950
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,311
Don't you have school tomorrow, mom?

951
01:24:08,652 --> 01:24:09,550
I do.

952
01:24:09,854 --> 01:24:11,617
Afterwards, I'll take you.

953
01:24:12,156 --> 01:24:13,145
Sleep, now.

954
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:14,291
Mom?

955
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:17,260
Can you leave the light on?

956
01:27:42,599 --> 01:27:45,966
Starting next week,
Nam will pick Lai up from school.

957
01:27:48,172 --> 01:27:50,766
I have arranged for Lai to stay
with him until he gets off work.

958
01:27:50,874 --> 01:27:52,808
That's not convenient for Nam.

959
01:27:53,343 --> 01:27:55,675
It's better for Lai to have
someone look after him.

960
01:27:55,913 --> 01:27:57,574
But I am looking after him.

961
01:28:00,017 --> 01:28:01,484
Have you seen his face?

962
01:28:01,552 --> 01:28:04,680
How can I let you take care of him
if you hide things from me?

963
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:06,583
I didn't want you to worry.

964
01:28:06,723 --> 01:28:07,849
Why not, mother?

965
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:11,853
I'm his mother. If he's hurt,
then of course I should worry.

966
01:28:12,062 --> 01:28:14,292
I don't understand why
you keep things from me.

967
01:28:14,364 --> 01:28:16,559
I understand him.
You don't understand him!

968
01:28:16,733 --> 01:28:18,064
You're never home!

969
01:28:22,573 --> 01:28:24,234
What I meant to say is...

970
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:26,641
that you work till very late.

971
01:28:29,746 --> 01:28:31,179
He's still growing.

972
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:33,680
He needs his father around.

973
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:45,050
Miss Mai?

974
01:28:48,132 --> 01:28:49,030
Phuong?

975
01:28:51,435 --> 01:28:52,868
Phuong, is it you?

976
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:54,435
Mai.

977
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:56,897
Miss Phuong.

978
01:28:59,243 --> 01:29:00,437
Phuong.

979
01:29:02,846 --> 01:29:04,507
I can't believe it's you.

980
01:29:48,525 --> 01:29:50,720
It's been so long since
I've had Vietnamese crepes.

981
01:29:50,794 --> 01:29:52,386
I can't find the ingredients here.

982
01:29:52,462 --> 01:29:54,331
I have to buy green beans
and grind my own flour.

983
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,127
Mai?

984
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,860
How did you end up in California?

985
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,195
We were sponsored by
a Christian Coalition.

986
01:29:59,403 --> 01:30:02,429
Actually... it was Nam
who brought us to California.

987
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,866
- Nam, our boat captain?
- Yes, that's right.

988
01:30:05,142 --> 01:30:07,303
We were supposed to
go to Virginia.

989
01:30:07,644 --> 01:30:09,373
But we were scared Grandma
couldn't handle the cold.

990
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,413
Forget it.

991
01:30:10,547 --> 01:30:12,208
California is the best place,
you know.

992
01:30:12,349 --> 01:30:14,180
Otherwise I wouldn't
have seen you again.

993
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:15,984
You should thank Buddha.

994
01:30:16,153 --> 01:30:19,020
It makes me so happy
to see your bright face.

995
01:30:20,424 --> 01:30:22,289
When we first got to America,

996
01:30:22,492 --> 01:30:24,153
Grandma wanted to
become a Buddhist nun.

997
01:30:24,228 --> 01:30:27,595
She believes that it was Buddha
that rescued us from the boat.

998
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:29,561
You should know this by now.

999
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,032
On the boat people prayed
to any and every god,

1000
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:33,533
just to stay alive.

1001
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,104
Actually...

1002
01:30:35,172 --> 01:30:37,663
For us to have survived
what happened on the boat,

1003
01:30:37,774 --> 01:30:39,298
was surely an act of Buddha.

1004
01:30:39,409 --> 01:30:41,536
Why couldn't it have been
a stroke of luck?

1005
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:44,079
Because living without faith
is just as good as being dead.

1006
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:45,978
I believe that Mai has faith.

1007
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:48,641
You just haven't
found it yet, right Mai?

1008
01:30:49,353 --> 01:30:51,378
Over here they have
an expression.

1009
01:30:51,955 --> 01:30:54,515
If you're missing anything,
you'll find it at the mall.

1010
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:55,216
Whatever.

1011
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:56,519
What are you laughing at?

1012
01:30:56,593 --> 01:30:57,719
You ride the horsey.

1013
01:30:57,794 --> 01:31:00,820
- Your mom and I will go shopping.
- How nice for you.

1014
01:31:02,799 --> 01:31:06,394
How did you manage to adapt
to this new life in just one year?

1015
01:31:06,803 --> 01:31:08,600
My fourth uncle helped
me out a lot.

1016
01:31:08,705 --> 01:31:10,036
How long has
he been in America?

1017
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,468
Since 1974.

1018
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:13,832
He taught me something.

1019
01:31:14,211 --> 01:31:17,510
If you want to make a new life
for yourself in America,

1020
01:31:17,648 --> 01:31:20,378
then you have to abandon
all of your past.

1021
01:31:22,819 --> 01:31:24,218
According to my uncle,

1022
01:31:24,921 --> 01:31:26,183
This is Vietnam.

1023
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,218
Crepes are ready!

1024
01:31:30,427 --> 01:31:32,019
Oh, that smells so good!

1025
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,661
What smells like crepes?

1026
01:31:40,904 --> 01:31:42,428
He's got a sharp nose.

1027
01:31:47,577 --> 01:31:48,236
What?

1028
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,870
Is that you, Phuong?

1029
01:31:52,749 --> 01:31:53,773
Hello, Nam.

1030
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:56,981
What’s that?

1031
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:58,214
Hold on a minute.

1032
01:31:59,022 --> 01:32:00,683
Hold on. There's more.

1033
01:32:01,158 --> 01:32:02,125
Fish sauce.

1034
01:32:04,027 --> 01:32:05,153
Where did you get that?

1035
01:32:05,262 --> 01:32:06,729
Let's test this out.

1036
01:32:13,003 --> 01:32:14,800
This is my favorite song.

1037
01:32:15,005 --> 01:32:18,372
Gosh, who would have thought
that you were so romantic?

1038
01:32:20,811 --> 01:32:21,971
Eat while it's hot, Phuong.

1039
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:23,842
Yes. Thank you, grandma.

1040
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,819
"Let's not fool ourselves. "

1041
01:32:32,856 --> 01:32:38,488
"Speak not of love when we're alone. "

1042
01:32:38,695 --> 01:32:42,654
"Let's not fool ourselves. "

1043
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:48,565
"Who knows where this love will go?"

1044
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:52,674
"Let's just hide our souls,

1045
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:58,313
"and not let hope make drunks of us. "

1046
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:02,812
"Let our shoulders touch,

1047
01:33:02,986 --> 01:33:05,511
"and know it's just

1048
01:33:06,323 --> 01:33:09,121
"... a dream. "

1049
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:48,887
Lai, take this plate of vegetables
to the table for grandma.

1050
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:51,091
Later, grandma. I'm drawing.

1051
01:34:51,661 --> 01:34:52,719
Drawing what?

1052
01:34:53,163 --> 01:34:54,130
A picture.

1053
01:34:54,664 --> 01:34:55,790
What picture?

1054
01:34:56,433 --> 01:34:58,333
- One from a story.
- Which story?

1055
01:34:59,002 --> 01:34:59,969
From...

1056
01:35:01,938 --> 01:35:03,667
I'll show you when I'm done.

1057
01:35:04,508 --> 01:35:05,600
That boy...

1058
01:35:34,504 --> 01:35:35,471
Hungry?

1059
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,183
- Cold?
- All day.

1060
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,814
- After you.
- Chopsticks, please.

1061
01:36:32,929 --> 01:36:34,396
Have some ribs.

1062
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:14,096
Let's go, son.
You okay?

1063
01:37:19,009 --> 01:37:19,771
Who is it?

1064
01:37:19,843 --> 01:37:20,867
Time to eat.

1065
01:37:20,977 --> 01:37:22,569
Okay. Give me a second.

1066
01:37:27,283 --> 01:37:28,250
What are you making?

1067
01:37:28,351 --> 01:37:30,114
I'm making turtles, uncle.

1068
01:37:30,654 --> 01:37:32,087
Who taught you to make
it so nice?

1069
01:37:32,155 --> 01:37:33,417
I taught myself.

1070
01:37:33,757 --> 01:37:36,123
Let's see what grandma
made us for lunch.

1071
01:37:37,293 --> 01:37:38,954
Wow!
Sauteed catfish.

1072
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,662
Your mom said that grandma used to
run a rice stand in front of the house.

1073
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:44,663
Yep.

1074
01:37:44,801 --> 01:37:48,237
I used to wake up early every
morning and watch her cook.

1075
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:49,770
I bet she's a good cook.

1076
01:37:49,839 --> 01:37:50,737
Yep.

1077
01:37:51,775 --> 01:37:53,072
- Uncle Nam?
- What, son?

1078
01:37:53,143 --> 01:37:54,735
Do you know a lot
about Vietnam?

1079
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:56,005
Of course I do.

1080
01:37:56,946 --> 01:37:59,608
Then, do you know about
the legend of Le Loi?

1081
01:37:59,816 --> 01:38:01,545
What Vietnamese person
doesn't know it?

1082
01:38:01,618 --> 01:38:03,882
That’s the legend about
the lake in Hanoi.

1083
01:38:03,987 --> 01:38:05,352
There's really a lake?

1084
01:38:05,422 --> 01:38:07,390
Yeah. That's the place
where Le Loi...

1085
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:10,017
returned the sword
after he became emperor.

1086
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:13,187
That's why the lake is called,
"Lake of the Restored Sword. "

1087
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:17,095
But I thought Le Loi forgot
to return the sword.

1088
01:38:18,134 --> 01:38:19,431
Who told you that?

1089
01:38:19,536 --> 01:38:20,594
Grandma told me.

1090
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,237
That's not how I heard it.

1091
01:38:22,305 --> 01:38:25,741
But did grandma tell you
how the sword was returned?

1092
01:38:25,975 --> 01:38:26,942
No.

1093
01:38:27,043 --> 01:38:27,975
Here's how it goes.

1094
01:38:28,078 --> 01:38:30,706
This is after Le Loi had driven
the Chinese out of Vietnam.

1095
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,440
One night as he was
crossing the lake,

1096
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:35,374
Suddenly, the sword...

1097
01:38:35,852 --> 01:38:38,184
inside the scabbard,
started to rattle and shake.

1098
01:38:38,321 --> 01:38:40,721
Then it shot. ZIP!
Straight into the sky.

1099
01:38:41,157 --> 01:38:44,217
At that moment, a giant turtle
came up from the water.

1100
01:38:44,561 --> 01:38:47,394
It opened its mouth, snatched
the sword and dove under.

1101
01:38:47,564 --> 01:38:48,428
Wow!

1102
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:49,725
Have you ever been there?

1103
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,132
No. Never.

1104
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:53,101
Don't you want to see
the sword and the lake?

1105
01:38:53,203 --> 01:38:54,192
It's just a story.

1106
01:38:54,304 --> 01:38:55,965
Grandma says it's real.

1107
01:38:56,372 --> 01:38:59,068
Obviously, your grandma
knows more than I do.

1108
01:38:59,909 --> 01:39:00,466
All right.

1109
01:39:00,543 --> 01:39:01,676
I have to get back
to work, now.

1110
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:03,110
Remember to save some
of the sauteed fish for me.

1111
01:39:03,179 --> 01:39:04,544
- Uncle Nam?
- What, son?

1112
01:39:04,614 --> 01:39:06,013
Thank you.
For this afternoon.

1113
01:39:06,082 --> 01:39:07,242
It was nothing.

1114
01:39:09,419 --> 01:39:10,386
Should I close the door?

1115
01:39:10,453 --> 01:39:11,442
Yes, please.

1116
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,349
Watch your feet.

1117
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:14,479
Yep.

1118
01:39:22,966 --> 01:39:23,660
Grandma.

1119
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:24,959
What, son?

1120
01:39:25,034 --> 01:39:27,025
What do you think
about uncle Nam?

1121
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,566
Uncle Nam is a good person.

1122
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:31,904
It's thanks to him that
we are now in America.

1123
01:39:31,975 --> 01:39:32,942
Yep.

1124
01:39:33,643 --> 01:39:34,905
I like him, too.

1125
01:39:35,578 --> 01:39:36,840
Have you written to
your father, yet?

1126
01:39:36,913 --> 01:39:38,642
Yes. Let me get it.

1127
01:39:38,882 --> 01:39:40,372
No shoes in the house!

1128
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,548
That boy is impossible.

1129
01:39:43,386 --> 01:39:44,546
Here, grandma.

1130
01:40:00,136 --> 01:40:02,798
Is this when Le Lai and Le Loi
are trapped in the mountains?

1131
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:04,668
Yes, it is.
Do you like it?

1132
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:05,673
I do.

1133
01:40:05,809 --> 01:40:07,572
And so will your father
when he receives it.

1134
01:40:07,644 --> 01:40:09,077
I'll send it tomorrow, okay?

1135
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:10,111
Yep.

1136
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:14,074
Grandma.

1137
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:14,707
What?

1138
01:40:14,818 --> 01:40:15,785
Two cans.

1139
01:40:16,753 --> 01:40:17,378
One more?

1140
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,179
Yep.

1141
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:19,288
Two cans?

1142
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:20,318
Two cans.

1143
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:21,082
Oh, boy.

1144
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:20,177
- Grandma!
- Sit down, son.

1145
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:21,275
Lai!

1146
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:22,543
Grandma.

1147
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:23,752
Step up, son.

1148
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,811
Phuong, this is too scary.

1149
01:41:26,155 --> 01:41:28,646
- Mom, let's race.
- No, I'm getting dizzy.

1150
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:31,419
Phuong. Mai. Smile!

1151
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:34,452
Hold on tight for me.

1152
01:41:35,398 --> 01:41:36,330
Grandma!

1153
01:41:36,432 --> 01:41:37,626
Look up! Look up.

1154
01:41:38,735 --> 01:41:42,535
- Phuong, how do I make it stop?
- It won't stop for a while.

1155
01:41:44,641 --> 01:41:45,665
Sit proper.

1156
01:41:48,778 --> 01:41:51,406
- Lai, come out for some photos.
- Come out, son.

1157
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:52,172
Grandma.

1158
01:41:52,248 --> 01:41:53,545
- Did you have fun?
- Sure did.

1159
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,675
This way. This way for photos.

1160
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,113
- Mai. Phuong. Let's take some photos.
- Okay.

1161
01:41:59,255 --> 01:42:01,621
Okay. Go this way.
That's right.

1162
01:42:02,692 --> 01:42:05,525
- You weren't dizzy?
- Okay, sit right here.

1163
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:09,223
Grandma sits here.
Mai and Phuong sit here.

1164
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:11,631
Yes, that's right.

1165
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:14,098
All righty, then.
Let's take some pictures.

1166
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,263
Phuong, scoot over.
That's right.

1167
01:42:16,472 --> 01:42:18,906
Lai, sit up.
Everyone look forward.

1168
01:42:19,409 --> 01:42:20,671
Mai, it's a photo.

1169
01:42:20,777 --> 01:42:23,746
Smile for the camera.
One. Two.

1170
01:42:25,548 --> 01:42:26,378
One.

1171
01:42:26,582 --> 01:42:27,571
Two.

1172
01:42:28,051 --> 01:42:29,018
Three!

1173
01:42:30,053 --> 01:42:31,748
Mom, mom. Let's go again.

1174
01:42:32,255 --> 01:42:34,587
- I've got a headache.
- Here, I'll take you.

1175
01:42:34,657 --> 01:42:35,988
- We can take more pictures.
- Grandma, grandma.

1176
01:42:36,059 --> 01:42:38,527
- Let's go play.
- Okay, but I'll wait outside.

1177
01:42:38,995 --> 01:42:41,964
- Okay, we'll stay here.
- Yes, don't go anywhere.

1178
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,333
- Oh, boy. My head hurts.
- Just rest here for a bit.

1179
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:47,528
I need an aspirin
or something.

1180
01:42:48,771 --> 01:42:50,238
Hi there.
What a cute girl!

1181
01:42:50,306 --> 01:42:51,330
Hello, miss.

1182
01:42:54,744 --> 01:42:55,802
Excuse me.

1183
01:42:56,212 --> 01:42:58,407
But is your name Phuong?

1184
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:03,981
- Do you know this man?
- No.

1185
01:43:05,321 --> 01:43:07,084
My name is Binh Loc Hoang.

1186
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:09,956
Is your name Phuong Van Le?

1187
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:13,760
Grandpa, let's go.

1188
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:17,127
Give grandpa a minute.
He needs to talk to this lady.

1189
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:19,836
Afterwards, I'll take you
out to play, okay?

1190
01:43:19,871 --> 01:43:20,996
Okay.

1191
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,203
The person in the photograph.
Is it you?

1192
01:43:33,483 --> 01:43:35,451
Where did you get this?

1193
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:38,176
Are you the one in the photo?

1194
01:43:42,225 --> 01:43:45,661
My mother took this
before I left for Can Tho.

1195
01:43:46,295 --> 01:43:47,694
Why do you have it?

1196
01:43:48,965 --> 01:43:50,227
Praise Buddha.

1197
01:43:52,035 --> 01:43:58,031
That I have found you today,
in the name of your father.

1198
01:43:59,909 --> 01:44:05,973
I have carried this photograph
around for almost two years.

1199
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:11,512
But today, I finally get
to meet you face to face.

1200
01:44:12,822 --> 01:44:13,789
I was...

1201
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:19,423
I was in the Da Ban
re-education camp with your father,

1202
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:20,922
Trai Van Le.

1203
01:44:21,931 --> 01:44:24,058
My father was never at Da Ban.

1204
01:44:24,934 --> 01:44:26,424
He died at Suoi Mau.

1205
01:44:26,536 --> 01:44:28,060
No. No he didn't.

1206
01:44:29,005 --> 01:44:34,136
They transferred your father and I,
all of us to Da Ban in the night.

1207
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:38,339
Your father had asked me...
to find you,

1208
01:44:39,449 --> 01:44:41,781
and deliver this photograph.

1209
01:44:42,018 --> 01:44:43,007
Your father...

1210
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:46,247
always loved you,
and every night,

1211
01:44:47,123 --> 01:44:51,526
he would look at
this photo, and cry.

1212
01:44:52,228 --> 01:44:53,126
Phuong.

1213
01:44:53,229 --> 01:44:56,062
You are your father’s
only reason for living.

1214
01:44:56,532 --> 01:44:57,499
Don't...

1215
01:44:58,501 --> 01:45:00,731
don't ever forget that.

1216
01:45:35,338 --> 01:45:36,896
My uncle was wrong.

1217
01:45:39,342 --> 01:45:42,675
How can I ever accept
that America is my homeland,

1218
01:45:43,112 --> 01:45:46,047
when my mother and father
are still in Vietnam?

1219
01:45:46,616 --> 01:45:48,174
I have a past, Mai.

1220
01:45:52,522 --> 01:45:55,286
Do you know that...
when I was taken that night,

1221
01:45:55,758 --> 01:45:57,623
I almost went crazy.

1222
01:45:59,962 --> 01:46:01,657
But I thought of my mother.

1223
01:46:01,764 --> 01:46:05,222
I thought of my mother,
and prayed to my father's spirit

1224
01:46:06,202 --> 01:46:08,466
for the strength to endure.

1225
01:46:18,114 --> 01:46:22,915
You should write your mother,
so that she can visit your father.

1226
01:46:24,287 --> 01:46:26,812
I know that he would
want to hear from you.

1227
01:46:31,794 --> 01:46:32,818
Mai,

1228
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:35,523
if my father was
transferred to Da Ban,

1229
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,761
Do you think that your husband
could also be there?

1230
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:49,937
I thought about that, when I heard
the news about your father.

1231
01:46:57,353 --> 01:47:01,255
Would you like me to send
word along with my mother?

1232
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:13,196
Don't say anything
to my mother and Lai.

1233
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,108
At least for the time being.

1234
01:47:24,914 --> 01:47:25,881
Sure.

1235
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:28,230
I'll wait for you outside.

1236
01:50:21,457 --> 01:50:23,721
I need your advice on something.

1237
01:50:24,293 --> 01:50:25,317
What is it?

1238
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,230
I think Long is still alive.

1239
01:50:32,301 --> 01:50:33,768
Why do you think so?

1240
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:38,103
It's a feeling I have.

1241
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:42,041
Have you told
Lai and Ba Noi, yet?

1242
01:50:46,248 --> 01:50:48,307
That's what I find difficult.

1243
01:50:50,486 --> 01:50:52,886
I don't think it’s that difficult.

1244
01:50:53,222 --> 01:50:55,656
Ba Noi and Lai need
to know about this.

1245
01:50:56,358 --> 01:50:57,382
But I have no proof.

1246
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,391
I don't want to tell them.

1247
01:51:00,896 --> 01:51:02,591
That would be false hope.

1248
01:51:05,734 --> 01:51:08,430
My mother passed away
when I was only fourteen.

1249
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:12,366
At that time my father
was a fisherman.

1250
01:51:13,175 --> 01:51:16,338
After she passed away,
he lost all his spirit.

1251
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:20,538
What happened to him?

1252
01:51:21,317 --> 01:51:23,342
Because he loved her so much,

1253
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:26,180
he lost the will to do anything.

1254
01:51:27,122 --> 01:51:30,455
I had one younger brother,
and four little sisters.

1255
01:51:31,293 --> 01:51:34,626
Suddenly, I had to become both
mother and father to them.

1256
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:36,694
How is your father now?

1257
01:51:36,966 --> 01:51:39,332
He's been living
in his own world,

1258
01:51:39,568 --> 01:51:41,297
ever since she died.

1259
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:49,402
You have to find Long.

1260
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:18,452
Why aren't you playing outside?

1261
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:24,824
Did something happen at school?

1262
01:54:34,476 --> 01:54:36,341
You like playing with these?

1263
01:54:50,225 --> 01:54:52,022
I have something for you.

1264
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:31,633
Wait.

1265
01:55:32,401 --> 01:55:33,425
Wait a bit.

1266
01:55:39,041 --> 01:55:41,100
Kim Quy has to have a sword.

1267
01:56:08,904 --> 01:56:09,871
Let's eat.

1268
01:56:12,341 --> 01:56:15,139
Wonder what grandma
cooked for us today.

1269
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,735
Yum.
Pork in coconut juice.

1270
01:56:48,377 --> 01:56:48,934
Oh.

1271
01:56:49,011 --> 01:56:50,444
You're still home?

1272
01:56:50,913 --> 01:56:52,107
What is this?

1273
01:56:52,781 --> 01:56:54,612
Why is Lai writing
to his father?

1274
01:56:54,683 --> 01:56:56,241
I needed to give him hope.

1275
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:57,716
To ease his mind.

1276
01:56:58,153 --> 01:56:59,620
By writing to a dead person?

1277
01:56:59,688 --> 01:57:01,417
- Long is not dead.
- How do you know?

1278
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:03,859
If you don't know,
then don't confuse him with hope.

1279
01:57:03,894 --> 01:57:06,020
Giving him hope
is not a bad thing.

1280
01:57:06,161 --> 01:57:07,856
If you knew Long was alive,

1281
01:57:07,996 --> 01:57:09,520
wouldn't you tell me?

1282
01:57:09,998 --> 01:57:12,057
I need hope to live, too!

1283
01:57:13,302 --> 01:57:15,827
Your way of giving hope
is harmful to him.

1284
01:57:17,539 --> 01:57:19,006
I don't think so.

1285
01:57:20,309 --> 01:57:23,710
I would do anything in this world
to protect this family.

1286
01:57:24,112 --> 01:57:25,545
You're wrong.

1287
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:30,108
You don't know the harm
that you're doing to him.

1288
01:57:31,687 --> 01:57:33,052
I am his mother.

1289
01:57:33,689 --> 01:57:36,351
I cannot let anyone
harm him like this.

1290
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:40,891
You are no mother
to my grandson.

1291
01:57:41,797 --> 01:57:45,426
A stone has more warmth
than what you have shown him.

1292
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:48,060
Since the day we were rescued,

1293
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:49,797
you have been nothing
but cold to him.

1294
01:57:49,905 --> 01:57:53,898
Do you know how his mind is affected
having to grow up without his father?

1295
01:57:54,142 --> 01:57:56,702
If I knew where my son was,

1296
01:57:57,045 --> 01:58:01,311
I would cross jungles and mountains
and cut my feet to find him.

1297
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,348
I would hand these letters
to him myself.

1298
01:58:06,255 --> 01:58:07,279
If he is dead,

1299
01:58:07,422 --> 01:58:10,289
I would burn these letters
at his altar for him.

1300
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,625
That is the pain of my womb.

1301
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:16,954
That is a mother’s love,
do you understand?

1302
01:58:25,774 --> 01:58:26,934
Grandma.

1303
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:29,142
Son.

1304
01:58:29,745 --> 01:58:31,372
What’s the matter here?

1305
01:58:31,513 --> 01:58:32,639
What's wrong, grandma?

1306
01:58:32,814 --> 01:58:34,338
Do you know about this?

1307
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:36,249
He hasn't been in school
for the last three days.

1308
01:58:36,351 --> 01:58:37,613
Where did he go?

1309
01:58:38,954 --> 01:58:40,046
Is this true?

1310
01:58:40,455 --> 01:58:42,218
Why didn't you tell grandma?

1311
01:58:42,357 --> 01:58:43,324
Lai.

1312
01:58:43,959 --> 01:58:46,018
Are you hiding things from me?

1313
01:58:52,367 --> 01:58:53,459
I hate you.

1314
01:58:54,937 --> 01:58:55,995
Don't shame your mother.

1315
01:58:56,138 --> 01:58:57,036
Why not?

1316
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:58,662
Isn't that what you wanted?

1317
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,002
It's not her fault.

1318
01:59:00,075 --> 01:59:01,201
Then whose is it?

1319
01:59:01,276 --> 01:59:02,140
It's your fault.

1320
01:59:02,244 --> 01:59:04,405
You're never at home
when I need you.

1321
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:05,070
Quiet!

1322
01:59:05,213 --> 01:59:07,443
You don't care about
me or grandma,

1323
01:59:07,649 --> 01:59:09,344
or care if dad is
alive or dead.

1324
01:59:09,584 --> 01:59:10,243
Enough!

1325
01:59:10,552 --> 01:59:11,951
I said that's enough.

1326
01:59:12,587 --> 01:59:13,754
Why are you hitting me?

1327
01:59:13,789 --> 01:59:16,917
You, yourself said that
mom doesn't think about dad.

1328
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:19,554
Ever since we got to America,

1329
01:59:19,661 --> 01:59:22,596
you've never asked about
or said anything about dad.

1330
01:59:22,731 --> 01:59:24,631
All you care about
is uncle Nam.

1331
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,367
How can you say that?

1332
01:59:27,302 --> 01:59:29,566
Uncle Nam has treated us
like his own family.

1333
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:30,694
With you,

1334
01:59:30,939 --> 01:59:32,907
he has treated you
like his own son.

1335
01:59:32,975 --> 01:59:34,237
I am not his son.

1336
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:36,402
And he is not my father.

1337
01:59:37,312 --> 01:59:39,712
My father is still alive
in a prison in Vietnam,

1338
01:59:39,915 --> 01:59:41,780
and you act as if he’s dead.

1339
01:59:41,984 --> 01:59:42,951
Shut up!

1340
01:59:43,685 --> 01:59:45,175
Just shut your mouth!

1341
01:59:45,887 --> 01:59:49,584
Do you know what I've been through
to be with this family today?

1342
01:59:50,325 --> 01:59:52,350
Do you think your mother
is still alive?

1343
01:59:52,427 --> 01:59:53,758
She's dead already.

1344
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:55,021
Dead already!

1345
01:59:56,098 --> 01:59:58,396
I died the day
they took your father.

1346
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:02,969
I died again out on
that ocean, Lai.

1347
02:00:05,807 --> 02:00:08,241
This person you call
your mother,

1348
02:00:08,643 --> 02:00:09,803
is nothing but a corpse,

1349
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,902
living only to take care of you.

1350
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:14,640
But your real mother
is already dead, son.

1351
02:00:14,816 --> 02:00:16,044
I hope you know.

1352
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:18,450
She's dead, son.

1353
02:00:56,591 --> 02:00:58,058
When you were three,

1354
02:00:59,094 --> 02:01:01,494
your father had just
returned from war,

1355
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:05,365
and you had just finished
making your first kite.

1356
02:01:06,034 --> 02:01:08,366
Our whole family went out to fly it.

1357
02:01:09,171 --> 02:01:11,230
The kite soared real high.

1358
02:01:12,674 --> 02:01:15,199
Then we made
little paper circles,

1359
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:18,036
that we wrote our wishes on

1360
02:01:18,346 --> 02:01:20,610
and attached to the kite string.

1361
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:25,213
We watched as the circles
went up into the sky.

1362
02:01:27,722 --> 02:01:30,213
But afterwards,
something happened.

1363
02:01:31,626 --> 02:01:34,094
We were so busy
doing our own things,

1364
02:01:34,729 --> 02:01:37,425
that we forgot you were
still flying the kite.

1365
02:01:39,468 --> 02:01:42,198
We didn't notice until
we heard your cry.

1366
02:01:44,206 --> 02:01:46,037
I didn't know where you were,

1367
02:01:46,274 --> 02:01:48,071
or what happened to you.

1368
02:01:51,847 --> 02:01:54,213
That waste scariest
moment of my life.

1369
02:01:58,153 --> 02:01:59,586
I promised myself,

1370
02:02:00,989 --> 02:02:02,217
that ifl found you,

1371
02:02:02,290 --> 02:02:05,851
I would never, ever let you
out of my sight again.

1372
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:12,633
I'm sorry.

1373
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:15,969
I'm sorry I haven't
been there for you.

1374
02:02:17,606 --> 02:02:19,005
But I promise you,

1375
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:24,872
from now on,
I will always be there.

1376
02:03:40,422 --> 02:03:42,322
Everyone stay calm
until I get to you.

1377
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:44,153
Children and the elderly first.

1378
02:03:44,226 --> 02:03:45,716
Slowly. Children first.

1379
02:03:46,561 --> 02:03:48,222
Injured. Anyone injured?

1380
02:03:48,997 --> 02:03:50,430
Careful, we have an injured here.

1381
02:03:50,498 --> 02:03:52,022
Careful. She's badly burned.

1382
02:03:52,167 --> 02:03:53,361
Please be gentle.

1383
02:03:53,802 --> 02:03:55,133
Be very gentle.

1384
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:56,794
Be gentle. She's in a lot of pain.

1385
02:03:56,871 --> 02:03:58,338
Bring her up. Bring her up.

1386
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:00,135
Careful! She's really badly burned.

1387
02:04:00,242 --> 02:04:01,470
Slowly! Slowly!

1388
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:07,240
Legend has it that Le Loi
returned the sword,

1389
02:04:07,616 --> 02:04:10,517
but it makes no mention
of the emperor's loss,

1390
02:04:10,885 --> 02:04:13,353
and of Le Lai's great sacrifice.

1391
02:04:14,956 --> 02:04:17,356
Though Le Loi kept his promise,

1392
02:04:18,093 --> 02:04:19,321
he realized

1393
02:04:19,694 --> 02:04:22,663
Kim Quy's sword
belongs in the lake.

1394
02:04:24,199 --> 02:04:26,429
As long as the sword returns,

1395
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:29,534
Vietnam will always have hope.

1396
02:04:34,075 --> 02:04:36,703
ONE YEAR LATER

1397
02:04:45,553 --> 02:04:47,748
By the time you finish,
there won't be any wind.

1398
02:04:47,922 --> 02:04:49,685
You can't be too careful.

1399
02:04:59,734 --> 02:05:01,668
- Oh no, it's falling.
- Pull it up, uncle.

1400
02:05:01,736 --> 02:05:04,034
- Hurry, uncle.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1401
02:05:04,706 --> 02:05:05,695
Wait, son.

1402
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:07,974
All right, let's go.

1403
02:05:13,615 --> 02:05:14,809
My turn.

1404
02:05:15,817 --> 02:05:18,012
Try to keep it steady.
It's climbing.

1405
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:19,412
Pull. Pull.

1406
02:05:24,526 --> 02:05:25,959
See, uncle?
I can do it.

1407
02:05:30,765 --> 02:05:31,857
What are you writing, grandma?

1408
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,126
Wait a bit.

1409
02:05:33,902 --> 02:05:34,926
Peace and

1410
02:05:36,671 --> 02:05:37,831
Good health.

1411
02:05:39,808 --> 02:05:41,036
Paste it, now.

1412
02:05:46,181 --> 02:05:47,671
I'll make another wish.

1413
02:05:47,782 --> 02:05:50,250
- Here, mom.
- Good. Now I can attach it.

1414
02:05:57,692 --> 02:05:59,717
- I want to make a wish.
- Oh, here.

1415
02:05:59,861 --> 02:06:01,658
Oh, there it goes.
Hope it goes high.

1416
02:06:01,796 --> 02:06:03,263
Mai, you write one.

1417
02:06:04,099 --> 02:06:05,566
I want to write, too.

1418
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:23,317
Can you attach this form?

1419
02:06:29,657 --> 02:06:32,057
Oh, this one is going
to go really high.

1420
02:06:33,395 --> 02:06:35,454
It's going up real high.

1421
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:46,029
Those two wishes went up fast,
but my lottery wish took forever.

1422
02:06:52,981 --> 02:06:54,573
Isn't it beautiful?
