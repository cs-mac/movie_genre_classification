1
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,906
Yes.

2
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,668
How can it be

3
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,212
someone in the prosecution?

4
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:12,413
I guess it is easy to miss
what's right in front of you.

5
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,321
You all worked so closely with him.
How can you not have known?

6
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,516
We do all the work
while they just act cool and important.

7
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:25,892
Don't even get me started on team dinners.
They go out for dinners so often.

8
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,785
You couldn't catch the culprit
because you were too close with him.

9
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:30,984
What Captain said was right.

10
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,112
People should keep some distance
from each other.

11
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,072
God.

12
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,576
Did he actually live here?

13
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,929
Mr. Hwang.

14
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:44,682
Yes.

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,108
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

16
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:15,708
Why did you kill him?

17
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,299
Because that scum

18
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:25,635
deserved to be killed

19
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:29,596
with my own hands.

20
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,603
I contemplated every single day.

21
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,970
I contemplated how to kill him.

22
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,069
I wanted to find the best way to kill him

23
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,805
so that he can understand my pain.

24
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:48,074
What pain?

25
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:51,410
Of getting burned by fire.

26
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,876
Do you know why people say "hellfire"?

27
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,882
I heard that pain from being burned
by fire is the worst of all.

28
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,762
That was what that little body
had to endure.

29
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,890
That delicate skin...

30
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,770
He was completely burned.

31
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:24,569
He came back

32
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:26,988
as a black scorched mass.

33
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,577
I'm talking about my son.

34
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,793
<i>He was six.</i>

35
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,299
<i>His hands were so soft.</i>

36
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,434
<i>That morning, I held that hand of his
and took him to his kindergarten.</i>

37
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,188
<i>I got him on the bus.</i>

38
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,110
I told him to follow his friends
and get on.

39
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:09,989
Have fun, okay?

40
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:11,550
Have a good day.

41
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,367
- Don't fight with your friends.
- Bye!

42
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,955
Yes, the bus is about to leave.

43
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,584
It's Mom. She's on the phone now.

44
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,253
Right. Yes.

45
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,442
I'll call you. All right.

46
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,359
Bye!

47
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,510
- Bye!
- Okay.

48
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,767
The bus just left. All right.

49
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,103
Yes, I'll pick him up in the evening.

50
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,167
Okay.

51
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:47,443
<i>I promised him that I'd pick him up
in the evening.</i>

52
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:57,828
<i>- It's reported that they'll proceed.
- This is breaking news.</i>

53
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,058
<i>Around 4:10 p.m. today,
tires of Incheon-bound tour bus</i>

54
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,377
<i>exploded near Yeongjong Interchange.</i>

55
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,022
<i>A fire broke out after it crashed
into the guardrail,</i>

56
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:10,046
<i>and dozens of people on the bus including
kindergarten children and teachers</i>

57
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:13,511
<i>were killed or injured in the accident.</i>

58
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,639
<i>It wasn't an accident.</i>

59
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,018
<i>It was not an accident.</i>

60
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,606
<i>There's a device called stabilizer.</i>

61
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,086
<i>It helps vehicles maintain balance,
but the bus company had removed it</i>

62
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,277
<i>in order to save cost.</i>

63
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,601
They used recycled tires
that were patched up with rubber.

64
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:37,552
The driver had gotten fired in the past
for looking at his phone while driving.

65
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,161
However, the verdict was...

66
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,651
They blamed it on the faulty construction
of the guardrail.

67
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:47,628
The guardrail.

68
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,299
The guardrail?

69
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:55,428
That is not what happened.

70
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:59,006
I took a leave of absence
for a year and did everything

71
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:01,142
to find out why my son died.

72
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,466
I wanted to find out why my son

73
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,083
had to die because of that guardrail,
which no one knows who installed it

74
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,027
because all records had
conveniently disappeared.

75
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,823
It was a murder.

76
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,867
They're guilty of murder.

77
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,911
The bastards in the bus company
killed all those people.

78
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,348
But only the driver got
a three-year sentence.

79
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:24,415
The owner of the company?

80
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,462
The public officials who received bribes
and allowed the company to operate?

81
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:35,217
In total, 14 kids aged around 4 to 5
died because of them,

82
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,763
<i>yet those pricks didn't even spend a year
in prison.</i>

83
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,059
Did someone have their back?

84
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,563
A broker.

85
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,850
He asked a high-ranking authority
to downplay the case,

86
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,652
and before that...

87
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:57,844
That bus shouldn't have been allowed
to operate to begin with.

88
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,010
The kids were going on a field trip
that day.

89
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,995
The bus could operate until that day

90
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,707
because of the broker.

91
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,293
Was that broker Moo-sung Park?

92
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,430
I have a wish.

93
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,059
I hope that my son

94
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:28,020
died...

95
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,567
right at that moment.

96
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,780
The moment the accident happened

97
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,991
and the bus got turned upside down.

98
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,451
Right at that moment,

99
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,039
before the fire spread.

100
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,003
I hope that he didn't feel any pain

101
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,008
and instantly...

102
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,429
I hope he died instantly.

103
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:09,477
His body...

104
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,526
His body got burned,

105
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:23,617
but I hope it happened after he died.

106
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,543
I've been praying every single day.

107
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,964
I've never forgotten about him,
even for a day.

108
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,268
Hey.

109
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,980
Welcome back. I'm glad to see you.

110
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:56,377
Those who are alive must go on living.

111
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,279
Try to bury him in your heart

112
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:03,104
and forget about what happened.

113
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:11,956
Good.

114
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,881
Who's the high-ranking authority

115
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:23,135
that downplayed the scope of the case
as per Moo-sung Park's request?

116
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,348
The chief prosecutor here.

117
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:30,654
<i>The chief prosecutor
of the western office.</i>

118
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,240
It was two years ago. Are you referring to.

119
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,233
Mr. Sang-wook Bae?

120
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,405
He pressured Incheon Prosecutors' Office.

121
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,958
You just admitted your motive.

122
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,796
How did you kill him?

123
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:33,372
That was me.

124
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,302
Analysis lab.

125
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,315
I had planned it for a long time.

126
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:30,713
Is this the customer service center?
I think my TV is broken. What should I do?

127
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,624
Where is 75-3?

128
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,342
<i>What about Jin-seob Kang?</i>

129
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,677
<i>He was part of my plan.</i>

130
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:16,642
I'm really sorry.

131
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,731
Was I part of it too?

132
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,074
- Yes.
- Then what about Jin-seob Kang's death?

133
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:33,867
That I didn't expect.

134
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,911
Are you saying

135
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,599
that you came up with the entire plan?

136
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:42,543
Why? Do you think I couldn't do that
on my own?

137
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,132
I had been picturing it in my head
over and over for a long time

138
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:52,803
since the moment I found out
that Moo-sung Park was the broker.

139
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,939
Then why have you done nothing
to Mr. Bae, the former chief prosecutor?

140
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:01,811
That son of a bitch...

141
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:06,454
Even after what he did, he wanted
to become a member of Congress...

142
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,550
I'll be sure to make him stand trial.

143
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:15,492
He'll be dragged to court like a dog
to face the law which he trampled upon,

144
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,287
and every one of his corrupt
and wrong deeds will be revealed.

145
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,165
I'll be sure to watch it.

146
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,002
Why did you harm Ga-young, then?

147
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:28,922
To let people know

148
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,564
what the so-called leaders of our society

149
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:36,054
exchange amongst themselves
in return for people's lives.

150
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,767
I figured she'd wake up and disclose
all men to whom she's given sexual favors.

151
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:43,562
You don't think

152
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,463
the chief of Yongsan Police Station
was the only one, do you?

153
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,277
Mister.

154
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,573
All guys spend money on women.

155
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,449
What do you want me to do?

156
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,121
Shall I meet your wife
in my school uniform?

157
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:05,209
Ga-young is still very young,
but she's just like Moo-sung Park.

158
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,792
He uses money,

159
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,547
whereas she uses her body.
That's the only difference.

160
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,634
It sounds like you're deluding yourself.

161
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,459
Whether they become someone's brokers
or use their bodies,

162
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:21,975
don't you think you have no right
to punish them?

163
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,693
Have those with the right done anything?

164
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,037
Is that why you killed
Eun-soo Young as well?

165
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,242
Ms. Young...

166
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,371
That wasn't me.

167
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:46,750
Why did you kill her?

168
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,837
I don't care whatever happens to me
from now on.

169
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:55,259
I already gave up on my future
when I started this.

170
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,593
But Ms. Young's murder...

171
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,594
I...

172
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,099
I have nothing to do with it.

173
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,526
You said you don't care whatever happens.
Then why did you rush to the airport?

174
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:17,281
Weren't you trying to flee the country
because you knew you'd be caught?

175
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,617
I don't have anything else to say.

176
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:22,995
Why did you kill Ms. Young?

177
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,250
I'm going to ask you once again.

178
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,088
Why did you kill her?

179
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,213
Did killing him

180
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,760
make you feel better?

181
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:24,847
It felt like

182
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,061
my heart had been completely empty

183
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:31,229
since my son died.

184
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:33,648
But that void

185
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:38,779
has been filled with fear.

186
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,115
The way he was looking at me.

187
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:45,994
The way he writhed as he was dying.

188
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:50,791
And the blood.

189
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,622
He declined an autopsy on his son
back then.

190
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,420
He was scared that soot might be found
in that little boy's lungs

191
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,259
which would confirm
that he had burned to death.

192
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,488
She had a severe convulsion
in his car earlier.

193
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:47,240
She had a convulsion?

194
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,680
<i>When she was hiding
in the underground parking lot.</i>

195
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:54,985
I guess it was because she had never left
the ward before.

196
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,545
I should've figured it out
a long time ago.

197
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:04,341
Yes, this is Won-chul Kang.
I'm sorry for calling so late.

198
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,179
Yes, that's what happened.

199
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,934
Speaking of which, we'll put in a request
for two search warrants.

200
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,727
Please issue them right away.

201
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,066
Congressman Sang-wook Bae.

202
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:25,755
That's right. The former chief prosecutor,
Sang-wook Bae.

203
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,549
The other one is for a seizure
of a company that's related to the case.

204
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:30,158
I know it's the weekend,

205
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:32,612
but please take care of it
first thing in the morning.

206
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:34,245
Thank you.

207
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:41,776
We'll get in trouble if the evidence
on Mr. Bae isn't strong.

208
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:43,892
At the moment, it's just Mr. Yoon's claim.

209
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,758
We'll find out
only after we investigate him.

210
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:48,927
He wouldn't have talked nonsense.

211
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:50,971
By any chance, did you know

212
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:55,392
that the former chief prosecutor
meddled in the trial for the bus case?

213
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:57,227
No, I did not.

214
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,724
Even assistant chief prosecutors
didn't know about it.

215
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:04,025
How did Mr. Yoon know about it?

216
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,029
He's specialized
in internal investigations, you know.

217
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,449
But he said that he didn't kill Eun-soo.

218
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,245
What's your thought on that?

219
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,658
I don't know anything anymore.

220
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,879
I really hope he didn't go that far.

221
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:30,343
I'll investigate more.

222
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:32,679
You should call it a day.

223
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,764
You got a lot done today.

224
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:36,552
You've arrested the culprit.

225
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,810
Congratulations.

226
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:42,058
<i>This is the footage of the Yongsan-gu
serial murder case culprit</i>

227
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,477
<i>getting arrested at the airport
after a fight with the police.</i>

228
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:47,253
<i>This serial killer, who has terrorized
all residents of Yongsan-gu,</i>

229
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,482
<i>was an employee
of Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office,</i>

230
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,216
<i>which is causing a bigger stir.</i>

231
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,136
- Oh, it's you.
- Yes, I'm home.

232
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,648
Do you know the killer?

233
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,401
Of course.

234
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:14,656
Was he holding a grudge
against Moo-sung Park too?

235
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,952
I'm not sure. I don't know that much yet.

236
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:23,248
That fellow, Moo-sung Park,
was too greedy for his own good.

237
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,416
Yes.

238
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,421
Have you found the rats?

239
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:34,693
I gave different information
to each of my two secretaries,

240
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,594
but neither of them made a move.

241
00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:38,930
- Different information?
- Yes.

242
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:40,950
I told them I have a visitor from Ukraine

243
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,642
and gave them different hotel names.

244
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:46,229
I actually had a foreigner stay
at each hotel,

245
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,192
but neither of them tried to contact him
or reacted in any way.

246
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,284
You should go get some rest.

247
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:02,786
Good night.

248
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,520
The Prosecutor's Office Conducts
Investigation on Additional Crime.

249
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,087
DAEJUN VILLA

250
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,633
He was caught at the airport
out of all places.

251
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:20,638
Was it a coincidence?

252
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,751
I thought you'd be asleep.

253
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:53,171
We didn't get to finish
our conversation earlier, you know.

254
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,817
You should go see Soo-jung.

255
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:19,656
I know that she's very independent,
but she still needs her mom.

256
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:22,095
I can't go, but you should visit her.

257
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:27,622
I didn't expect things
to unfold like this.

258
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,918
You snooped on my assets,
and now you want me to leave?

259
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,506
What excuse would you have come up with
if Soo-jung wasn't in the States?

260
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,678
I'll have to make a public disclosure
of all of my assets soon,

261
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:46,057
including what you own as well as
all properties under Soo-jung's name.

262
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,726
That's why I looked into it.

263
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,104
If that was the case,

264
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:54,274
all you had to do was talk it over
with me in advance and...

265
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,734
why do you want me gone?

266
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:02,156
It'll be better for you to be away
when the process commences.

267
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,499
People will get awfully jealous
of our wealth.

268
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:07,829
Come back when things quiet down.

269
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,964
Don't forget about me no matter
how much fun you have with Soo-jung.

270
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:19,256
Okay?

271
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,767
I don't regret it.

272
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:35,732
I'm talking about going
to Sung-jae's trial that day.

273
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,714
You said that I shouldn't have come.

274
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:42,738
I don't feel that way.

275
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:45,450
Because I attended it,

276
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,912
you can be here with me now.

277
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,290
Why should I regret it?

278
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,595
You looked so beautiful that day.

279
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:11,434
I saw you sitting in the audience,

280
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,103
and your face lit up the entire courtroom.

281
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,571
- What about now?
- Now?

282
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,460
You're still beautiful.

283
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
Hello?

284
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,090
Do you want to meet that high school girl
who sent the letter tomorrow?

285
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:26,384
Then what?

286
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:29,846
<i>You can ask her when and where she met
that man and what she was wearing.</i>

287
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,494
You want me to find out the details?

288
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:33,765
<i>All right.</i>

289
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:35,642
Are you home now?

290
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:42,775
Yes, I'm home.

291
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:48,322
The place where I said something
unnecessary and caused someone's death.

292
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,241
I'm here now.

293
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:56,831
<i>Why did I answer Ms. Young's call?</i>

294
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,501
It wasn't even for me.

295
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,965
Why did I pick it up
and make her come here?

296
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:08,418
<i>Was I possessed by something?</i>

297
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,140
What was I possessed by, then?

298
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:18,144
You didn't do anything wrong.

299
00:31:19,937 --> 00:31:23,941
<i>I was the one who asked Mr. Yoon
to join our team in the first place.</i>

300
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:30,698
The special investigation's goal was

301
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,576
to catch the killer and dig up
on the Moo-sung Park scandal,

302
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:37,205
yet I recruited the killer himself
to our team.

303
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,709
Why did he kill him?

304
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,798
Among the former chief prosecutors
of our office,

305
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:49,175
there's a man named Sang-wook Bae.

306
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,510
What about him?

307
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,097
<i>He and Moo-sung Park colluded</i>

308
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,016
<i>to conceal the truth about the accident
that killed Mr. Yoon's son.</i>

309
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:00,478
Even so...

310
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,500
How can he treat someone's child like that

311
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:07,068
when he's devastated by his son's death?

312
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:09,862
Even if he had chosen
to live his life like that...

313
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,740
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

314
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:14,408
His place is...

315
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,411
I saw his place and...

316
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:25,128
He got divorced too. It must've been
shortly after the accident.

317
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,637
When something goes wrong with a child,

318
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,221
parents end up

319
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,183
hating each other.

320
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,353
<i>Shouldn't they gather strength
at times like that?</i>

321
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,960
<i>They should be there for each other.</i>

322
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,900
I guess families like that do exist
somewhere out there.

323
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,488
What about your parents?

324
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:01,497
<i>Why didn't you tell me
about your brain surgery?</i>

325
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:03,583
It's nothing important.

326
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:07,670
<i>Is the pain gone?</i>

327
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,631
Yes, it's gone.

328
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,634
<i>That's all I needed to know.</i>

329
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:18,264
<i>Tell me if the pain comes back.</i>

330
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:26,564
<i>Well, there's nothing I can do
even if you tell me.</i>

331
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,322
You should still tell me if it hurts.

332
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,699
I can at least take you to a hospital.

333
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,041
<i>About Ms. Young...</i>

334
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,587
He said he didn't kill her.

335
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,548
Mr. Yoon said that?

336
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:55,259
Why am I still addressing him politely?

337
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,970
Did Se-won say that to you himself?

338
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:03,392
I'll need to investigate further
to find out what happened, but her death

339
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:07,772
might not have anything to do with you
inviting her to your place that day.

340
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,860
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

341
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,821
You should too.

342
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,857
What a long day.

343
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
You said nothing about this
even yesterday.

344
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,028
I suddenly got the urge
to go see Soo-jung last night.

345
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:23,139
You've held it back for a long time.
I know how much you like to travel.

346
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:25,891
- I'll see you soon.
- All right.

347
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:27,017
See you later.

348
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:29,352
I'll drive.

349
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:31,105
Okay, sir.

350
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:33,024
You're going to drive?

351
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:35,651
It's a beautiful day.

352
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:38,362
I'm leaving.

353
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:41,174
It's not a big deal.
Why are you smiling ear to ear?

354
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:43,367
Dad, it's something
you've never even done yourself.

355
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:47,455
See you later, Father.

356
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:08,309
The sky hasn't been this clear
in a long time.

357
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,437
This is what the sky actually looks like.

358
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:14,815
It's a good time of the year to travel.

359
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,282
What is it?

360
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:29,181
DONATION AGREEMENT

361
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:31,850
Let's move your cash
to your scholarship foundation

362
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:33,268
just for the time being.

363
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,460
THE DETAILS OF DONATION

364
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:39,590
It says I'm donating 80 billion won
to my foundation.

365
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:43,403
Yes. We have to move it there
in order to get it all back

366
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,346
after the public disclosure.

367
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,559
I'll tell those in the foundation.

368
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:03,906
- Aren't you hungry?
- No, I'm not.

369
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:06,158
- You haven't eaten anything.
- I'm fine.

370
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:07,867
Honey.

371
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:19,921
Let's go.

372
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Goodbye.

373
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,508
Hello, this is Chang-jun Lee.

374
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:07,904
I'm calling
about Prosecutor Joon-sik Gong.

375
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:09,346
Yes, the former division head.

376
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:11,765
He'll stand trial soon.

377
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,143
No one can say things about him going

378
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,413
to the legal affairs team at your company.

379
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:17,605
You know that, right?

380
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:24,737
Yes, Mr. Song.
I'm sorry to bother you on your day off.

381
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,323
I'd like to meet with you today.

382
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,659
Yes. Please meet me at my office
in an hour.

383
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:38,185
How is there no trace
of Ms. Young's blood?

384
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,085
Those clothes were covered in blood.

385
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,963
I guess he wore something else that day.

386
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,351
Do killers have to wear the same clothes
every time they kill someone?

387
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:50,513
He must get grossed out too.

388
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:54,725
First, let's find the person
who bought the knife.

389
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:57,520
Gosh, I thought it was all over.

390
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:00,939
What are you doing here?

391
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:12,993
Did Mr. Yoon really do it?

392
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:17,581
No one is making it up.
I mean, he admitted it himself.

393
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,834
There's plenty of evidence as well.

394
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,338
Does that mean he killed Ms. Young too?

395
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:27,651
He's insisting that he didn't, but...

396
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:29,927
He's just wasting his energy
by denying it. We're...

397
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:31,887
Gosh, damn it.

398
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,242
He got caught on the run after killing her
because she figured it out.

399
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:36,392
No one would believe him.

400
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:39,853
You know what?

401
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,899
I can't believe
that this was only a few days ago.

402
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,529
I know. The serial killer was among us.

403
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:51,031
And the victim
who was soon to be killed by him.

404
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:56,078
Why did we have no clue?
He was right beside us.

405
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:05,296
I wish people wear labels
saying whether they're evil or nice.

406
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:08,882
I wish that too.

407
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:14,054
Even many of us here wouldn't fall into
exactly one of the categories.

408
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:25,125
They're leaving now to carry out
the confiscation of the bus company.

409
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:26,233
Okay.

410
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,445
I'm sorry that you have to leave
when you just got here.

411
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,841
You all must be busy. I'm sorry
I took up your time. See you all later.

412
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,634
- Bye.
- Have a good day.

413
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:35,909
- Oh, this.
- Gosh.

414
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:37,745
Bye.

415
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:41,049
What did you mean when you said
many of us here can't be categorized?

416
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,709
I was referring to someone specific.

417
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:48,714
You think he's a nice person as he seems
to be working hard to catch the culprit,

418
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,401
then you see him dumping
everything on others

419
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:53,010
and wonder what he's really like.

420
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,387
Whom are you talking about?

421
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:57,348
Captain.

422
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,785
He begged Kyung-wan on his knees
the day before he came clean.

423
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:03,520
The point he tried to make was
that he didn't do anything wrong.

424
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,000
I only found out about it
because I ran into him that day.

425
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,817
For goodness' sake.

426
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,487
People are more or less the same.

427
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:13,865
No one is that horribly evil
or angelically nice.

428
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:17,618
Those of us that belong to the common herd
just go where our lives take us.

429
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,995
What if going with the flow like that

430
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,874
takes you to a place you don't even know?

431
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:28,379
The seizure itself is a prosecution's job,
so don't step on anyone's toes.

432
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:31,107
They changed the name to continue
operating after killing the kids,

433
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,318
so don't go easy on those pricks. Got it?

434
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:34,342
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:45,187
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

436
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,368
Gosh, it looks like time has been
on pause here.

437
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:03,080
What brings you here?

438
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:08,419
Did we neglect what was right in front
of our eyes? Is that it?

439
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:14,633
After Eun-soo...

440
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:19,104
I assumed that things went haywire
for him after what happened to her.

441
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:21,598
I thought that was why
he was running away.

442
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,394
Who are you talking about?

443
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,773
Mr. Chief Secretary.

444
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:31,691
Where did he go?

445
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,986
His wife came by the office to see him.

446
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:35,612
They talked about divorce.

447
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:39,053
Then he got ready to leave the country
without telling anyone.

448
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:42,703
Getting divorced and leaving the country?
When and where?

449
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,999
That I don't know. I just got
a quick glance at the itinerary.

450
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:50,836
Anyway, it doesn't even matter anymore
because he's not the killer.

451
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,504
Who cares where he's going?

452
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:56,841
Right.

453
00:42:57,634 --> 00:42:59,594
He certainly doesn't have
the guts to kill anyone.

454
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:03,140
He's just a materialistic guy
who uses his wife.

455
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,057
Mr. Yoon

456
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:08,103
is saying that he didn't kill Eun-soo.

457
00:43:10,063 --> 00:43:11,815
It sounds like you believe him.

458
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:16,987
Do you remember what we talked about
at Mr. Kang's office a while ago?

459
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:19,943
I said that Mr. Young must have been
framed like that

460
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:22,534
because he knows something.

461
00:43:27,748 --> 00:43:30,584
Some documents went missing
on the day that Eun-soo died.

462
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:34,552
They're about Hanjo Group, and Mr. Young
had been keeping them at home.

463
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:37,424
It looks like Eun-soo took them, but...

464
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:42,888
If she died when she had them with her...

465
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:46,785
What if she died because she had them?

466
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,687
It must've been Chairman Lee.

467
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,397
There's one more person.

468
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:58,152
Chang-jun Lee.

469
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:05,006
Gosh, he just can't get his name
crossed out from the suspect list.

470
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:09,414
I'll need to investigate Mr. Yoon further
to find out more,

471
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,752
but we can't dismiss the possibility
that it was Hanjo's doing.

472
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,253
That being said,

473
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,215
the man in the photos
I sent to you the other day...

474
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,969
Excuse me for a second.
Si-mok Hwang speaking.

475
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:25,012
Yes.

476
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:28,809
No, I'll come down.

477
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:32,396
What's the matter?

478
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,523
It's Mr. Young.

479
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,943
What brings him here?

480
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:44,408
Why can't I meet the culprit?

481
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:47,303
Mr. Yoon is refusing all visitors.

482
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:49,830
I just want to see him.
I can't even do that?

483
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,000
Is that really why you're here?

484
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,978
There's something I have to ask him.

485
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:56,980
I have to ask you something as well.

486
00:44:57,004 --> 00:44:58,565
Let's sit down and talk.

487
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:00,309
Coming all the way here
must've been tiring.

488
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:14,229
What went missing?
What exactly was it about?

489
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:16,690
It's...

490
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:20,527
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

491
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,234
Since his children were young,

492
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:31,038
Yun-beom Lee has distributed

493
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,624
his assets to them little by little

494
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,543
and bought his company's shares with them.

495
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,296
Knowing that switching
to a holding company

496
00:45:39,588 --> 00:45:43,359
meant that any dividend it receives
from its subsidiaries is tax-exempt,

497
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:45,383
he has evaded hundreds of millions
of won in taxes.

498
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:49,973
When I heard that Hanjo Distribution
went public,

499
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,184
I thought something was off.

500
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:55,145
Hanjo Distribution...

501
00:45:55,646 --> 00:45:58,486
Moo-sung Park invested everything he had
in that company before he died.

502
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:01,193
I didn't know about him back then.

503
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:05,882
I knew that Chairman Lee's children
were involved.

504
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:08,200
Had you pushed ahead
with that investigation,

505
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,036
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee would've been...

506
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:13,330
Chang-jun's wife?

507
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:16,875
She would've been arrested for tax fraud.

508
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:20,796
Whether she was directly involved
or not doesn't matter.

509
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:25,050
Then, Mr. Lee must've been in a position

510
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,121
where he either had to betray you

511
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:30,097
or put his wife behind bars.

512
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,829
Those must've been his only options.

513
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:37,479
That's why he cried
when he came to see me.

514
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:39,313
What?

515
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:44,611
<i>Did he ask you to stop the investigation?</i>

516
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:46,923
<i>He didn't say anything.</i>

517
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:50,802
<i>I think that was
when Chairman Lee was busy</i>

518
00:46:50,826 --> 00:46:52,619
<i>cooking up his scheme to get rid of me.</i>

519
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:58,959
Then it wasn't about an affair or things
like that. He did it to save his wife.

520
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,753
An affair?

521
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:03,754
It's nothing, sir.

522
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:07,737
That means Moo-sung Park lied to me
until right before he died.

523
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,680
Is there a chance that the killer

524
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:14,182
has an association with Chairman Lee?

525
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,686
No association has been confirmed yet.

526
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,981
You don't know anything either?

527
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,399
No. I apologize, sir.

528
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:28,238
I need to ask him directly

529
00:47:29,322 --> 00:47:30,782
and find out who's behind him.

530
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,286
I must ask him myself.

531
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,163
Let me meet him.

532
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:39,166
Who's the scum

533
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:41,877
that killed Eun-soo...

534
00:47:50,677 --> 00:47:51,762
Sir.

535
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,310
You know how Si-mok is.

536
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:01,839
He's the most trustworthy prosecutor
in the entire country.

537
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:06,419
He'll bring the truth to light,
so please just trust him.

538
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:09,321
Let me take you home, sir.
I'll give you a ride.

539
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,939
I've worked under Mr. Lee
for over a decade,

540
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,274
yet I still can't figure out

541
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,318
who he really is.

542
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,446
It is true that he has changed
a lot though.

543
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,698
I'm sorry.

544
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:56,659
I beg your pardon?

545
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,869
Your shoulder.

546
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:00,789
Get out, you scumbag!

547
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,334
You shouldn't worry about me.

548
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:08,171
Because you're so considerate,
wolves like Chairman Lee...

549
00:49:15,428 --> 00:49:16,948
What does the lost document look like?

550
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:20,595
It's the one I used to use
at the training institute.

551
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:23,915
It must have the institute's logo on.

552
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:02,893
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

553
00:50:08,023 --> 00:50:09,023
The institute's logo.

554
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:10,984
The logo.

555
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:12,944
The institute's logo...

556
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:54,402
You're here on your day off.

557
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:03,745
- Why are you here today, sir?
- Go home.

558
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,433
How can I go home
when you're here to work, sir?

559
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:08,457
Get going now.

560
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,379
Yes, sir. Have a good day.

561
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:34,464
Why didn't he say anything about it?

562
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:36,444
He caught me in the act.

563
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,140
Is Mr. Chief Secretary in his office?

564
00:51:45,328 --> 00:51:46,871
Yes, but may I ask who you are?

565
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:49,624
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

566
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:55,380
- Shall I make some tea?
- Drop this off immediately.

567
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,382
You don't need to come back.

568
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:05,491
BLUE HOUSE

569
00:52:05,515 --> 00:52:07,308
Cheongsol Scholarship Foundation.

570
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:09,853
A scholarship foundation?

571
00:52:16,818 --> 00:52:19,058
I'd like you to start getting ready
for selling the bank.

572
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:21,173
Already?

573
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:23,050
Yes. Why wait?

574
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:25,285
You did a great job at marketing the bank

575
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,681
saying that you've secured a lump sum
from Hong Kong as an investment,

576
00:52:28,705 --> 00:52:30,516
so the stock price will go up in no time.

577
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,875
Yes, that is true.

578
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,962
The stock price will crash
when we pull out the investment.

579
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:38,584
When retail investors start
crying over their losses,

580
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:41,176
external meddling will begin right away.

581
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:44,471
I'd like it to be sold
before that happens.

582
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:47,152
There's one thing that concerns me though.

583
00:52:47,515 --> 00:52:48,808
What is it, sir?

584
00:52:49,642 --> 00:52:52,762
If the payment from it gets deposited
directly into my father-in-law's account,

585
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,065
it might get traced.

586
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:58,109
Hence, I'd like it to meander a little.

587
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:02,989
Our majority shareholder
is no longer Chairman Lee.

588
00:53:03,198 --> 00:53:05,992
It's now Mr. Sung-jae Lee.
Didn't you know about it, sir?

589
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,078
My brother-in-law?

590
00:53:10,914 --> 00:53:13,142
Has the ownership of the shares
been transferred to him?

591
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,166
Yes.

592
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:20,632
Then what will happen to the profit
from JR Holdings purchasing the bank?

593
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,176
It'll go to Mr. Lee.

594
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:25,970
The account is held in Swiss,

595
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:27,680
so you have nothing to worry about.

596
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:30,910
Oh, I see.

597
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:32,102
Yes.

598
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,336
Yes, it's me.

599
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:03,383
I just sent you the signed copy
with Ms. Lee's signature,

600
00:54:04,217 --> 00:54:06,094
so take care of it
as soon as you receive it.

601
00:54:07,053 --> 00:54:10,765
She's voluntarily donating her assets.

602
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:12,392
Please make that clear.

603
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:15,562
All right, then.

604
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:30,827
CONGRESSMAN SANG-WOOK BAE

605
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,791
Hello, Congressman Bae.
It's been a long time.

606
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:40,794
I guess you've heard.

607
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,500
Yes, there must be a search and seizure
going on at Sepoong Transportation now.

608
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:50,889
I didn't expect that you'd be affected
by the Huam-dong case.

609
00:54:55,143 --> 00:54:59,439
I don't think you're in a situation
where you can worry about saving face.

610
00:55:01,816 --> 00:55:03,818
The killer must've told them
everything by now.

611
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,863
It's only a matter of time
before your name comes up.

612
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:11,117
Yes, that's what I was waiting to hear.

613
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:16,789
I'm sure there will be something
I can do for you.

614
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,667
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

615
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,146
<i>I initially assumed that you were the one
who wanted to proceed it quickly.</i>

616
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,882
<i>But oddly, he didn't even know
about the change in majority shareholder.</i>

617
00:56:08,508 --> 00:56:11,469
All right. I'll call you again soon.

618
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:18,810
CHANG-JUN LEE

619
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:25,024
<i>The subscriber you're trying to reach is
unavailable now. Please leave a message.</i>

620
00:56:27,944 --> 00:56:29,904
What on earth is he up to?

621
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:32,782
He even used me as an excuse.

622
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:41,291
DONG-JAE SEO

623
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,420
Come to my office now.

624
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,339
I'm back.

625
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:51,235
I'm sorry for making you work
on your day off.

626
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:52,510
Please don't worry about it.

627
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:56,533
I'm so confused and disturbed
that I can't really relax anyway.

628
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:57,931
Here it is.

629
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:01,620
The airport is huge, which means
there are many security cameras.

630
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:04,456
I heard that the team there
spent the whole night editing the footage

631
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
to gather all the parts
where Mr. Yoon is captured.

632
00:57:07,775 --> 00:57:11,863
What was the other thing? Oh, I reviewed
every call on his call history,

633
00:57:12,322 --> 00:57:15,134
but they were all for his work
at the special investigation team.

634
00:57:15,158 --> 00:57:18,161
It doesn't even look like he spoke
to anyone over the phone personally.

635
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,599
Please see if he had a burner phone
or a phone under a different name.

636
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:22,832
Sure.

637
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,062
TERMINAL AREA 3, SECOND FLOOR

638
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:28,421
Oh, over there...

639
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:32,717
There he is. That's Mr. Yoon.

640
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,763
He vanished instantly.

641
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:38,887
On the lower right corner.

642
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:41,100
Oh, you're right.

643
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:44,038
Which floor is he on?

644
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:46,314
ESCALATOR 3, THIRD FLOOR

645
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:49,025
He just got to the third floor, right?

646
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:50,317
International Departures.

647
00:57:58,368 --> 00:58:00,971
CHECK-IN COUNTER K, THIRD FLOOR

648
00:58:00,995 --> 00:58:02,914
CHECK-IN COUNTER, THIRD FLOOD

649
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:11,506
Did he know that we were after him?

650
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,675
He seems very much on guard.

651
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:22,308
Is he thinking where he should go?

652
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:26,604
I guess he didn't even have time to get
a ticket before rushing to the airport.

653
00:58:30,316 --> 00:58:31,734
He's walking away.

654
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:33,879
AREA J, THIRD FLOOR

655
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:34,838
DEPARTURE HALL

656
00:58:34,862 --> 00:58:36,048
FOOD COURT 5, THIRD FLOOR

657
00:58:36,072 --> 00:58:37,312
Why didn't he leave right away?

658
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,951
I bet every second mattered.

659
00:58:41,994 --> 00:58:43,371
GATE 14, THIRD FLOOR

660
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,542
He's going back to the check-in area.

661
00:58:57,552 --> 00:59:02,807
CENTRAL AISLE, SECOND FLOOR

662
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:16,362
Why does he keep looking around?

663
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,463
If I were him, I would've fled right away
without wasting my time.

664
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:21,409
He's looking for someone.

665
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:23,161
He's not on guard.

666
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:25,121
What? Looking for whom?

667
00:59:26,998 --> 00:59:29,292
I can tell that he's looking for someone.

668
00:59:32,295 --> 00:59:33,629
His accomplice.

669
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,090
Was he supposed to meet him there?

670
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:41,071
<i>I don't care whatever happens
to me from now on.</i>

671
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:42,513
I already gave up on my future

672
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:45,016
when I started this.

673
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,476
But Ms. Young's murder...

674
00:59:48,895 --> 00:59:50,038
I have nothing to do with it.

675
00:59:50,062 --> 00:59:53,399
You said you don't care whatever happens.
Then why did you rush to the airport?

676
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:58,297
Weren't you trying to flee the country
because you knew you'd be caught?

677
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:00,031
I don't have anything else to say.

678
01:00:03,993 --> 01:00:05,929
Please send Mr. Yoon
to the interrogation room.

679
01:00:05,953 --> 01:00:06,996
Sure.

680
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:22,861
How did you send that letter
to <i>Sungmoon Daily</i>?

681
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,882
I asked a girl I met on the street
to do it for me.

682
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:27,342
<i>I met the high school girl.</i>

683
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:29,803
Where did you meet her?
And how did you ask her?

684
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,304
<i>It was an alley in Sinchon.</i>

685
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,454
It was near Sinchon.

686
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,165
I asked her to send a letter
to <i>Sungmoon Daily</i> for me.

687
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:38,436
<i>She said she followed his instructions
and sent the letter at the post office.</i>

688
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,730
What was that girl wearing?

689
01:00:40,754 --> 01:00:44,442
<i>She said he must've known her age roughly
as she was wearing her school uniform.</i>

690
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:46,152
- Her school uniform.
- What color?

691
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:47,928
- <i>Brown.</i>
- Brown.

692
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:56,812
So you're the one who tipped off
<i>Sungmoon Daily</i>?

693
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:00,524
You already know the answer.

694
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:05,654
Then why did you choose
<i>Sungmoon Daily</i> out of all media outlets?

695
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,951
Why did you send it to <i>Sungmoon Daily</i>?

696
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,663
The same reason as why you gave them
the information on Matsuyama.

697
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:19,126
I knew that the CEO of Sungmoon
would publish it as a cover story.

698
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:30,512
How did you know
that he'd respond like that?

699
01:01:32,097 --> 01:01:34,417
I was in charge of internal investigations
for seven years.

700
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:36,185
I should know that much.

701
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:40,481
Is that why you knew what only those
directly involved would know?

702
01:01:40,856 --> 01:01:43,585
Is that also why you knew about how
Mr. Sang-wook Bae meddled in the trial?

703
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:45,277
No one here knew about it.

704
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:47,046
Collecting intel was my job.

705
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,864
Then let's hear more about it.

706
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:53,160
How did you find out that Mr. Bae
pressured Incheon Prosecutors' Office?

707
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:55,013
I worked hard on it for a year...

708
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:58,916
Right, so give me the details
of what you did during that one year.

709
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:02,645
There's no way he made it obvious

710
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:05,482
and it's not like those who were pressured
would tell you about it.

711
01:02:05,506 --> 01:02:07,216
How did you find out?

712
01:02:14,806 --> 01:02:16,517
If you didn't find out yourself,

713
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,521
did someone tell you about it?

714
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,365
I see that you're trying hard
to protect your accomplice.

715
01:02:33,867 --> 01:02:35,907
You must've gone to the airport
to meet up with him.

716
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:37,955
You planned to flee together.

717
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:42,376
Isn't that why you kept looking for
someone?

718
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,712
You looked more desperate
than a little boy looking for his mom.

719
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,300
Did he leave without you?
He must've had your itinerary.

720
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,512
He's the one who killed Eun-soo.

721
01:02:54,221 --> 01:02:56,515
That's why you insist
that you didn't kill her.

722
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,643
It was a collaboration between you two
even though he betrayed you.

723
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,145
I mean, he ran away without you.

724
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:05,639
Or is he still in the country?

725
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:10,862
Is that why you're protecting him?

726
01:03:11,572 --> 01:03:13,031
Are you two like brothers?

727
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:14,699
Is that it?

728
01:03:26,545 --> 01:03:28,345
The person you were looking for
at the airport

729
01:03:29,464 --> 01:03:30,674
wasn't your accomplice.

730
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:36,930
You went straight to the departure hall
with your passport,

731
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,516
but you had no interest
in leaving the country.

732
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,579
If you were to flee the country
because of what you did,

733
01:03:42,603 --> 01:03:45,456
you should've gotten on whatever flight
that was available and left.

734
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,066
Instead, you kept looking for someone.

735
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:52,362
Had that person been your accomplice,
you would've called him

736
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:55,540
or set a time to meet up so that
you didn't have to wander everywhere.

737
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:58,386
There's no accomplice.
I did everything alone.

738
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,681
Someone else must've been at the airport
at the time you got arrested.

739
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:04,425
You must've gone there to catch
that person, not to flee the country.

740
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,811
You went to the entrance
of the departures area

741
01:04:06,835 --> 01:04:08,521
and came back to buy a ticket

742
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,190
because you had concluded
that he already went in.

743
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,734
You must've wanted to get inside
to catch him. Who's that prick?

744
01:04:14,259 --> 01:04:16,887
- I've got nothing to tell you.
- Who is that son of a bitch?

745
01:04:20,432 --> 01:04:23,620
You said you've given up on your future
and that you don't care whatever happens,

746
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:25,896
yet he made you run
to the airport. Who is he?

747
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:42,829
How did it feel?

748
01:04:44,623 --> 01:04:46,208
When you saw the dead body of Eun-soo

749
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,878
and the knife with the rose motif,
which you used to use, right beside her.

750
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:54,383
When you thought that someone killed her,
pretending to be you.

751
01:04:54,508 --> 01:04:56,486
When you realized that the person schemed

752
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,390
to make the murder look like a part
of the serial case to screw you over.

753
01:05:01,056 --> 01:05:02,140
You had to catch him.

754
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:07,187
You must've wanted to catch him
at all costs. Why?

755
01:05:08,146 --> 01:05:11,775
You think you're not one of those psychos
who kill people for no reason.

756
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:15,070
You keep telling yourself
that all criminals deserve to be killed.

757
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,156
You're worse than those psychos.

758
01:05:19,408 --> 01:05:22,008
All of your experience must've helped you
find the killer quickly.

759
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:23,620
Tell me if I'm wrong.

760
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,667
INVESTIGATION REPORT

761
01:05:31,086 --> 01:05:32,086
Have a look.

762
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:34,588
This man is the killer.

763
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:37,467
You went there to catch him.

764
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,904
I have nothing to say.

765
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:41,346
Why are you trying to protect him?

766
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:44,951
You're putting up with people
saying you got caught while fleeing

767
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:47,453
just to protect this son of a bitch.
Why are you keeping quiet?

768
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,288
This prick is running farther away

769
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,065
- while you're wasting my time like this.
- I have nothing to say.

770
01:05:53,442 --> 01:05:56,820
I don't need an attorney.
I will exercise my right to remain silent.

771
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:15,963
Mr. Yoon.

772
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,551
I'm sure there's a reason.

773
01:06:21,428 --> 01:06:22,596
A reason you can't tell me.

774
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,726
I'll find it myself.

775
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:46,703
It must be hard to go from wearing
the judicial robe to serving someone.

776
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,798
Not at all, sir.
I'm still a public official.

777
01:06:50,749 --> 01:06:53,168
It looks like you still feel
very attached to your old job.

778
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,592
Sir, what do you mean by that?

779
01:07:02,594 --> 01:07:03,929
Aren't you the one who leaked it?

780
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:06,556
The intel on Matsuyama.

781
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:08,432
Matsuyama...

782
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,103
Oh, are you referring to what was
on the news a little while ago?

783
01:07:15,482 --> 01:07:19,194
Sir, I'm flattered to know
that you think I'm that competent,

784
01:07:19,694 --> 01:07:22,334
but how could I leak such information
when I knew nothing about it?

785
01:07:22,864 --> 01:07:25,742
I had no idea until they started going on
about it on TV.

786
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:27,953
Have some tea.

787
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:29,745
Thank you.

788
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,250
Did the CEO of the bank come by
Chang-jun's office today?

789
01:07:35,794 --> 01:07:36,794
My apologies, sir.

790
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,548
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

791
01:07:46,972 --> 01:07:50,725
Well, someone did come by to see him,
but I don't know who he is.

792
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:52,727
Is he a CEO of a bank?

793
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,688
Did you see anyone else?

794
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:57,315
Did anything else happen?

795
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:01,152
Mr. Lee sent me on an errand
as soon as his guest arrived,

796
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:03,905
so I don't know anything else.
I apologize.

797
01:08:04,406 --> 01:08:05,406
What was the errand?

798
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:10,370
He asked me to deliver a letter
to a scholarship foundation.

799
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,247
But when I got there,

800
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,860
I learned that Ms. Lee is the chairwoman
of the foundation.

801
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:32,410
Yes, sir.

802
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:34,620
<i>Call Mr. Moon
at Cheongsol Scholarship Foundation.</i>

803
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:35,644
Right away, sir.

804
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:43,278
Hello, Mr. Moon.

805
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:45,927
There's something I want to ask you.

806
01:08:47,532 --> 01:08:50,619
What did my son-in-law send you today?

807
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:54,539
He's moving money?

808
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,666
I never gave him permission!

809
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:02,189
Did you have to call at that moment?
I was with Chairman Lee.

810
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:04,613
<i>You remember the photos
I sent you a little while ago, right?</i>

811
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,593
<i>Photos of the man
who sneaked into my place.</i>

812
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:08,779
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

813
01:09:08,803 --> 01:09:11,782
<i>Can he be someone who works
with Chairman Lee or Mr. Lee?</i>

814
01:09:11,806 --> 01:09:13,659
How can I know that
from those photos alone?

815
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:14,963
His face wasn't clearly visible.

816
01:09:15,602 --> 01:09:17,371
When I saw you at Mr. Kang's office,

817
01:09:17,395 --> 01:09:19,248
you mentioned Chairman Lee's
executive assistant.

818
01:09:19,272 --> 01:09:20,249
<i>Mr. Woo?</i>

819
01:09:20,273 --> 01:09:22,710
Is there a possibility
that he could be the man in the photos?

820
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:25,528
Are you saying Mr. Woo
sneaked into your place? Why?

821
01:09:25,737 --> 01:09:27,697
<i>The man sneaked into my apartment</i>

822
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:30,075
<i>right after I put a stop
on the weapon import.</i>

823
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:32,160
<i>Eun-soo, who saw him that day, got killed,</i>

824
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,597
<i>and the documents related to Hanjo
went missing too.</i>

825
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:35,705
Hold on a second.

826
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,213
Hey, did you say Eun-soo saw this man?

827
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:08,237
<i>Yes.</i>

828
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,800
- Is this a coincidence?
- <i>What do you mean? Why?</i>

829
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:13,827
I think this man is Mr. Woo,
Mr. Byung-jun Woo. But...

830
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:15,930
He's not in the office now.

831
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:18,182
You said you just saw Yun-beom Lee, right?

832
01:10:18,206 --> 01:10:20,017
But Mr. Woo isn't there now?

833
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,853
<i>No, he isn't. This was the first time
I saw Chairman Lee without him.</i>

834
01:10:22,877 --> 01:10:24,337
<i>He was like Chairman Lee's shadow.</i>

835
01:10:25,505 --> 01:10:26,505
Hey, Si-mok.

836
01:10:28,008 --> 01:10:29,328
Can all of this be a coincidence?

837
01:10:35,974 --> 01:10:39,120
Please see if you can find Byung-jun Woo
in yesterday's outbound passenger data.

838
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:40,353
Byung-jun...

839
01:10:44,649 --> 01:10:45,809
<i>Those who know Byung-jun Woo.</i>

840
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,810
<i>Those who know about the jealousy
Sungmoon's CEO has been harboring.</i>

841
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:36,844
<i>Those who can find out
about Mr. Bae meddling in</i>

842
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:38,828
<i>the trial for the accident
using his authority.</i>

843
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:50,507
<i>Those who knew that Mr. Woo was
leaving the country yesterday afternoon.</i>

844
01:12:01,309 --> 01:12:03,061
<i>The one who can move Mr. Yoon</i>

845
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,397
<i>to make him chase Mr. Woo.</i>

846
01:13:31,524 --> 01:13:32,901
Is Mr. Park not home yet?

847
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,404
Sir.

848
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:01,596
Killing a mutt

849
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:05,099
will just make you a butcher.

850
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:12,440
If you have to kill someone,

851
01:14:14,234 --> 01:14:15,944
you should hear me out first.

852
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,746
FATHER

853
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:35,088
FATHER

854
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:42,386
Mr. Hwang!

855
01:14:43,471 --> 01:14:46,224
The name, Byung-jun Woo,
is on yesterday's outbound passenger list.

856
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:09,580
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

857
01:15:19,674 --> 01:15:21,592
STRANGER

858
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:24,113
<i>It's time for you to be honest, Father.</i>

859
01:15:24,137 --> 01:15:26,031
<i>Bring Chang-jun to me right now!</i>

860
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,242
<i>We must strike them with full force.</i>

861
01:15:28,266 --> 01:15:30,411
<i>If we approach them rashly,
we'll be crushed.</i>

862
01:15:30,435 --> 01:15:33,497
<i>Control the media before they come up with
imaginative stories.</i>

863
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:36,542
<i>- Do you think you won this game?
- That's the only thing I regret.</i>

864
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:40,087
<i>You will regret that you've messed with us
for the rest of your life.</i>

865
01:15:40,111 --> 01:15:41,338
<i>Who is "us"?</i>

866
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:44,508
- Let's go catch the murderer.
- <i>Request Interpol to issue a red notice.</i>

867
01:15:44,532 --> 01:15:46,218
<i>Were you talking about me?</i>

868
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,994
<i>- I was thinking about you.</i>
- Mr. Hwang?

869
01:15:51,789 --> 01:15:54,000
