00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:07,495
<i>- Juanillo?
- Yes, Mother?</i>

3
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:10,901
<i>- Go to sleep.
- Yes, Mother.</i>

4
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:15,603
<i>- Thank you. Thank you, amigos.
- The miracles you performed this afternoon—</i>

5
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,808
I, Curro, tell you
you didn't need your sword.

6
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,443
You killed that bull with your cape.

7
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,286
Curro, these women
kill more often than the bulls.

8
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,821
- Garabato, where did you get this scar?
- Oh, this one?

9
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,420
I got that in, uh— in Bilbao.

10
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:36,624
Tell me something. Is it true your body
is covered all over like a map?

11
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,601
<i>Well, gachi, during the 19 years
I've exercised my profession...</i>

12
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,934
I've killed 2,912 bulls...

13
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:50,273
And I've been gored 67 times.

14
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,813
With my hand on my heart, I, Curro...

15
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:57,614
declare all nations of the Earth should
come and admire toreros like Garabato.

16
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:00,914
<i>They may have ships,
they may have gold...</i>

17
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,181
but they have no man like this.

18
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:05,780
I, Curro, tell you this man...

19
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:10,124
is greater than Frascuelo
or Mazzantini or Lagartijo!

20
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,291
Oh, come now, Curro.
Not greater than Lagartijo.

21
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,665
<i>Yes! By the life of the blue dove,
even greater than Lagartijo.</i>

22
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,331
<i>- But not greater than Gallardo!
- The boy's right.</i>

23
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:23,206
- Gallardo was a great killer of bulls.
- You mean a butcher.

24
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:26,674
He belonged to the slaughterhouse,
not to the bull ring.

25
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:30,840
- I spit in your milk!
- With his cape and muleta,
Gallardo was phenomenal.

26
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,350
Ah, no. Garabato is
the best bullfighter in the worid.

27
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,013
- Gallardo was the greatest torero of all time!
- Torero?

28
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,024
<i>Who called that perro a torero?
I knew that mamarracho.</i>

29
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,960
I was there the day he was killed.
He trembled like a leaf.

30
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,122
He had cats in his belly.

31
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:05,552
<i>Señor Toro.</i>

32
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,209
<i>¡Ajá, toro! ¡Ajá! ¡: Toro!</i>

33
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,419
<i>¡: Toro! ¡Ajá! ¡Ajá!</i>

34
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,227
¡Ajá, toro! ¡Ajá! ¡Ajá!

35
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,998
¡Ajá! ¡Toro! ¡Ajá!

36
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,045
<i>Toro! Toro! Ajá, toro. Ajá.</i>

37
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,118
<i>Ajá. Toro!</i>

38
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,831
<i>Ajá. ¡Ajá, toro!</i>

39
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:50,138
<i>¡Ajá! ¡Ajá!</i>

40
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,300
Olé! Olé! Superb!

41
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,299
<i>Juanillo! Come here, you rascal!</i>

42
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,741
- Are you hurt?
- No!

43
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:22,874
It was only a caress, nothing more.

44
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,256
And this time I mean it.
Trespassing.

45
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,262
Spoiling our best bulls.
Criminal entry.

46
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,163
<i>Tonight you can sleep in the barn,
but tomorrow morning...</i>

47
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,724
<i>I'm going to turn you over
to the police.</i>

48
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,600
Tell me, muchacho, how did you feel
when you were fighting that bull?

49
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,163
Sort of gay. Very gay.

50
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:51,608
That's the way I always feel
when I fight a bull.

51
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,668
Where did you learn that cape work?

52
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,647
He's been coming here like this
ever since he was that high.

53
00:10:56,716 --> 00:11:00,911
- More of a pest than the fly
that plagued the cattle.
- You weren't afraid?

54
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:06,286
<i>Afraid? Excelencia, I was born under
a good shadow with a cape in my hands.</i>

55
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,416
<i>- That bicho couldn't hurt me.
- ¿Bicho?</i>

56
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:13,155
Do you know that animal's a Miura?

57
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,665
They're only like any others.
My father killed scores of Miura bulls.

58
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,099
The boy's name is Gallardo.

59
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,763
Gallardo.

60
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:25,635
So, that's where you got it.

61
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,696
- You knew my father?
- Quite well.

62
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,675
- Was he a good torero?
- One of the best.

63
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,769
- Ah.
- I was there at Cordoba...

64
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,939
the day your father was killed
by a Miura bull...

65
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:38,179
probably the great-grandfather of the bull
that almost killed you a while ago.

66
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:41,949
<i>There's always been a great feud between
the Gallardo men and the Miura bulls.</i>

67
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,355
They've been killing each other
for generations.

68
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:46,450
My father said
that's what they're made for.

69
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:50,153
When I get to be a matador,
my first formal bull will be a Miura.

70
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:53,789
<i>Excelencia, someday,
I'll make the church bells ring.</i>

71
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:57,824
There, now. When they hang you,
at least you'll be dressed properly.

72
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,700
<i>- Gracias, señor.
- I came here to see bulls.</i>

73
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:02,797
And instead, I saw a bullfighter...

74
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,899
and I must say he is an original.

75
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:08,309
Maestro,
I'm your unconditional admirer.

76
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,370
<i>Oh, thank you, excelencia.</i>

77
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:14,541
Everybody in Spain is the unconditional
admirer of Don Jose Alvarez.

78
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:17,585
Ah. When you become a matador...

79
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,643
perhaps you'll let me be
your impresario.

80
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:25,160
- My hand on it.
- Be sure I'm fully conscious of the honor.
Good evening.

81
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,594
<i>I'm off, Pedro.</i>

82
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,962
<i>God give you a good night, excelencia.</i>

83
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:58,248
<i>Hola! Hola!</i>

84
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:08,393
- Carmencita, I'm sorry to wake you like this.
- You didn't wake me.

85
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,456
- I've been up for hours.
- You have?

86
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:13,095
You should've seen me fight a big,
enormous bull. The biggest.

87
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:16,538
I did see you. I was afraid
the bull might kill you.

88
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:19,599
How many times have I told you?
I can dominate any bull.

89
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,702
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes, but—

90
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,540
Listen. I've gotta tell you
before your father gets back.

91
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:29,276
I didn't come here tonight just to fight a bull.
I wanted to see you and say good-bye.

92
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,818
<i>I'm going to Madrid.</i>

93
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:35,447
- M-Madrid? When?
- First thing in the morning.

94
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,151
- Alone?
- No. The others are going with me.

95
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,423
The whole cuadrilla—
Manolo, Sebastian, Luis and Pablo.

96
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:45,227
- What are you going for?
- You can't be a bullfighter
unless you go to Madrid.

97
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,789
I'm running away.
It's a good thing too. I'm in trouble.

98
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:51,301
<i>Every policía in town
is looking for me right now.</i>

99
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,803
I killed a man.

100
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:56,272
Juanillo!

101
00:13:56,341 --> 00:14:00,407
At La Veronica tonight. A great big
fat goat insulted my father's name.

102
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,644
Said he had cats in his belly.

103
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,779
- So I killed him.
- When will you come back from Madrid?

104
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,847
When I'm the greatest torero
in the worid.

105
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>Then and only then.</i>

106
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,686
<i>- Will you wait for me?
- How long?</i>

107
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,785
How long will you wait?

108
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:18,353
Forever.

109
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,095
You won't have to wait that long,
I promise you.

110
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:25,468
When I come back, I'll be rich and famous
with my name in the papers.

111
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,440
And whatever I have, I'll—

112
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:34,172
And whatever I have,
I'll lay at your feet...

113
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,942
and we'll be married in the church
of San Gil if you're willing.

114
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,539
I'm willing.

115
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,983
Here comes your father.

116
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:45,510
- Good-bye, Carmencita.
- Good-bye, Juanillo.

117
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:16,812
<i>- Olé, Encarnación.
- Granuja. Scum!</i>

118
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,190
Mother's looking for you.
You're going to get it.

119
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:22,589
- Get what, Sister?
- Another broomstick broken over your head.

120
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:25,218
I don't mind that.
I've even brought my own broomstick.

121
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:28,661
A fine brother you are. Your mother and
your sister work their hands to the bone...

122
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,755
while you go off to play with bulls.

123
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:32,891
Not play with them, Encarnación—
fight them.

124
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:36,405
I wish one of them would kill you.
Then we wouldn't have to feed you anymore.

125
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:41,000
The bull that can kill me hasn't been born yet.

126
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,090
- Where did you go last night?
- To practice, Mother.

127
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,432
One doesn't have to practice for death.

128
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,333
You promised you wouldn't
go to the ranch anymore!

129
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:15,871
You knew I couldn't keep my promise.

130
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,443
Oh.

131
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,504
Aren't you going to beat me?

132
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,846
I'm tired of beating you.

133
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,011
Where did you steal those clothes?

134
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,681
I didn't steal them.
I got them from Pedro Espinosa.

135
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:35,519
And who do you suppose I met there?
Don Jose Alvarez.

136
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,286
He saw me fight a bull,
an enormous bull.

137
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,658
He said he was
my unconditional admirer.

138
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,493
He wants to be my manager
when I get to be a matador.

139
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,056
I hope I never see the day.

140
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:48,659
I've made up my mind.
I'm not gonna starve...

141
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:51,570
for the rest of my life
on gazpacho and rotten codfish.

142
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,800
And Encarnación— how about her?

143
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,641
How could she get a husband unless
I make money for her dowry? And you—

144
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:02,703
I don't wanna see you for the rest of your life
on your knees scrubbing floors.

145
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,648
That's what your father said too.

146
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,742
And here I am...

147
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,844
on my knees.

148
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:14,052
Oh, you.

149
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:17,824
You're your father come back
to plague me again.

150
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:20,889
He died once,
and I died a thousand times.

151
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:25,025
Every time he went into the ring.
And now you—

152
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:29,265
you want me to die
a thousand times more.

153
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,831
<i>Madre, I've hurt you a lot...</i>

154
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,900
and maybe I'll hurt you some more.

155
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,503
If I do, please forgive me.

156
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,572
And maybe someday
you'll be proud of me.

157
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,743
Oh!

158
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:55,758
<i>Good-bye, Madrecita.</i>

159
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,861
- Come on. You turn too quick.
- He's no good today.

160
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:02,930
Come on. Just a little more speed
there in your run.

161
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:05,135
<i>- He has no grace.
- Hola, amigos.</i>

162
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,610
- We got something.
- Yeah, a surprise.

163
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,943
- I got it.
- Come over here.

164
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,738
- You'd never guess what it is.
- What is it?

165
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:17,547
- A surprise.
- A horse!

166
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,452
Yes. I got to thinking.

167
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:22,547
Madrid's 600 kilometers from here.

168
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,889
- I found the horse standing
near the road, and I thought—
- Good idea, Manolo.

169
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:28,953
- Wait. That's my horse.
- Who's the leader of this cuadrilla?

170
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:32,398
You may call yourself the leader,
but I'm going to ride the horse.

171
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:36,925
How's it going to look for a matador to walk
while one of his men rides a horse?

172
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,993
I'm going to be a matador too.

173
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:41,562
We might as well agree on one thing
before we start.

174
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,235
There's only one matador in this cuadrilla,
and his name is Juan Gallardo.

175
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:49,476
<i>- Sebastian, are you with me?
- Always.</i>

176
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,574
<i>- Potaje?
- I follow.</i>

177
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,676
<i>- Pablo?
- Me too.</i>

178
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:59,450
- Manolo?
- I'm coming along, all right, but I ride.

179
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:02,185
There's only one way
to settle a matter like this.

180
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,437
- We'll never make it.
- We'll make it.

181
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:41,675
Not by walking.

182
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:45,343
Who said anything about walking?
You men stay here.

183
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,410
What are you gonna do?

184
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,785
- Stop the train.
- How are you gonna stop it?

185
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,881
Have you ever seen a bull
stop a train?

186
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,862
- Yes, but you're not a bull.
- I can stop a bull, so I can stop a train.

187
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:42,464
- God give you a good evening, Senor Engineer.
- What?

188
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:45,563
We're on our way
to the corrida in Madrid.

189
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,766
<i>Mi capitán,
we've come all the way from Sevilla.</i>

190
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,868
<i>We've walked 500 kilometers
already, excelencia.</i>

191
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,514
All right, you whelps of hell.
Get aboard.

192
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,321
Come on, muchachos!

193
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>Compañeros, you may do as you please.</i>

194
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,737
<i>But as for me, I'm through.</i>

195
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:23,436
We're doomed, all of us,
because we haven't got an education.

196
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,503
For 10 years now, we've been risking
our necks in a hundred arenas.

197
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,778
And where are we?
Just where we started from.

198
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,682
How much better it would've been if we'd
joined up with the Workman's Federation...

199
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,777
and served our class.

200
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:39,687
Or at least joined the national militia
and served our country.

201
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,225
As it is, whom have we served?

202
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,784
Nobody, not even ourselves.

203
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,525
One of us hasn't done so badly
for himself.

204
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,194
<i>Eh, Juanillo?</i>

205
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,670
<i>- I can't complain, Manolo.
- I can.</i>

206
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,402
<i>- My pockets are empty.
- You don't make as much as I do.</i>

207
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,237
<i>Your pockets are bulging
with pesetas right now.</i>

208
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,039
Four thousand. Not a bad season.

209
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,512
And someday I'll make twice that much
in one afternoon.

210
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:14,716
Look! Look— my picture!

211
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,816
<i>Now, that's recognition.</i>

212
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:20,157
There's something under it.
What does it say?

213
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:25,294
Huh? Oh.

214
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:32,400
Hey, you! I mean you! Come here!

215
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:35,408
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on!

216
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,743
<i>- Good morning, señores.
- Can you read?</i>

217
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,181
- Yes, thank you.
- Good. Read this.

218
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:46,773
Right there.

219
00:23:57,194 --> 00:24:00,425
- Well, come on. Come on. Read it.
- Let's hear it.

220
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:04,628
<i>Señores, this is an article
by the great critic Curro.</i>

221
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:08,536
<i>In it, he— he praises the merits
of various novilleros...</i>

222
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,537
including Juan Gallardo.

223
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:12,596
- That's me!
- That's him!

224
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:14,766
<i>What does it say?</i>

225
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,774
<i>Let's hear it. Come on.</i>

226
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:23,546
Easily the most promising of the season's
newcomers is Juan Gallardo.

227
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:27,146
His work in the ring is...

228
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:31,283
classic, pure and perfect.

229
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,418
<i>I declare that nothing like it
has been seen...</i>

230
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:39,157
<i>from Fuentes, Garabato
or from anybody else.</i>

231
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:45,101
<i>It will not be long before all Spain
rings with his praise...</i>

232
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:48,140
and Sevilla
should be proud of its son...

233
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,971
whose name will one day
cover it with, uh—

234
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:53,841
with undying glory.

235
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:57,781
- Thank you, amigo.
- The sun comes alas from behind the clouds.

236
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,907
- I tell ya, praise from Curro spells contracts.
- The beginning of history!

237
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,144
- It's only one man's opinion.
- One man's, yes.

238
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:05,244
But when that one man
happens to be Curro—

239
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:10,589
Sevilla. Sevilla.

240
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,755
<i>Sevilla.</i>

241
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:30,173
Look! Look!

242
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,011
You'll have to make a speech.

243
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:42,521
- What'll I say?
- Whatever comes to you.

244
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:35,333
Juanillo! Juanillo!

245
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:40,002
<i>Madrecita!</i>

246
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,317
Nacional, that package.

247
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,656
Huh?

248
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:09,327
<i>- Madrecita.
- Oh!</i>

249
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,535
<i>For you, Madrecita.</i>

250
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:20,979
Oh. Oh, Juanillo.

251
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:08,153
Look at Juan over there.
We do all the work, he takes all the bows.

252
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,190
One of these days,
I'm going out on my own.

253
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,954
- When?
- As soon as I get together a good cuadrilla.

254
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,087
Men like yourselves.
I could use you all.

255
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:20,155
I'll pay you twice what he does.
What do you say, huh?

256
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:23,362
I am not interested.
I am through with bullfighting.

257
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,837
It's the most
reactionary of professions.

258
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:28,306
I renounce it here and now.

259
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:30,844
Someday,
the people will renounce it too.

260
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:34,935
- What about you two?
- First time I ever met Juan Gallardo, we fought.

261
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,540
I was much bigger than Juan,
but he bit off part of my ear...

262
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,641
and part of my heart went with it.

263
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:44,279
I love the man.
I'll work for no other.

264
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,290
- How about you?
- Me too.

265
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,701
Well, now, here are
the two longest faces in Andalucía.

266
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,238
What's the matter?
Aren't you enjoying yourselves?

267
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,900
Encarnación, what's wrong?

268
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:46,271
Antonio Lopez, you tell me.

269
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:50,938
Your sister and I have been engaged now
for four years.

270
00:29:51,014 --> 00:29:54,211
Each year, we've been planning
to get married.

271
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:56,684
- And now—
- Yes?

272
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,727
Now we should be married.

273
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:03,457
Well—Well, that's all right.
Why don't you get married?

274
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:07,433
Antonio's been let out
of the saddlery shop.

275
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:12,802
What'll it take to open
a shop of your own?

276
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:16,238
I should think about 2,000 pesetas.

277
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:18,902
You're in business.

278
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:21,946
You mean—
Oh, thank you very much. Thank you.

279
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:24,038
- It's a wedding present.
- Thank you.

280
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,550
- And I hope it's a boy.
- Yes.

281
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:32,967
Amigos! Amigos! Step up, everybody.

282
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,833
Come up close.

283
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:43,068
Amigos, I have an important
announcement to make.

284
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:47,806
The marriage of my sister Encarnación
to Antonio Lopez...

285
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,144
which will take place
as soon as possible.

286
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,721
In honor of this great occasion...

287
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:12,291
I wish to present you with a few gifts
that I brought you from Madrid.

288
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:18,898
Lorenzo Rodriguez. Angelina Marcos.

289
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:21,569
<i>Carlos.</i>

290
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:23,734
<i>Mateo.</i>

291
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:31,509
<i>Elena. Fernando.</i>

292
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,883
Enrique.

293
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:35,547
No, no. Not that one.

294
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,614
Who's this one for, Juanillo?

295
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:40,092
It's a secret. It's for someone
who isn't here just now.

296
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,915
<i>Hermano.</i>

297
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:08,544
Excuse me, but things have been going
rather badly with me lately.

298
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,814
- I thought maybe you could help a little.
- Garabato.

299
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,822
Yes, I regret to say I am still alive.

300
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,883
But I thought you'd retired and gone
to the country and bought a ranch.

301
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,953
Oh, no, no.

302
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:25,990
No, I left the ring just as I came into it—
without a peseta.

303
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,397
Oh, thank you so much.

304
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:33,997
Oh, thank you. This will—

305
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:36,940
Oh! Juan Gallardo!

306
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,604
Things have been going great
for you lately, haven't they?

307
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,477
Yes, I had a good season.
I look forward to a better one.

308
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,573
Oh, that is good.

309
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:47,449
- I suppose your cuadrilla—
- It's full up just now.

310
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,284
Oh. Oh, well,
I've had a lot of experience.

311
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:52,847
I've spent most of my life
in the bull ring.

312
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,916
I know all the critics.

313
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:57,155
Maybe you could use a sword handler...

314
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,752
or a-a servant in the house, anything.

315
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:04,424
Why not?

316
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,631
Come and, uh—
Come and see me tomorrow.

317
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,766
Thanks.

318
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,650
Good evening, senor.

319
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:32,216
- Is there anything I can get you?
- Yes. I want your band.

320
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,888
<i>- My band?
- Yes, the whole band.</i>

321
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:35,051
Juanillo.

322
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,686
And all the way on the train from Madrid,
I kept worrying and thinking...

323
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:12,159
"Perhaps she's tired of waiting.
Perhaps she's gone away.

324
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:14,219
Perhaps she's even forgotten me."

325
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:16,322
Oh, you couldn't possibly think that.

326
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:20,563
You know, I even thought—You know the first
thing I asked my mother when I got home?

327
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:25,537
"Pedro Espinosa's little girl— the one
with the skinny legs and the funny face—

328
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,903
has she, by any chance,
gotten married yet?"

329
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:30,067
Oh!

330
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:35,872
I can't get over it.

331
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:38,713
I never thought
that you'd grow up to be so—

332
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:41,015
so very nice to look at.

333
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:44,215
Juan, why did you never write to me?

334
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:49,089
Write? Well, you see—

335
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,525
This may sound silly to you,
but I didn't wanna write...

336
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:53,722
until I could sign
my first letter to you...

337
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,095
<i>"Juan Gallardo, Matador de Toros."</i>

338
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:59,629
<i>- You haven't had your alternativa yet?
- No, but I haven't done badly.</i>

339
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,733
Do you know
what I cleared last season...

340
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,143
over and above traveling expenses,
renting costumes and all that?

341
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:07,306
4,000 pesetas.

342
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:09,407
- 4,000?
- Yeah.

343
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:12,279
And that's nothing to what I'll make
later on once I've been recognized.

344
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:15,252
Of course, I'm not entirely
overlooked now, mind you. Not at all.

345
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:18,950
They're beginning to find out who I am.
Take a look at that.

346
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,720
My first press notice,
and by Curro himself.

347
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:24,194
<i>Pretty nice, don't you think?</i>

348
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:32,873
Have you read it?

349
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:35,846
- Of course.
- And you like it?

350
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,474
I think it's wonderful.

351
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,280
- No, read it.
- I have read it.

352
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:46,053
- Read it aloud.
- Juan, I know why you never wrote to me.

353
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,754
It's because you haven't learned
how to write or read.

354
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,626
- Is that it?
- Read what it says.

355
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:55,930
- What for? I've just—
- Read it!

356
00:38:56,002 --> 00:39:00,402
<i>"And here is a newcomer,
a flat-footed novillero from Sevilla...</i>

357
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,236
"taking money under false pretenses.

358
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:08,005
"He has nothing to recommend him
but a certain stupid animal courage...

359
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:12,515
which makes his work in the ring
look more like suicide than battle."

360
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:15,676
When will we be married?

361
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:17,743
There's more. Read it.

362
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:25,023
"He is definitely fifth-rate."
Oh, Juan, when will we be married?

363
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:27,185
Read the rest.

364
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,133
"It's useless to predict a future for him.

365
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:36,193
"He will probably be killed in the ring...

366
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:39,866
<i>long before he advances
from novillero to matador."</i>

367
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:47,405
Well, I— I guess I came back
a little too early.

368
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,376
But you saw me fight bulls
a long time ago.

369
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,475
It's not like that—what it says.

370
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:55,543
- It doesn't matter.
- But it matters to me!

371
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,646
Juanillo, why don't you throw it away
and forget all about it?

372
00:39:58,724 --> 00:40:02,125
No, no. I'm gonna save this.

373
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:05,652
And someday I'll make that Curro
eat his words.

374
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:08,791
Someday I'll come back to you
with a whole trunkful of clippings.

375
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:12,129
And when you marry me,
you'll marry the first torero in Spain.

376
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,568
Not the second or the third, but the first!
The greatest!

377
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,902
I'll go now, Carmen.

378
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,069
- What's in the package?
- Nothing.

379
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:28,243
- Is it for me?
- Well, it's-it's just something that I—

380
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,913
- But, uh—
- What is it?

381
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:34,317
It's nothing, Carmen. I—

382
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:13,613
No, you cannot see him now.
The room is crowded as it is.

383
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,673
But if the matador could only
see his godson just for a minute—

384
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,777
Don't you know any better than to bring
your brats here today of all days...

385
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:24,018
when Senor Gallardo is about to make
his first formal appearance...

386
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:26,184
in his hometown?

387
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,697
- Just for one minute?
- Wednesday. That's the day
Don Juan sees his godchildren.

388
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:33,096
<i>Do you think you're the only one?</i>

389
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,133
<i>Already, he's godfather
to half the infants in Sevilla.</i>

390
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,828
Presently,
we'll have to hire an armory!

391
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:41,463
Oh. How do you do, gentlemen?
Please come right in.

392
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,099
Come right in. Yes.

393
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:00,646
Why can't we go in there?

394
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,850
Not today!

395
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:06,991
<i>I, Curro—</i>

396
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:11,396
<i>I was present the afternoon
of our Juan's formal presentation...</i>

397
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,867
<i>as a matador in Madrid.</i>

398
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,372
<i>He fought a Miura bull
as big as a cathedral.</i>

399
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:21,395
<i>Never in my life have I seen
such sincerity...</i>

400
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:25,035
<i>such purity, such lightheartedness...</i>

401
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:29,343
<i>and, above all, such serene valor.</i>

402
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:32,179
<i>Let me read you what I wrote
that night in the Heraldo.</i>

403
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:34,652
I have the clipping right here with me.

404
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:40,320
"Rejoice, ye faithful.

405
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:43,227
"There's an end to the decay
of our great art.

406
00:43:43,297 --> 00:43:46,661
"We are on the eve
of a great renaissance.

407
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,392
"Cid Campeador has returned...

408
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:51,900
"to bring back the glory of Spain.

409
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:56,531
The arena has come back once more
to passion and dignity."

410
00:43:56,607 --> 00:44:00,043
- Olé. Olé.
- At last, Sevilla has a matador.

411
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,908
The greatest matador of all history.

412
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,780
A saint.
The first man of the worid.

413
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,214
The day he was born,
there was salt in the air...

414
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:13,185
a great quantity of salt.

415
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,347
Olé. Olé.

416
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:18,324
<i>You should have seen him at the corrida
of the Feast of the Anunciación.</i>

417
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:21,020
He was so near the bull, next day...

418
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:25,396
Garabato spent hours picking
the bull's hairs out of Juan's clothes.

419
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:28,527
<i>Olé. Olé.</i>

420
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:38,166
<i>Gorgeous! It must cost a fortune!</i>

421
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:42,270
I don't know whether Juan
mentioned it to you or not...

422
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:44,873
but it was I who financed
his early career.

423
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,818
- For years, I had to support his whole family.
- Really?

424
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,980
<i>What a corrida.</i>

425
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,890
Ah, his cape work was magnificent.

426
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,256
You would have given a thousand pesetas
to see Juanillo with that bull.

427
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,352
I tell you, he had it on a string.

428
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:05,128
Don Jose, you never saw
such arrogance and grace.

429
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:08,068
- Yes, I did, once.
- What corrida was that?

430
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:13,633
That was a dozen years ago when I saw
a very little boy fight a very big bull.

431
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,943
Curro, that was the night you and I met
and split that bottle of wine together.

432
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:23,245
<i>- Remember?
- Yes, I've carried the scar ever since.</i>

433
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:27,777
My most prized possession, gentlemen,
since it was given me by Juan Gallardo.

434
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:34,822
<i>I didn't see you again until you fought
as a novillero in Madrid.</i>

435
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:37,921
Oh, yes. You wrote a piece
in the paper about me.

436
00:45:37,998 --> 00:45:40,159
You said I was definitely fifth-rate.

437
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:45,464
I know. But the next time I saw you
in the ring, you were a different man.

438
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:48,664
- Something must've happened to you.
- I got married.

439
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,819
Yes, those were the lean days...

440
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:05,327
when I fought both bulls
and hunger at the same time.

441
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:07,726
Curro, have you ever been hungry?

442
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:12,788
Never. I've frequently been thirsty.

443
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:14,856
Well, I can tell you this.

444
00:46:14,934 --> 00:46:19,200
The gore of hunger is worse
than the horns of a bull.

445
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:23,368
My friends have said to me, "Juanillo,
life's been very magnificent to you.

446
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:27,004
How does it feel to be way up there
on top of the ladder?"

447
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,538
Then I think of all the good things
that have happened to me...

448
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:33,707
and one thing stands out
above everything else.

449
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:36,183
I can buy all the food
my belly can hold...

450
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,710
and my friends' bellies, and I don't have
to ask the price of anything anymore.

451
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,398
Now I'm ready for the grave.

452
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,870
I've just come
from the drawing of the bulls.

453
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:58,235
We've got something on our hands
this afternoon.

454
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:01,332
We've drawn a couple of
the meanest-looking beasts I've ever seen.

455
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:04,742
- Sluggish, treacherous—
- What difference? A bull's a bull.

456
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:07,337
They're all alike to Juanillo.
All safe.

457
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:10,213
Senor Lopez, have you ever
faced a bull in the ring?

458
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:15,085
- Well, not exactly.
- There is no such thing as a safe bull.

459
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:17,954
And these two are monsters
with lightning in their horns.

460
00:47:18,025 --> 00:47:21,856
I'm a humble man with no education,
and my life isn't worth very much.

461
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:24,019
<i>But you, maestro—</i>

462
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:27,895
The cow hasn't been born yet that can
give birth to the bull that can hurt me.

463
00:47:27,966 --> 00:47:30,127
<i>Olé! Olé!</i>

464
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:33,638
That's what I say. You either dominate
the bull, or the bull dominates you.

465
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:35,970
Now, then—

466
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,975
I will not listen
to your ignorance and folly...

467
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:41,410
which incapacitates you for any
further views in relation to bulls.

468
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,711
And I think it would be well
if you were all to go now...

469
00:47:44,784 --> 00:47:47,113
and give Juan a few minutes' rest
before his ordeal.

470
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:49,743
Caballeros, Nacional's right.
We'd better be going.

471
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:52,379
Good luck, senor.

472
00:47:52,455 --> 00:47:54,923
<i>Gracias.</i>

473
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:04,162
Parasites.

474
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:07,828
Most of them come here to get a free ticket
to the corrida or to borrow money.

475
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:11,337
They'll be the first to turn against you
the moment you have any bad luck.

476
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:14,862
Wait for me in the carriage.

477
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,240
It's all ignorance and superstition...

478
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:23,272
from not knowing
how to read or write.

479
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,664
Hot, isn't it?

480
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:47,364
One always sweats the big drop
on the morning of an afternoon.

481
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:51,636
They used to crowd into my dressing room,
too, when I was dressing...

482
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:54,940
like a wake before one's dead.

483
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:00,473
Garabato.

484
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:04,382
I wouldn't admit this
to anyone else in the worid...

485
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:07,080
but always when I'm dressing like this...

486
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:11,555
there's a feel of rust in my throat.

487
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:14,061
The taste of death.

488
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:16,222
Fear.

489
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,859
But it's gone
when I step into the arena.

490
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:25,529
The minute I hear the music,
the yell of the crowd, it's all right again.

491
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,845
<i>Chiquillo.</i>

492
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:44,911
- How do you feel?
- Good as bread.

493
00:49:44,988 --> 00:49:48,048
- And you?
- Oh, I wish it were this time tomorrow.

494
00:49:48,124 --> 00:49:50,217
You've gotta learn not to worry.

495
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:53,660
Please let me worry just a little bit.
Makes me feel better.

496
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,068
You wouldn't worry if you'd heard
what Curro just said about me.

497
00:49:57,138 --> 00:50:00,107
"At last, Sevilla has a matador,"
he said.

498
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:02,267
My jacket.

499
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:08,910
"The greatest matador in history,"
he said.

500
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,005
I've kept my promise, haven't I?

501
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:13,141
<i>My montera.</i>

502
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:19,689
He said I was
the first man of the worid.

503
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:21,953
That makes you the first lady.

504
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,324
Well, how do I look?

505
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:38,799
Like a king.

506
00:50:40,475 --> 00:50:44,809
Or a little boy
all dressed up for a party.

507
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:50,211
Somehow, I feel this is gonna be
a great afternoon.

508
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:52,311
I wish you were
gonna be there with me.

509
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:54,822
I'm always with you, Juan.

510
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:59,052
Carmen, what do you do with yourself
when I'm in the ring?

511
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,219
<i>I pray to La Macarena every second...</i>

512
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:05,230
and every second is an hour.

513
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:10,167
When the sun begins to go down,
I- I look up the street, and there's no Juan.

514
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,728
My heart stops beating.

515
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:17,766
But then I hear cheers and I see
people running and I know it's Juan—

516
00:51:17,844 --> 00:51:22,574
Juan coming home— and my heart
starts beating again like a drum.

517
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:31,921
You're the only true one in the worid.

518
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,224
Now, go.

519
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:08,107
<i>And here, mon ami,
is where the espadas come...</i>

520
00:53:08,175 --> 00:53:12,044
to offer their devotions
and seek protection of the saints.

521
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,913
Does it save them
from being gored by the bulls?

522
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:19,009
Sometimes.

523
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:23,991
There's no guarantee,
not even from the saints.

524
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:40,507
Who is that?

525
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:44,872
I don't know. A new one.

526
00:54:36,894 --> 00:54:39,624
Every ticket has been sold.

527
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,119
You're lucky to be here this afternoon.

528
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,124
You'll see history made.

529
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:51,626
From now on,
the calendar of the bull ring...

530
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,789
will be figured as B.G. And A.G. —

531
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:57,958
Before Gallardo and After Gallardo.

532
00:55:58,034 --> 00:56:00,662
I, Curro, say it.

533
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:05,398
I see she's back from Paris.

534
00:56:08,476 --> 00:56:12,741
- Who is she?
- Dona Sol de Miura.

535
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:17,648
What I could tell you about that one
would fill a whole book— several books.

536
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:20,312
If this is death in the afternoon...

537
00:56:20,387 --> 00:56:24,154
she is death in the evening.

538
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:54,380
I promise that this afternoon you'll see
something extraordinary and unforgettable.

539
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,612
What is it I'm going to see that's
so extraordinary and unforgettable?

540
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,883
Since you've been away,
a new star has arisen.

541
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:03,857
His name is Juan Gallardo.

542
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,648
Charges straight. Favors the left horn.

543
00:58:56,897 --> 00:59:00,128
<i>- Olé!
- Toro.</i>

544
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,567
Olé!

545
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:07,701
Olé!

546
00:59:10,144 --> 00:59:12,135
Olé!

547
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:14,237
<i>Toro!</i>

548
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:19,251
<i>Olé! Olé!</i>

549
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:22,183
Olé!

550
00:59:22,253 --> 00:59:26,656
Olé!

551
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:53,871
Olé!

552
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,378
Olé!

553
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:02,322
Olé!

554
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,222
<i>Olé!</i>

555
01:00:04,293 --> 01:00:07,956
<i>- Olé!
- Toro!</i>

556
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:13,556
Olé! Olé! Olé!

557
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:21,239
Olé! Olé!

558
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,605
Olé!

559
01:00:56,504 --> 01:00:59,905
Oh, you were magnificent.

560
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:03,137
<i>Olé!</i>

561
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:11,014
Olé!

562
01:01:26,765 --> 01:01:29,632
I dedicate the death of this noble bull...

563
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:33,137
to the beauty of the women of Spain.

564
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:45,478
Olé! Olé!

565
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:49,444
Olé!

566
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:56,561
Olé!

567
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:02,502
Olé!

568
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:27,717
Olé! Olé!

569
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:01,349
I tell you, he's the greatest of the great!

570
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,888
The first man of the worid!

571
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,282
The other side of the curtain.

572
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:54,824
Well, at least the poor beast
didn't die in vain.

573
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:57,700
Hunger. Hunger!
I tell you, I'm finished.

574
01:03:57,772 --> 01:03:59,763
I'm through with this rotten business.

575
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,104
I swear to you, this is my last season.

576
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:36,133
I dedicate the death of this noble bull...

577
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,733
to the beauty of—

578
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,183
Ah.

579
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,532
Ah, Carmen.

580
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,626
Oh, where—where are the newspapers?

581
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,468
I'll get them and read them to you personally.
They were wonderful, dear.

582
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,168
All Sevilla is ringing
with your name this morning...

583
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,302
and it's my name too.

584
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,270
Now, come here, now. There.

585
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:24,315
Who did you
dedicate the bull to yesterday?

586
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,978
<i>- Oh, some gachi.
- Who?</i>

587
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:29,818
I don't know what her name was.
I never saw her before.

588
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,882
- Then why did you dedicate it?
- She was with a party of swells...

589
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,588
and it pays to keep in
with people of that kind.

590
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:38,426
- She threw me some flowers.
- I hate her.

591
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,524
Was she pretty?

592
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:42,728
Mmm, not bad.

593
01:05:42,803 --> 01:05:44,825
Prettier than me?

594
01:05:44,902 --> 01:05:46,961
That's impossible.

595
01:05:49,907 --> 01:05:52,171
Then I don't hate her anymore.

596
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:55,406
Still, she, uh— she wasn't so bad.

597
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:58,248
- Blue eyes and, uh—
- I don't like her.

598
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,585
- But too skinny.
- I guess she's all right.

599
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,456
Come on, now. Eat your breakfast.

600
01:06:16,669 --> 01:06:19,137
<i>Do you know you came home last night
without your montera?</i>

601
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:21,435
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm. What became of it?

602
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:25,273
I don't know.
I must've left it somewhere.

603
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:28,211
<i>Come in.</i>

604
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:33,215
<i>- A messenger just brought
this note for el matador.
- Thank you.</i>

605
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:42,147
- Will you read it for me?
- Mm-hmm.

606
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:47,721
- Who's it from?
- Well, there's no signature,
but... it's from a woman.

607
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:49,993
Oh, well, then tear it up.

608
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:53,833
Oh. It's from the woman
you dedicated the bull to.

609
01:06:53,904 --> 01:06:56,062
What's it say?

610
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,766
<i>"Senor Juan Gallardo, thank you for
dedicating the first bull to me yesterday.</i>

611
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:02,241
<i>"If you want back the montera
you threw me...</i>

612
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,108
"you may have it by calling for it
tonight at 8:00.

613
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:07,909
The address is Number Four,
Plaza de Alfaro."

614
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,440
<i>- Your montera.
- Oh, yes.</i>

615
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,612
Oh, yes, it all comes back to me now.

616
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:16,657
<i>I threw the gachi my hat,
and she refused to part with it.</i>

617
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:18,749
She seems willing now.

618
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,621
Well, if she thinks I'm gonna call for it,
she'll grow old waiting.

619
01:07:21,693 --> 01:07:25,026
Oh. Why shouldn't you call for it?

620
01:07:25,096 --> 01:07:29,795
She must be somebody of great importance
if she lives at the Plaza de Alfaro.

621
01:07:29,868 --> 01:07:34,033
Number Four.
That's where the Marques de Miura lives.

622
01:07:34,106 --> 01:07:36,666
She must be his niece.

623
01:07:36,742 --> 01:07:38,767
What does she look like?

624
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:40,971
I don't remember. Just a woman.

625
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:43,877
Well, if she's just a woman,
why don't you wanna go?

626
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:45,971
Let's not argue about it.
I'm not going.

627
01:07:46,048 --> 01:07:48,039
- You're not?
- No.

628
01:07:48,117 --> 01:07:51,177
- Oh, I'm glad.
- Glad? A moment ago, you were just saying—

629
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:54,189
As long as you don't want to go,
you can go.

630
01:07:54,257 --> 01:07:56,350
Give me that note.

631
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:04,394
Now, run and get the papers
and read me the notices.

632
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:06,560
All right.

633
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:21,343
<i>- Mmm. What are these?
- Potatoes.</i>

634
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:23,474
They're so small.

635
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,383
They're good though.
Not as good as gazpacho.

636
01:08:26,453 --> 01:08:28,478
You ever eat that?

637
01:08:28,555 --> 01:08:31,546
- I don't think so.
- I was raised on it.

638
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:33,647
Really? How is it made?

639
01:08:33,724 --> 01:08:37,387
Well, you take biscuits
and oil and vinegar...

640
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:39,929
and some, um, onions and garlic...

641
01:08:39,997 --> 01:08:42,022
and you, uh— and bread crumbs—

642
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:44,090
and you fry 'em all together in a pan.

643
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:47,604
Then you throw them all in a pot—
gazpacho.

644
01:08:47,672 --> 01:08:50,072
- Sounds lovely.
- You oughta try it sometime.

645
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:54,202
- I will.
- Dona Sol likes to try everything.

646
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:56,573
Yeah, me too.

647
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,505
If I were a man, I'd try bullfighting.

648
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:03,948
There's nothing more exciting.

649
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,282
Oh, this is fine meat. What is it?

650
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,353
- Pheasant.
- I could eat a dozen of'em.

651
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:18,867
You know, when I retire,
I'm gonna raise pheasants and bulls.

652
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,868
Senor, may I ask what brand
of perfume you use?

653
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:30,642
I- I forget the name of it,
but it's the most expensive there is.

654
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:35,875
<i>It's certainly the strongest. But since you
spend most of your time with horses and bulls—</i>

655
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:38,348
I like the smell of horses and bulls.

656
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:43,212
Well, if, uh, we want to hear Galli,
we'll have to hurry.

657
01:09:43,289 --> 01:09:46,813
Senor Gallardo, I hope you'll join us.

658
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:51,883
- Where are you going?
- Tito Galli, the Italian tenor,
is a friend of Dona Sol's.

659
01:09:51,961 --> 01:09:54,225
He's giving a concert,
and if you'd care to go—

660
01:09:54,297 --> 01:09:56,293
No, thank you. Not me.

661
01:09:56,371 --> 01:09:59,636
I'm afraid I'll have to beg out too.

662
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:02,369
One of my nasty headaches.

663
01:10:02,443 --> 01:10:05,310
Oh. That's too bad.

664
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,515
- I hope you feel better soon.
- Thank you.

665
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,814
Please explain to Tito.
He'll understand.

666
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:18,151
I'm sure he will. We all do.

667
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:22,489
I am so sorry about your headache.

668
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,394
- I'm sure you'll take something for it, won't you?
- Yes, of course.

669
01:10:26,464 --> 01:10:28,796
Well, good night.

670
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:34,464
- Or is it good-bye?
- Pierre, why do you say that?

671
01:10:34,536 --> 01:10:36,936
In the army,
we learn many signal calls...

672
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:39,098
including retreat.

673
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:50,519
- Thank you, Pierre.
- Good-bye.

674
01:10:50,586 --> 01:10:52,679
Good-bye.

675
01:11:09,702 --> 01:11:12,193
If I want you, I'll call.

676
01:11:37,281 --> 01:11:39,647
- How's your headache?
- Better, thank you.

677
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:41,810
Hmm. Well, I—

678
01:11:41,886 --> 01:11:43,874
Please sit down.

679
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:50,153
I must say, senora,
that's the best meal I've ever eaten.

680
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:56,460
It's the least I can give you
for an afternoon of great emotion.

681
01:11:56,531 --> 01:12:00,160
You followed your star yesterday.

682
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,465
You were inspired.

683
01:12:02,537 --> 01:12:07,270
Mmm. Who wouldn't be inspired?
I'd seen you.

684
01:12:07,341 --> 01:12:09,330
I wasn't bad, was I?

685
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,271
Would you like to play chess?

686
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:18,339
No, thanks.

687
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:21,580
I'm much too comfortable.

688
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:24,555
Matter of fact,
I don't know how to play chess.

689
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:29,755
Matter of fact, I'm the most ignorant man
in the worid except with bulls.

690
01:12:29,829 --> 01:12:33,023
I'm glad you decided
not to go to the concert.

691
01:12:33,096 --> 01:12:35,360
So am I.

692
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:38,423
Perhaps we can have
a concert of our own.

693
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:42,938
- You play something?
- The guitar, a little.

694
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,266
Do you like music?

695
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:50,244
Some music, yes.

696
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:56,209
The first music I remember
was the clanging of the bells...

697
01:12:56,283 --> 01:12:59,980
<i>that hung from the necks of the cabestros
when they led the herd.</i>

698
01:13:00,053 --> 01:13:04,547
<i>And l— I loved the singing of the vaqueros
on the ranch of your uncle, the marquis.</i>

699
01:13:04,624 --> 01:13:08,220
I love the music of the gypsies
in the Café la Veronica.

700
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:13,757
Play something.

701
01:17:40,343 --> 01:17:44,299
- Juanillo.
- Put it on. Let's see how it looks on you.

702
01:17:44,378 --> 01:17:48,041
- Here.
- Oh, that's beautiful!

703
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:51,710
Oh, that's too gorgeous for words.

704
01:17:51,785 --> 01:17:53,776
I looked all over Sevilla for it.

705
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:56,487
I wanted to give you
something especially fine.

706
01:17:56,562 --> 01:18:00,259
But why, dear? What's happened?
Why did you get this for me?

707
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:04,132
<i>Because, querida,
you're the only true one in the worid.</i>

708
01:18:33,693 --> 01:18:36,218
<i>¡Ajá, toro!</i>

709
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,196
If you want to know why he spends
all his time at the Plaza Alfaro...

710
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:22,895
it's because he has nothing
to keep him at home.

711
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,406
He goes to another woman because
his own woman is nothing. Nothing!

712
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:28,908
Perhaps if you'd give him
a son or two—

713
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:32,174
<i>- Encarnación!
- You can say anything you like about me...</i>

714
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:35,739
but I won't hear one word
against Juan— not a word.

715
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:37,842
If he'd only take my advice.

716
01:19:37,919 --> 01:19:40,820
Where is his gratitude
after all I've done for him?

717
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:43,753
Just what have you done for him?

718
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:46,552
- What has he done for me?
- Why, everything.

719
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:50,254
He set you up in business.
He lets you live in his house.

720
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:52,820
Who says it's his house?
He and his fine gestures!

721
01:19:52,898 --> 01:19:54,889
Buys a house and doesn't pay for it.

722
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:57,697
Well, mark my words,
one fine day we'll all be thrown out.

723
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,705
He's no good in the ring anymore.
He's afraid of a scratch!

724
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:02,764
<i>It might interfere with his evenings.</i>

725
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:06,277
<i>He neglects you, his family, his friends.
He makes a fool ofhimself.</i>

726
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:08,970
<i>He's a lazy, drunken, worthless—</i>

727
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:17,784
You rotten little worms.
You aren't fit to mention his name.

728
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:21,449
You ingrates! Hypocrites! Maggots!

729
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,550
He gave you everything you have!

730
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:25,891
He supports you and your children!

731
01:20:25,962 --> 01:20:30,126
He shares everything he has, and you—
behind his back, you sneer at him and criticize!

732
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,290
You pick at him like vultures!

733
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:49,981
I can't stand it
in this house any longer.

734
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:52,712
I'm going away.

735
01:20:52,786 --> 01:20:56,480
No, Carmen, no. You'll stay.

736
01:20:56,554 --> 01:20:59,955
You'll stay with Juan until the end.

737
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:05,060
The end?

738
01:21:05,129 --> 01:21:10,432
Tell me, on those days
when Juan goes to the ring...

739
01:21:10,502 --> 01:21:12,629
to whom do you pray?

740
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,730
To Our Lady of Hope, La Macarena.

741
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:18,298
What do you ask La Macarena?

742
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:23,140
I ask that she watch over our Juan
and keep him safe from any hurt.

743
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,812
So I used to pray for his father.

744
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,444
It was no good.

745
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,853
In the end, it was no good.

746
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:39,019
The Virgin— She's only a woman.

747
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,390
And women can do so little.

748
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:48,591
Now I pray to a man God—

749
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:51,602
Jesus of great power.

750
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:58,514
What I ask is something different.

751
01:21:58,582 --> 01:22:01,608
<i>Madre, what do you ask for?</i>

752
01:22:01,685 --> 01:22:07,019
I pray to him to let my son
be gored in the ring.

753
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:12,348
Not to die, but to be hurt...

754
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:16,522
so he may cheat the end
which every torero meets.

755
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:20,055
Yes, that's what I pray for.

756
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:26,304
And I pray to him
not to send you a son...

757
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:30,037
for he'll only grow up
to torment you...

758
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:34,738
and let you die every Sunday afternoon...

759
01:22:36,881 --> 01:22:39,611
just as you are dying now.

760
01:23:03,105 --> 01:23:05,505
Dear Lady of Good Hope...

761
01:23:05,575 --> 01:23:08,271
please watch over my husband, Juan.

762
01:23:08,344 --> 01:23:13,475
He'll be safe and sound, my child.

763
01:23:16,452 --> 01:23:22,115
And if you see fit, please put in his heart
a wish to retire from the bull ring.

764
01:23:23,356 --> 01:23:27,725
That, too, when the time comes.

765
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:30,923
And one thing more, Macarena...

766
01:23:30,998 --> 01:23:34,593
and this is what I really came
to see you about.

767
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:37,899
I know what it is.

768
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:40,805
I can read it in your heart.

769
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:45,605
It's been there a long time,
and you've held it back...

770
01:23:45,676 --> 01:23:48,362
even from me.

771
01:23:48,496 --> 01:23:51,329
Why, I didn't mean to.
Really, I didn't.

772
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:53,833
It's just that I didn't want to hurt Juan.

773
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:57,894
But I've got to do something.
I can't go on living like this.

774
01:23:57,972 --> 01:24:02,204
Dear Macarena, help me.
Please help me.

775
01:24:02,276 --> 01:24:04,938
Tell me what to do about that woman.

776
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:07,944
That woman—

777
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:14,383
<i>¡Ajá, toro!</i>

778
01:24:14,452 --> 01:24:16,545
<i>¡Ajá, toro!</i>

779
01:24:16,621 --> 01:24:19,090
<i>¡Ajá, ajá, toro!</i>

780
01:24:30,002 --> 01:24:32,331
That's good. Very good.

781
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,392
<i>¡Ajá, toro!</i>

782
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:55,152
Excuse me, Juanillo.

783
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:10,295
Senora Gallardo to see you.

784
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:14,500
Have her come in.

785
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:43,294
I came to see you
on the advice of a friend.

786
01:25:43,364 --> 01:25:46,458
Yes? Please be seated.

787
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:48,559
Thank you.

788
01:25:48,636 --> 01:25:51,764
Senora Gallardo,
is there anything I can offer you?

789
01:25:51,839 --> 01:25:55,177
Yes. My husband.

790
01:25:55,248 --> 01:25:57,978
Oh?

791
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:03,181
Please believe me.
I came here in no spirit of rancor.

792
01:26:03,256 --> 01:26:05,656
I'm not here to judge.

793
01:26:05,725 --> 01:26:09,123
I can understand your
being interested in my husband.

794
01:26:09,192 --> 01:26:13,629
He's the first man in Spain,
the greatest in his profession.

795
01:26:13,696 --> 01:26:17,894
<i>- Naturally, all women run after him.
- Naturally.</i>

796
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:22,502
I can understand
his interest in you too...

797
01:26:22,572 --> 01:26:26,975
especially now that I see
how beautiful you are.

798
01:26:27,043 --> 01:26:29,102
Thank you.

799
01:26:29,178 --> 01:26:31,973
Perhaps it's my fault.

800
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:34,536
Perhaps if I were more beautiful...

801
01:26:34,614 --> 01:26:37,048
better educated
and of a better family.

802
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:40,883
I know of your family. Your father works
for my uncle on the ranch, I believe.

803
01:26:40,954 --> 01:26:45,483
Yes, he's the overseer there.
All my life I've heard about you.

804
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,790
What have you heard?

805
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:51,127
- Shall I be frank?
- Please do.

806
01:26:52,633 --> 01:26:55,394
I've heard that you've
been all over the worid...

807
01:26:55,466 --> 01:26:58,333
that you speak many languages...

808
01:26:58,403 --> 01:27:01,895
and that you've known
a great many men.

809
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:03,998
Go on.

810
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:07,511
I've never been out of Andalucía...

811
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:10,810
I speak only one language...

812
01:27:10,882 --> 01:27:15,319
and I've had only one man.

813
01:27:15,386 --> 01:27:18,411
Maybe that's why
I want so much to keep him.

814
01:27:22,557 --> 01:27:26,049
Tell me,
have you discussed this with Juan?

815
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:29,153
- No.
- Why not?

816
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:31,825
It would hurt him.

817
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:37,562
Just a minute, please.

818
01:27:46,646 --> 01:27:49,410
<i>¡Ajá, toro!</i>

819
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,211
Garabato!

820
01:30:25,994 --> 01:30:27,985
Garabato!

821
01:30:34,767 --> 01:30:37,099
<i>Oh, good morning, Madrecita.</i>

822
01:30:37,169 --> 01:30:39,228
Good afternoon, my son.

823
01:30:39,304 --> 01:30:41,932
- Where's Garabato?
- He's gone.

824
01:30:42,007 --> 01:30:45,409
- Gone?
- You let him go last night.

825
01:30:45,478 --> 01:30:48,447
Don't you remember?

826
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:52,747
Oh, yes. Yes, we had a row
about something he did.

827
01:30:52,819 --> 01:30:56,343
- What was it?
- He asked for his wages.

828
01:30:56,419 --> 01:30:59,286
You haven't paid him in months.

829
01:30:59,356 --> 01:31:02,917
He had an offer from Manolo de Palma.

830
01:31:02,993 --> 01:31:07,555
Well, that's fine.
I picked him up when he was a beggar.

831
01:31:07,631 --> 01:31:11,089
I took him when nobody else would
have him, and now he leaves me.

832
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:13,796
Why wasn't he paid?
Why didn't Don Jose attend to it?

833
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,895
I don't know.

834
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:19,029
The only people who come
to the house these days...

835
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,540
are tradesmen with unpaid bills—

836
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:24,577
shoemakers, tailors, dozens of others.

837
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:28,581
I don't understand it. The more money
I make, the less I seem to have.

838
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,710
- It melts away before I ever see it.
- Yes.

839
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,550
One can't build on sand.

840
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,316
I'll answer it.

841
01:32:06,349 --> 01:32:08,748
- Good afternoon, Juanillo.
- Don Jose.

842
01:32:08,817 --> 01:32:11,479
I've been in the country,
over at the ranch.

843
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,317
There's something
I want to talk over with you.

844
01:32:14,389 --> 01:32:17,187
Well, uh, make yourself comfortable.

845
01:32:19,729 --> 01:32:22,129
How is everything at the ranch?

846
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:24,860
- I saw Carmen.
- How is she?

847
01:32:24,934 --> 01:32:28,927
It's a great pity that one so young
should be already finished with life.

848
01:32:29,005 --> 01:32:34,668
But that's what happens when you have
only one thing in life and you lose it.

849
01:32:34,741 --> 01:32:36,936
Let's not talk about that.

850
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,969
But we've got to talk about it.
That's what I came here for.

851
01:32:41,047 --> 01:32:44,949
What's the use? She had a right to leave,
and she left. That's all there is to it.

852
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:48,920
Is it? Did you want her to leave?

853
01:32:48,989 --> 01:32:51,514
No.

854
01:32:51,591 --> 01:32:54,218
Do you still love her?

855
01:33:03,267 --> 01:33:06,362
- Yes.
- And the other one?

856
01:33:06,437 --> 01:33:09,235
That's an entirely different thing.

857
01:33:09,307 --> 01:33:14,108
Juan, listen to me. I've known both of these
women ever since they were children.

858
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:18,475
I'm sorry for Carmen,
and I pity Dona Sol.

859
01:33:18,546 --> 01:33:20,605
Why should you pity her?

860
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:25,119
Because there's nothing in the worid
that she can hold on to for long. Nothing.

861
01:33:25,186 --> 01:33:28,451
<i>When she was a little girl,
she used to tire of all her toys...</i>

862
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,991
and throw them away
while they were still new.

863
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:34,051
- Now, my advice to you—
- Don Jose, you're my manager...

864
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:37,030
and I'm willing to take your advice
on matters of business.

865
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:39,999
But in personal matters,
I don't have to listen to you!

866
01:33:40,068 --> 01:33:43,034
Why don't you leave me alone
and stop interfering with me!

867
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:46,161
Maybe I don't know how to read
or write, but this I do know—

868
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:48,832
I've made tons of money,
and what's become of it?

869
01:33:48,907 --> 01:33:51,842
I've never had an accounting from you
or that thieving Lopez either.

870
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:54,037
- From me?
- Senor Lopez.

871
01:33:54,112 --> 01:33:56,881
You've always wanted to be
your brother-in-law's manager.

872
01:33:56,954 --> 01:34:00,355
As far as I'm concerned, you may have
that honor from this moment on.

873
01:34:00,424 --> 01:34:02,551
And I can tell you this:

874
01:34:02,626 --> 01:34:06,719
If you sign any contracts for him,
he'll be taking money under false pretenses.

875
01:34:06,794 --> 01:34:10,389
And here's some bills you'd better pay,
if you can find the money.

876
01:34:13,968 --> 01:34:17,904
Well, now as my manager,
it'll be much easier for you to rob me.

877
01:34:17,972 --> 01:34:20,839
Do you think I'd let my husband
have anything to do with you?

878
01:34:20,908 --> 01:34:24,105
To be a manager, one must have something
to manage! And what are you? Nothing!

879
01:34:24,178 --> 01:34:27,545
- Encarnación.
- Your money—You've spent it, thrown it away!

880
01:34:27,614 --> 01:34:29,775
<i>You haven't even paid
for the house you live in!</i>

881
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,179
<i>And we're not going to live
in it anymore either!</i>

882
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:36,049
<i>We're not going to get soiled
in the scandal that drove your wife away!</i>

883
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,281
I understand.

884
01:34:38,356 --> 01:34:41,883
They say that when a ship is sinking,
all the rats leave.

885
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:44,155
Good-bye, rats!

886
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:49,027
But you're mistaken
if you think I'm sinking.

887
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:52,036
Well, what are you waiting for?

888
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:13,221
<i>Rejoice, ye faithful.</i>

889
01:35:13,288 --> 01:35:17,622
<i>At last, Sevilla has a matador.</i>

890
01:35:17,693 --> 01:35:21,751
<i>The greatest matador of all history.</i>

891
01:35:21,827 --> 01:35:24,261
<i>A saint.</i>

892
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:27,697
<i>The first man of the worid.</i>

893
01:35:27,767 --> 01:35:31,602
<i>The day he was born,
there was salt in the air.</i>

894
01:35:31,671 --> 01:35:34,868
<i>A great quantity of salt.</i>

895
01:35:58,429 --> 01:36:00,590
Well, what can you expect from a herd...

896
01:36:00,664 --> 01:36:03,132
that, for the most part,
can't read or write?

897
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,929
They enjoy the pleasure
of a tragic emotion...

898
01:36:06,002 --> 01:36:08,662
without the slightest danger
to themselves.

899
01:36:08,736 --> 01:36:11,762
They scream with a lust for blood.

900
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,504
As for the people
who sit in the shade...

901
01:36:15,576 --> 01:36:17,601
at least they can afford it.

902
01:36:17,678 --> 01:36:20,273
But the citizens of the sun,
they pay five pesetas—

903
01:36:20,348 --> 01:36:22,680
a whole day's pay,
enough to feed a family—

904
01:36:22,751 --> 01:36:24,878
to fry on the sunny side of the ring...

905
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:27,945
while they watch a few bulls
being butchered— a criminal business.

906
01:36:28,023 --> 01:36:32,047
If it's a criminal business, Nacional,
why are you still in it?

907
01:36:32,124 --> 01:36:36,686
The truth of the matter is that Juan Gallardo
owes me practically a year's pay.

908
01:36:36,762 --> 01:36:38,992
As soon as I can collect my back wages...

909
01:36:39,064 --> 01:36:41,396
I'm going to quit
this repulsive trade forever.

910
01:36:41,467 --> 01:36:43,594
I swear this is my last season.

911
01:37:03,752 --> 01:37:07,382
You fool! Stop dousing me
with that stinking stuff!

912
01:37:07,457 --> 01:37:09,448
I only did it to kill the smell
of rum on your breath.

913
01:37:09,526 --> 01:37:11,668
Well, I'll thank you to mind your own business.
I know what you're up to.

914
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:18,062
- If you're looking for an excuse to quit me, say so.
- Why, I wouldn't quit you.

915
01:37:18,139 --> 01:37:21,904
But it isn't right for you to fill yourself
with rum on the day of a corrida.

916
01:37:21,975 --> 01:37:26,503
<i>You don't have to worry about the bulls
this afternoon. We drew a couple of bravos.</i>

917
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,071
It's not the bulls. It's the crowd.

918
01:37:29,149 --> 01:37:32,016
They're waiting for me with claws.

919
01:37:32,085 --> 01:37:34,918
The crowd is forgetful, Juanillo,
like a woman.

920
01:37:34,988 --> 01:37:38,480
And fickle like a woman,
and cruel like a woman.

921
01:37:38,558 --> 01:37:41,822
<i>- Shut your mouth.
- But this time you can't blame the crowd.</i>

922
01:37:41,894 --> 01:37:44,087
<i>You aren't giving them anything.</i>

923
01:37:44,161 --> 01:37:46,152
Well, I've— I've had bad luck.

924
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,255
The bulls have been much bigger.

925
01:37:48,332 --> 01:37:52,769
They only seem bigger because
when you face them, you're afraid.

926
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:55,833
You were born to very little
like the rest of us...

927
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:58,175
but one thing you had
that was real and pure—

928
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:01,080
you were a born killer of bulls,
a matador!

929
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:03,618
She took it away from you.

930
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:06,845
Now when you face the bull with a sword,
you're drained, empty.

931
01:38:06,919 --> 01:38:09,114
There's nothing left of you but fear.

932
01:38:11,123 --> 01:38:13,148
You have a gun, haven't you?

933
01:38:13,225 --> 01:38:15,489
Why don't you
bring it to the ring with you...

934
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:17,756
and kill the beast with a bullet?

935
01:40:20,507 --> 01:40:23,408
I've dragged myself...

936
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:26,503
through the blood and sand...

937
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,242
of a thousand arenas.

938
01:40:30,981 --> 01:40:33,472
In the end...

939
01:40:33,551 --> 01:40:36,486
there's only one thing I regret—

940
01:40:38,222 --> 01:40:40,213
I never learned...

941
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,449
to read or write.

942
01:40:54,335 --> 01:40:57,304
I was obliged...

943
01:40:57,371 --> 01:41:00,306
to renounce education...

944
01:41:00,374 --> 01:41:05,505
but I make the whole worid responsible...

945
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,345
for my ignorance.

946
01:41:13,288 --> 01:41:15,916
<i>Your cornada was meant for me.</i>

947
01:41:18,457 --> 01:41:20,618
What?

948
01:41:20,693 --> 01:41:24,459
We've always shared everything,
haven't we?

949
01:41:28,534 --> 01:41:31,196
Life is very curious.

950
01:41:33,606 --> 01:41:35,597
There's no remedy.

951
01:41:39,078 --> 01:41:42,533
If it were all to do over—

952
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:47,072
Amigo...

953
01:41:48,618 --> 01:41:51,314
there are some things you can't stop...

954
01:41:52,355 --> 01:41:54,555
not even with a cape.

955
01:41:57,999 --> 01:42:02,163
Well, I'm quitting.

956
01:42:04,171 --> 01:42:06,329
This is my last season.

957
01:44:10,181 --> 01:44:12,945
<i>- Olé!</i>

958
01:44:17,222 --> 01:44:20,283
"And I end by heralding the news...

959
01:44:20,359 --> 01:44:23,294
"of a new comet
flashing across the horizon—

960
01:44:23,362 --> 01:44:26,889
a bright and flashing comet—
and his name is Manolo de Palma."

961
01:44:26,966 --> 01:44:28,991
Olé.

962
01:44:29,068 --> 01:44:31,465
<i>"Aficionados, mark well that name.</i>

963
01:44:31,534 --> 01:44:33,627
It is destined for great glory."

964
01:44:33,703 --> 01:44:35,830
- Curro wrote it himself, huh?
- He signed it.

965
01:44:35,905 --> 01:44:38,567
You'll be famous! Wonderful!

966
01:44:38,641 --> 01:44:42,475
Don't leave. Oh, Manolo.

967
01:44:42,545 --> 01:44:45,571
Aw, quiet!

968
01:44:48,317 --> 01:44:50,842
- Senor Curro.
- Manolo.

969
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,375
I've just been reading the piece
you wrote about me. It's very flattering.

970
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:59,391
Not at all, Manolo. It is my honest opinion.
Sit down, my friend.

971
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:03,225
Sit down. Will you do me the honor
of having some wine with me?

972
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:06,494
No, you must do me the honor.

973
01:45:06,567 --> 01:45:09,934
Curro, what is a comet?

974
01:45:10,004 --> 01:45:13,838
A comet, my friend, is a star...

975
01:45:13,908 --> 01:45:16,069
that flashes across the sky...

976
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:20,042
lighting up the heavens
with its fiery brilliance and then—

977
01:45:20,111 --> 01:45:22,102
Yes?

978
01:45:32,957 --> 01:45:36,085
Good evening, Don Juan.
Good evening, senora.

979
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,185
This way, if you please.

980
01:45:49,037 --> 01:45:51,437
- What will you have?
- What will you have?

981
01:45:51,506 --> 01:45:53,531
- Champagne.
- Champagne.

982
01:45:53,609 --> 01:45:56,047
<i>- Champagne?
- Sí, champagne.</i>

983
01:45:56,115 --> 01:45:58,640
Champagne.

984
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:04,351
It's a nice place.
I'm glad we came here.

985
01:46:12,495 --> 01:46:14,895
What is it, Juan?

986
01:46:14,965 --> 01:46:19,129
I was just trying to figure out
what kind of a woman you are.

987
01:46:19,202 --> 01:46:21,534
Yes?

988
01:46:23,206 --> 01:46:25,800
The trouble is
you're—you're not one woman...

989
01:46:25,876 --> 01:46:29,333
but many... and never the same.

990
01:46:29,411 --> 01:46:31,400
Well, one changes, you know.

991
01:46:32,813 --> 01:46:35,748
Why didn't you come to see me
at the corrida last Sunday?

992
01:46:35,816 --> 01:46:38,182
I had a headache.

993
01:46:41,188 --> 01:46:43,180
A headache?

994
01:46:44,993 --> 01:46:47,359
Samson and Delilah.

995
01:46:47,428 --> 01:46:50,158
- What?
- Nothing.

996
01:46:50,231 --> 01:46:52,222
Excuse me.

997
01:46:54,599 --> 01:46:57,397
<i>Greetings, compañero.
Pardon me for intruding, Juanillo...</i>

998
01:46:57,469 --> 01:47:00,336
but this is as good a time as any
to keep your promise.

999
01:47:00,405 --> 01:47:03,203
- What promise?
- Why, to present me to Dona Sol.

1000
01:47:03,275 --> 01:47:07,075
Don't you remember? Allow me
to introduce myself. I'm Manolo de Palma.

1001
01:47:07,145 --> 01:47:10,774
<i>I shall have the pleasure soon
of appearing in the ring here in Sevilla.</i>

1002
01:47:10,849 --> 01:47:13,443
How nice. I shall look forward to it.

1003
01:47:13,518 --> 01:47:15,782
I understand Juan
will be in the same corrida.

1004
01:47:15,854 --> 01:47:18,285
Yes, it'll be the first time
we appear together.

1005
01:47:18,353 --> 01:47:20,787
You'll have a chance
to compare our styles.

1006
01:47:20,856 --> 01:47:22,847
We work altogether differently.

1007
01:47:22,925 --> 01:47:25,052
- How have you been, amigo?
- Well, thank you.

1008
01:47:25,127 --> 01:47:27,118
- How's your mother?
- Nicely.

1009
01:47:27,195 --> 01:47:29,528
How's your sister and Antonio Lopez
and the children?

1010
01:47:29,599 --> 01:47:32,397
- They're all fine. Thank you.
- And how's your little wife?

1011
01:47:32,468 --> 01:47:35,403
Oh, yes, I hear she's gone off
to the ranch with her father.

1012
01:47:35,471 --> 01:47:38,872
You know, Dona Sol,
Juan and I are old friends.

1013
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:41,999
His mother used to work here.
We used to live right around the corner.

1014
01:47:42,075 --> 01:47:44,873
<i>We ran away together
with some other boys.</i>

1015
01:47:44,945 --> 01:47:48,608
Hey, Juan, remember that horse we stole?
Remember what happened to it?

1016
01:47:48,682 --> 01:47:51,981
- What happened?
- We ate the horse.

1017
01:47:52,052 --> 01:47:55,283
You did? How did it taste?

1018
01:47:55,355 --> 01:47:58,688
Excellent.
Ah, those were good days.

1019
01:47:58,758 --> 01:48:01,921
We'd spend all our time
fighting the bulls and each other.

1020
01:48:01,995 --> 01:48:04,657
We were great rivals, even then.

1021
01:48:26,684 --> 01:48:29,083
Senora, would you like to dance?

1022
01:48:29,152 --> 01:48:31,141
I'd love to.

1023
01:50:43,009 --> 01:50:45,000
It's mine.

1024
01:51:11,468 --> 01:51:13,834
<i>Camarero, a new glass!</i>

1025
01:51:36,191 --> 01:51:38,682
What are you doing?

1026
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:41,057
It's well to keep in practice.

1027
01:51:41,127 --> 01:51:43,686
What are you talking about?

1028
01:51:43,762 --> 01:51:48,392
When we left Triana, I asked Francisco
to keep my old job open for me.

1029
01:51:48,467 --> 01:51:53,302
I knew someday I'd come back
to La Veronica to scrub the floors.

1030
01:51:53,372 --> 01:51:56,545
Get up. Get up!
Suppose someone should see you.

1031
01:51:56,678 --> 01:51:59,772
There is no one left in the house
to see me but you.

1032
01:51:59,848 --> 01:52:01,839
I don't like to see you
on your knees like this.

1033
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:04,784
What's wrong
with my being on my knees?

1034
01:52:04,852 --> 01:52:07,751
That's how I pray and that's how I work.

1035
01:52:07,819 --> 01:52:10,344
This house was clean when we moved in.

1036
01:52:10,422 --> 01:52:12,447
Let it be clean when we move out.

1037
01:52:12,524 --> 01:52:15,425
Why must you always talk
about moving out?

1038
01:52:15,494 --> 01:52:18,225
Because we've got to
leave this house tomorrow.

1039
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:21,324
Oh! Oh, Juan.

1040
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:28,765
Juan, when you were little,
you wouldn't listen to me.

1041
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,500
Will you listen to me now?

1042
01:52:31,575 --> 01:52:33,839
What do you want?

1043
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:36,708
I want you to quit the bull ring.

1044
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:38,805
Quit? When I'm at the top?

1045
01:52:38,882 --> 01:52:41,009
I've been through all this before.

1046
01:52:41,084 --> 01:52:43,211
I know what to expect.

1047
01:52:43,286 --> 01:52:45,948
When you reach the top,
you begin to slip.

1048
01:52:46,022 --> 01:52:49,423
There is only one way you can
possibly go, and that's down.

1049
01:52:49,492 --> 01:52:51,960
<i>Oh, Madrecita,
you talk just like all the rest.</i>

1050
01:52:52,028 --> 01:52:54,220
Just because
I've had a few poor afternoons...

1051
01:52:54,294 --> 01:52:56,421
some bad luck,
you think I'm finished.

1052
01:52:56,496 --> 01:52:58,760
But you're wrong. They all are.

1053
01:52:58,832 --> 01:53:02,859
I'm just as good as I ever was—
even better— because now I know more.

1054
01:53:02,936 --> 01:53:05,371
Supposing we do have to
move out of this house.

1055
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,431
I'll buy you another one—
much better...

1056
01:53:07,508 --> 01:53:10,443
the best that money can buy
and in the finest part of town.

1057
01:53:10,511 --> 01:53:12,911
Right on the Plaza Alfaro,
that's where we'll live.

1058
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:16,075
And I'll buy a ranch,
and we'll breed bulls and pheasants.

1059
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:19,810
<i>Juanillo, niño mío...</i>

1060
01:53:19,884 --> 01:53:22,978
what's wrong with your hand?

1061
01:53:23,054 --> 01:53:25,022
My hand?

1062
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:45,133
I understand Gallardo has
one more contract to fulfill—

1063
01:53:45,207 --> 01:53:47,505
the corrida next Sunday afternoon.

1064
01:53:47,576 --> 01:53:50,272
I predict he will make his exit...

1065
01:53:50,345 --> 01:53:53,808
in a cloud of rotten oranges
and dead cats.

1066
01:53:53,887 --> 01:53:57,186
I hold him directly responsible
for the death of Nacional...

1067
01:53:57,257 --> 01:53:59,589
and I shall say so
in my article tomorrow.

1068
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:03,255
The trouble with Gallardo
is he has cats in his belly.

1069
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:05,420
His father was the same way.

1070
01:54:05,496 --> 01:54:08,021
Like father, like son.

1071
01:54:08,098 --> 01:54:11,795
That's the second time
you've said things about my father.

1072
01:54:11,869 --> 01:54:15,600
As for you, you've probably
never been baptized.

1073
01:54:15,673 --> 01:54:18,164
I'll baptize you now.

1074
01:54:18,242 --> 01:54:22,770
I christen you "liar,"
and your second name is "swine."

1075
01:54:47,536 --> 01:54:51,063
Father, his face—

1076
01:54:51,139 --> 01:54:56,233
<i>Reminds me of Nacional's
just before he died from the cornada.</i>

1077
01:54:56,308 --> 01:54:58,276
Yes, my son.

1078
01:55:16,694 --> 01:55:18,683
You were here?

1079
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:21,992
I'm always here whenever you fight.

1080
01:55:22,064 --> 01:55:25,158
You mean all these weeks
since you left me?

1081
01:55:27,336 --> 01:55:29,703
I never left you, Juan.

1082
01:55:29,773 --> 01:55:32,173
I've just been waiting for you—

1083
01:55:32,242 --> 01:55:35,678
waiting for this sickness to pass.

1084
01:55:35,746 --> 01:55:38,909
Just a minute ago
I was praying to see you.

1085
01:55:38,982 --> 01:55:42,039
I was thinking
if you could love me again—

1086
01:55:42,116 --> 01:55:45,244
Oh, Juanillo, I do love you.
I always have and I always will.

1087
01:55:45,319 --> 01:55:48,914
Nothing has changed that.
Nothing can. Nothing ever.

1088
01:55:48,989 --> 01:55:51,549
Oh.

1089
01:55:51,625 --> 01:55:54,526
Oh, Carmencita...

1090
01:55:54,595 --> 01:55:58,656
when I hold you in my arms like this,
I'm born again.

1091
01:55:58,732 --> 01:56:02,634
You give me strength.
I can do anything.

1092
01:56:07,271 --> 01:56:10,604
Oh, I— I'm so glad
you're wearing your white suit.

1093
01:56:10,674 --> 01:56:13,404
It's the one I like best.

1094
01:56:13,477 --> 01:56:16,810
No, you don't. You hate it.

1095
01:56:16,881 --> 01:56:20,318
Like my mother does.
You hate them all.

1096
01:56:20,385 --> 01:56:23,582
But this is the last time
I'm ever going to wear one.

1097
01:56:23,655 --> 01:56:25,953
I'm through with the ring forever.

1098
01:56:26,024 --> 01:56:28,424
Oh, Juan. Juanillo.

1099
01:56:28,493 --> 01:56:30,481
This is my last afternoon out there...

1100
01:56:30,559 --> 01:56:32,618
but it'll be one they'll never forget.

1101
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:35,492
You'll see. They'll see, everyone.

1102
01:56:52,813 --> 01:56:54,939
Carmencita,
will you wait for me here?

1103
01:56:55,014 --> 01:56:57,005
Yes, Juanillo.

1104
01:57:30,581 --> 01:57:36,213
I tell you, there is only one matador here
this afternoon worth watching: Manolo.

1105
01:58:12,054 --> 01:58:14,579
<i>Ah, Señor Toro, we meet again.</i>

1106
01:58:21,731 --> 01:58:26,100
Olé!

1107
01:58:26,168 --> 01:58:30,966
<i>Olé!</i>

1108
01:58:31,037 --> 01:58:34,268
- Ah, that's our old Juan.
- Magnificent.

1109
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:38,003
- Olé!
- Olé! Olé!

1110
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:43,081
<i>Olé!</i>

1111
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:45,414
<i>Olé!</i>

1112
01:58:45,486 --> 01:58:48,080
<i>Olé!</i>

1113
01:58:48,155 --> 01:58:50,146
<i>Olé!</i>

1114
01:58:58,362 --> 01:59:01,160
<i>Olé!</i>

1115
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:10,138
Bravo!

1116
01:59:54,246 --> 01:59:57,113
I could tell all along that beast
was going to get him.

1117
01:59:57,183 --> 02:00:00,084
The bull is not the beast.

1118
02:00:00,152 --> 02:00:04,054
Look at the crowd!
That is the real beast!

1119
02:00:04,123 --> 02:00:09,114
Now he's got it! It's what you
been waiting for! Are you happy?

1120
02:00:09,192 --> 02:00:13,094
Now he's got it!
It's what you have wanted!

1121
02:00:13,162 --> 02:00:17,065
Now he's got it! Now he's got it!

1122
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:38,885
Carmen.

1123
02:00:46,193 --> 02:00:49,651
Oh, it's— it's nothing.

1124
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:53,322
I'll be up on my feet again
before you know it.

1125
02:01:11,083 --> 02:01:15,110
And now there'll be money
to take care of my mother...

1126
02:01:16,787 --> 02:01:20,745
and enough left over for—
for us to buy a little ranch.

1127
02:01:20,823 --> 02:01:25,522
Not a big place.
I wouldn't want a big place.

1128
02:01:25,594 --> 02:01:28,324
People don't need much
when they have each other.

1129
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:33,362
Just a little patch.

1130
02:01:33,436 --> 02:01:36,269
Somewhere in the country, hmm?

1131
02:01:38,007 --> 02:01:41,337
And you—you'll teach me
how to read and write.

1132
02:01:43,476 --> 02:01:47,469
And then on Sundays,
we'll get dressed up in our best.

1133
02:01:49,115 --> 02:01:54,558
Go to breakfast at— at some little inn.

1134
02:01:54,625 --> 02:01:58,459
Oh, Juanillo, dear, does it hurt much?

1135
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,598
Not a bit.

1136
02:02:06,468 --> 02:02:10,097
The bull hasn't been born yet that can—

1137
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:19,670
Carmencita...

1138
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:24,418
you're the only true one in the worid.

1139
02:03:08,892 --> 02:03:12,658
My child,
you must be brave as he was.

1140
02:03:12,729 --> 02:03:16,220
You must ask our Lord of great power
to give you courage.

1141
02:03:17,564 --> 02:03:21,694
No, Father, I don't need courage.

1142
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:25,295
I have his.

1143
02:03:25,372 --> 02:03:28,102
I'll always have it.

1144
02:03:28,175 --> 02:03:30,940
To me, he'll never be dead.

1145
02:03:32,547 --> 02:03:37,143
He'll always be just as I first saw him—

1146
02:03:37,218 --> 02:03:42,380
just a little boy... with fire and valor.

1147
02:03:58,570 --> 02:04:00,868
Manolo is the greatest of the great!

1148
02:04:00,939 --> 02:04:02,964
The first man of the worid!

1149
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,146
