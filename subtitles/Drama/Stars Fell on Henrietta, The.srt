You Who Came From the Stars

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,840
When I was first left alone here...

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,240
I couldn't stop thinking about
when I would go back home.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,690
Then I got a job at the
Meteorological Observatory.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,000
Doctor Hong, you're still working?

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,180
Someone may think that you're
doing all the work here.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,620
What book are you reading?

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,340
It's Sir Lee Soon Ji's book.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,360
It never ceases to astonish me.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,890
He calculated the astronomical constant and
calculated the lunar and solar eclipse dates.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,710
It also gives us the exact calculation
of the orbits of the five planets.

12
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,710
Are you suggesting something
rather strange to the people?

13
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,760
Such as?

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,460
Like the earth we live on
is rotating.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,710
And that it's round shaped.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,210
It's true.

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,820
Goodness.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,660
If the earth is rotating...

19
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,420
Then everyone would feel
too dizzy to stand up.

20
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,260
Also if it's round...

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,280
What makes you say such hearsay?

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,430
Why are you laughing?

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,420
If you look from very far away...

24
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,110
- You can see it.
- See what?

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,950
How beautiful our home,
the planet Earth, is.

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,220
Have you seen it from far away?

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,110
Earth is beautiful from far away.

28
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,880
Many from my home wanted to know
about Earth and wanted to visit.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,420
This is how we come to Earth.

30
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,030
We terraformed an asteroid to camouflage
it as an ordinary asteroid.

31
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,220
To make sure the asteroid is invisible from
Earth, we enter at the perihelion.

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,350
In Earth years, this happens
about every 404 years.

33
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,640
Do I have to wait that long
if I miss this chance?

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,310
I don't know what will happen.

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,240
Gravity could offset the orbit.

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,040
More importantly,
if I cannot return this time.

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,930
It's likely that I will disappear soon.

38
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,050
I will likely die.

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,080
There were rumors about
you getting engaged.

165
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,180
- I think I'm going to get engaged.
- What?

166
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,410
Why do you care? You're
leaving in a month.

167
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm going to get engaged with just anyone
on the date of your departure to show you.

168
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,550
- Do you mean that?
- Hello?

169
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,120
- Where are you Song Yi?
- I'm jogging.

170
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,640
<i>You shouldn't over-do it.</i>

171
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,150
I'm not. Where are you?

172
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,300
Stop right there!

173
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,120
Professor!

174
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,560
Oh my! It is you!

175
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,220
I didn't think I'd see you here.

176
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,380
Who...

177
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,750
Don't you remember?
It's me, Go Hye Mi.

178
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I was in your class last year
and the year before that.

179
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,940
I said that you looked just like my ex, Sam Dong.
(Kim Soo Hyun's role in Dream High.)

180
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,170
Oh... did you?

181
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,510
I wanted to re-take your class so
I turned in a blank sheet for final.

182
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,290
You really don't remember me?

183
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,620
I don't know.

184
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,270
Hul! I'm hurt!

185
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,650
My parents almost kicked me
out for getting an F.

186
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,150
I think I can remember a bit.

187
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:11,630
Perhaps it's because I've gotten
prettier than last year.

188
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,180
I lost some baby fat and...

189
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,900
I hear that I've gotten mature.

190
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,310
Oh! Look what you have on your face.
You're like a baby.

191
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,300
One sec.

192
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,150
I'm okay.

193
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,450
Professor! Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

194
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,800
Yeah.

195
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,730
I'm okay.

196
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,010
Professor! You got a cell phone?

197
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
You used to only carry a pager.

198
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,050
- That's an improvement.
- It sort of happened.

199
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,930
Then can I have your number?

200
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,130
I'll text you later.

201
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,440
- That's a bit...
- Please?

202
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,510
Please? Please?

203
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,260
Tell me, hmm?

204
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,190
- Tell me, hmm?
- 0-1-0...

205
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,650
Do Min Joon! Didn't you have
something to tell me?

206
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,420
Huh? Yeah.

207
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,740
What do you want to do?
The timing is perfect for me.

208
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,920
You want to talk now or
not see me forever? Choose.

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,250
Bye.

210
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,780
Who the heck is that visor lady?

211
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,720
She looks like a fake Cheon Song Yi.

212
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,910
What happens if you don't go?

213
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,670
Can't you not go?

214
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,830
Yeah, I don't know where your home is.

215
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,200
Let's say that your home is somewhere.

216
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,920
But a person doesn't have
to live at home.

217
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,700
Most of the people in Seoul
are not from Seoul.

218
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,800
They have their homes in provinces,
but Seoul is like the second home to them.

219
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,200
This is on a different level.

220
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,070
I don't know what level that is.

221
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,300
I don't know!

222
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,580
And I don't want to know.

223
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,010
You said that you've lived here
for centuries!

224
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,510
Why now?

225
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,560
You lived here just fine!

226
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,790
Right when you've met me!
Right when I'm about to do something.

227
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,580
We haven't even had a good date.

228
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,640
Why now?

229
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,770
Can't you just...

230
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,720
Stay here with me?

231
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,770
If you won't then don't
get get me flustered.

232
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,350
Because you can just leave...

233
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,750
But I have to stay and live here...

234
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,780
Where you've left me behind.

235
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,530
So if you're leaving,
then leave quietly.

236
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,010
And leave me alone.

237
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,610
If that's what you want...

238
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,550
Then I will.

239
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,470
Elder brother died in an
accident exactly at my age.

240
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,720
You're right.

241
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,560
I didn't think I could
live after burying my child.

242
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,980
But so many years have already passed.

243
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,860
But I thought he couldn't drink.

244
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,160
That's how I remember him.

245
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,790
He could not.

246
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,580
Then why did he drink and drive that night?

247
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,590
The day after was my graduation.

248
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,980
He promised that he would come.

249
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,800
Your brother suffered
from depression then.

250
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,850
We only found out later after
the autopsy results came out.

251
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,400
There were drugs in his blood.
Antidepressants.

252
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,640
It didn't work out with the girl he liked.

253
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,120
I think that's why he made
such an extreme decision.

254
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,410
I had known him to never do such a thing.

255
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,060
Something must have gone wrong.

256

<i>[S&C successor Lee Han Kyung

<i>[Chlorpheniramine.]</i>

260
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,830
I'm Lee Hee Kyung. I called you.

261
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,580
Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot
about you from Se Mi.

262
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,490
What's the reason you're telling me this?

263
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,460
He's your brother after all.

264
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,220
I thought that I had to stop him
because he is my brother.

265
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,560
In order to do that, I need to know how
much was actually done by him.

266

<i>[Haneul Mental Institution]</i>

Here. You can have all the meat.

268
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm just going to eat the collagen part.

269
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,580
Like that's going to work.

270
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,420
Let's go eat grilled pork skin tomorrow.

271
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,300
I really don't want to age.

272
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,250
Then you shouldn't be drinking soju.

273
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,320
It's too hard without it.

274
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,710
You got cast in a movie.

275
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,220
You finally saw your dad again.

276
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,600
What could be so hard?

277
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,880
Have a drink with me.

278
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,350
You know that I don't drink.

279
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,610
Who cares? It's just you and me.

280
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,760
Don't keep it inside and cope
with it with a drink.

281
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,110
It would have been better
if it had never started.

282
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,050
It's too late now, because
it has already begun.

283
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,370
You asked me once.

284
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,990
How did I live alone for such a long time?

285
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,090
If I weren't lonely.

286
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,850
I did ask you that.

287
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,950
When I lived alone, I didn't
feel lonely at all.

288
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,090
Then for the first time I loved someone.

289
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,370
And now that I think I have to
leave her, I feel really lonely.

290
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,430
As if I'm the only one in the universe.

291
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,790
If I could turn back in time, I would.

292
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,630
So that I would have never met him.

293
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,270
That would be the best.

294
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,110
Then no matter how he much swayed me,
I would not be swayed.

295
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,380
I wouldn't like him either.

296
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,620
Just thinking about the days without him
makes me so sad that I want to die.

297
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,510
What's wrong with the lights?

298
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,690
Sir!

299
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,700
You should stop now.

300
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,970
It's so dark.

301
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,840
What should I do from now on?

302
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,950
Is it a blackout?

303
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,020
Yoon Jae!

304
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,740
Find a candle.

305
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,180
What is this?

306
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,130
I shouldn't have gotten him the drinks.

307
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,020
I thought he would make objects
float or something.

308
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,250
It's gotten serious.

309
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,430
There's not much time left.

310
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,250
What?

311
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,760
Why should I be here?

312
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:11,580
Why should I waste this
precious time with you?

313
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,040
I understand how you feel.

314
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,070
But you didn't have to say that.

315
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,870
Right now, every hour, every minute,
and every second, means a lot to me.

316
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,690
Why should I waste this precious time!

317
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,070
With you?

318
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,180
This is not where I want to be.

319
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,320
It's not here!

320
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,280
Gosh.

321
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,620
They say you speak from your
heart when you're drunk.

322
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,440
Now I know your true feelings.

323
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,160
30 years of friendship means
nothing when a girl is there.

324
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,510
Sir?

325
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,070
What are you doing over there?

326
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,300
- What are you doing?
- Move!

327
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,580
- What?
- I came out to see Cheon Song Yi's face.

328
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,520
What are you doing over there, you hypocrite!
Move! That's Cheon Song Yi's spot!

329
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,310
Stop.
Let's go inside.

330
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,510
Can't you find a better place
to use your power?

331
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,950
I shouldn't have made him drink.

332
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,940
What do I do now?

333
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,980
Oh my God.

334
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,820
When did you come in?
Who told you that you could be here?

335
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,550
Wake up right now!

336
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,630
Wake up and leave!

337
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,370
One, two, three!

338
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,780
You still don't get it?

339
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,970
You leave me no choice then.
I've tried.

340
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,150
What? He said that he never drinks.

341
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,810
I don't want to be with you, Mr. Jang.

342
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,080
What about me?

343
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,400
Who do you want to be with?

344
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,310
Who do you want to be with?

345
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,590

<i>[Widespread Blackout in Downtown Seoul Continues]</i>

347
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,120
The kind of person I hate the most is the
one who loses his memory after drinking.

348
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,710
Sleeping somewhere other than
their home after getting drunk.

349
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,010
Not remembering anything
he has done the night before.

350
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,650
What makes a human, human?

351
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,770
It's free will that defines human.

352
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,010
But doing something against their will
due to mere alcohol consumption is...

353
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,030
Tsk, tsk.

354
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,420
What happened?

355
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,630
Yeah, what happened Do Min Joon?

356
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,980
I... I was...

357
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,980
You were lying down in my bed
completely drunk.

358
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,460
I can't remember.

359
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,220
Did I really do that?

360
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,720
No way.

361
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,720
I can't remember.

362
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,660
That's why you said that
you would never drink.

363
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,960
Because you teleport anywhere
and sleep anywhere.

364
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,320
And you can't even remember what happened.

365
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,050
Stay back a little.

366

- You're...
- I'm what?

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:47,080
I can't think straight.

368
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,400
Then what about this?

369
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,700
Leave! I don't want to see you ever again.

370
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,830
Are you kidding me?
Why did you just kiss me then?

371
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,430
- Does this make you mad?
- What?

372
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,580
That's exactly how I feel.

'I can't come back.'

Do you know how bad and selfish that is?

376

- You need to know that.

Why can't you leave?

Wait.

390
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,010
What's wrong with me?

391
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,770
Is it because of the hangover?

392
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,400
What the heck? Were you lying about
your powers and being an alien?

393
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,550
Don't talk to me.

394
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,930
Is it because of that smooch I gave you?

395
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,860
No!

396
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,840
What kind of super power
goes on and off?

397
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,920
You even pass out when we kiss!

398

There's nothing better than
someone from Earth.

399

She's so...

400
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,760
Super powers?
Oh my God!

401
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,560
Who were you talking to?

402
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,680
Talk to whom?
What are you talking about?

403
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,640
Were you talking to yourself then?

404
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,650
- That's suspicious.
- Nothing suspicious here.

405
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,850
Will you get out?

406
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:14,310
Yoon Jae! Did you call Dad?
I gave you his number.

407
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,770
I told you! He's a father to you,
but I don't remember him.

408
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,710
It's going to be so awkward.

409
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,550
Hey! He's still your father!

410
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,970
No matter how awkward it is,
he is always going to be your father.

411
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,110
You think you dropped from the sky?

412
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,260
Do you think you're an alien?

413
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,560
Hi.

414
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,380
But what if you get in trouble for this?

415
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,050
It's not even your case any more
and you got a warrant.

416
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,290
I'm risking my career for this.

417
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,620
He knows that I've been transferred
to the Criminal Trial Department.

418
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,510
He must have his guard down.

419
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,880
This is when I should strike
to get the evidence.

420
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,410
I didn't think he was an
aggressive type. Prosecutor!

421
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,020
I have a warrant for seizure and search.

422
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,570
Take me to Building Number Two.

423
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,800
Right now!

424
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,180
I told you.

425
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,850
No one by that name is here.

426
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,750
How will you compensate for our loss?

427
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,770
- Min Joon Hyung!
- Yoon Jae.

428
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,690
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, to Mom's house.

429
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,000
Song Yi is acting strange.
It's hard to be with her.

430
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,770
Okay, I will see you later.

Min Joon!

432
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:41,150
My sister may seem tough and clueless.

433
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,960
But she's not.

434
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,580
She's really soft inside.

435
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,940
I don't know what happened with you two.

436
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,830

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
I think I overreacted.

I liked the H.O.T., then Sechs Kies.

453
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,030
Then g.o.d., then Shinhwa.

five different fan clubs.

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,450
I may not like you anymore.

485
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,230
Are you listening?

486
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,430
<i>[Manager Do]</i>

487
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,060
<i>[Let's go somewhere.]</i>

488
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,250
<i>Let's go, somewhere.</i>

489
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,780
You wanted to go in the morning?

490
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,300
It's still before dawn.

491
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,860
What about you?

492
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,530
I...

493
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,270
- I didn't want to be late.
- Me neither.

494
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,530
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

495
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,260
Just... what's the point
of letting it hang free?

496
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,400
Let's hold hands.

497
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,800
Umm... why not?

498
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,120
Yeah, find a different institution.

499
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,600
By the way...

500
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,540
Who told the prosecutor
about the institution?

501
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,580
I do have someone in mind.

502
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,880
I will call you back.

503
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,890
Jae Kyung, do you have time?

504
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,570
Why?

505
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,740
What's it for?

506
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,860
There's someone I want you to meet.

507
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,040
You open it.

508
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,960
I need to eat right now.
I will call you back...

509
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,110
- What?
<i>- Yang Min Joo went missing.</i>

510
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,170
What happened?

511
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,260
Go in.

512
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,490
Your wife is waiting.

513
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:55,180
She has a lot to ask you.

514
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,590
- Where are you Song Yi?
- I'm jogging.

515
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,850
Don't overdo it.

516
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,040
<i>I'm not. Where are you?</i>

517
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,250
<i>Stop right there!</i>

518
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,060
Are you with Do Min Joon?

519
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,440
Unless I was hallucinating because
I had injured my head.

520
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:35,570
You appeared out of thin air
in front of me.

521
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,860
- That's right.
- On that day 12 years ago...

522
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,660
You disappeared in a flash and stood on
the other side of the road.

523
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,020
That's also true.

524
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,740
At first I thought you were
weird and dangerous.

525
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,330
Even when you were protecting
Song Yi from my brother...

526
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,540
I thought that you were planning something.

527
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,040
But I know now.

528
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:12,140
Why you said those words to me.

529
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,710
The accident that hurt Song Yi a while ago.

530
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,030
I think it was my brother.

531
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,590
I know.

532
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,030
I think my sister-in-law is locked
away in a mental hospital.

533
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:30,260
Help me so that I can get her out.

534
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:37,110
I will be able to hear more
when I find my sister-in-law.

535
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,100
Search the hospital for me.
They will try to smuggle her out.

536
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,040
She's not even on the patient list.

537
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,470
Okay yes sir.

538
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,530
<i>Yang Min Joon went missing.</i>

539
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,870
I have a lot to ask you.

540
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,480
Yeah okay.

541
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,770
<i>Thank you anyway.</i>

542
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,130
What was that? Who is it?

543
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,790
Was it that young girl
you saw at the park?

544
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,520
The one squealing for your number?

545
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,800
- No.
- Then?

546
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,000
- Is it another girl?
- No!

547
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,280
I need to practice reading my script.
Can you help me?

548
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,700
I can't act...

549
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,410
You don't have to act.
Just read the script.

550
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,550
My other managers used to do this for me.

551
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,340
- Scene 71?
- Yeah.

552
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,320
Diet? Don't!

553
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,330
I told you!

554
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,170
I don't want even one gram
of you going away.

555
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,470
You're perfect the way you are to me.

556
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:56,360
You're the most beautiful
girl that I know.

557
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,170
Young girls are loud and annoying.

558
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,140
I don't need...

559
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,650
What's wrong with this line?

560
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,310
It's just how it is.
Next paragraph.

561
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,450
Give a back hug?

562
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,910
What's wrong with the script?

563
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,260
And are you doing this
when you're shooting?

564
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,100
Of course! Shouldn't I?

565
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,200
You want to do a rehearsal then?

566
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,230
Do what?

567
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,130
Next line.

568
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,930
Aren't you going to do it?

569
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,470
Let's stop.

570
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,780
Why? Where are you going?

571
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,240
Let me go with you!

572
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:04,360
Did you get sick of me because
I was next to you all day?

573
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,460
My sister was never in a relationship.

574
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,520
So she doesn't know anything.

575
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,520
I'm doing this so that I could
get sick of you faster.

576
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,150
If we see everything, then we
won't have any more fantasies left.

577
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,470
Frankly, I know quite a lot being
in a relationship now.

578
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,760
It's all the same between men and women.

579
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,400
<i>I heard that it was harder for my sister
than my mom when my father left.</i>

580
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,300
She can't get over people.
She has a lot of affections.

581
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,700
That's her type.

582
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,070
She loves dogs, but she can't raise one.

583
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,850
Because she's afraid something
will happen to them.

584
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,360
I've had a lot of fun too.

585
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,040
So I won't be miserable and cry
about love and feelings.

586
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,330
I'm quite rational and clean-cut.

587
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,670
Do Min Joon! Do Min Joon!

588
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,360
Do Min Joon!

589
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,080
Do Min Joon!

590
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,070
Do Min Joon!

591
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,880
Do Min Joon!

592
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,920
Do Min Joon!

593
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,040
Why are you calling for me?

594
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,470
Where did you go?

595
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,510
I went to get some fresh air.

596
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,540
You scared me.

597
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,790
I thought you left.

598
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,630
Where would I go?

599
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,510
I have a feeling that
you will just go away.

600
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,410
What I'm saying is...
You can go.

601
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:16,040
But I was afraid that you would
leave without saying good bye.

602
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,190
I know I'm rational and clean-cut.

603
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,050
But if you leave
without saying good bye...

604
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,720
I won't leave.

605
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,290
I'm not leaving you.

606
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,640
I'm going to stay.

607
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,140
What do you mean?

608
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,560
I'm saying I'm not leaving.

609
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,160
Not in a month, or two months later.

610
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,730
So...

611
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,790
Don't be anxious.

612
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:52,430
Is it okay for you to not go?

613
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,330
<i>More importantly, if I can't
go back this time.</i>

614
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,480
<i>It's likely that I will disappear.</i>

615
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,940
<i>It's likely that I will die.</i>

616
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,700
It's fine.

617
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,980
Is it really okay?

618
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:52,140

00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,730
Diet? No!

620
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,120
I told you!

621
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:10,370
Young girls are loud and annoying.

622
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,430
They are all useless.

623
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,450
Kisses her.

624
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,510
Wait no, what if he passes out again?

625
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,950
Gives a back hug.

626
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,340
<i>(Gives a back hug and feels happy)</i>

627
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:15,080
<i>[I won't go anywhere and stay with
you forever after.]</i>

628
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,350
Aren't you saying it?

629
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,020
Let's stop.

630
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,880
Why?

631
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,460
Where are you going?
Let me go with you!
