1
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:30,900
No, no, no. Get... Get...
Back of the line, man.

2
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:34,153
- You're gonna let me in, right?
- No, no, no.

3
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,781
I got business to run here. Back of the...

4
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:39,158
- Yo, Maurice.
- Jack. Jackie Jack.

5
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:43,246
Jackie Jack. Jackie Jack.
Jack, how you doing?

6
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,623
And Miss Lovely Amber Waves. Mwah.

7
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,999
- Hi, Maurice.
- Como estas?

8
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:50,211
- I've been pissed you haven't been around.
- Uh, we were on vacation.

9
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:53,214
Don't you ever stay away
from my club that long again, okay?

10
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:56,008
- You got it.
- And not for nothing, honey...

11
00:01:56,176 --> 00:02:00,304
...but you are the sexiest bitch
in the entire county. I love you.

12
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:01,556
You're such a charmer.

13
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,933
Listen.
I got your booth set up over there.

14
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:07,979
Some clams, I'm gonna send right over.
Listen, Jack. I'm ready, I'm available.

15
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,648
You put me in a movie, okay?
We're talking box office.

16
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,861
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Box office, Jack. Chi-Chi?

17
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:20,158
Chi-chi, listen. Jack and Amber's table.
Take them over an order of clams. Let's go.

18
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:23,286
Okay, how's it going here?

19
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:26,330
Listen, baby. Me and you,
we'll take a picture later on, okay?

20
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,832
I love you, baby.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,211
How's it going? Hey, hey, hey. Yeah.

22
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,548
Hey, we were looking for you before, man.
Where were you, seriously?

23
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:38,134
- Yeah. Okay, I was here.
- Seriously, man.

24
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,178
Hmm.

25
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:43,556
- I love you.
- I love you, Beck. I love you, Beck.

26
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,058
Hey, Maurice. Hey, cowboy.

27
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:48,519
- Cow...? That's a cowboy?
- Cowboy.

28
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,188
That's...
There you go.

29
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,981
- You like it? It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,192
- If you like it, it's okay.
- I love it, man.

31
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,444
- Okay.
- All right.

32
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:58,863
- Cool. Real cool.
- Thanks, man.

33
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,990
- Compliments of Maurice.
- Oh, thank you.

34
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,660
- Can I get a margarita, please?
- Uh, 7-Up.

35
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,832
- Hi, Rollergirl.
- Hi.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,710
- Did you call that girl today?
- I forgot.

37
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,881
If you don't do it tomorrow, it'll be the
weekend, you'll never be able to see her.

38
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,508
Okay.

39
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,343
What's the matter down there?

40
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:24,055
- I gotta go pee.
- Well, go then.

41
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:35,107
What's happening?

42
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,902
Guys, let's get the album.

43
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,486
- Hey, Jack.
- Little Bill.

44
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:22,947
- Hi.
- Hi, Amber. How are you?

45
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,783
Uh, how's our schedule?
Are we still on for day after tomorrow?

46
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,119
More like the day after
the day after tomorrow.

47
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,622
Jack, come on. I gotta call Rocky, Scotty,
Kurt. I gotta call those guys.

48
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,126
I wanna keep a small group on this one.
A small crew. Know what I mean?

49
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:37,003
- A low-key deal?
- Exactly.

50
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,796
Well...

51
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:42,550
I mean, do...? I'm sorry.
Do we...? Do we have a script?

52
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:12,496
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,250
- So how you doing?
- Fine.

54
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,171
- How old are you?
- I have a work permit. I have all the papers...

55
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,007
No, it's nothing like that.
You been working here long?

56
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,092
A month.

57
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,345
- Maurice give you the job?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:31,724
You from around here?
I mean, uh, Canoga? Reseda?

59
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:35,519
- Um, no. You know where Torrance is?
- Yeah. How do you get here?

60
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:37,605
Take the bus.

61
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:41,233
- So, what do you wanna be?
- Excuse me?

62
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:45,529
Well, I mean, you take the bus from Torrance
to come here to Reseda to do this job.

63
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:48,199
Can't you get a job like this in Torrance?

64
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,453
- Yeah, but I don't want to.
- Oh, okay.

65
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:57,416
So...

66
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:00,920
...you want 5 or 10?

67
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
What?

68
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:06,676
Well, if you just wanna see me jack off,
it's 10.

69
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:09,887
But if you just wanna look at it,
it's only 5.

70
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,641
- Guys pay you to watch you, do they?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,560
- You already done it tonight?
- Couple times.

72
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,398
- And you can do it again?
- If you want. If you got 10 bucks.

73
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,567
No.

74
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,236
My name is Jack.

75
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,279
Eddie. Eddie Adams.

76
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:30,574
- Eddie Adams from Torrance.
- Yup.

77
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,910
- Jack Horner, filmmaker.
- Really?

78
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:37,581
Yeah. I make, uh, adult films,
exotic pictures.

79
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,626
Ah, I know who you are.
I read about you in a magazine.

80
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,795
Inside Amber, Amanda's Ride.
You made those.

81
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,296
- Right.
- Those are great.

82
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,257
So now you know...

83
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:48,300
- ...I'm not full of doggy doo-doo.
- Heh, yeah.

84
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,345
Wanna come back to the table
and, uh, you know, have a drink with me?

85
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:54,181
Uh, I'd love to, but I gotta work.

86
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,934
You have to work, get money,
you know, pay the rent.

87
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,061
Well, yea... I mean, no.

88
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,856
I need money, but I don't pay rent.
I still live at home.

89
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,859
How old are you, Eddie?

90
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,111
Seventeen.

91
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,823
Seventeen-year-old piece of gold.

92
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:13,325
- Heh, yeah, right.
- Why don't you come to the table?

93
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:16,996
- I got some people I'd like you to meet.
- I do know you. I know who you are.

94
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:20,624
I'd love to come to your table for a drink.
Obviously, you're not full of, um...

95
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:21,959
- Doggy doo-doo.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,838
But I just couldn't walk out on Maurice.
I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,215
Yeah.

98
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,887
I got a feeling, beneath those jeans there's
something wonderful just waiting to get out.

99
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:47,318
- Hey, guys.
- Bill. What's up?

100
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:51,363
- Not a lot. What are you guys up to?
- Don't know, probably just go home.

101
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,200
- I'll see you guys later.
- What are you still doing here?

102
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,869
- Can I sleep at your place?
- Half-hour, I'll be there.

103
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,038
- Bye, Maurice.
- Good night.

104
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,248
Hey, listen. Thank you.

105
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,833
Love you, mamita. Take care.

106
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,711
This is the man that you let in anytime,
you understand?

107
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,838
- Ha, ha.
- All right.

108
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:11,342
- Luego.
- Hasta manana.

109
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:18,349
Fix you some eggs, beauty?

110
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:21,560
No. I'm going to sleep. Good night.

111
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,522
Good night, honey-tits. Sleep beautiful.

112
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,190
Okay.

113
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,935
Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

114
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:05,479
I know that it's late, but I...

115
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,940
Is Andy there? Is he?

116
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:11,610
I'd like to say hello.

117
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:15,656
I'd like to say hello to my son,
and that's all.

118
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:21,704
Let me tell you something.

119
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:25,291
Let me tell you something you don't know.
I know a lawyer. You understand?

120
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,587
You might think I don't, but I do,
and I'll take you to court.

121
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:38,596
Tom, don't. Come on, Tom.
Please. Please. Please.

122
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:39,823
What the fuck are you doing?

123
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,661
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

124
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:44,995
Can you close the door?

125
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:48,415
Will I close the door?

126
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,752
Will I close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

127
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,172
Uh, I'm sorry.

128
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,926
Get out. Go sleep on the couch.

129
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,553
Don't stop, big stud.

130
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:39,443
Yeah. That's right.

131
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,104
Oh, Jesus, please, okay?
Shave if you're gonna do that.

132
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:18,482
- You scratch my face.
- Sorry.

133
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:27,032
- Good morning.
- Hey.

134
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,872
How's it at work?
You get home late, huh?

135
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,834
- Yeah.
- You know, you work in a nightclub.

136
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,837
If it means so much to you,
you should find one that's closer.

137
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:41,046
Yeah.

138
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,675
I gotta get to work.

139
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,052
- At a car wash.
- What?

140
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,513
You work at a car wash.
You work at a nightclub.

141
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,682
School never occurred to you?

142
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,487
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

143
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,202
So basically, you're getting
twice the bass with the TK-421...

144
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,913
...which we've, uh, got available
in this system right here.

145
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:19,042
I don't know. I don't really
know if I need all that bass.

146
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,545
Oh, I think you need all that bass.

147
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:24,214
Heh, I mean, if you want a system
to handle what you want...

148
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,717
...yeah, you need the bass.

149
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:30,888
See, this... This is hi-fi, okay?

150
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:33,849
High fidelity. Know what that means?

151
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:37,060
That means
this is the highest quality fidelity.

152
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:41,023
Hi-fi. Those are two very important things
to have in a stereo system.

153
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,444
- It's the price. For the 420...
- I have this very unit in my home.

154
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:47,404
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

155
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,073
Of course, I got it modified
with the TK-421...

156
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:52,075
...which, uh, kicks it up another...

157
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:58,123
...I don't know, maybe three or four, um,
quads per channel, you know.

158
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,835
But that's really... That's technical talk.
That doesn't really concern you.

159
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,838
Still a little uncertain, aren't you?

160
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:06,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

161
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,842
You know what you need?
You need a test drive.

162
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,011
That's what you need.
You need a test drive.

163
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:15,474
It's one thing to hear it from Buck's mouth,
it's another to hear it from the TK-421.

164
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,518
So let me just pop in this 8-track...

165
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,062
...and you just give a listen,
tell me what you think, okay?

166
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,192
Whoo. Huh?

167
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,487
You hear that? You hear the bass? Right?

168
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,280
You hear it? It kicks.

169
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:35,410
It turns. It curls up your belly.
Makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right?

170
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,497
Heh, you got that?
Now, see, if you get this system as is...

171
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:41,792
...it's not gonna sound like this
without the TK-421 modification...

172
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,128
...and we do that in the store right here,
very small price.

173
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:48,340
Go on and move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

174
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,968
Thank you for your time.

175
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:54,179
Oh, okay. Well, hey. So long, partner.

176
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,724
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

177
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,476
- Have I told you?
- Have... What?

178
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:01,562
- Have I?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

179
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,524
You put on that country-western shit,
no one's gonna buy a stereo.

180
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,277
What kind of brother are you, anyway?
Listening to that shit.

181
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:10,946
- All right. Look, Jerry...
- No, no, no. You look.

182
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:12,990
I gave you a job here because,
you know...

183
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:16,994
...I thought your acting stuff might bring
some nice pussy into the place, and it has.

184
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:21,164
But I can't have any more fuckups.
You dig?

185
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:22,374
Yeah.

186
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,376
- You dig?
- Yeah. I dig.

187
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:27,879
Okay, now get in the back
and, uh, unload those new 484s.

188
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,549
All right. Sorry, I was just...

189
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,510
Settle down, class. Settle down.

190
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,221
This is your final.

191
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,183
Keep your test papers face down
until I tell you to turn them up.

192
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:43,020
Clear your tables, please.

193
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:47,274
There should be nothing on your desk
but your test paper and a pencil.

194
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:51,987
We're covering chapters 17 through 28.

195
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:56,366
Your eyes should stay on your test paper,
please.

196
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,577
Are we ready?

197
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,079
Class, begin.

198
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:31,818
I love to suck cock. I love to suck cock.

199
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,752
Honey? You okay?
Sweetheart? Is something wrong?

200
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:53,590
- I gotta get back.
- I need it once more.

201
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:56,760
- I have to go back to work.
- Come on. Give it to me, Eddie.

202
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,762
Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

203
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,847
- Ooh, baby, baby, baby.
- I'll do it.

204
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,392
- You promise?
- Oh, that's it.

205
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,018
- You want it?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:06,770
- How bad?
- Bad.

207
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:08,605
- You sure?
- Yeah.

208
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:09,773
You asked for it.

209
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:15,946
Oh, God. Wait.

210
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:20,158
Stop. Stop.

211
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:21,952
What?

212
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,835
Your cock is so beautiful.

213
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:31,753
Yeah?

214
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,631
Do you know how good you are
at doing it, Eddie?

215
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,593
Having sex? Fucking me?
Making love to me?

216
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,889
Everyone has one thing, you think?

217
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:45,559
I mean, everyone's given
one special thing, right?

218
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,561
That's right.

219
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:52,190
Everyone's blessed
with one special thing.

220
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:55,861
Hey.

221
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:01,366
I want you to know I plan on being a star.

222
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,994
A big, bright shining star.

223
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:07,873
That's what I want.
That's what I'm gonna get.

224
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:09,791
I know.

225
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,752
I gotta go.

226
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,046
You're lucky.

227
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:54,002
Hi.

228
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:36,920
- Eddie.
- Hi.

229
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:38,421
- Want a ride?
- Jack?

230
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:42,259
- Yeah. Want a ride?
- Hi. Uh, well, I'm going really far.

231
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,845
Do you remember me
from a couple hours ago?

232
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:47,013
Yeah, I remember.

233
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,141
Come with us, sweetie.

234
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,185
Okay.

235
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,151
This is a really cool car, Jack.

236
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:07,784
So, what I'm trying to tell you, Eddie...

237
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:12,914
...is that it takes a lot
of the good, old American green stuff...

238
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:16,084
...to make one of these things,
you know what I mean?

239
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:20,130
I mean, you know, you've got your camera,
you've got your film...

240
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,508
...you got your lights, you got your sound,
you got your lab costs...

241
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:27,012
...you got your developing, you got
your synching, you got your editing.

242
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,894
Before you turn around, you've spent
maybe 20-, 25-, $30,000 on a movie.

243
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:37,022
- Wow, that's a lot of money.
- You bet your ass it is.

244
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:38,982
But if you make a good one...

245
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,319
...there's practically no end
to how much money you can make.

246
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:45,155
- Have you seen Jack's house?
- No.

247
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:48,450
- He will.
- He'll see it.

248
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:51,786
You got maybe 15, 20 guys
standing around...

249
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:55,540
...just making sure
that your lighting is right.

250
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,044
But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon...

251
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,087
...you can work out at night.

252
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:04,382
It doesn't matter
if you don't have those juices flowing...

253
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,346
...down there in the Mr. Torpedo area,
in the fun zone...

254
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:12,015
...but you gotta get the people
in the theater.

255
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:14,351
You know, you need the big dicks,
the big tits.

256
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:16,978
Uh-oh. Here we go.

257
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:20,690
How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

258
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,109
With beauty...

259
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,404
...and with acting.

260
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:31,117
Now, I understand you've gotta
get them in the theater, you know?

261
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:32,702
You gotta keep the seats full.

262
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,873
But I don't wanna make a film
where they show up, they sit down...

263
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,418
...they jack off, and they get up
and they get out before the story ends.

264
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:46,216
It is my dream, it is my goal,
it is my idea to make a film...

265
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:50,387
...that the story just sucks them in...

266
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,725
...and when they spurt out that joy juice,
they just gotta sit in it.

267
00:22:55,893 --> 00:23:02,357
They can't move
until they find out how the story ends.

268
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:07,237
You know, aah,
I wanna make a film like that.

269
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:09,864
And I understand,
you know, they have to make films...

270
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:13,576
I've made them myself,
you know, that are a few laughs...

271
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:17,122
...everybody fucks their brains out,
and that's fine.

272
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:21,418
But it's my dream to make a film...

273
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,713
...that is true...

274
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:29,551
...and right and dramatic.

275
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:32,554
You sure you don't want a Fresca?

276
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:34,139
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

277
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,433
- Yeah.
- You're out of limes, Jack.

278
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,352
Well, check in the kitchen, darling.

279
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:43,106
I'm going to bed.

280
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:46,443
Good night, Jackie.
Don't stay up too late.

281
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,445
Good night, beauty.

282
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,822
- Good night, Eddie.
- Good night.

283
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,033
Glad you came by.

284
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,871
- You're great.
- Oh, thank you.

285
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,627
She's the best.

286
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,839
She's a wonderful mother, you know?

287
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:11,301
She's a mother
to all those who need love.

288
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:14,137
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

289
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:20,435
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking,
I wanna be in business with you, Eddie.

290
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:23,104
- Really?
- Yeah. What do you think?

291
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:25,148
I'd love it.

292
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,109
What do you think of Rollergirl?

293
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:30,945
- She's great.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,907
- Would you like to do it?
- Have sex?

295
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:37,577
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I mean, I'd love to.

296
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:40,997
- She's really foxy.
- Oh, you bet your ass she is.

297
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:42,999
You're officially out of limes, Jack.

298
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,668
Well, I'll pick up some for you
tomorrow or something.

299
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:46,961
Come here, darling.

300
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:51,132
I want you to go over there
and sit on the couch with Eddie.

301
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,218
Here we go. Are we gonna fuck?

302
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:57,305
- Oh, yes.
- Ha, ha. Wait a minute.

303
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,362
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Are you?

304
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,364
Oh, yeah.

305
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,036
Are you gonna take your skates off

306
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:22,664
I don't take my skates off.

307
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:24,874
- And don't fucking come in.
- Okay.

308
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:28,586
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

309
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:54,821
- Hi.
- Where were you?

310
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:58,241
- Nowhere.
- Shut up. Where were you?

311
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:02,245
You see that little slut girl you see?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

312
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:04,164
Don't say that.

313
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:07,584
Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

314
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,421
- She your girlfriend?
- No, she's not my girlfr...

315
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,757
She's a little whore
and a little piece of trash.

316
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:17,594
And I know
you're not the only one she sees.

317
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:21,306
- Why would you say something like that?
- I heard things about her, that girl.

318
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:24,058
Don't think I don't know what goes on
when I'm not here.

319
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:28,104
I wash your sheets. I know she's been here.
Or you doing something else in there...

320
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:30,440
...with your music
and your posters on the wall?

321
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:33,776
- What is your problem?
- Okay, fine. All right. Just go.

322
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:36,779
Go to that whore Sheryl Lynn.
Why don't you just go to her?

323
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:38,448
- Yeah. Well, maybe I will.
- Yeah?

324
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:39,949
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

325
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:43,369
- I don't know. I'll do something.
- You can't do anything.

326
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,872
You're a loser. You'll always be a loser.

327
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,042
You couldn't even finish high school
because you were so stupid.

328
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,336
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I'll do something.

329
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:54,339
I'll go somewhere.
I'll run away where you can never find me.

330
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:56,216
Go ahead and fuck that little girl.

331
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,930
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting my stuff.

332
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:05,808
You think that's your stuff. That's not
your stuff. You didn't pay for it.

333
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:09,187
That is not your stuff
because you didn't pay for it, stupid!

334
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:12,023
None of this is yours! This...

335
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:15,610
You leave here,
you leave with what you've got!

336
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:18,905
Nothing! Nothing!

337
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:22,742
You understand me?
You want to treat me like this?

338
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,286
- This is what happens, okay?
- I didn't do anything.

339
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:27,705
You want to live that way?
Fuck that little whore!

340
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:31,000
You think you're gonna be this?
You think you're gonna be this?

341
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:32,543
Goddamn poster!

342
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:35,630
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Why are you doing that?

343
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:38,174
You're not gonna be shit
because you're too stupid!

344
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,218
- I'm not stupid!
- Yes, you are!

345
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:43,846
Please, please. Don't fucking do that.
Please don't be mean to me.

346
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,766
I'm not being mean to you.
You're just too stupid to see it.

347
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:50,853
You don't know what I can do,
what I'm gonna do, or what I'm gonna be.

348
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,065
You don't know. I'm good.
I have good things you don't know about.

349
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,566
I'm gonna be something! I am!

350
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,361
- Don't fucking tell me I'm not!
- You can't do anything.

351
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:02,031
Don't be mean!
And you don't talk to me! No!

352
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,950
Fuck.

353
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,671
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

354
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:18,798
I knew you'd make it.

355
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:22,176
- You take the bus the whole way here?
- Yeah. It wasn't bad, though.

356
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:23,720
- How are you?
- Oh, great.

357
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,014
I got some people I want you to meet.

358
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,480
- Do you like music?
- I love music.

359
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,608
- What kind?
- All kinds of music. Rock, jazz, classical.

360
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:40,361
Oh, I want you to meet
a couple of great people.

361
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,531
- Buck and Becky.
- Hi. I'm Eddie. Eddie Adams.

362
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:46,409
- Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.
- Our new fella.

363
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,578
- Becky Barnett.
- It's nice to meet you.

364
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:49,787
Oh, this is the new fella?

365
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,122
- Oh, ho.
- Oh, ho.

366
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,915
- Is that a faccia?
- That is a faccia.

367
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,793
- I didn't know you'd be so precious.
- Faccia's "face," right?

368
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,170
- That's right.
- Yeah.

369
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:00,757
- Nice to meet you, guys.
- All right.

370
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,759
- Great people.
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:04,510
He's one hell of an actor.

372
00:29:04,678 --> 00:29:07,347
Hey, Reed. Reed-o.

373
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:11,559
I want you to meet
the new boy on the street.

374
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,061
Eddie Adams.

375
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:15,563
- Hi. I'm Eddie.
- Hi, Eddie. Reed Rothchild.

376
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,691
- I want you to stick around for a while.
- Sure.

377
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,694
- Make him something special.
- Aye, aye.

378
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:24,614
- So you live on this street?
- No, no.

379
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:27,158
Oh, I thought Jack just said you did.

380
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:28,951
- No.
- Hmm.

381
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,244
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

382
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,789
- Margarita?
- Great.

383
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:34,791
Wow.

384
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:41,631
Two, four, mm-hm, whatever.

385
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:46,344
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

386
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:48,429
- Do you work out?
- Yeah.

387
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:50,973
Yeah. You look like it.
What do you squat?

388
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:54,519
- About two.
- Super, super.

389
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:56,562
What about you?

390
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,107
What do you squat?

391
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:01,984
- Three-fifty.
- Wow.

392
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,487
- No B.S.
- That's a lot.

393
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:07,323
- Where do you work out?
- In Torrance, where I live.

394
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:08,991
Cool. Cool.

395
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,287
Hey, you ever go to Vince's out here?
Oh, no. I would have seen you.

396
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:16,499
- I'm there every day.
- I've always wanted to work out at Vince's.

397
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,836
Cool. Here. Taste that.

398
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,551
- Ahem, rock 'n' roll.
- Right?

399
00:30:28,846 --> 00:30:32,765
- Did you ever see that movie Star Wars?
- Oh, about four times.

400
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,811
- People tell me I look like Han Solo.
- Really?

401
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:40,273
What do you bench?

402
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,817
You tell first.

403
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,819
I asked you first.

404
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,737
Same time.

405
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,322
Cool.

406
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,199
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

407
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,995
One, two, three...

408
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,122
- You didn't say anything.
- Oh, neither did you.

409
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,041
Hey, guys. Look at me.

410
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,769
Thank you, Johnny.
My dear, it's party time.

411
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,064
Oh, do you look lovely. Mm.

412
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:26,027
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Oh, hello, Jack. Ha-ha-ha.

413
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,196
Hi. This is my lady friend.

414
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:32,033
Darling, I'd like you to meet Jack Horner,
the finest director in the business.

415
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,242
- Hi.
- Hi.

416
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,036
Do you have any coke at this party?

417
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:37,914
- They can find some somewhere. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

418
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,082
- Great.
- You're no bigger than a minute?

419
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,250
Uh-uh. Ha, ha.

420
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:43,169
- Shy as a butterfly.
- I'll bet.

421
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:47,673
He has every right to tell me how to sell
stereos. It's his store, I'll listen.

422
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:50,176
He does not have the right
to tell me how to dress.

423
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,303
Where's he get off
telling me how to dress, huh?

424
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:55,264
- It's old. It's just plain old.
- No, wait. Let me tell you...

425
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:57,517
He was obviously pissed off
about the music.

426
00:31:57,684 --> 00:32:00,853
- What's wrong with it?
- The cowboy look ended six years ago.

427
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,273
- It's coming back though, Becky.
- No, it's not. It's over. It's dead, okay?

428
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,442
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

429
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,611
I do know what I'm talking about.

430
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,447
Your bosses at the stereo store
are saying the same thing.

431
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:14,617
- What? What?
- You have to get a new look.

432
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:16,619
What? You get a new look.

433
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:19,080
I have a look, okay?
The look I have is just fine.

434
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,124
- What's your look?
- Chocolate love, all right?

435
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,043
- Oh, take a pill.
- One hundred percent.

436
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:26,837
You don't have to lash out.
I'm trying to be your friend.

437
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:30,132
- Okay, Becky. Drop it.
- I tried opening up a club there, you know?

438
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,928
But you see, Miss Amber, I'm just this
poor fellow from Puerto Rico, you know?

439
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:35,972
I got this club. Yeah, that's one thing.

440
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,433
But soon that goes, I die,
then what do I have? I got nothing.

441
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:40,643
Mm-hm.

442
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:43,062
You know, I want something
I can send home, you know?

443
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:48,025
Something I can send to my brothers
and say, "Look at me.

444
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:51,487
Look at me and all the beautiful women
I've been with."

445
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:54,156
So what? You want me to talk to Jack?

446
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:58,035
Yeah. I mean, you know.
I mean, what am I asking you here?

447
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:00,413
Honey, Amber, baby, please, talk to Jack.

448
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:02,999
Tell him I can do this.
Tell him I won't be bad.

449
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,710
- So you wanna be in a movie?
- Baby, please.

450
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:08,129
- I'll see what I can do.
- Would you, love?

451
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,880
Thank you very much.

452
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:11,090
Thank you, mamita.

453
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:17,388
Maurice, can I talk to you?
I need to talk to you now.

454
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:19,682
- Now?
- Yeah. We gotta go in here.

455
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,517
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

456
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,686
Can I join in?

457
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:25,479
Most certainly.

458
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:29,150
- Your cowboy...? That's not dead.
- Then what is Becky talking about?

459
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:32,153
- She's got something up her ass.
- Fuck that shit.

460
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:33,946
Bitch.

461
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:55,718
- Do a cannonball.
- No, no. Watch this jackknife.

462
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,393
- Did it look cool?
- That was pretty good.

463
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:06,687
Let me show you what you did wrong.

464
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:21,452
Full flip.

465
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,670
Whoa.

466
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:38,427
Ow.

467
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,888
- You all right?
- Yeah.

468
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:43,808
Hey, you gotta bring your legs
all the way around.

469
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:46,727
I know. I know.

470
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:49,647
- Hey, hey, hey. This is my point.
- What?

471
00:34:49,815 --> 00:34:51,649
- Okay, you know what I say?
- What?

472
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,734
Wear what you dig.

473
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:56,487
That's it. Just wear what you dig.

474
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:59,740
- That's what I said.
- Well, what's the problem?

475
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,286
- Should I get that?
- Yeah.

476
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:07,665
Hello? Uh-huh.

477
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,000
Uh, can you speak a little louder, please?

478
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:13,587
A who? A Ma...? A Maggie.
You know a Maggie?

479
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:17,550
- I don't know a Maggie.
- Uh, look, sorry. There's no Maggie here.

480
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:22,430
Your... Your mother. Oh, okay.
Just give me a sec.

481
00:35:22,597 --> 00:35:24,932
Watch that for me, okay?

482
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:31,147
Uh, excuse me, is Maggie here?
Maggie? Are you Maggie?

483
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:34,775
No? Do you know?
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

484
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:36,610
Do you know Maggie?

485
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:41,073
- Are you Maggie?
- No.

486
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:43,951
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

487
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,705
Hello? Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, there's no Maggie here.

488
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:51,417
Okay. No, no. It's not a problem.
Okay. Ciao.

489
00:35:52,294 --> 00:35:55,713
- Who was that?
- Oh, some kid looking for his mom.

490
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:47,014
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's it look like they're doing?

491
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:48,349
That's my wife.

492
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:52,478
Shut up, Bill. You're embarrassing me.

493
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:55,314
Yeah, Little Bill. Shut up.

494
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,120
- Little Bill.
- Hey, Kurt. How's it going?

495
00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:13,207
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, my fucking wife, man.

496
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,334
She's down there,
some idiot's dick in her.

497
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:18,754
Everybody's standing around watching.
It's a fucking embarrassment.

498
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:21,257
Yeah, yeah. I know. Anyway, listen.

499
00:37:21,424 --> 00:37:23,759
- Yeah.
- For the shoot, I wanna talk about the look.

500
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,011
- See about getting this new zoom lens.
- Right.

501
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,098
I was wondering if we'd be able
to look into getting more lights.

502
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:30,641
Jack wants a minimal thing.

503
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:34,270
Yeah, well, very often minimal means
a lot more photographically, I think...

504
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:37,106
- Well, I think than most people understand.
- I understand.

505
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:40,192
No, I know you understand.
I'm talking about some other people.

506
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,862
I think what Jack is talking about
is minimal.

507
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:44,989
Not really natural, but minimal.

508
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:47,825
- Okay, fine. Uh, I was just saying...
- I understand.

509
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:50,786
Yeah, because I'm trying
to give each picture its own look.

510
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:53,956
- Can we talk about this later?
- Oh, yeah.

511
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:56,417
You gotta go somewhere, or...?

512
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:59,044
Yeah. No. I mean, unh...

513
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:01,046
I was hoping for the shoot tomorrow...

514
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:03,632
...we could send Rocky down
and he could pick it up.

515
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,509
- Kurt.
- No, hey. Got you.

516
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,803
You gotta go somewhere,
so, hey, what the fuck?

517
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:10,639
It's only the photography of the film
we're talking about.

518
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:14,560
- Are you giving me shit, Kurt?
- No. Hey, no way, Little Bill.

519
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:17,980
My fucking wife has an ass in her cock
in the driveway, Kurt.

520
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:21,150
All right? I'm sorry if my thoughts
are not on the photography...

521
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,321
- ...of the film we're shooting tomorrow.
- Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

522
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:28,365
- All right?
- Gotcha.

523
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,631
All right, where is it?

524
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:52,681
I think she's sick.

525
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,852
- Oh, what the fuck is this?
- I didn't do anything. I... I didn't...

526
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,146
- Is she breathing?
- I don't know.

527
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:02,316
- I think maybe she did too much coke.
- Do you think so, doctor?

528
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:04,818
- This girl's definitely OD'd.
- Oh, fuck me. Okay.

529
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,820
I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.

530
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:08,072
- You listening?
- Yeah.

531
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,493
Get her in the car, drive her to Saint Joe's.
Drop her off in the front. I don't want any...

532
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:15,412
- Got you.
- Make sure no one sees the limo.

533
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,123
- Got it.
- What the fuck is this?

534
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:21,877
This is twice in two days
that a chick has OD'd on me.

535
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,047
You think maybe you ought to
think about getting some new shit?

536
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:26,256
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

537
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:29,718
- Oh, shit. She's freaking out.
- Oh, see? Look at this.

538
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,346
With all this fucking conversation.
Come on. Come on.

539
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:35,474
- Please don't die.
- Hey, hey.

540
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:37,559
Come on!

541
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:42,564
- Back door, Johnny.
- You got it.

542
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:44,775
Fucking shit.

543
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:51,323
Get out of my way.

544
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:55,786
- Bart, is she all right?
- Shut the fuck up.

545
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:27,901
- Hey, Reed.
- Hey, Scotty J. How are you?

546
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:31,113
You know, you know. Ha, ha, who's this?

547
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:34,783
Eddie, this is Scotty J. He's a friend.
He works on some of the films.

548
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:36,702
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. Me too.

549
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,495
Uh, you gonna be working, or...?

550
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:40,456
- Um, maybe.
- Oh.

551
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:43,459
- Probably. Ha, ha.
- That's great. Ha, ha.

552
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:46,879
How'd you meet Jack? Because I work
on the films, you know, sometimes.

553
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,506
- So if you ever, yeah...
- Hey, Eddie.

554
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:53,886
- Come here a second.
- That's the boy you told me about.

555
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,305
Uh, could you excuse me for a minute?

556
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,474
- Yeah.
- Very nice to meet you.

557
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,726
- Take care.
- Yeah.

558
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,190
- Hey.
- Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

559
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:08,317
- Hi.
- How do you do, Eddie?

560
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,819
Eddie is, uh, interested in film.

561
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:14,656
Oh. I can't give you much advice
that Jack probably doesn't know...

562
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:17,284
...but I can advise
that you think about your name.

563
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,494
My name. Yeah.

564
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:21,497
Like, think about some name
that makes you happy.

565
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,249
- Something with a little pizzazz, you know?
- Sure.

566
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:29,922
You see, Eddie, the Colonel here,
he puts up all the money for our films.

567
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,341
It's an important part of the process.

568
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:35,260
- Oh. Great, great.
- I'm looking forward to seeing you in action.

569
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:39,515
- Jack says you got a great big cock.
- Um, well, heh, I don't know. I guess so.

570
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,433
May I see it?

571
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,560
- Really?
- Please. Yeah.

572
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,354
Okay.

573
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,654
- Well, thank you, Eddie.
- No problem.

574
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:56,365
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Bye.

575
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:25,352
- You wanna hear a poem I wrote?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,020
Okay.

577
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:33,527
<i>I love you, you love me
Going down the sugar tree</i>

578
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:38,574
<i>We'll go down the sugar tree
And see lots of bees</i>

579
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:41,952
<i>Playing, playing</i>

580
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:46,415
<i>But the bees won't sting
Because you love me</i>

581
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:49,001
- That's it.
- That's fucking great. Did you write that?

582
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:53,088
- Yeah. I write songs too. I'm still working...
- How's it going, boys?

583
00:42:53,256 --> 00:42:55,340
Hey, Jack.

584
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:57,259
Having a good time?

585
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:59,928
Excellent time. Thank you, Jack.
It was a great party.

586
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:03,390
- The best.
- Ah, that's what Jackie's house is for.

587
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,434
To have a good time. Right?

588
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:07,102
- That's right.
- Coming in.

589
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:11,273
- Woo-hoo. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

590
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,652
- Ah, how about a little bubbles?
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,073
- Excuse me, Jack.
- Yeah?

592
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:22,993
I was thinking about what the Colonel
was saying, about my name.

593
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,787
- Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering if you had any ideas.

594
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:29,374
I had some thoughts on it, yeah.
What about you? What do you think?

595
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:33,128
Well, my idea was...
You know, I just want a name...

596
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:35,964
I want it so it can cut glass,
you know, like razor-sharp.

597
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:37,424
Razor-sharp. Right.

598
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:41,470
Yeah, well, when I close my eyes,
I see this thing. It's like this big sign.

599
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:44,139
And the name is in,
like, bright-blue neon lights...

600
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:46,642
...with, like, purple outline.

601
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,605
And this name is just so bright and so
sharp that the sign, it just blows up...

602
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:54,816
...because the name is just so powerful.

603
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:05,911
It says, "Dirk Diggler."

604
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:11,333
I think... I think heaven has
sent you here, Dirk Diggler.

605
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:16,421
I think the angels have blessed us all
because of you.

606
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:19,883
- You're Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Dirk Diggler, ha, ha.

607
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,010
Amen.

608
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,185
Talk to me, Kurt.

609
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:31,770
- Twenty to 30.
- Oy.

610
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:35,983
- I got a couple tough shadows to deal with.
- There's shadows in life, baby.

611
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,693
- Jack.
- Yo.

612
00:44:38,194 --> 00:44:41,989
- You, uh, wanna go over this?
- Okay.

613
00:44:42,198 --> 00:44:45,617
Uh, the setup is... Okay, here we go.

614
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:47,703
Uh, "One, Amber talking to Becky.

615
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,831
They make the telephone call to the agents
to send over some actors.

616
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:56,503
Two, enter Reed to audition for Amber.
They go at it. Becky watches.

617
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:59,339
Three, Becky goes to the bathroom
to jack off.

618
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:02,175
She gets interrupted by Amber.
They go at it.

619
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:04,219
Four..."

620
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:07,931
Who's "Dirk...? Dirk Diggler?"

621
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,643
That's that new, good-looking kid.
Eddie at the club.

622
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:12,894
- Good name.
- Yeah.

623
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,897
Anyway, uh, "Enter Dirk. He meets Becky.
They go at it."

624
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:20,402
No, ugh. Change that, will you? Uh...
I want Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

625
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,237
Got it.

626
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:25,741
- Darling, where are you going?
- Huh? I gotta go wash my vagina.

627
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:28,285
- How long will you be?
- Two seconds.

628
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:30,287
You want it clean, don't you?

629
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,001
I'm back now. I'm ready to start my...

630
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,629
- Come in.
- Hey.

631
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:41,757
- Hi.
- Ha, ha. Hi.

632
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:44,509
Dirk. Dirk Diggler.

633
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:48,555
- Scotty.
- Yeah, uh...

634
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:52,601
I'm supposed to come get you now
and tell you that they're all ready now.

635
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:55,228
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

636
00:45:58,107 --> 00:46:00,442
Do you think you could give me a minute?

637
00:46:02,445 --> 00:46:03,487
Thanks.

638
00:46:06,324 --> 00:46:11,787
I'm back now.
I'm ready to start my acting career.

639
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:22,798
That's right.

640
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:30,055
- Hey.
- Hey.

641
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,265
- You look really good.
- Oh, thank you.

642
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:34,434
Ahem. And you look really sexy.

643
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:36,520
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

644
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:43,318
- I like your name a lot.
- You do?

645
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:44,945
Yeah. It's really cool.

646
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:47,155
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Heh.

647
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:54,204
You'll be right down there.

648
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:04,631
Thanks. Hey.

649
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:06,842
- Ho, how's my boy?
- Great.

650
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,260
- How you feeling?
- Let's do it.

651
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:09,886
Ha, ha. All right.

652
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:12,097
- Remember everything we talked about?
- Yeah.

653
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:16,309
Okay, now, you're gonna come through
the door, walk right over here...

654
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:21,189
...I'll... I'll say, uh, "Action, Eddie."
That'll be your cue, right?

655
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:24,151
You come through the door,
you walk over here to the desk...

656
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,237
...to Amber, and we shoot.

657
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:30,532
- Um, do we go right into the sex, or...?
- I need some more fill.

658
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,492
- Is that all right?
- Good.

659
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,619
- Is it okay with you?
- That looks good.

660
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:37,038
- Amber?
- Good.

661
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:40,834
- Okay.
- Okay. You don't need a rehearsal?

662
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:42,627
No, it's okay. I can do it.

663
00:47:42,795 --> 00:47:44,588
Okay, then we'll shoot the rehearsal.

664
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:46,131
- Great.
- All right.

665
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,341
- Um, could I ask you something, Jack?
- Sure.

666
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:50,844
Um, I was wondering if you could, um...

667
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:53,889
...call me Dirk Diggler from now on.

668
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:55,390
- Absolutely.
- Great. Heh.

669
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:56,725
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. It's...

670
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:59,478
- No, no. From now on.
- Thanks.

671
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:01,480
Okay, let's get a good one.

672
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:04,983
- Do you wanna practice your lines with me?
- No, I know it.

673
00:48:05,151 --> 00:48:07,235
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks.

674
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:09,654
Um, does he want me to keep going
until I come?

675
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:13,241
- Yeah. You just come when you're ready.
- Okay. Well, where should I do it?

676
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:14,701
Where do you want?

677
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:17,037
Wherever you tell me.

678
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:19,080
Well, come on my tits if you can, okay?

679
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,375
Just pull it out and do it on my stomach
and my tits if you can.

680
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:25,128
Yeah. No problem.

681
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:30,634
Are you all right, honey?

682
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:33,428
Oh, this is great. I'm fine.
I just wanna do good.

683
00:48:33,596 --> 00:48:35,764
- I just want it to be really good.
- Mm-hm.

684
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:40,435
I was wondering, is it okay if I really try
to make it look sexy? Would that be okay?

685
00:48:40,603 --> 00:48:42,938
- Okay.
- Great.

686
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:47,692
- You ready?
- Yeah.

687
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,530
Make your entrance through this door.
He'll call, "Action." That's your cue.

688
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:53,615
- You got the lines for the scene?
- Uh-huh.

689
00:48:53,783 --> 00:48:56,326
If you drop one, just call for it,
but do not stop, okay?

690
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:58,119
Do not stop. You want some water?

691
00:48:58,287 --> 00:49:01,039
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Okay. You're gonna do fine.

692
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:03,375
Roll it, Scotty.

693
00:49:04,877 --> 00:49:06,503
Speed. Ahem.

694
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:08,463
- Sticks.
- Marker.

695
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,091
- Yeah?
- Camera's set.

696
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:13,426
- We're ready, chief.
- Okay.

697
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:15,679
And...

698
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:19,391
...action, Dirk.

699
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,064
Hello. Are you John?

700
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:28,400
Yes, ma'am.

701
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:31,069
Your agency recommends you very highly.

702
00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:34,990
Well, I'm a really hard worker, and if
you give me a job, I won't disappoint you.

703
00:49:35,157 --> 00:49:38,076
- What special skills do you have?
- Well, I just got...

704
00:49:38,244 --> 00:49:41,913
I've been in the Marines for three years.
I just got back from a tour of duty.

705
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:44,165
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

706
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,752
And it got really hard being surrounded
by all those guys all day.

707
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,005
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?

708
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:53,383
- A long time.
- That's terrible.

709
00:49:53,843 --> 00:49:57,596
But now I'm back,
and I'm ready to pursue my acting career.

710
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:01,016
Well, as you may or may not know,
this is an important film for me.

711
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:03,935
If it's not a hit,
I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

712
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:07,188
- My landlord's a real jerk.
- Really?

713
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:11,192
Why don't you take your pants off?
It's important I get an idea of your size.

714
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,153
No problem.

715
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:19,784
Oh.

716
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:49,564
I think that you have the job,
but why don't I make sure of something?

717
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:55,070
This is a giant cock.

718
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:37,213
We've rolled out.

719
00:52:37,381 --> 00:52:39,758
Uh, we gotta change mags.

720
00:52:40,426 --> 00:52:42,343
Do it quickly.

721
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:50,727
- Kids.
- Is everything cool?

722
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:53,688
It's going great.
We just gotta change the angle.

723
00:52:53,856 --> 00:52:55,690
Does it...? Does it look sexy?

724
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:58,943
- Oh, it's great.
- You're doing so good, Dirk.

725
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:01,362
- Does it feel good?
- Yep.

726
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,496
Okay?

727
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,039
Roll sound, Scotty.

728
00:53:14,752 --> 00:53:16,461
Speed.

729
00:53:17,213 --> 00:53:19,297
Quiet. Sticks.

730
00:53:23,594 --> 00:53:25,220
Marker.

731
00:53:25,387 --> 00:53:27,055
We're back.

732
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:29,182
Action, kids.

733
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,229
- We're gonna go down now.
- Okay.

734
00:53:34,396 --> 00:53:39,526
- No. No, first... Down again.
- Okay.

735
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:48,201
John, you're a wonderful actor.

736
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:50,620
Oh, John.

737
00:53:57,044 --> 00:53:58,586
- Oh, John.
- Yeah.

738
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:01,923
John, you're a wonderful actor.

739
00:54:16,522 --> 00:54:18,773
- You're amazing.
- Oh, you feel so good, Amber.

740
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:20,650
- Are you ready to come?
- Yeah.

741
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:22,944
- Come in me.
- What?

742
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:26,906
Don't worry. I'm fixed.
I want you to come in me.

743
00:54:27,074 --> 00:54:28,867
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

744
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,451
Okay.

745
00:54:37,585 --> 00:54:39,794
Oh, God, yeah.

746
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,801
Wonderful.

747
00:54:47,678 --> 00:54:51,055
- Cut. Terrific. Nice work. Nice work.
- All right.

748
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:53,725
Congratulations.
That was great, wasn't it?

749
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:55,435
- Wasn't that sexy?
- Rock 'n' roll.

750
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:57,145
- That was something.
- Really good.

751
00:54:57,313 --> 00:54:58,646
It looked great. Very sexy.

752
00:54:58,814 --> 00:55:00,940
- Doesn't he fuck like a champ?
- Was it sexy?

753
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:02,317
- You rocked.
- Thanks.

754
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:05,153
- Hey, the camera loves you.
- We didn't get the come shot.

755
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:06,946
- What?
- We missed the come shot.

756
00:55:07,114 --> 00:55:08,740
He came inside of her.

757
00:55:08,908 --> 00:55:11,576
Maybe we could,
like, go to stock footage or...

758
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:15,413
Are you crazy? It won't match.

759
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:16,623
- Well...
- Jack.

760
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,585
- Hmm?
- I could do it again if you need a close-up.

761
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,259
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

762
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:30,887
Okay, everyone say, "Dirk."

763
00:55:31,055 --> 00:55:32,388
Dirk.

764
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:35,183
These are real wood.

765
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:38,311
No, these. These are the ones.
These are great.

766
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:40,521
Yeah. Those are really cool.
Are they lizard?

767
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:43,691
No. They're ltalian.
I'm gonna fucking buy these.

768
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:47,570
Guys.

769
00:55:48,197 --> 00:55:51,741
It's funny you say that
because we should be in a band, you know?

770
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:02,210
- Like my shoes?
- They're cool.

771
00:56:02,378 --> 00:56:04,796
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool, huh?

772
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:07,256
- Yeah.
- You know, embossed leather...

773
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:10,885
...with this patchwork,
reptilian-pattern design.

774
00:56:11,053 --> 00:56:13,012
- Cool.
- Can we have some hot sauce here?

775
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,931
- Oh, hi, Scotty.
- Hi, Scotty.

776
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:17,850
- Come on, sit down and help yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

777
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,102
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

778
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:21,896
- Scotty, this is Jaime Lynn.
- I was thinking about the...

779
00:56:22,064 --> 00:56:23,982
Scotty, Jaime Lynn.
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

780
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:26,067
- You're a Leo, huh?
- That's right.

781
00:56:26,235 --> 00:56:28,736
- Hey, my girlfriend wants to meet you.
- Is that right?

782
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:31,447
- This is Raymond.
- How do you do? What's your name?

783
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:33,574
- Becky Barnett.
- Excuse me?

784
00:56:33,742 --> 00:56:35,618
Becky Barnett.

785
00:56:35,786 --> 00:56:38,371
- Raymond's a Leo.
- I knew it. I knew it.

786
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:40,248
- What's your sign?
- I'm a Pisces.

787
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,583
What? I can't deal with no Pisces.

788
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,711
- That shirt's pretty sexy too.
- Well, yeah.

789
00:56:44,878 --> 00:56:47,630
Well, this is, um, like,
imported Italian nylon...

790
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:50,883
...and, uh, it's like a special-edition,
limited silk print...

791
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:55,346
...and it was done by this really famous,
um, design artist from ltaly.

792
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:56,556
Pick a card, man.

793
00:56:56,724 --> 00:56:58,975
What's up, baby? I love you.
Picture later, baby.

794
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:02,520
What table's that going to?
Four? Five, Jose. Five.

795
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:06,607
What's happening, my man?
You alive, man. I thought you were dead.

796
00:57:06,775 --> 00:57:10,278
- Yo, what's up, people?
- Rise from the deck.

797
00:57:10,446 --> 00:57:11,863
Oh.

798
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,865
- Damn, that's...
- Two of diamonds, right?

799
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:16,075
- That's my card. That is incredible.
- Right.

800
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:20,288
But doesn't it make you nervous when
you're dealing with all those evil forces?

801
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:21,998
Horses? What?

802
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:24,584
No. The evil forces.

803
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:28,296
Evil? No, man. It's not evil.
It's an illusion.

804
00:57:28,464 --> 00:57:31,132
- It's an illusion.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's confusing.

805
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,009
Thank you.

806
00:57:33,302 --> 00:57:34,969
Listen up, kid. Listen up.

807
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:38,222
I'm gonna try and do this all in one shot,
know what I mean?

808
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,225
So we start like this,
and then you roll her over, Dirk.

809
00:57:41,393 --> 00:57:43,394
Rollergirl, you roll right over with him.

810
00:57:43,562 --> 00:57:46,105
Try to give me every single position.
Is that possible?

811
00:57:46,273 --> 00:57:48,816
Well, if she...
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg around...

812
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:50,651
No, the other one, the left one.

813
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:54,447
Around and over. Good.
See, we can go right into doggy style.

814
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:56,157
Perfect.

815
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:59,077
Is the movement on a waterbed
gonna be a problem?

816
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:01,579
No, not at all, Kurt.
I mean, I dig it. It's great.

817
00:58:01,747 --> 00:58:03,122
- Okay, can we do this?
- Yeah.

818
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,583
All right, everybody, here we go.

819
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:08,336
- This is gonna be great. Jack.
- Yeah?

820
00:58:08,504 --> 00:58:10,338
Do you want me
to use a Spanish accent?

821
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:22,100
"Jack Horner has found something special
in newcomer Dirk Diggler.

822
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:26,187
It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

823
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:29,899
Diggler delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

824
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:33,236
His presence when dressed is powerful
and demanding.

825
00:58:33,403 --> 00:58:35,321
When stripped to the bone...

826
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:38,366
...Diggler's more eruptive than a volcano
on a bad day.

827
00:58:38,534 --> 00:58:41,077
Amber Waves' ripe cherry lips
do a wonderful job...

828
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:43,162
...of handling Diggler's wide load.

829
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,540
And Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps...

830
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:50,545
...do a slapping good job
with Becky Barnett's supple ass.

831
00:58:50,712 --> 00:58:53,381
But it's Diggler that
remains the standout in this film.

832
00:58:53,549 --> 00:58:55,883
It's easy to predict
that after only two films...

833
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:59,095
...that Diggler's success
can only grow and grow and grow...

834
00:58:59,263 --> 00:59:01,722
...and grow and grow and grow...

835
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:06,227
...and grow and grow and grow."

836
01:00:11,793 --> 01:00:13,794
- What else?
- Well, that's it for now.

837
01:00:13,962 --> 01:00:17,465
I mean, look at the character
Holmes came up with, for instance.

838
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:21,219
- And look, I just...
- Tell me.

839
01:00:21,762 --> 01:00:25,264
I don't like seeing women treated that way.
This guy he plays, Johnny Wadd...

840
01:00:25,432 --> 01:00:29,644
It's always about slapping some girl around
or whatever. It's not right. It's not cool.

841
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:32,897
It's just not sexy. I mean,
it's not sexy like it should be, Jack.

842
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:35,942
This guy's more of like
a James Bond-type character.

843
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:39,737
You know, he's classy.
He's a world-traveled guy.

844
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:43,991
- I like that.
- Reed could play my partner.

845
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:48,496
- I like that a lot.
- We could make it really good, Jack.

846
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:52,208
Honestly, if you direct it,
we make a whole series with a whole story.

847
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,794
I mean, it's exactly
what we've always talked about.

848
01:00:55,879 --> 01:00:57,505
Please?

849
01:00:57,673 --> 01:01:00,967
When we get back, set up the typewriter.

850
01:01:01,677 --> 01:01:03,928
We'll see what comes out of it.

851
01:01:04,096 --> 01:01:07,348
But I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

852
01:01:07,724 --> 01:01:10,518
And, Dirk, you gotta
work on the Colonel too, Dirk.

853
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:12,144
I mean, you gotta be committed.

854
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:15,481
Right, right. Jack,
I'll do whatever I have to do.

855
01:01:16,525 --> 01:01:18,109
Does this character have a name?

856
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:23,030
His name is Brock Landers.

857
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:25,491
His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

858
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,037
Those are great names.

859
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:34,375
And the award for best newcomer
goes to...

860
01:01:34,543 --> 01:01:38,212
Yes. My baby boy. Dirk Diggler.
Whoo.

861
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,673
And the award for best cock goes to...

862
01:01:40,841 --> 01:01:42,591
Here we go again. Dirk Diggler.

863
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:45,803
The award for best actor goes to... Aah!

864
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:48,806
I've seen all his movies,
and I can't wait to work with him.

865
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:51,309
Mr. Dirk Diggler.

866
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:30,348
Wow.

867
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:33,017
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on, say it.

868
01:02:33,185 --> 01:02:34,268
I guess...

869
01:02:34,436 --> 01:02:35,561
Wow.

870
01:02:35,729 --> 01:02:37,772
I guess the only thing I can say...

871
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:41,108
...is I'll promise to keep rocking
'n' rolling and making better films.

872
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:47,323
You know, it seems we make
these movies and sometimes, you know...

873
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:50,201
...they're considered filthy or something
by some people...

874
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,495
...but I don't think that's true.

875
01:02:52,662 --> 01:02:55,498
These movies we make,
they can be better.

876
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:58,584
They can help. They really can.
I mean that.

877
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:00,920
We can always do better.

878
01:03:01,088 --> 01:03:03,464
I'm gonna keep trying
if you guys keep trying.

879
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:05,341
Let's keep rocking 'n' rolling, man.

880
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:18,771
Yeah!

881
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:23,776
Marker.

882
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:25,945
Set.

883
01:03:43,672 --> 01:03:46,173
Shot of tequila, straight up.

884
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,175
Yes, ma'am.

885
01:03:49,302 --> 01:03:53,556
I've been in this place for 20 minutes
just to get a seat.

886
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:57,518
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. Just visiting L.A.

887
01:03:57,686 --> 01:04:00,729
Some people told me
the food in here was really good.

888
01:04:00,897 --> 01:04:02,857
Good? It's not good.

889
01:04:03,024 --> 01:04:07,027
It's probably the best place to eat
in all of Los Angeles. It's excellent.

890
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:08,863
I certainly hope so.

891
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,199
I could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.

892
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,328
Still hungry?

893
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:19,123
Starving.

894
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:25,629
- Why don't you feast on that?
- Okay.

895
01:04:35,515 --> 01:04:37,808
Oh, it's true.

896
01:04:38,185 --> 01:04:39,518
What's that?

897
01:04:40,312 --> 01:04:42,730
You are Brock Landers.

898
01:05:05,962 --> 01:05:09,882
Freeze! Don't make me chase you, Raphael!

899
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:23,145
Freeze!

900
01:05:38,036 --> 01:05:41,455
We're almost there. Here's what I want.
I want you to trim the head.

901
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:44,792
Take that shot of Reed with the revolver,
just dump that, okay?

902
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,335
And switch the title card.

903
01:05:46,503 --> 01:05:49,838
I want it to come flying right out
of the screen, right at the audience.

904
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:52,675
- Nice. Piece of cake.
- That's my guy.

905
01:05:55,637 --> 01:05:57,972
I told him,
"This is a special party for Scotty J.

906
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:00,599
I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne."

907
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:02,017
So this is what he gave me.

908
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:04,770
I want you take a little sip
and tell me what you think.

909
01:06:04,938 --> 01:06:08,190
This is supposed to be really good stuff.
Here. Take a sip.

910
01:06:09,568 --> 01:06:11,110
- Is that pretty light?
- Yeah, that is.

911
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:13,404
- Baby, it's beautiful.
- What do you think?

912
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:14,655
- It's great?
- Yeah.

913
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:17,324
- Look how spacious it is.
- Yeah. Look, I like this too.

914
01:06:17,492 --> 01:06:20,160
That's custom-made.
That's real imported ltalian leather.

915
01:06:20,328 --> 01:06:22,705
- This color is very unusual.
- Watch this.

916
01:06:22,872 --> 01:06:24,873
- What's that?
- My initials.

917
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,376
Oh, that's so imaginative.
How'd you think of that?

918
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:30,129
I was just thinking of my name one day
and dreamt it up.

919
01:06:30,297 --> 01:06:31,338
- Hi, Dirk.
- How are you?

920
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:33,132
- I'm almost finished.
- Looks great.

921
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,843
I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

922
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:38,053
- Show me the rest of the house?
- Looks great.

923
01:06:38,221 --> 01:06:40,097
Yeah, it's good for conversation, huh?

924
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:44,518
Yeah. Jessie did that oil painting as well
and Buck is still installing the stereo.

925
01:06:44,686 --> 01:06:46,312
- That's a beanbag.
- You're kidding.

926
01:06:46,479 --> 01:06:50,524
And that lamp, those are real sterling silver.
Yeah, they have a very modern feel too.

927
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:53,152
This could be the place
you could have conversations.

928
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,862
- You ready?
- What is this? Yeah.

929
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,530
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

930
01:06:56,698 --> 01:07:01,201
- This is my dojo.
- It's all Asian. You have an Asian room.

931
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:04,538
- Yeah. It has that whole karate feel.
- Nice. It's very comfortable.

932
01:07:04,706 --> 01:07:07,041
- Yeah. A lot of ancient China.
- That's really good.

933
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,168
I have my statues for my best-actor awards.

934
01:07:09,336 --> 01:07:11,503
You have a place
to keep your awards. I'm glad.

935
01:07:11,671 --> 01:07:13,339
Look up there.

936
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:14,798
Oh, that's handy.

937
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:16,383
- Can you see yourself?
- Yeah.

938
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:18,052
- That's great, huh?
- That's nice.

939
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:19,219
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

940
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:21,347
- My whole entire wardrobe.
- That's great.

941
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:24,725
It's all perfectly organized by color,
as well as designer.

942
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:29,355
You don't have to think about anything. You
just reach in and know right where it is.

943
01:07:29,522 --> 01:07:30,814
- You're gonna love it.
- Yeah?

944
01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:34,026
This is my favorite thing
in the whole world. Close your eyes.

945
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:36,195
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, baby.

946
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:43,661
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh, God. Heh.

947
01:07:44,162 --> 01:07:47,164
This is it. This is the thing.

948
01:07:47,332 --> 01:07:48,791
You deserve this, baby.

949
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:52,836
Isn't it great? This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

950
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:55,130
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Oh, yeah. Heh.

951
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:58,175
Let's do this thing. She rocks.

952
01:07:58,343 --> 01:07:59,760
Whoo.

953
01:07:59,928 --> 01:08:01,220
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha.

954
01:08:01,388 --> 01:08:03,430
- Hold on.
- Ha, ha.

955
01:08:03,598 --> 01:08:06,684
- You set us up, Chico.
- You wanna fuck with Raphael and Ringo...

956
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:10,396
...that's your business.
You don't fuck with Chest and Brock.

957
01:08:10,814 --> 01:08:12,815
- No...
- You know what?

958
01:08:12,982 --> 01:08:14,483
- No.
- You're not even worth it.

959
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:16,819
I gave you a chance.

960
01:08:21,074 --> 01:08:22,366
I trusted him.

961
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:27,830
Well, we almost solved the case.

962
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:31,375
At least the women are safe.

963
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:34,795
Let's go get some of that
Saturday-night beaver.

964
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:38,924
No one fucks with Chest and Brock.

965
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:42,469
This is the best work we've ever done.

966
01:08:42,637 --> 01:08:45,139
It's a real film, Jack.

967
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:50,352
- It feels good.
- You made it fly.

968
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:55,524
You know, this is the film...

969
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:58,110
...I want them to remember me by.

970
01:09:09,038 --> 01:09:10,664
Thank you.

971
01:09:29,392 --> 01:09:32,728
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
it's all about love, you know?

972
01:09:32,896 --> 01:09:36,273
I mean, if you love someone,
how hard can the world be?

973
01:09:36,441 --> 01:09:39,860
I mean, uh, people will come
and they will go, and so will problems...

974
01:09:40,028 --> 01:09:45,282
...but ultimately, if you have got love
on your side, and it is just...

975
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:50,037
I mean,
it is just deep down in your soul...

976
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:55,000
...what's a problem gonna be
that takes your attention away from that?

977
01:09:56,503 --> 01:09:58,337
Do you understand?

978
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:03,759
- I'm Becky Barnett.
- I'm Jerome.

979
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:06,428
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, Becky.

980
01:10:06,596 --> 01:10:10,349
- So, what do you do?
- Oh, uh, I'm in the auto industry.

981
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:11,600
Oh.

982
01:10:11,768 --> 01:10:14,228
Yeah, I'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

983
01:10:14,395 --> 01:10:15,521
Oh. Wow.

984
01:10:15,688 --> 01:10:17,189
That's great. That's great.

985
01:10:17,357 --> 01:10:19,066
You've got a really nice smile, Becky.

986
01:10:20,401 --> 01:10:21,902
Thank you, heh, heh...

987
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,112
- ...Jerome. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

988
01:10:37,085 --> 01:10:40,087
- The Colonel.
- Excuse me.

989
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:45,384
Floyd Gondolli. Ha, ha. Great you
could make it. Great, great, great.

990
01:10:45,552 --> 01:10:49,012
- How are you? You look happy.
- I'm fine.

991
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,348
- Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.
- Hi.

992
01:10:51,516 --> 01:10:53,475
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

993
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:54,852
- Hi.
- Hi.

994
01:10:55,019 --> 01:10:57,271
- These are the next stars.
- Mm-hm.

995
01:10:57,438 --> 01:11:00,858
- These are the real people in the world.
- Ah, ahem.

996
01:11:01,025 --> 01:11:05,279
I think we ought to talk with Jack now.
Iron this out before we start the new year?

997
01:11:05,446 --> 01:11:06,446
Let's do it.

998
01:11:06,948 --> 01:11:10,284
What were you thinking? What
were you feeling? Did you do research?

999
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:12,286
- Hi, Amber.
- What are you talking about?

1000
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:15,581
- Oh, nothing.
- You wanna come with me for a little while?

1001
01:11:15,748 --> 01:11:18,792
- Where?
- It's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

1002
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,461
Yeah. Let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

1003
01:11:50,658 --> 01:11:54,036
- Hey, Buck.
- Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

1004
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:57,164
- You sitting alone?
- Yes.

1005
01:12:00,752 --> 01:12:03,670
- Todd Parker.
- Rocking Reed Rothchild.

1006
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:08,175
- Aw, you made it. Yeah. Woo-hoo.
- Yeah.

1007
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:10,594
Amazing party, man.
Fucking chicks everywhere.

1008
01:12:10,762 --> 01:12:13,347
You bet. Courtesy of Jack Horner.
Thank you.

1009
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:16,600
I wouldn't mind me having
a piece of that action right over there.

1010
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:18,477
That's Michelle. I'll introduce you.

1011
01:12:18,645 --> 01:12:22,397
- Sure. Introduce her to my lap.
- Ha, ha. Did you get off work, man?

1012
01:12:22,565 --> 01:12:24,691
- I don't dance Sunday nights.
- Right.

1013
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:27,903
- Whose Vette is that out in the driveway?
- Dirk.

1014
01:12:28,071 --> 01:12:30,197
- I'm so jealous of him.
- That shit's jamming.

1015
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:33,533
It's dropped down low with a 350 cube,
3-and-a-quarter horsepower...

1016
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:36,703
...4-speed, 4.10 gears,
10 coats of competition orange...

1017
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:39,539
...hand-rubbed lacquer
with a dual-plane manifold.

1018
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:41,833
Tsk, full fucking race cams. Whoa.

1019
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:43,543
Yep.

1020
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,053
I'm pretty happy with it, you know.

1021
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:54,930
It's a great look for you, I think.

1022
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:58,100
It's pretty original, you know, I think.

1023
01:12:58,267 --> 01:12:59,810
Right.

1024
01:13:01,396 --> 01:13:04,272
Heh. I'm gonna take this off.

1025
01:13:06,985 --> 01:13:08,568
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:10,570
What were we talking about before?

1027
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:14,324
- Um, oil painting?
- No.

1028
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:18,412
- No... Yes. I mean, um, but I was saying...
- Oh, oh, oh. Sunsets.

1029
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:21,331
Right, yeah.
I was saying that I love sunsets.

1030
01:13:21,499 --> 01:13:24,751
- But sunrises are better. Heh.
- Exactly. Ha, ha.

1031
01:13:24,919 --> 01:13:27,379
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

1032
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,423
- No, I feel that way.
- Really?

1033
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:32,926
Yes, really. Hey, have you ever heard
my stereo system?

1034
01:13:33,094 --> 01:13:36,304
- No.
- I'm gonna open my own business.

1035
01:13:36,472 --> 01:13:39,599
- Really?
- Yes. Yes. It's my dream.

1036
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:44,730
Okay, it's hi-fi stereo equipment
at discount prices.

1037
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:48,150
Yeah. It's called
Buck's Super Stereo World.

1038
01:13:48,317 --> 01:13:50,819
- That is a fucking great idea. Heh.
- Yeah.

1039
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:55,115
You know, in the 80s,
that's when it's gonna happen for real.

1040
01:13:55,283 --> 01:13:57,951
- Really?
- Yes, really. The 1980s.

1041
01:13:58,119 --> 01:13:59,161
Wow.

1042
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:04,374
I wanted you to give me a minute
so I could tell you how much I love you.

1043
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:08,128
I mean, it's gonna be a new year and
we're gonna start things and do things...

1044
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:11,798
...and I just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

1045
01:14:11,966 --> 01:14:13,425
I really care about you, honey.

1046
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:15,469
- You're my little baby.
- Thank you, Amber.

1047
01:14:15,636 --> 01:14:20,140
You're the best thing that's happened to me
since my son went off, and I just...

1048
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:22,976
I love you, honey.

1049
01:14:23,144 --> 01:14:25,187
I love you too.

1050
01:14:26,856 --> 01:14:29,441
Fucking 1980, you know?

1051
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:31,068
- Can you believe it?
- I can't.

1052
01:14:31,235 --> 01:14:36,031
I mean, it's like, the next thing you know
it's gonna be, like, 1990 and 2000.

1053
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,158
- I mean, can you imagine?
- Hmm.

1054
01:14:38,493 --> 01:14:44,164
Goodbye, 1979. Hello, 1980.

1055
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:45,665
Okay.

1056
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:50,170
Make sure you snort it back real quick
and hard.

1057
01:14:50,338 --> 01:14:53,090
- Huh?
- Like this.

1058
01:15:00,056 --> 01:15:01,640
Okay.

1059
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:09,606
- Ugh, it burns.
- It's good though, right?

1060
01:15:10,066 --> 01:15:11,691
- It's going in my throat.
- Hmm.

1061
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:14,569
That's the drip. The drip's the best part.

1062
01:15:14,737 --> 01:15:18,031
- It tastes like aspirin.
- Here. Do one more in the other nostril.

1063
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:20,784
- I need a drink of water, I think.
- Mm-mm.

1064
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:24,162
One more, and then a drink of water.

1065
01:15:30,336 --> 01:15:32,462
Do you think I look cool when I do it?

1066
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,886
So let's talk about the future.

1067
01:15:40,054 --> 01:15:42,931
Let's talk about what video means
to this industry.

1068
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:45,600
And let's talk about how all of us...
Not one of us.

1069
01:15:45,768 --> 01:15:47,477
How all of us are gonna profit.

1070
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:52,149
I've been doing theater in San Francisco
and San Diego...

1071
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:54,651
...about as long as
you've been doing stag and hard-core.

1072
01:15:54,819 --> 01:15:57,154
We're all familiar with your biography,
Floyd.

1073
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:59,865
No one is doubting your credentials
or your history.

1074
01:16:00,032 --> 01:16:01,908
Then why the resistance?

1075
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:05,412
I mean, this industry is gonna
be turned upside down soon enough.

1076
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:09,416
- Why help it?
- Why not be prepared?

1077
01:16:09,584 --> 01:16:12,127
Colonel's got the money.
You got the talent, Jack.

1078
01:16:12,295 --> 01:16:15,213
I got the connection to the equipment
and the mail-order distribution.

1079
01:16:15,381 --> 01:16:20,468
Not to mention those kids out there
who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.

1080
01:16:20,928 --> 01:16:24,347
This is the future.
Videotape tells the truth.

1081
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:30,437
Wait a minute. You come into my house,
my party, to tell me about the future?

1082
01:16:30,605 --> 01:16:34,191
That the future is tape, videotape,
and not film?

1083
01:16:34,358 --> 01:16:37,777
That it's amateurs and not professionals?
I'm a filmmaker.

1084
01:16:37,945 --> 01:16:41,114
That's why I will never make a movie
on videotape.

1085
01:16:41,282 --> 01:16:42,949
And I'll tell you something else.

1086
01:16:43,117 --> 01:16:46,077
I will never, ever loan out
any of the actors...

1087
01:16:46,245 --> 01:16:49,122
- ...that I have under contract to you.
- Wait, wait, wait, Jack.

1088
01:16:49,624 --> 01:16:52,709
I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema.

1089
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:55,629
In particular,
I like to see people fucking on film.

1090
01:16:55,796 --> 01:16:58,798
I don't wanna win an Oscar,
and I don't wanna reinvent the wheel.

1091
01:16:58,966 --> 01:17:02,969
I like simple pleasures like butter
in my ass, lollipops in my mouth.

1092
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:05,472
That's just me.
That's just something that I enjoy.

1093
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,307
Call me crazy, call me a pervert...

1094
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:10,560
...but there's one little thing
that I wanna do in this life...

1095
01:17:10,728 --> 01:17:15,398
...and that is I wanna make
a dollar and a cent in this business.

1096
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:18,026
Ahh, Jack, I'm not trying to hurt you.

1097
01:17:18,194 --> 01:17:21,154
I'm trying to help you
stay one step ahead of the game.

1098
01:17:21,614 --> 01:17:24,991
We're going in circles now.
We're in familiar territory.

1099
01:17:25,451 --> 01:17:27,577
The territory we're in is the future.

1100
01:17:27,745 --> 01:17:28,954
Not to mention the cost.

1101
01:17:29,956 --> 01:17:33,166
You know, if it looks like shit
and it sounds like shit...

1102
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:34,876
...then it must be shit.

1103
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:39,673
You're holding on too tight, Jack.
It doesn't have to look good.

1104
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,133
Film is just too damn expensive.

1105
01:17:42,301 --> 01:17:45,303
And the theaters are already converting
to video projectors.

1106
01:17:46,013 --> 01:17:47,514
I haven't heard that.

1107
01:17:47,682 --> 01:17:49,516
Well, it's true.

1108
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,020
Well...

1109
01:17:56,232 --> 01:17:57,983
Ten minutes before the new year.

1110
01:18:00,278 --> 01:18:02,070
I'd like to spend it with my friends.

1111
01:18:02,697 --> 01:18:05,907
We will or will not continue
this conversation.

1112
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:15,375
- Hey, Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Hey, Scotty. What's up?

1113
01:18:15,543 --> 01:18:17,377
- Fucking New Year's, right?
- 1980.

1114
01:18:17,545 --> 01:18:21,214
- Oh, man, right. Did you see my new car?
- You got a new car?

1115
01:18:21,382 --> 01:18:22,590
- Yeah. Wanna see?
- Yeah.

1116
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:24,843
All right, cool. It's out front.

1117
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,845
Come on. It's out front.

1118
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:30,098
Dirk. I want you to meet my friend Todd.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.

1119
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:32,183
- What's up? How are you?
- We finally meet.

1120
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:33,393
- Yeah.
- No.

1121
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:36,438
I was telling you about him before.
You remember. Todd Parker.

1122
01:18:36,605 --> 01:18:39,524
- He works at Party Boys Strip Club.
- Oh, cool. You're a dancer.

1123
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:42,527
- Yeah, I got some moves.
- Dirk? Uh...

1124
01:18:43,195 --> 01:18:45,822
I'm sorry. You coming?
Or you wanna talk to these guys...?

1125
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,575
Yeah, Scotty. I'll be around in a bit.
We can talk then?

1126
01:18:48,743 --> 01:18:50,035
- Okay.
- See you later, Reed.

1127
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:51,870
- See you.
- All right.

1128
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:58,251
Uh, when you get by, uh, the lights,
close your eyes.

1129
01:18:58,419 --> 01:18:59,419
- Okay?
- All right.

1130
01:18:59,587 --> 01:19:01,963
- All right, just follow my voice. All right?
- Yeah.

1131
01:19:02,131 --> 01:19:06,468
Here, here, here.

1132
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:08,928
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

1133
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:12,057
Keep coming. All right, open them.

1134
01:19:12,224 --> 01:19:14,059
This is it. Ha-ha-ha.

1135
01:19:14,226 --> 01:19:16,895
- It's cool.
- Yeah. You wanna get inside?

1136
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:18,646
- When did you get this?
- Uh, yesterday.

1137
01:19:18,814 --> 01:19:22,609
Actually, I had it painted yesterday
so the paint might still be kind of sticky.

1138
01:19:22,777 --> 01:19:26,112
- This is great, man. Really great.
- You wanna go for a ride?

1139
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,741
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck.
Hell, how much time is left?

1140
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:33,036
- I'm sorry, Dirk.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

1141
01:19:33,204 --> 01:19:36,122
- Why did you do that, Scotty?
- Uh, you look at me sometimes.

1142
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,124
- What?
- I wanted to know if you like me.

1143
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:41,252
Well, of cour... Uh.
Yeah, I like you, Scotty.

1144
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,463
- Can I kiss you? Please?
- Scotty, I don't...

1145
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,298
- Can I kiss you on the mouth?
- No.

1146
01:19:45,466 --> 01:19:47,717
- Please let me.
- Scotty.

1147
01:19:47,885 --> 01:19:51,137
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to grab you like that or scare you.

1148
01:19:51,305 --> 01:19:53,098
- It's all right.
- Do you wanna kiss me?

1149
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:55,350
- Scotty, wha...?
- No?

1150
01:19:55,518 --> 01:19:57,435
- What is the matter with you?
- Uh, forget it.

1151
01:19:57,603 --> 01:20:02,315
I'm really drunk. Really, I am. I'm just...
I'm out of my head.

1152
01:20:02,483 --> 01:20:04,984
I'm so wa... I'm really wasted.
Really, Dirk.

1153
01:20:05,152 --> 01:20:07,946
- I'm really wasted. I'm crazy right now.
- I understand, man.

1154
01:20:08,114 --> 01:20:10,657
- I'm really crazy, you know?
- Do you wanna go back inside?

1155
01:20:10,825 --> 01:20:12,200
Uh...

1156
01:20:12,368 --> 01:20:14,786
- Do you like my car, Dirk?
- What?

1157
01:20:14,954 --> 01:20:16,621
- I mean...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1158
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:18,665
Because I wanted to, you know...

1159
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:21,042
I wanted to make sure
you thought it was cool...

1160
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:23,711
...or else I was gonna take it back.

1161
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:25,422
Oh.

1162
01:20:25,589 --> 01:20:27,173
- Yeah.
- It's great, Scotty.

1163
01:20:27,341 --> 01:20:28,967
Happy New Year.

1164
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:31,928
- Happy New Year, Scotty.
- I love you. I really love you.

1165
01:20:32,096 --> 01:20:33,888
- I love you too, Scotty.
- Okay.

1166
01:20:34,056 --> 01:20:38,309
- All right, let's go back inside, okay?
- All right. All right.

1167
01:20:46,193 --> 01:20:48,611
Fucking idiot.

1168
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:51,656
I'm a fucking idiot.

1169
01:20:53,742 --> 01:21:07,213
I'm a fucking idiot.

1170
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:11,801
Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.
Fucking idiot.

1171
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:18,558
Jackie. Jackie.
Two minutes, pops. Let's go, let's go.

1172
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,519
Whoo!

1173
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:25,982
Two. Two minutes. Two minutes.

1174
01:21:26,358 --> 01:21:27,901
Come on, Little Bill.

1175
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:31,529
Okay. Becky, I'm...

1176
01:21:36,243 --> 01:21:39,412
Little Bill. Smile, man. Come here.

1177
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:41,748
Right, ha, ha.

1178
01:21:45,002 --> 01:21:46,753
I'm so excited.

1179
01:21:50,424 --> 01:21:52,300
Little Bill, champagne?

1180
01:21:52,468 --> 01:21:54,886
- Aw, thanks. That's really nice of you.
- Happy New Year.

1181
01:21:55,054 --> 01:21:56,221
- To you too.
- Okay, man.

1182
01:21:56,388 --> 01:21:58,223
Get some champagne, dude.

1183
01:22:00,935 --> 01:22:02,769
No, I'm sorry, I don't have any matches.

1184
01:22:02,937 --> 01:22:05,313
- I got it here, hold on.
- Happy New Year.

1185
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:12,445
Hey, Kurt, have you seen my wife?

1186
01:22:12,613 --> 01:22:14,822
No, no. Hey, they're doing
that countdown thing.

1187
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:17,075
- Come on in, man.
- Okay.

1188
01:22:57,116 --> 01:23:00,076
Come on, say something. Make a toast.

1189
01:23:00,244 --> 01:23:02,370
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.

1190
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:09,479
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1191
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:12,899
...four, three, two...

1192
01:24:16,111 --> 01:24:19,739
- What the fuck was that?
- Where's Jack?

1193
01:24:23,077 --> 01:24:24,911
Where's Jack?

1194
01:24:31,418 --> 01:24:33,294
What about your character Brock Landers...

1195
01:24:33,462 --> 01:24:37,382
...and what some people might consider
violent attitudes towards women?

1196
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,053
Violence? No. What...?

1197
01:24:42,763 --> 01:24:48,309
I mean, if there's a certain amount
of, you know, violence or action...

1198
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:51,020
...in this series of films,
you know, that's the movie.

1199
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:56,984
If Brock Landers is slick with a gun...

1200
01:24:57,152 --> 01:25:00,029
...he does so
only in the vein of good and right.

1201
01:25:00,197 --> 01:25:02,990
Brock protects the values
of the American ideal...

1202
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:08,579
...and fights for causes that instill pride in
a society where morals are hard to come by.

1203
01:25:08,747 --> 01:25:11,457
- Who sent you? Who sent you?
- Get the fuck off me, asshole.

1204
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,460
Lie still! Lie still
or I'll punch you in the goddamn face!

1205
01:25:14,628 --> 01:25:16,796
Fuck off.

1206
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:19,298
I'll find out who sent you.

1207
01:25:23,262 --> 01:25:28,808
Amber, I live in this world.
I don't like violence any more than you do.

1208
01:25:29,184 --> 01:25:31,269
Violence is a bad thing.

1209
01:25:31,437 --> 01:25:36,023
But when you see violence in films, it's...
You know...

1210
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:40,153
if movies, films, caused violence...

1211
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,321
...we'd be able
to wipe out violence tomorrow.

1212
01:25:42,489 --> 01:25:44,323
Boom, no more films.
That's fine with me.

1213
01:25:44,491 --> 01:25:47,118
I'll find something else to do.
I'll fuck on my own time.

1214
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:49,829
You know, I got other interests.
I'm a magician.

1215
01:25:49,997 --> 01:25:54,292
Um, and, you know, hopefully, that'll be
something that I focus on in the future.

1216
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:58,504
Because you can't fuck forever.
I realize that. Anyway, violence...

1217
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:02,133
...is something that plagues us
as a society.

1218
01:26:02,718 --> 01:26:06,179
Well, the fine line is
I'm playing a character.

1219
01:26:06,346 --> 01:26:08,598
You know, I mean, I'm Dirk Diggler.

1220
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,019
Brock Landers
is a character that I'm playing.

1221
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:16,272
I'm gonna ask you once more,
and I'm gonna ask you nice.

1222
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,399
Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?

1223
01:26:18,817 --> 01:26:20,318
Fuck you.

1224
01:26:20,486 --> 01:26:21,527
Oh!

1225
01:26:21,695 --> 01:26:23,780
- Uh, why do I love him?
- Yeah.

1226
01:26:23,947 --> 01:26:26,282
He's, uh... He's very special.

1227
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:30,077
And, um, he can fuck hard
or he can fuck, like, really gently.

1228
01:26:30,245 --> 01:26:31,996
He's the best.

1229
01:26:32,164 --> 01:26:37,293
Uh, I think that's part of my reason
for doing this, you know?

1230
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:40,129
I've gotten thousands
upon thousands of letters...

1231
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:42,006
...you know, from people telling me:

1232
01:26:42,174 --> 01:26:46,219
"God, you've taught me this and
you've made our love life so much better."

1233
01:26:46,386 --> 01:26:49,222
And this isn't "Go out and have sex
with 10 million people."

1234
01:26:49,389 --> 01:26:53,059
And, you know, "How to get a girl off."
It's about how to get your wife off.

1235
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:55,561
If only people
could have been doing this before...

1236
01:26:55,729 --> 01:26:58,105
...we could have saved
a million relationships.

1237
01:26:58,273 --> 01:26:59,857
You know, I've saved thousands.

1238
01:27:00,025 --> 01:27:02,860
Blocking, an idea or a movement.

1239
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:07,573
Jack will put the final touches together
for what the camera needs for editing...

1240
01:27:07,741 --> 01:27:10,785
...but, you know, he allows me
to block my own sex scenes...

1241
01:27:10,953 --> 01:27:14,831
...and, you know, gives me the freedom to
develop the character and stuff like that.

1242
01:27:14,998 --> 01:27:17,500
God, ha, ha, I don't know any other,
you know, director...

1243
01:27:17,668 --> 01:27:22,296
...who would let an actor,
you know, do that, heh. You know?

1244
01:27:22,464 --> 01:27:27,301
Ha-ha-ha. I don't allow him
to block his own sex scenes.

1245
01:27:27,678 --> 01:27:29,929
It is. It's jealousy.

1246
01:27:30,097 --> 01:27:34,642
It's deceitfulness. It's vindictiveness.
It's all of that stuff, you know?

1247
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,895
But, I mean, God, what can you expect
when you're on top, you know?

1248
01:27:38,063 --> 01:27:40,773
It's like Napoleon.
When he was the king...

1249
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:43,693
...you know, people were constantly
trying to conquer him...

1250
01:27:43,861 --> 01:27:45,945
...you know, in the Roman Empire.

1251
01:27:46,947 --> 01:27:49,448
So it's history repeating itself
all over again.

1252
01:27:49,616 --> 01:27:52,952
To all the critics out there,
I know they're gonna be reviewing this...

1253
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,121
...and I know
they're gonna try to knock me.

1254
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:58,791
I just want them to know... Is it okay
if I say this into the camera, Amber?

1255
01:27:59,001 --> 01:28:00,626
Okay.

1256
01:28:01,128 --> 01:28:03,754
I only am who I am
because I was born that way.

1257
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:08,634
I have a gift, and I am trying
to not be selfish about it, but to use it.

1258
01:28:08,802 --> 01:28:12,972
Okay? And if you wanna knock me for that,
it's your own problem, okay?

1259
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:15,516
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

1260
01:28:16,768 --> 01:28:18,019
I'm gonna keep rocking on.

1261
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:20,980
For Dirk Diggler...

1262
01:28:21,148 --> 01:28:24,984
...the future is something
to look forward to, not to fear.

1263
01:28:25,152 --> 01:28:27,528
He is a creative man of many interests:

1264
01:28:27,696 --> 01:28:31,782
Film, poetry, karate, music, and dance.

1265
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:34,827
He is a man of passion and mystery.

1266
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:37,246
He is a man of lust.

1267
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:50,009
- It's my poem to you.
- It's good, Amber. It's really good.

1268
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:53,179
You're like a director now.
So have you shown Jack yet?

1269
01:28:53,347 --> 01:28:55,848
No, just you. I wanted you to be the first.

1270
01:28:56,016 --> 01:28:58,351
- It's really good, Amber. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1271
01:28:58,518 --> 01:29:00,436
- Thanks, baby.
- Wow.

1272
01:29:00,604 --> 01:29:03,522
Um, the only thing I was wondering is...

1273
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:06,359
You might think about cutting that part
where Jack talks...

1274
01:29:06,526 --> 01:29:07,985
- About blocking the sex?
- Yeah.

1275
01:29:09,196 --> 01:29:11,697
That stuff about me
not being a black belt is not true.

1276
01:29:11,865 --> 01:29:14,116
Yeah. I can fix that.

1277
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:16,160
- Ace of spades.
- How did it turn out?

1278
01:29:17,663 --> 01:29:19,497
- Are you sure?
- No.

1279
01:29:19,665 --> 01:29:21,374
- Shit.
- Hello?

1280
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:24,543
- Hey, how was it, man?
- What?

1281
01:29:24,711 --> 01:29:26,629
Really? I bet. You're so good.

1282
01:29:26,797 --> 01:29:30,132
- Look, slow... Slow down. Slow down.
- You'll have to show it to me.

1283
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:36,055
Guys, guys, guys.
Slow down, Colonel. Say again?

1284
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,936
I'll be right there.

1285
01:29:50,904 --> 01:29:52,238
So...?

1286
01:29:52,406 --> 01:29:55,199
Well, let me tell you, Jack, ha, ha.

1287
01:29:56,326 --> 01:30:02,915
I mean, I don't mean to laugh about it,
but she was 15 going on 150, believe me.

1288
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:05,751
She was... You would never know it.
Never know.

1289
01:30:05,919 --> 01:30:09,505
I mean, I was fooled completely.
I mean, I've had a few of them.

1290
01:30:09,673 --> 01:30:10,715
Anyhow...

1291
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,593
You do believe me, don't you, Jack?

1292
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:16,262
Yeah, I believe you.

1293
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:20,599
Anyway, so I take her home, Jack,
you know, and I got her there...

1294
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,768
...and I tell her not to do so much coke...

1295
01:30:22,936 --> 01:30:26,272
...but she must have done 20 lines
of this stuff in, like, 5 minutes.

1296
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,774
It's like a vacuum in her nose.
And there's only...

1297
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:31,152
Just going up like crazy.

1298
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:35,322
Anyway, she's got all this stuff going up,
and the next thing you know, she started...

1299
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:38,701
Something must have broken up there,
blood poured all over the place.

1300
01:30:38,869 --> 01:30:42,204
All over the sheets and everything.
Just... pouring out.

1301
01:30:42,372 --> 01:30:45,249
- Oh, Jack. Oh, God.
- All right.

1302
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:48,461
You thought she was older.
You... You didn't do anything.

1303
01:30:48,628 --> 01:30:52,673
She was just at the... She was at your
place. You didn't do anything, right?

1304
01:30:52,841 --> 01:30:54,383
- Nothing.
- You didn't do anything?

1305
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:57,303
- You know me. I didn't do a thing.
- You didn't do anything?

1306
01:30:57,471 --> 01:31:00,598
- No, I didn't do anything.
- All right, nothing.

1307
01:31:04,561 --> 01:31:06,395
But they, uh...

1308
01:31:07,481 --> 01:31:09,857
They found something at the house.

1309
01:31:12,027 --> 01:31:14,737
- What?
- There's something that's...

1310
01:31:17,324 --> 01:31:21,077
Jack, it's my fucking weakness, Jack.

1311
01:31:21,244 --> 01:31:24,747
It's just, they're so small, and they're
so cute and they're so adorable.

1312
01:31:24,915 --> 01:31:27,666
- I just can't help it when they're so cute...
- Jesus Christ.

1313
01:31:27,834 --> 01:31:30,377
No, no, Jack. Listen, listen.
I don't touch them, Jack.

1314
01:31:30,545 --> 01:31:35,007
I don't touch them in any way, honestly.
Jack, please.

1315
01:31:35,217 --> 01:31:36,801
All right.

1316
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:42,348
Tsk. Well, now you think I'm an asshole.

1317
01:31:43,767 --> 01:31:48,687
Jack, let me tell you this.
I love you, Jack. I'm your friend.

1318
01:31:48,855 --> 01:31:51,774
There's one thing I want you to do, though.
Tell me...

1319
01:31:51,942 --> 01:31:55,069
Jack, come on.
Tell me that you're my friend.

1320
01:31:55,487 --> 01:31:57,988
Just tell me. Am I your friend? Am l...?

1321
01:32:03,328 --> 01:32:04,370
Jack?

1322
01:32:06,206 --> 01:32:07,748
Jack?

1323
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:11,669
Jack, Jack, am I your friend?

1324
01:32:11,837 --> 01:32:16,757
Just tell me. Am I?
Just tell me, Jack. Am I your friend?

1325
01:32:23,181 --> 01:32:25,266
- I do.
- I do too.

1326
01:32:30,772 --> 01:32:32,648
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1327
01:32:38,405 --> 01:32:41,907
Listen, I'm... I'm dying...

1328
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:45,077
- I'm dying to do a movie with you.
- I know you are.

1329
01:32:45,245 --> 01:32:47,538
I mean,
it's such an important thing in my life.

1330
01:32:47,706 --> 01:32:49,748
I spoke to Jack...

1331
01:32:51,918 --> 01:32:53,919
Oh, man. I just...

1332
01:32:54,087 --> 01:32:56,297
- I'll tell you what comes to mind.
- Yeah?

1333
01:32:56,464 --> 01:32:59,717
What comes to mind is
I am the ultimate Latin lover.

1334
01:32:59,885 --> 01:33:03,387
- I've never been to Las Vegas.
- There is no Latin lover like me, understand?

1335
01:33:03,555 --> 01:33:05,389
Once you get Maurice as the Latin lover...

1336
01:33:05,557 --> 01:33:07,433
Have you ever been to, um, Niagara Falls?

1337
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:10,269
- I've been to Las Vegas.
- That is great. That's so great.

1338
01:33:10,437 --> 01:33:13,606
This is gonna be a great opportunity for me
to run the store my way.

1339
01:33:13,773 --> 01:33:15,941
- Just to get those guys off my back.
- Exactly.

1340
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:18,777
- Hello? Champagne.
- I'll run the store my way.

1341
01:33:18,945 --> 01:33:22,031
- You...? Are you guys moving to Bakersfield?
- Did you find a house?

1342
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:23,282
- Yeah.
- Soon?

1343
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:25,576
- I know... l once lived in Bakersfield.
- Yeah?

1344
01:33:25,744 --> 01:33:28,746
Hey, guys, we're losing these two.
They're moving to Bakersfield.

1345
01:33:28,914 --> 01:33:31,749
- Did you like it there?
- Big promotion.

1346
01:33:32,042 --> 01:33:34,460
They look at the movies and say,
"Hell, I can do that."

1347
01:33:34,628 --> 01:33:37,171
- I can do it.
- It's more complicated than that.

1348
01:33:37,339 --> 01:33:39,215
- It's a tough racket, actually.
- Right.

1349
01:33:39,382 --> 01:33:41,592
Hey, Dirk, you made it.

1350
01:33:41,968 --> 01:33:43,969
- Hey, Jack.
- How you doing?

1351
01:33:44,137 --> 01:33:46,555
Good. Who's that?

1352
01:33:46,723 --> 01:33:48,974
Hi. I'm Johnny Doe.

1353
01:33:49,142 --> 01:33:51,518
You're Dirk Diggler.

1354
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,773
It's great to meet you.

1355
01:33:57,484 --> 01:34:00,527
Johnny's, uh, the new boy on the street.

1356
01:34:00,695 --> 01:34:03,656
He's interested in, uh, show business.

1357
01:34:09,663 --> 01:34:11,372
He's very tired.

1358
01:34:11,539 --> 01:34:15,584
And, uh, he's shy, you know?

1359
01:34:16,962 --> 01:34:20,547
So like I said, it's a tough...
It's a tough business.

1360
01:34:20,715 --> 01:34:22,216
You got a great kisser...

1361
01:34:22,384 --> 01:34:28,013
...but, you know, there's a lot of work
involved, a lot of people.

1362
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,641
We all have to work our buns off.
Know what I mean?

1363
01:34:30,809 --> 01:34:36,021
I mean, it takes 15, 16 guys
just to do the lighting.

1364
01:34:37,607 --> 01:34:40,150
No, no, no. It's crystal, man.
You just wanna do bumps.

1365
01:34:40,318 --> 01:34:44,071
- Shut up, man.
- All right.

1366
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:46,282
Hey, you guys.

1367
01:34:46,741 --> 01:34:48,242
What?

1368
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:51,328
- Just saying hey.
- Yeah, whatever.

1369
01:34:52,205 --> 01:34:54,039
Oh, man.

1370
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:56,917
- Oh!
- You all right?

1371
01:34:57,085 --> 01:35:00,921
- It's fucking getting me fucking high, man.
- Yeah. It's that carpet dope.

1372
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:04,633
It's the kind of dope
they used to put carpet in.

1373
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:08,387
You know, they'd mix it up in the bathtub
and while they were mixing it up...

1374
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:11,557
...they'd drop in a hunk of carpet into it.

1375
01:35:12,892 --> 01:35:14,226
Ow!

1376
01:35:14,394 --> 01:35:18,105
It's a lot better than that pink shit,
I tell you. The pink shit's fucking weird.

1377
01:35:18,273 --> 01:35:20,357
They put fish scales in that shit.

1378
01:35:31,745 --> 01:35:33,412
Fuck.

1379
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:45,257
You look good. You ready?

1380
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:47,259
You ready?

1381
01:35:54,517 --> 01:35:56,435
Come on.

1382
01:35:59,105 --> 01:36:02,107
I am a star.
I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.

1383
01:36:02,275 --> 01:36:04,443
My cock can get hard. Come on. Fuck.

1384
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:08,072
Please don't do this to me.
No, please. Come on.

1385
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:11,116
I'm a star. I am...

1386
01:36:16,623 --> 01:36:19,166
Again. You ready?

1387
01:36:20,668 --> 01:36:22,586
I'm born ready.

1388
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:24,797
Come on.

1389
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,343
- What?
- It's just there's a thing there...

1390
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:30,969
- No.
- That'll work.

1391
01:36:31,137 --> 01:36:32,554
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1392
01:36:32,722 --> 01:36:34,473
I'm ready to shoot.

1393
01:36:35,058 --> 01:36:38,519
- Uh, 20 minutes, huh?
- No. I'm ready now. It's gotta be now.

1394
01:36:38,686 --> 01:36:39,853
Twenty minutes, babe.

1395
01:36:40,021 --> 01:36:43,857
Fuck it. Hey, no. Hey, Jack.
I'm ready to shoot now.

1396
01:36:44,025 --> 01:36:46,610
My cock is ready. I wanna fuck. Let's go.

1397
01:36:46,778 --> 01:36:48,237
Twenty minutes.

1398
01:36:48,405 --> 01:36:50,989
- I wanna fuck. Who's it gonna be?
- What?

1399
01:36:51,157 --> 01:36:53,450
Who do you want to start fucking?
Me or him?

1400
01:36:53,618 --> 01:36:54,660
- What?
- Shut up, okay?

1401
01:36:54,828 --> 01:36:57,746
- I didn't do anything to you.
- What? You're not even an actor.

1402
01:36:57,914 --> 01:37:00,541
- You got no business being here.
- Knock this shit off.

1403
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:01,834
- Yes, I am.
- No, no.

1404
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:04,670
- I'm an actor. I'm a real fucking actor.
- Shut up.

1405
01:37:04,838 --> 01:37:06,004
- What?
- Hey, come on.

1406
01:37:06,172 --> 01:37:07,423
- Shut up.
- No.

1407
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:10,300
Stop this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
I want you to go in there.

1408
01:37:10,468 --> 01:37:13,679
I want you to cool off, okay?

1409
01:37:13,847 --> 01:37:16,557
Just cool off and we'll come back
and shoot the scene.

1410
01:37:16,724 --> 01:37:19,101
- I said, I'm ready to shoot.
- Not now.

1411
01:37:19,269 --> 01:37:21,728
I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack.

1412
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,273
I'm not gonna shoot you
in the state you're in.

1413
01:37:24,441 --> 01:37:26,942
What do you mean, "state"?
State? State of California?

1414
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:30,195
- I know where the fuck I am, Jack.
- You've been up for two days.

1415
01:37:30,363 --> 01:37:32,030
No, I haven't been up for two days.

1416
01:37:32,198 --> 01:37:34,700
Nevertheless,
you look like you haven't been to sleep.

1417
01:37:34,868 --> 01:37:38,203
So I ain't gonna shoot you this way
because you don't look good.

1418
01:37:38,371 --> 01:37:40,581
You know what?
You don't tell me anything, okay?

1419
01:37:40,748 --> 01:37:42,583
- Really?
- You're not the boss of me.

1420
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,209
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you're the king, huh?

1421
01:37:44,377 --> 01:37:46,170
- Yes!
- Don't you fucking touch me, man!

1422
01:37:46,337 --> 01:37:48,964
- Dirk, honey...
- No, no. No. You shut up too.

1423
01:37:49,132 --> 01:37:51,592
You're not the mother of me
and you're not my boss.

1424
01:37:51,759 --> 01:37:53,552
- You're not my fucking mom.
- Hey, man...

1425
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,304
- Dirk, honey...
- I'll take you home.

1426
01:37:55,472 --> 01:37:59,475
No, no. I'm ready to shoot the scene.
I wanna shoot the scene. I'm fine.

1427
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:01,143
I want you out of here.

1428
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:05,189
- Look, it's over, okay? I'm done.
- Listen to me, kid. I want you...

1429
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:07,191
- Don't you fucking call me a kid.
- What?

1430
01:38:07,358 --> 01:38:10,986
I'll fuck you up. You wanna see me
kick some ass? I know fucking karate.

1431
01:38:11,154 --> 01:38:13,822
- You're fucking fired! You are fired!
- Come on, come on.

1432
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:16,617
- You're fired, you goddamn kid!
- What is that? What is that?

1433
01:38:16,784 --> 01:38:18,619
- Jack! Jack!
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1434
01:38:18,786 --> 01:38:21,538
No, no, no. You know what?
I'm the biggest star here, man.

1435
01:38:21,706 --> 01:38:23,707
That's the way it is.

1436
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:28,337
I wanna fuck. It's my big dick.
So everybody get ready fucking now!

1437
01:38:30,215 --> 01:38:32,925
You know what? Here.
I don't need this shit.

1438
01:38:33,092 --> 01:38:35,636
You know, fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

1439
01:38:35,803 --> 01:38:37,930
You're not my boss!
You're not the king of me!

1440
01:38:38,097 --> 01:38:39,973
I am the fucking king of Dirk!

1441
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:43,227
You're nothing without me, Jack.
You're fucking nothing. Fuck this.

1442
01:38:43,394 --> 01:38:45,103
- I don't need this shit.
- Dirk, wait.

1443
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:47,356
- Fuck this.
- I'm so sorry, Jack. I'm so sorry.

1444
01:38:47,524 --> 01:38:50,192
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'm gonna straighten him out.

1445
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:06,917
Okay, Dirk, you ready?

1446
01:39:07,085 --> 01:39:09,086
Yeah. I was born ready, Nick.
Let's go, man.

1447
01:39:09,921 --> 01:39:11,755
- Dirk Diggler demo.
- Keep the vocals up.

1448
01:39:11,923 --> 01:39:14,633
"You Got the Touch," take seven.

1449
01:39:15,468 --> 01:39:16,969
Excuse me, Reed.

1450
01:39:17,136 --> 01:39:19,638

is taking away from the vocal?

1464
01:40:19,949 --> 01:40:24,036
No, not really. Maybe.
It sounds balanced to me.

1465
01:40:24,203 --> 01:40:26,204
It's definitely taking away from my vocal.

1466
01:40:26,372 --> 01:40:29,041
Just take the bass down
and bring up the vocals.

1467
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:31,835
Okay, let's do it, Nick. You heard him.

1468
01:40:32,545 --> 01:40:34,046
You wanna take it from the top?

1469
01:40:34,213 --> 01:40:36,715

1485
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:39,403
- Let's lay it down. Nick?
- You wanna lay it down?

1486
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:41,154
Were we rolling on that rehearsal?

1487
01:41:41,322 --> 01:41:44,116
Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?

1488
01:41:44,283 --> 01:41:47,285
- Is that what you want?
- It would be nice.

1489
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,663
Fuck her in the ass.

1490
01:41:50,456 --> 01:41:51,998
Lock and load, Jack.

1491
01:41:59,716 --> 01:42:02,175
I was gonna take a pottery class
at Everywoman's Village.

1492
01:42:02,343 --> 01:42:04,636
- Oh, I wanna do that.
- Okay, we'll do that.

1493
01:42:04,804 --> 01:42:06,763
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 3.

1494
01:42:06,931 --> 01:42:09,391
- I was thinking something.
- What?

1495
01:42:09,934 --> 01:42:12,519
I was gonna see about taking the GED.
Do you know what that is?

1496
01:42:12,687 --> 01:42:16,189
- Mm-hm, for high school, to graduate.
- It's because I never got my diploma.

1497
01:42:16,357 --> 01:42:19,609
I feel bad, you know, that, uh...
I think you were right about that.

1498
01:42:19,777 --> 01:42:22,738
You should do it, Rollergirl,
because you know what?

1499
01:42:22,905 --> 01:42:25,615
If you wanted to, you could do anything.

1500
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:33,665
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes. That's me. Yes.

1501
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:36,126
- You have your loan application?
- Yes, I do. Right there.

1502
01:42:36,294 --> 01:42:38,378
- Good. You wanna follow me?
- Yes, I do.

1503
01:42:38,838 --> 01:42:42,007
Hey, Kurt, are we gonna
have any more coverage on this, or...?

1504
01:42:42,175 --> 01:42:44,426
No, no. We just keep shooting.
This is video.

1505
01:42:44,594 --> 01:42:47,095
We shoot and shoot,
and then we deal with it later.

1506
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:50,015
All right, now, Summer,
I want you to take Skye's thong off.

1507
01:42:50,183 --> 01:42:53,560
That thong thing. Yeah, actually take
it off. That's good. And finger it.

1508
01:42:53,728 --> 01:42:55,520
Oh, that's good. Lick the thong. Yeah.

1509
01:42:55,688 --> 01:42:58,106
You know,
that's really good technically, but...

1510
01:42:58,274 --> 01:43:01,109
But it lacks passion.
I wanna see some passion here.

1511
01:43:01,277 --> 01:43:02,694
Yes, bitch!

1512
01:43:04,322 --> 01:43:06,198
Yeah, that's it.

1513
01:43:06,783 --> 01:43:08,074
Lick my balls.

1514
01:43:08,826 --> 01:43:09,910
Fuck me.

1515
01:43:11,954 --> 01:43:13,288
Who's your daddy, bitch?

1516
01:43:14,332 --> 01:43:18,001
You live. You live. Yes!

1517
01:43:20,296 --> 01:43:22,005
I'm back.

1518
01:43:22,423 --> 01:43:23,465
Perfect timing.

1519
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:26,259
I'm back.

1520
01:43:28,387 --> 01:43:30,514
- What the fuck took you so long, man?
- Todd.

1521
01:43:41,067 --> 01:43:42,108
Fuck.

1522
01:43:42,276 --> 01:43:46,154
That's really what Buck's Super Stereo World
is all about. It's about the customer.

1523
01:43:46,322 --> 01:43:48,907
People wanna know
what they're getting into technically.

1524
01:43:49,075 --> 01:43:51,409
I have the specific
technical hi-fi background...

1525
01:43:51,577 --> 01:43:53,787
...to answer any question
somebody's gonna have.

1526
01:43:53,955 --> 01:43:56,289
I've been in sound equipment
long enough to know...

1527
01:43:56,457 --> 01:43:58,917
...what a guy wants
when he walks through that door.

1528
01:43:59,085 --> 01:44:02,629
That's the kind of personal touch
Buck's Super Stereo World's gonna have.

1529
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:12,430
I miss my two sons, you know.
I miss my little Andrew and... And my Dirk.

1530
01:44:12,598 --> 01:44:16,226
You know,
I always felt like Dirk was my baby.

1531
01:44:16,394 --> 01:44:17,686
My new baby.

1532
01:44:18,104 --> 01:44:21,398
- Don't you miss Dirk?
- Yeah.

1533
01:44:21,566 --> 01:44:25,193
He's so fucking talented, the bastard.
You know, I just...

1534
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:31,825
I love him, Rollergirl. I mean, I
really love the stupid jerk, ha, ha.

1535
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,579
I love you, Mom.

1536
01:44:35,788 --> 01:44:38,665
I want you to be my mom, Amber.
Are you my mom?

1537
01:44:39,125 --> 01:44:42,252
I'll just...
I'll ask you if you're my mom, okay?

1538
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:45,297
And you say yes, okay?
Are you my mom?

1539
01:44:45,923 --> 01:44:47,173
Yes, honey.

1540
01:44:47,341 --> 01:44:50,677
- Ha.
- Yes. Yes.

1541
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:54,973
- Don't try...
- Hold on. Come on, come on, all right?

1542
01:44:55,141 --> 01:44:57,350
All we need is the tapes, Burt.

1543
01:44:57,518 --> 01:44:59,895
No. You don't get them until you pay.

1544
01:45:00,062 --> 01:45:02,564
In our situation,
that doesn't make any fucking sense!

1545
01:45:02,732 --> 01:45:05,108
Wait. We can't pay
the price of the demo tapes...

1546
01:45:05,276 --> 01:45:08,737
...unless we take the demo tapes
to the record company and get paid!

1547
01:45:08,905 --> 01:45:10,947
Hello? Exactly.

1548
01:45:11,324 --> 01:45:15,160
That's not an MP.
That's a YP. "Your problem."

1549
01:45:15,328 --> 01:45:18,163
Come up with the money
and I'll give you the tapes. That's it.

1550
01:45:18,331 --> 01:45:21,791
Okay, now you're talking above my head.
I don't know this industry jargon.

1551
01:45:21,959 --> 01:45:23,335
YP, MP. Whatever, okay?

1552
01:45:23,502 --> 01:45:26,087
All I know is that
I cannot get a record contract...

1553
01:45:26,255 --> 01:45:29,466
We cannot get a record contract
unless I take these tapes...

1554
01:45:29,634 --> 01:45:31,635
And granted,
the tapes themselves are your...

1555
01:45:31,802 --> 01:45:34,679
Are your busi... Are your...
You own them, okay?

1556
01:45:34,847 --> 01:45:38,516
But the magic that is on the tapes,
that fucking heart and soul...

1557
01:45:38,684 --> 01:45:41,978
...that we put into those tapes,
that is ours, and you don't own that.

1558
01:45:42,146 --> 01:45:45,523
Now, I need to take that magic
and get it to the record company.

1559
01:45:45,691 --> 01:45:48,568
They're waiting. We were supposed
to be there a half-hour ago.

1560
01:45:48,736 --> 01:45:51,863
We look like assholes right now, man.

1561
01:45:58,329 --> 01:46:02,165
I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.
I can't. I just... Let's have fun now.

1562
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:05,919
Let's just go and go and go,
because it's over.

1563
01:46:06,087 --> 01:46:09,881
There's too many things. Too many things.
Too many things. Too many things.

1564
01:46:10,049 --> 01:46:12,717
- Okay.
- Let's go walk.

1565
01:46:12,885 --> 01:46:16,012
- I don't wanna leave this room.
- Me either, ha, ha.

1566
01:46:16,847 --> 01:46:18,264
I love you, honey.

1567
01:46:18,432 --> 01:46:20,225
- I love you, Mom.
- Aah!

1568
01:46:20,393 --> 01:46:24,562
Let me explain to him in simple arithmetic.
One, two, three.

1569
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:28,733
Because you don't fucking get it, Burt.
You give us the tapes.

1570
01:46:28,901 --> 01:46:32,362
We get the record contract. We come back
and give you your fucking money.

1571
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:34,614
Have you heard the tapes?
Have you heard them?

1572
01:46:34,782 --> 01:46:37,325
We're guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good!

1573
01:46:37,493 --> 01:46:40,453
Okay, now I got it. I got it.
Now I understand.

1574
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:44,082
I know you want it to happen,
but it's not gonna happen...

1575
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:47,335
...because it's a Catch-22, and that's it.

1576
01:46:47,503 --> 01:46:50,046
What the fuck does that mean?
What is a Catch-22, Burt?

1577
01:46:50,214 --> 01:46:53,049
- Aah.
- Twenty-two, gentlemen. Think about it.

1578
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,803
- You know what I'm thinking about, man?
- No, Dirk!

1579
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:59,556
I'm thinking about
kicking some fucking ass in here!

1580
01:46:59,724 --> 01:47:01,141
Scotty, get him out of here.

1581
01:47:01,308 --> 01:47:04,936
Thanks a lot for backing us up too.
Real good.

1582
01:47:06,105 --> 01:47:07,313
Fuck.

1583
01:47:11,819 --> 01:47:14,195
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes.

1584
01:47:15,448 --> 01:47:17,073
We can't help you.

1585
01:47:19,785 --> 01:47:23,747
I have all the papers, though. I mean,
every... Everything's in order, yes?

1586
01:47:23,914 --> 01:47:28,001
Yes, yes, but we can't give you a loan.
I'm sorry.

1587
01:47:28,169 --> 01:47:29,586
- Why?
- I don't understand. Why?

1588
01:47:29,754 --> 01:47:31,463
Yeah, why can't you give me the loan?

1589
01:47:33,591 --> 01:47:35,467
Mr. Swope, you're a pornographer.

1590
01:47:35,634 --> 01:47:38,094
This bank is not in business
to support pornography.

1591
01:47:38,262 --> 01:47:41,014
Okay, I'm not a pornographer, though.
I'm an actor.

1592
01:47:41,182 --> 01:47:42,849
- I'm sorry.
- Please, please.

1593
01:47:43,017 --> 01:47:46,436
Now, this is a new business for me.

1594
01:47:46,604 --> 01:47:52,609
All right? It's a real thing that I wanna do.
It's a real thing that I can do. Please.

1595
01:47:53,152 --> 01:47:55,070
- I'm sorry.
- Well, we did everything right.

1596
01:47:55,237 --> 01:47:57,572
Okay, honey, it's okay.
Just wait a minute, wait a minute.

1597
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:00,617
Now, let's just take a minute, okay?
Um...

1598
01:48:01,327 --> 01:48:04,454
Look, you have something to say.
I have something to say, all right?

1599
01:48:04,622 --> 01:48:06,831
So let's just talk, okay?

1600
01:48:06,999 --> 01:48:10,168
If there is something
that I didn't fill out correctly on this...

1601
01:48:10,336 --> 01:48:14,089
...or if there is something I left out,
or maybe you want me to write on there...

1602
01:48:14,256 --> 01:48:17,217
...just tell me what to write on there.
I'll write it on there.

1603
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:19,302
I'm sorry.

1604
01:48:22,014 --> 01:48:25,058
You're not being fair. This isn't fair.

1605
01:48:25,226 --> 01:48:28,478
This financial institution
cannot endorse pornography.

1606
01:48:28,646 --> 01:48:31,064
Stop saying that!
Will you quit saying "pornography"?

1607
01:48:31,232 --> 01:48:35,318
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Please. Now, please. I'm sorry.

1608
01:48:37,696 --> 01:48:41,491
I'm an... l am an ac... I am an actor.

1609
01:48:45,746 --> 01:48:47,038
Come on.

1610
01:49:13,566 --> 01:49:16,401
- That guy wants that thing for the thing...
- You fix it up.

1611
01:49:30,249 --> 01:49:32,083
Who's your daddy?

1612
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:35,128
- How is it?
- What it is, what it is.

1613
01:49:35,296 --> 01:49:36,921
Yeah.

1614
01:49:38,966 --> 01:49:41,467
Suck that cock, bitch.

1615
01:49:55,524 --> 01:49:58,067
- Hello. You must be Maggie.
- Yes.

1616
01:49:58,235 --> 01:50:01,487
- Kathleen O'Malley. I'm the judge.
- Yes.

1617
01:50:03,782 --> 01:50:06,618
- You have a lawyer with you?
- No, I don't.

1618
01:50:06,785 --> 01:50:08,620
I do not.

1619
01:50:25,471 --> 01:50:28,473
- Hello, judge.
- Morning, counselor.

1620
01:50:49,411 --> 01:50:51,120
You've been divorced for six years?

1621
01:50:51,288 --> 01:50:53,915
Yes, since 1977.

1622
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:57,627
And the agreement on the money settlement
has been taken care of?

1623
01:50:58,545 --> 01:51:00,171
Yes.

1624
01:51:00,589 --> 01:51:05,468
So, what we're talking about then is coming
to an agreement on the custody of...

1625
01:51:05,636 --> 01:51:07,595
- Of "Andrew."
- Yes.

1626
01:51:09,348 --> 01:51:11,849
Oh, what was decided during the divorce?

1627
01:51:12,017 --> 01:51:15,561
Well, initially, uh,
Andrew was to go with his father...

1628
01:51:15,729 --> 01:51:18,064
...with a visitation with his mother...

1629
01:51:18,232 --> 01:51:23,236
...uh, from, uh,
Saturday noon to Sunday at 7...

1630
01:51:23,404 --> 01:51:28,866
...with his mother entitled to bring Andrew
to her house or any reasonable place.

1631
01:51:29,034 --> 01:51:31,828
- Was that the understanding?
- Yes.

1632
01:51:32,329 --> 01:51:34,747
Why wasn't that visiting privilege
honored, then?

1633
01:51:34,915 --> 01:51:38,334
- It was for a while.
- I only saw him twice.

1634
01:51:38,502 --> 01:51:41,504
It said "reasonable place."

1635
01:51:41,672 --> 01:51:46,050
I didn't think that a house of prostitution
and drugs and pornography was that.

1636
01:51:46,218 --> 01:51:47,760
I'm sorry?

1637
01:51:47,928 --> 01:51:51,264
My wife is in the pornography business.

1638
01:51:52,057 --> 01:51:54,350
I didn't think that environment
was safe for my son.

1639
01:51:54,518 --> 01:51:59,063
No, this is not right.
Um, my son was never exposed to drugs...

1640
01:51:59,231 --> 01:52:01,441
...or pornographic material
or any of those things.

1641
01:52:01,608 --> 01:52:03,359
My husband just assumed...

1642
01:52:03,527 --> 01:52:06,863
I saw it with my own eye, Maggie.

1643
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:09,490
Did you register a complaint?

1644
01:52:09,658 --> 01:52:12,785
Uh, my client
didn't officially register, Your Honor.

1645
01:52:12,953 --> 01:52:18,082
But I think the circumstances call
for immediate action, uh...

1646
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:19,751
...for the safety of the child.

1647
01:52:19,918 --> 01:52:23,921
The problem is, judge,
is that my ex-wife, ahem...

1648
01:52:24,089 --> 01:52:29,260
...she's a sick person, and she needs help.
She deals in sex and drugs for a living.

1649
01:52:29,428 --> 01:52:31,387
No, I don't do drugs.

1650
01:52:31,555 --> 01:52:34,891
Your Honor, she has been
in and out of trouble with the law...

1651
01:52:35,059 --> 01:52:36,893
...on several occasions
for this sort of thing.

1652
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:40,396
No, no. No, not anymore. No.

1653
01:52:40,564 --> 01:52:42,857
Have you ever been arrested?

1654
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,943
Yes.

1655
01:52:47,196 --> 01:52:51,783
When was the last time you were arrested,
and, uh, what was the charge?

1656
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:13,262
Okay, okay, okay,
let's get ready for this experiment.

1657
01:53:13,806 --> 01:53:16,140
Hi. Jack Horner here.

1658
01:53:16,308 --> 01:53:20,478
Uh, we're in the back of this beautiful
limousine in the back seat...

1659
01:53:20,646 --> 01:53:24,232
...riding along west on Sherman Way.

1660
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:30,321
And beside me is a beautiful, talented,
gorgeous, young actress...

1661
01:53:30,489 --> 01:53:33,741
...from adult cinema, Miss Rollergirl.

1662
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:36,202
Hi. Hello. Howdy.

1663
01:53:36,370 --> 01:53:39,205
Are you ready
to get on with this experiment?

1664
01:53:39,373 --> 01:53:42,041
- Ready. Ready like Freddy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1665
01:53:42,209 --> 01:53:47,088
Yes. And we're, uh, going along,
like I said, west on Sherman Way...

1666
01:53:47,256 --> 01:53:50,842
...and this is called On the Lookout.

1667
01:53:51,009 --> 01:53:54,846
That's the name of this show.
On the lookout for a young stud...

1668
01:53:55,013 --> 01:53:58,266
...who maybe
will get in the back seat here...

1669
01:53:58,434 --> 01:54:01,769
...and get it on with Rollergirl.

1670
01:54:01,937 --> 01:54:06,858
Uh, and we're going to make
film history...

1671
01:54:07,025 --> 01:54:09,527
...right here on videotape.

1672
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:26,252
- Hello?
- Hey.

1673
01:54:26,879 --> 01:54:28,921
Waiting for someone?

1674
01:54:30,215 --> 01:54:31,757
Yeah.

1675
01:54:31,925 --> 01:54:36,095
I'm waiting for somebody, but I'm not sure
if they're gonna show up, though.

1676
01:54:36,972 --> 01:54:39,015
You wanna wait in the car?

1677
01:54:41,018 --> 01:54:42,477
Cool.

1678
01:55:10,589 --> 01:55:12,340
I'm Joe.

1679
01:55:13,091 --> 01:55:14,926
Dirk.

1680
01:55:17,596 --> 01:55:19,597
You know who I am?

1681
01:55:21,642 --> 01:55:23,267
No.

1682
01:55:24,686 --> 01:55:26,938
My name's Dirk Diggler.

1683
01:55:28,524 --> 01:55:30,107
No.

1684
01:55:30,609 --> 01:55:33,736
I mean, you're a guy.
I'm just helping you out.

1685
01:55:34,321 --> 01:55:35,780
Yeah.

1686
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:38,199
What do you see here?

1687
01:55:39,576 --> 01:55:41,452
Well, I see a girl. Ha, ha.

1688
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:44,205
Ha, yeah. Well, you like what you see?

1689
01:55:44,373 --> 01:55:49,126
- Um, yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Ha, ha, all right. Get in.

1690
01:55:49,294 --> 01:55:53,631
Get in and let's make film history.

1691
01:55:56,343 --> 01:55:58,135
So...

1692
01:55:58,929 --> 01:56:00,721
...what do you wanna do?

1693
01:56:01,723 --> 01:56:03,891
It's what you wanna do.

1694
01:56:05,894 --> 01:56:07,812
I wanna watch you.

1695
01:56:08,981 --> 01:56:11,774
I mean, I'm not gay. I just wanna...

1696
01:56:12,943 --> 01:56:16,070
Maybe you could jerk off a little,
and I could watch.

1697
01:56:17,281 --> 01:56:20,825
Maybe I'll join in later,
but for now, I just wanna watch.

1698
01:56:22,995 --> 01:56:24,787
Twenty bucks.

1699
01:56:26,999 --> 01:56:29,041
Ten's all I have.

1700
01:56:33,297 --> 01:56:34,880
You go to school?

1701
01:56:35,048 --> 01:56:37,675
Um, yeah. Yeah, I do.

1702
01:56:37,843 --> 01:56:39,719
Where do you go to school?

1703
01:56:39,886 --> 01:56:41,554
Um...

1704
01:56:41,972 --> 01:56:43,931
Is it okay if I don't tell you?

1705
01:56:44,099 --> 01:56:46,267
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

1706
01:56:46,435 --> 01:56:47,852
Ahem.

1707
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:50,187
You recognize Rollergirl from her films?

1708
01:56:50,355 --> 01:56:54,900
Yep. Ha, ha, yeah. Yeah,
we watch her films a lot at my frat house.

1709
01:56:55,068 --> 01:56:58,154
- I go to, uh... I go to CSUN.
- Wonderful.

1710
01:56:58,322 --> 01:57:01,032
Yeah, the fucking guys
will never believe this, ha, ha.

1711
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:06,829
So, you know, we've done a whole
bunch of films together, Rollergirl and l.

1712
01:57:07,205 --> 01:57:08,706
Do you remember me?

1713
01:57:08,874 --> 01:57:10,374
Ahem.

1714
01:57:10,542 --> 01:57:12,793
We went to school together.

1715
01:57:14,504 --> 01:57:16,589
Your name's Brandy, right?

1716
01:57:17,716 --> 01:57:20,551
Brandy? Brandy's your name, right?

1717
01:57:22,179 --> 01:57:23,804
No.

1718
01:57:24,056 --> 01:57:27,099
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Your name's not Brandy?

1719
01:57:30,896 --> 01:57:33,648
Well, ha... Okay.

1720
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:40,071
Maybe...? Maybe do it harder?

1721
01:57:49,331 --> 01:57:52,500
Faster. Do it a little faster.

1722
01:57:55,879 --> 01:57:57,838
All right.

1723
01:58:01,176 --> 01:58:05,429
You're hiding her again.
Let's get on the other side. That's it.

1724
01:58:07,099 --> 01:58:10,643
Just nice and sexy, you know...

1725
01:58:10,811 --> 01:58:12,478
Yeah.

1726
01:58:17,484 --> 01:58:21,445
Listen, pal, you gotta make it
a little more sexy, you know?

1727
01:58:21,613 --> 01:58:24,198
Don't just ram it in there like that.

1728
01:58:24,366 --> 01:58:27,410
This is not a hole in the wall, pal.
This is Rollergirl.

1729
01:58:27,869 --> 01:58:29,453
Faster.

1730
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:34,709
Do it faster.

1731
01:58:35,627 --> 01:58:38,796
- Get your hand wet.
- Be quiet.

1732
01:58:40,966 --> 01:58:44,802
Can you be more sexy?
Like, uh, cinematically sexy.

1733
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:46,846
Just don't ram it. Don't...

1734
01:58:48,348 --> 01:58:51,475
Be respectful. This is Rollergirl.

1735
01:58:52,352 --> 01:58:53,686
Are you listening to me, kid?

1736
01:58:53,854 --> 01:58:56,856
- Just let me do my thing. I know what...
- This is stupid, Jack.

1737
01:58:57,023 --> 01:59:01,193
Okay, that's it. Hold it. Cut. Pull over.

1738
01:59:01,653 --> 01:59:02,778
Pull over.

1739
01:59:11,037 --> 01:59:14,373
I can't fucking believe this.
Jesus Christ, you gave me a hard-on, lady.

1740
01:59:14,541 --> 01:59:17,168
The least you could do
is jack me off or something.

1741
01:59:17,794 --> 01:59:19,545
What the fuck did you say?

1742
01:59:20,964 --> 01:59:24,216
I just said it's not that cool
to leave me with a hard-on, all right?

1743
01:59:24,384 --> 01:59:26,385
Fuck you.

1744
01:59:28,513 --> 01:59:30,890
I don't fucking believe this.

1745
01:59:33,143 --> 01:59:35,227
This is a fine life
you've made for yourself.

1746
01:59:37,147 --> 01:59:39,315
You really should be proud.

1747
01:59:39,524 --> 01:59:41,400
I mean, really.

1748
01:59:43,195 --> 01:59:46,197
- Fucker.
- Yeah, fuck you.

1749
01:59:47,032 --> 01:59:49,283
And your fucking films suck now anyway.

1750
01:59:55,123 --> 01:59:56,874
Come on.

1751
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,713
I can't. I can't get it hard, all right?
I just can't. I'm sorry.

1752
02:00:07,469 --> 02:00:11,013
You just shouldn't
do this sort of thing, faggot.

1753
02:00:11,181 --> 02:00:12,556
Get out of the car, man!

1754
02:00:12,724 --> 02:00:15,518
Jack, Jesus. No, Jack. Jack.

1755
02:00:15,685 --> 02:00:18,354
Jack. Jack. Hey.

1756
02:00:18,522 --> 02:00:19,814
Jack. Jack.

1757
02:00:19,981 --> 02:00:22,441
Get him out of the fucking truck, man!

1758
02:00:22,609 --> 02:00:24,235
You shouldn't be coming down here.

1759
02:00:24,402 --> 02:00:27,947
Jack. Jack. Jesus Christ.

1760
02:00:28,114 --> 02:00:31,492
- Come on, Jack. Jack.
- You little fucker.

1761
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:34,286
- You piece of shit. You faggot.
- Fuck you.

1762
02:00:34,454 --> 02:00:36,080
Faggot, you like that?

1763
02:00:36,248 --> 02:00:38,749
- Jack. Jack.
- Amateur fucker.

1764
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,544
Come on.

1765
02:00:49,594 --> 02:00:51,929
You don't ever disrespect me.

1766
02:00:52,097 --> 02:00:55,850
Fucker! You don't ever disrespect me,
you fucker!

1767
02:00:56,017 --> 02:00:59,603
- Motherfucker, look at you now, huh?
- That's what you get, faggot.

1768
02:00:59,771 --> 02:01:02,731
You think you can fuck?
You can't fuck me, you fucker!

1769
02:01:03,233 --> 02:01:06,944
You can't touch me!
You can't touch me, you fucker!

1770
02:01:07,112 --> 02:01:08,487
Stop it.

1771
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:15,452
- You don't do this, donkey-dick. You don't.
- Unh!

1772
02:01:15,871 --> 02:01:17,663
Fucking faggot.

1773
02:01:22,127 --> 02:01:26,630
- You don't ever disrespect me, you fucker!
- Come on.

1774
02:01:26,798 --> 02:01:29,133
You fucking piece of shit!

1775
02:01:29,301 --> 02:01:34,805
You fucking... Fucking die, you shithead!

1776
02:02:11,801 --> 02:02:13,385
- Okay.
- Okay.

1777
02:02:13,553 --> 02:02:18,057
- What do you want?
- I want an apple fritter, jelly...

1778
02:02:18,224 --> 02:02:22,853
...um, chocolate with sprinkles,
and, um, a bear claw too.

1779
02:02:23,021 --> 02:02:26,190
- A bear claw. Okay.
- Yeah. And hurry.

1780
02:02:26,358 --> 02:02:29,276
Hey, how's my little kung-fu fighter?

1781
02:02:29,444 --> 02:02:31,570
He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

1782
02:02:31,738 --> 02:02:33,906
- Ha, ha. See? That's a boy.
- Uh-huh.

1783
02:02:34,074 --> 02:02:35,449
Okay.

1784
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:40,162
- Okay, be right back.
- Okay.

1785
02:02:42,207 --> 02:02:44,959
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up? Can I help you?

1786
02:02:45,126 --> 02:02:47,795
- Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna get a dozen.
- All right.

1787
02:02:52,634 --> 02:02:55,886
Let me get, uh, a couple bear claws.

1788
02:02:56,805 --> 02:02:59,431
- Two bear claws.
- Yeah.

1789
02:03:00,725 --> 02:03:02,726
A couple glazed.

1790
02:03:04,896 --> 02:03:08,399
Oh, apple fritter. No, no. Not that one.
The one in front of it.

1791
02:03:08,566 --> 02:03:12,653
- Yeah, that one. That one. That one.
- Okay.

1792
02:03:15,365 --> 02:03:17,992
Oh, yeah. Two chocolate.

1793
02:03:18,827 --> 02:03:19,868
Two chocolates.

1794
02:03:20,036 --> 02:03:22,121
Old-fashioned, yeah.
Give me two of those.

1795
02:03:22,288 --> 02:03:24,415
Two old-fashioned.

1796
02:03:25,125 --> 02:03:28,877
Oh, is this, uh...?
Did you do this for the Christmas?

1797
02:03:29,045 --> 02:03:31,046
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's cute.

1798
02:03:31,214 --> 02:03:35,759
Yeah, give me two of those
sprinkly Christmas things.

1799
02:03:35,927 --> 02:03:37,428
- Yeah.
- Christmas hoops.

1800
02:03:37,595 --> 02:03:39,263
That's great.

1801
02:03:41,266 --> 02:03:44,852
- Okay, uh, how many is that?
- That's 11.

1802
02:03:49,149 --> 02:03:52,693
All right, motherfucker,
empty the cash register now. And hurry up.

1803
02:03:52,861 --> 02:03:55,904
- Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.

1804
02:03:56,072 --> 02:03:57,823
Hurry up with that shit.

1805
02:04:02,287 --> 02:04:05,456
No, no, no, motherfucker.
Empty the safe too, asshole.

1806
02:04:08,793 --> 02:04:10,294
And I ain't got all night.

1807
02:04:13,465 --> 02:04:16,425
- Don't even move.
- I'm not moving. I'm not moving.

1808
02:04:16,593 --> 02:04:18,469
Shut up!

1809
02:04:23,099 --> 02:04:25,350
- Don't fucking move, man.
- I'm not... I'm not...

1810
02:04:25,518 --> 02:04:27,478
Shut the fuck up.

1811
02:04:27,645 --> 02:04:29,480
Hey, don't... Don't do that. No, no, no.

1812
02:04:29,647 --> 02:04:33,025
No, no, no. You shut the fuck up.

1813
02:04:33,818 --> 02:04:35,152
Give me this sh...

1814
02:05:25,703 --> 02:05:27,454
All right, this could be the thing.

1815
02:05:27,622 --> 02:05:29,873
Something to help us
score a little extra cash.

1816
02:05:30,375 --> 02:05:34,044
The guy's name is Rahad Jackson.
He's got more money than God.

1817
02:05:34,212 --> 02:05:37,131
He's got twice as much coke, crank,
and smack. All right?

1818
02:05:37,298 --> 02:05:40,759
This guy's gonna buy just about anything
anybody wants to sell him.

1819
02:05:40,927 --> 02:05:44,680
Just likes people hanging around
at his house partying, the whole thing.

1820
02:05:44,848 --> 02:05:46,223
How do you know him?

1821
02:05:46,391 --> 02:05:49,059
He used to come to Party Boys a lot.
Mutrix introduced me.

1822
02:05:49,227 --> 02:05:51,687
How will we do it exactly?
How would it all go down?

1823
02:05:51,855 --> 02:05:54,773
It's gonna go down like this.
I'm gonna call him on the phone...

1824
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:58,277
...and I'm gonna tell him
I got a half a key of quality stuff.

1825
02:05:58,444 --> 02:06:00,404
Do you have his phone number?

1826
02:06:00,572 --> 02:06:01,989
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1827
02:06:02,157 --> 02:06:05,367
So I'm gonna call him on the phone.
I'm gonna give him a price.

1828
02:06:05,535 --> 02:06:06,577
How much?

1829
02:06:06,744 --> 02:06:09,079
Well, it's half a key, man.
It's, like, 5000 bucks.

1830
02:06:09,247 --> 02:06:12,499
- You split that up three ways...
- It's enough to get the Vette fixed.

1831
02:06:12,667 --> 02:06:15,711
That's right, man.
So we're gonna do the deal.

1832
02:06:15,879 --> 02:06:18,422
We're gonna drop
half a key of baking soda into a bag.

1833
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:20,591
We're gonna walk over there.
We're gonna...

1834
02:06:22,093 --> 02:06:24,386
Boom. Right there.

1835
02:06:24,554 --> 02:06:28,640
- This could be a nifty bit of hustle-bustle.
- Wait. Do you have his address?

1836
02:06:28,808 --> 02:06:30,976
Fucking, Reed, yeah.
I got his fucking address.

1837
02:06:31,144 --> 02:06:33,812
What? Yeah, okay, question. Sorry.

1838
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:37,107
Hold on. What if he tests the stuff out?

1839
02:06:37,692 --> 02:06:39,943
- He won't.
- Well, how do you know that?

1840
02:06:40,445 --> 02:06:44,031
Because I know he won't. I'm positive.

1841
02:06:44,199 --> 02:06:46,450
You guys should be careful.

1842
02:06:46,618 --> 02:06:48,785
- Scotty.
- What?

1843
02:06:48,953 --> 02:06:50,120
What do you mean, "What?"

1844
02:06:50,288 --> 02:06:54,166
Do me a favor. Just mind your business,
please. What the fuck?

1845
02:06:54,334 --> 02:06:55,834
Sorry.

1846
02:06:56,002 --> 02:06:57,794
Anyway, heh...

1847
02:06:57,962 --> 02:07:00,464
Dump it in there good. Dump it in clean.

1848
02:07:02,008 --> 02:07:04,134
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't lay this all on me, man.

1849
02:07:04,302 --> 02:07:06,470
We're gonna go in there... This is it.

1850
02:07:06,638 --> 02:07:08,096
Fine.

1851
02:07:10,141 --> 02:07:11,934
You guys ready for this?

1852
02:07:12,101 --> 02:07:13,810
- I am.
- Dirk?

1853
02:07:13,978 --> 02:07:18,315
- Me? Yeah, yeah. I was born ready, man.
- All right.

1854
02:07:19,692 --> 02:07:21,318
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a big gun.

1855
02:07:21,486 --> 02:07:23,779
- No shit, but why?
- Just in case.

1856
02:07:23,947 --> 02:07:26,156
Shit.

1857
02:07:26,491 --> 02:07:27,532
Fucking great.

1858
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:29,576
- You never said anything about a gun.
- Shh.

1859
02:07:29,744 --> 02:07:31,161
Now I'm nervous. Do you have a gun?

1860
02:07:31,329 --> 02:07:33,497
- No, I don't have a gun. He never said...
- Shh. Relax.

1861
02:07:33,665 --> 02:07:37,918
- Let's just get in and out, all right? In, out.
- Not too fast. It makes it look suspicious.

1862
02:07:39,337 --> 02:07:40,921
Goddamn it.

1863
02:07:41,089 --> 02:07:43,006
You all right?

1864
02:07:43,174 --> 02:07:46,385
- Just let me do all the talking, all right?
- Just be cool.

1865
02:07:57,146 --> 02:07:59,898
How you doing? Come on in.

1866
02:08:03,278 --> 02:08:05,237
Whoa.

1867
02:08:07,323 --> 02:08:09,533
- Hey, man.
- Hello, come on in.

1868
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:11,868
Hey.

1869
02:08:23,047 --> 02:08:25,215
Hey, Rahad.

1870
02:08:25,383 --> 02:08:26,591
Hello, friends.

1871
02:08:27,218 --> 02:08:28,719
- Hey.
- Which one is Todd?

1872
02:08:28,886 --> 02:08:32,723
Yeah, that's me. Ha, ha.
We met before, down at Party Boys.

1873
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:35,392
Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on in. Come on in.

1874
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:37,561
Uh, these are my friends here.
Dirk and Reed.

1875
02:08:37,729 --> 02:08:40,397
Good to see you.
Take a seat. You want something to drink?

1876
02:08:41,774 --> 02:08:43,442
- Want a pill? Coke? Little dope?
- No.

1877
02:08:43,609 --> 02:08:46,528
- Uh, you sure you don't want something?
- No, thank you. No.

1878
02:08:47,113 --> 02:08:49,906
So got something? Huh?

1879
02:08:50,074 --> 02:08:51,616
We got something here?

1880
02:08:52,243 --> 02:08:54,453
Here it is.
That's about half a key right there.

1881
02:08:55,913 --> 02:08:57,956
- All right.
- That is some quality shit.

1882
02:08:59,334 --> 02:09:01,460
- If you wanna test that out...
- Don't worry about him.

1883
02:09:01,627 --> 02:09:03,920
- ...I mean, go ahead. If you want.
- No, no, no. Wait.

1884
02:09:05,548 --> 02:09:07,299
Here's that build-up. I love this part.

1885
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:18,602
Fucking love that song.

1886
02:09:20,271 --> 02:09:22,272
So anyway, uh, what's the price?

1887
02:09:27,445 --> 02:09:37,037
Well, ha-ha-ha, we, ha-ha-ha...

1888
02:09:37,205 --> 02:09:40,999
Maybe, I don't know, 5 grand.

1889
02:09:43,211 --> 02:09:45,754
- Five grand.
- Yeah.

1890
02:09:48,132 --> 02:09:50,384
All right. No problem. That's cool.

1891
02:09:55,723 --> 02:09:57,182
Five grand?

1892
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:59,184
Five grand.

1893
02:10:03,272 --> 02:10:04,940
Okay.

1894
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:20,956
You guys wanna play baseball?

1895
02:10:21,541 --> 02:10:23,583
- No, thank you.
- No.

1896
02:10:25,336 --> 02:10:28,964
The black guy has a gun in his jacket.
Todd?

1897
02:10:37,682 --> 02:10:39,766
Let's get up and get the fuck out of here.

1898
02:10:39,934 --> 02:10:41,685
Todd, count the fucking money in the car.

1899
02:10:58,161 --> 02:11:02,247
Hey, you wanna see something
really fascinating?

1900
02:11:06,461 --> 02:11:08,879
- Check it out.
- Oh, wow. That's sweet.

1901
02:11:11,382 --> 02:11:13,258
- That thing's not loaded, is it?
- Not yet.

1902
02:11:13,426 --> 02:11:15,927
- Is that silver?
- Look... See, we...

1903
02:11:16,095 --> 02:11:18,388
- Let's see what happens now, huh?
- Don't point...

1904
02:11:18,556 --> 02:11:21,850
- Could you not point the gun, please, sir?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1905
02:11:22,018 --> 02:11:23,059
- Todd.
- You wanna watch.

1906
02:11:24,562 --> 02:11:26,855
- Why? You think I can't do it?
- No, wait, wait.

1907
02:11:27,023 --> 02:11:29,566
- Huh? Ha-ha-ha. You think I can't do it?
- Sir?

1908
02:11:29,734 --> 02:11:32,569
- You wanna see me do it? You dare me?
- No, we don't dare you.

1909
02:11:33,905 --> 02:11:35,071
Fucking dare me.

1910
02:11:41,078 --> 02:11:43,246
Thank you, thank you.

1911
02:11:45,249 --> 02:11:47,459
Your fucking faces, man.

1912
02:11:50,963 --> 02:11:52,797
What the fuck?

1913
02:11:54,091 --> 02:11:57,469
Hey, I love this thing. I make these
little mix tapes together, you know?

1914
02:11:57,637 --> 02:12:01,890
I put all my favorite songs together. Which
one is this? Number, uh, 11. I love it.

1915
02:12:02,058 --> 02:12:05,101
You know, when you buy a tape
or something or an album...

1916
02:12:05,269 --> 02:12:08,772
...you put it on, and the songs,
the bands put them in some fucking order...

1917
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:12,817
...like they want you to listen to it in
that order. I hate that. Fucking hate that.

1918
02:12:12,985 --> 02:12:16,613
I don't like to be told what to listen to,
when to listen to it, or anything.

1919
02:12:25,122 --> 02:12:26,248
Fuck.

1920
02:12:28,167 --> 02:12:31,294
It's Cosmo. He's Chinese.

1921
02:12:32,046 --> 02:12:34,965
That's why he likes
lighting off firecrackers. Huh?

1922
02:13:09,834 --> 02:13:12,168
Ricky Springfield. He's a buddy of mine.

1923
02:13:29,353 --> 02:13:32,647
Todd, we're leaving, man. Todd.

1924
02:13:32,815 --> 02:13:35,191
Let's go. All right?

1925
02:14:15,983 --> 02:14:17,233
We're leaving.

1926
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:20,320
Sir. We gotta split, man. We gotta go.

1927
02:14:20,488 --> 02:14:23,239
Aw, come on. You just got here.
Let's hang out, let's party.

1928
02:14:23,407 --> 02:14:27,285
We got somewhere else to go.
We scheduled dinner with friends.

1929
02:14:27,453 --> 02:14:29,412
We're not leaving yet.

1930
02:14:32,083 --> 02:14:35,669
We're here now,
and we want something else from you.

1931
02:14:36,629 --> 02:14:38,380
Hey.

1932
02:14:38,547 --> 02:14:39,964
Hey, hey, hey.

1933
02:14:42,051 --> 02:14:44,386
We want something else from you.

1934
02:14:45,221 --> 02:14:46,262
What?

1935
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:49,015
Todd, what the hell are you doing, man?
Let's just go.

1936
02:14:50,267 --> 02:14:52,435
In the master bedroom...

1937
02:14:53,437 --> 02:14:57,232
...under the bed in a floor safe.

1938
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:58,817
Understand?

1939
02:14:59,443 --> 02:15:01,861
- What is the matter with you? Let's go.
- Todd.

1940
02:15:02,029 --> 02:15:03,446
- Come on, man.
- Shut up, Dirk.

1941
02:15:03,614 --> 02:15:05,949
I told you I got a plan.
I got a very good plan.

1942
02:15:06,909 --> 02:15:08,618
Are you kidding me, kitty?

1943
02:15:08,786 --> 02:15:10,412
No, I'm not, see?

1944
02:15:10,579 --> 02:15:13,540
I'm not kidding.
I want what's in the safe.

1945
02:15:13,708 --> 02:15:16,918
We want what is in the goddamn safe,
in the goddamn master bedroom...

1946
02:15:17,086 --> 02:15:20,463
...in the fucking floor, in a goddamn
fucking floor safe, that's all.

1947
02:15:20,631 --> 02:15:22,090
Todd, don't be crazy, okay?

1948
02:15:22,258 --> 02:15:25,677
Sir, we don't know anything about this.
This is not at all what we wanted.

1949
02:15:25,845 --> 02:15:29,055
Shut the fuck up, Dirk.
Do not reach for your gun, man.

1950
02:15:29,223 --> 02:15:30,974
Don't reach for your gun.

1951
02:15:45,322 --> 02:15:46,364
He went in the bedroom.

1952
02:15:46,991 --> 02:15:48,742
Todd, what the fuck are you doing?

1953
02:15:49,201 --> 02:15:52,328
- He went in the bedroom.
- Todd, when the fuck did you go crazy?

1954
02:15:52,496 --> 02:15:55,665
He's got coke, and he's got cash
in that safe in that bedroom...

1955
02:15:55,833 --> 02:15:58,668
...and if we leave here without it,
we're fucking idiots, man.

1956
02:15:58,836 --> 02:16:00,837
We came here
to motherfucking do something.

1957
02:16:01,005 --> 02:16:03,256
And we can fucking do it, all right?
You with me?

1958
02:16:03,424 --> 02:16:07,844
Todd, listen to me. Let's just split, man.
Let's just split now. This is not the thing.

1959
02:16:08,012 --> 02:16:09,846
This is not supposed to be the thing.

1960
02:16:10,014 --> 02:16:13,266
That's what I goddamn came here
to motherfucking do.

1961
02:16:13,434 --> 02:16:16,144
And that's what I'm gonna fucking do
right the fuck now.

1962
02:16:16,312 --> 02:16:18,605
Fuck no! Todd, don't!

1963
02:16:18,773 --> 02:16:20,690
- Don't be fucking stupid!
- Todd! Todd!

1964
02:16:24,028 --> 02:16:25,945
- Come on!
- Fuck! Go, man!

1965
02:16:26,113 --> 02:16:27,530
Come on, you puppies.

1966
02:16:32,036 --> 02:16:33,787
It's coming down for puppies!

1967
02:16:41,337 --> 02:16:44,923
Come on, come on, come on. Puppies!

1968
02:16:45,633 --> 02:16:47,592
No!

1969
02:16:49,011 --> 02:16:50,678
Oh, shit.

1970
02:16:51,388 --> 02:16:53,014
Come on!

1971
02:16:57,311 --> 02:16:58,394
Shit.

1972
02:17:13,869 --> 02:17:17,080
Fucking son of a bitch. Oh, God.

1973
02:17:17,248 --> 02:17:20,500
Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1974
02:17:20,668 --> 02:17:24,838
Fuck. Fucking stupid motherfucker.

1975
02:17:25,005 --> 02:17:27,131
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1976
02:17:31,554 --> 02:17:33,263
Oh, fuck.

1977
02:17:34,098 --> 02:17:37,642
Oh, fuck. Son of a bitch.

1978
02:18:24,106 --> 02:18:25,815
Jack?

1979
02:18:32,781 --> 02:18:35,909
Jack, could you please help me?

1980
02:18:46,128 --> 02:18:47,629
I'm...

1981
02:18:52,927 --> 02:18:54,469
Uh...

1982
02:18:59,308 --> 02:19:02,393
I just... l wanted to come
and say sorry, you know.

1983
02:19:02,561 --> 02:19:04,187
And, um...

1984
02:19:06,857 --> 02:19:10,026
Well, I just wanna know
if you can help me, Jack.

1985
02:19:10,694 --> 02:19:13,237
I, um... l need help.

1986
02:19:15,866 --> 02:19:17,450
And, um...

1987
02:19:18,202 --> 02:19:20,203
...I'm sorry, you know?

1988
02:19:23,999 --> 02:19:26,042
I need help, Jack.

1989
02:19:38,097 --> 02:19:40,223
I'm so fucking sorry, Jack.

1990
02:19:44,144 --> 02:19:46,396
I'm sorry too, kid.

1991
02:19:48,899 --> 02:19:51,275
It's okay, baby.

1992
02:19:51,443 --> 02:19:54,320
- We all need to start again.
- Yeah.

1993
02:19:54,488 --> 02:19:56,406
Okay.

1994
02:19:56,573 --> 02:19:58,449
Shh.

1995
02:19:58,617 --> 02:20:00,284
It's okay.

1996
02:20:04,081 --> 02:20:06,207
It's okay, baby.

1997
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:08,292
Shh.

1998
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:12,171
Yeah. You're all right, baby.

1999
02:20:12,339 --> 02:20:14,966
- One more. Let's go. Please. Eleven.
- Eleven.

2000
02:20:15,134 --> 02:20:16,634
Yeah.

2001
02:20:20,597 --> 02:20:22,765
Did I hear someone say deal?

2002
02:20:22,933 --> 02:20:25,101
This weekend and this weekend only...

2003
02:20:25,269 --> 02:20:29,605
...Buck's Super Cool Stereo Store is making
super-cool deals on all name brands.

2004
02:20:29,773 --> 02:20:31,190
We're open. We're ready.

2005
02:20:31,358 --> 02:20:35,111
All you need to do is walk over,
get down, and come inside us.

2006
02:20:37,448 --> 02:20:39,032
Word.

2007
02:20:39,450 --> 02:20:42,201
Cut. Excellent.

2008
02:20:42,369 --> 02:20:44,829
Buck, honey, that was great.

2009
02:21:00,721 --> 02:21:02,263
I said, shut up, Colonel.

2010
02:21:04,433 --> 02:21:06,517
Shut up, Colonel.

2011
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:12,315
I said, shut up.

2012
02:21:15,069 --> 02:21:21,657
Cinco, cuatro, tres, dos, uno.

2013
02:21:34,004 --> 02:21:37,256
Wait, wait, wait. What happened there?

2014
02:21:37,424 --> 02:21:44,180
That's a Q. That's supposed to be a G.
Oh, man. No, no.

2015
02:22:04,785 --> 02:22:06,369
Go.

2016
02:22:11,542 --> 02:22:13,251
What the heck?

2017
02:22:14,294 --> 02:22:16,879
Naughty, naughty, Candy.

2018
02:22:18,799 --> 02:22:20,258
- Push.
- Okay, ready to push?

2019
02:22:20,425 --> 02:22:22,051
Okay, let's push. Let's push. Let's push.

2020
02:22:23,428 --> 02:22:26,931
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Go, go, go. Push, push, push.

2021
02:22:27,099 --> 02:22:28,724
Yes. Yes.

2022
02:22:28,892 --> 02:22:31,310
- God almighty, fucking Christ.
- We're almost there.

2023
02:22:31,478 --> 02:22:34,230
- No, don't cuss, sweetie.
- One big push for me, all right?

2024
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:37,817
Big push for the doctor. Big push.
This is it. Big push. Push, push, push.

2025
02:22:40,612 --> 02:22:42,738
- I got it, I got it, yeah.
- He got it.

2026
02:22:42,906 --> 02:22:44,365
It's a boy. It's a boy.

2027
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:54,500
No hurry, guys.
Just sometime this year, huh?

2028
02:22:54,668 --> 02:22:59,172
- Jack, should we put it in the garage?
- Put it where I told you to put it.

2029
02:23:00,299 --> 02:23:01,549
Oh.

2030
02:23:01,717 --> 02:23:03,509
Maurice.

2031
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:07,638
- You've got to turn a fan on.
- It smells good, doesn't it?

2032
02:23:07,806 --> 02:23:09,265
No. It smells like shit.

2033
02:23:09,433 --> 02:23:11,601
Oh, come on. This is Puerto Rican cooking.

2034
02:23:11,768 --> 02:23:14,103
Everybody's complaining
in the whole neighborhood.

2035
02:23:14,271 --> 02:23:16,272
This is what they're complaining about.
Taste this.

2036
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:19,150
No, I can't taste it, not now.
I'll taste it later.

2037
02:23:21,695 --> 02:23:23,738
Rollergirl, yoo-hoo.

2038
02:23:23,906 --> 02:23:25,364
Honey, honey. Listen to me.

2039
02:23:25,532 --> 02:23:28,743
Take the dirt on one side of your room
and move it to the other side.

2040
02:23:28,911 --> 02:23:31,287
- Okay.
- Then one side of the room will look clean...

2041
02:23:31,455 --> 02:23:33,789
...that used to look dirty.
That'll be good, huh?

2042
02:23:35,292 --> 02:23:39,045
Oh! Johnny Weissmuller.
That's my swimmer.

2043
02:23:39,213 --> 02:23:42,215
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Five gold medals, look at that.

2044
02:23:42,382 --> 02:23:45,384
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Oh, look at him.

2045
02:23:45,552 --> 02:23:49,222
- You like Uncle Jack's pool?
- Who is the Olympic-fever baby?

2046
02:23:49,598 --> 02:23:51,849
- Who's the Olympic-fever baby?
- Say, "Hi, Jack."

2047
02:23:52,017 --> 02:23:53,392
- Say, "Hi. Hi."
- "Hi, Jack."

2048
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:56,229
- "Watch me kick."
- He's not gonna piss in the pool, is he?

2049
02:23:56,396 --> 02:24:00,274
- I don't think so.
- Do you like Uncle Reed? Yes, you do.

2050
02:24:00,442 --> 02:24:02,109
- He is a good boy.
- Yo, Buck.

2051
02:24:02,277 --> 02:24:05,321
I gotta talk to you about
the stereo modification for this system.

2052
02:24:05,489 --> 02:24:06,989
- No technical shit.
- No, no, no.

2053
02:24:07,157 --> 02:24:10,034
If you don't get the right modification
it's not gonna be loud.

2054
02:24:10,202 --> 02:24:12,161
Loud isn't what I want.
I don't want loud.

2055
02:24:12,329 --> 02:24:13,663
- I want...
- Mellow.

2056
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:16,123
Mellow. That's what I want.

2057
02:24:16,291 --> 02:24:18,334
- Okay.
- Buck, I want mellow.

2058
02:24:18,502 --> 02:24:21,170
Mellow. Mellow.

2059
02:24:21,338 --> 02:24:22,838
Yeah.

2060
02:24:23,006 --> 02:24:26,092
Oh, great, honey. Great.

2061
02:24:35,686 --> 02:24:37,687
Are we ready?

2062
02:24:37,854 --> 02:24:41,649
We have got all the time we want.

2063
02:24:42,401 --> 02:24:44,318
What are you looking at?

2064
02:24:44,903 --> 02:24:47,989
- I'm looking at you.
- You're staring.

2065
02:24:48,156 --> 02:24:50,199
You know what I'm staring at?

2066
02:24:51,201 --> 02:24:56,956
I'm staring at the foxiest bitch
in the whole world.

2067
02:25:25,694 --> 02:25:28,154
I've been around this block twice now.

2068
02:25:28,322 --> 02:25:30,239
I'm looking for something.

2069
02:25:30,407 --> 02:25:31,991
A clue.

2070
02:25:32,534 --> 02:25:35,661
I've been looking for clues,
and something led me back here.

2071
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:38,956
Yep. So here I am.

2072
02:25:39,291 --> 02:25:42,918
Could have been me, the one that was
at Ringo's place when the shit went down.

2073
02:25:43,086 --> 02:25:47,006
Hey, I know how it is. I've been there.

2074
02:25:47,257 --> 02:25:49,592
We've all done bad things.

2075
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:52,887
We've all had those guilty feelings
in our heart.

2076
02:25:53,263 --> 02:25:57,600
You wanna take your brain out of your head
and wash it and scrub it and make it clean.

2077
02:25:57,768 --> 02:25:59,560
Well, no.

2078
02:26:01,605 --> 02:26:03,939
But I'm gonna help you settle this.

2079
02:26:04,107 --> 02:26:07,151
First we're gonna check for holes,
see what we can find.

2080
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:11,655
Then we're gonna get nice and wet
and you're gonna spread your legs.

2081
02:26:12,074 --> 02:26:15,701
Oh, that's good. So you know me.

2082
02:26:15,869 --> 02:26:18,037
You know my reputation.

2083
02:26:18,205 --> 02:26:21,791
Thirteen inches is a tough load.
I don't treat you gently.

2084
02:26:21,958 --> 02:26:26,128
That's right. I'm Brock Landers.

2085
02:26:26,755 --> 02:26:36,389
So I'm gonna be nice.

2086
02:26:36,556 --> 02:26:38,724
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

2087
02:26:38,892 --> 02:26:41,936
Where the fuck is Ringo?

2088
02:27:06,711 --> 02:27:08,796
I am a star.

2089
02:27:09,005 --> 02:27:11,841
I'm a star. I'm a star. I'm a star.

2090
02:27:12,008 --> 02:27:15,219
I am a big, bright, shining star.

2091
02:27:31,319 --> 02:27:33,028
That's right.

2092
02:34:26,234 --> 02:34:27,985
I just...

2093
02:34:35,076 --> 02:34:37,119
I just wanna talk to you.

2094
02:34:42,250 --> 02:34:44,126
I just want...

2095
02:34:45,628 --> 02:34:47,379
Raphael.

2096
02:34:59,267 --> 02:35:01,268
Oh, shit.

2097
02:35:09,068 --> 02:35:12,571
Shit. Raphael.

2098
02:35:13,156 --> 02:35:14,823
Where is he?

2099
02:35:15,325 --> 02:35:16,992
Where's Ringo?

2100
02:35:19,162 --> 02:35:20,621
I know where it goes.
