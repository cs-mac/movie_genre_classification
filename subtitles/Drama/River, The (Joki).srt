00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,506
--<i>before the end</i>
<i>of the season last year...</i>

2
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,468
<i>...and then re-injured it</i>
<i>in spring training...</i>

3
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,137
<i>...on a terrific game-saving play.</i>

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
<i>You know, l was talking with....</i>

5
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:00,394
-What time is this going on?
-7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,605
-Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
-Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,818
-Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
-l'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,988
-Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
-Yankees.

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,367
lmagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

10
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,328
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,664
He's been hot lately.

12
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:26,086
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, l'll paint your porch.

13
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,185
Save.

14
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,603
The sewer.

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,112
Hold on, l'll get it.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,867
Sorry, guys, l guess l don't
know my own strength.

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,746
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

18
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,170
Hey...

19
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,590
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

20
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,384
-What?
-Driving a car.

21
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,637
You know, just around the block.

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,597
Yeah?

23
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,226
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,188
l steal a car, my dad will kill me.

25
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,233
Just around the block. Who said steal?

26
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,623
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,353
See, now it'll be there forever.

28
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,982
Me too.

29
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,194
Forever.

30
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,783
Let me ask you something.

31
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,457
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

32
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,585
Huh?

33
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,046
Come here.

34
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,842
Get over here.

35
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,356
Well, do you?

36
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,693
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

37
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,321
-No.
-No, what?

38
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
Sir.

39
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,369
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,249
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,546
You live around here?

42
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,840
Right there.

43
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,763
You?

44
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,932
Right over there.

45
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,019
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,441
-Rester Street.
-ls your mother home?

47
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,203
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,921
Get in.

49
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,425
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,151
ln.

51
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,909
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,460
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,158
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,285
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,455
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,999
-No, no writing.
-He had a uniform on?

57
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,834
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,170
-He was a cop.
-He took Davey.

59
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:22,341
-So, what were you guys doing?
-We wrote our names in the cement, but--

60
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,053
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,806
-That doesn't make sense. Come on.
-ls there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,994
Please.

63
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,121
No more.

64
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,999
Please.

65
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,545
No more, please.

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,201
-Have you seen him?
-Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,328
Jesus.

68
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,949
You took some good swings today.

69
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,535
Dad, l struck out.

70
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,331
Good swings, though. That's what counts.

71
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,001
l'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,756
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,594
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1 978 to '82.

74
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,430
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,646
-Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
-Yeah.

76
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,942
l used to play on this street
when l was a kid.

77
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,445
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

78
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,074
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

79
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,202
lf we could get that manhole cover up...

80
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,329
...could be 1 000 balls down there.

81
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,666
Really? Let's try.

82
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,113
Get in.

83
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,116
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

84
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:39,329
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

85
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,928
Jimmy. Jimmy.

86
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,431
Earth to Mr. Markum.

87
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,185
-What do you want now, Pete?
-Like l'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

88
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,229
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

89
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,273
-So?
-So that means less profit...

90
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,526
...and more profit means l get a raise.

91
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,278
So why don't you order more.

92
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,740
All right, but if the
surgeon general calls, you're my alibi.

93
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,673
-Hey, you.
-Hey, there.

94
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,885
l'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

95
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:39,056
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

96
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,601
-Christ, l sound like....
-Someone's father?

97
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,103
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

98
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,567
-Later, Daddy.
-Later.

99
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,486
Have fun.

100
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,452
-Later.
-Later.

101
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,605
Brendan.

102
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,777
-You scared the shit out of me.
-l'm sorry, l didn't want your dad to see me.

103
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,657
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

104
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,995
What will he do if he sees this?

105
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,707
Shoot you and then kill you.

106
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,547
lt's been six hours.

107
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,175
l had to see you.

108
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,971
l'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

109
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,058
Tomorrow?

110
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,352
Like we planned?

111
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,980
Tomorrow.

112
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,236
Drop me around the corner.

113
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,562
-Take it easy.
-He kept cutting me off!

114
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,983
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

115
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,238
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

116
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,365
That son of a bitch!

117
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,243
Can you believe this guy keeps confessing?

118
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,580
l don't know. Maybe we ought to grab
a lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

119
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,417
Hey, Devine?

120
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:20,217
-What you looking at?
-The old neighborhood.

121
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:28,934
-We're done, Sean, but l can stick around.
-No, l think we're good, thanks.

122
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,229
A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

123
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,359
No, l don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

124
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,736
Yeah.

125
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,616
-So the wife left you six months ago?
-So?

126
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,078
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs....

127
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,206
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

128
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,791
So, what's your point?

129
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,670
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

130
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,339
She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

131
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,634
-l'm married, Whitey.
-So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

132
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,014
-You haven't talked to Lauren in six months.
-She calls all the time.

133
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,309
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing l ever heard of.

134
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,354
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

135
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,816
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

136
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,880
Come on, come on, come on.

137
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,510
<i>The pitch. A swing and a line drive</i>
<i>into right field. A base hit.</i>

138
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,846
l just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

139
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,774
Could we please have three beers?

140
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,658
Yeah, come on.

141
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,632
You believe those chicks?

142
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,137
-Come on.
-Oh, yeah, baby.

143
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,935
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

144
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,647
-We've got you right over here, boys.
-Yeah.

145
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,607
Yeah.

146
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,528
l've known her since she was a kid.

147
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,915
<i>A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.</i>

148
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,467
Dave.

149
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,554
lt's 3 in the morning.

150
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,972
Where have you been?

151
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,727
Oh, my God.

152
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,479
l fucked up.

153
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,607
What happened?

154
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:26,612
This guy tried to mug me,
and l swung on him and he sliced me.

155
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,574
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

156
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,077
No, no, it's not that bad.
lt's not that deep.

157
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:38,123
-lt bled like hell. l can't go to the hospital.
-Oh, my God, Dave.

158
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,585
Come on. Come here.

159
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:47,883
So l'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

160
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,261
l say l don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

161
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,015
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

162
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,643
-Oh, God.
-That's when l see the knife.

163
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,938
Says, ''Your wallet or your life.
l'm leaving with one of them.''

164
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,606
-That's what he said?
-Yeah.

165
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,151
So l try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

166
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,114
-You said you swung on him first.
-Jesus, Celeste, can l tell the fucking story?

167
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,034
l'm sorry, babe.

168
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,415
l went fucking nuts on him, baby. l....

169
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,503
l went off.

170
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,173
l bashed his head on the parking lot.

171
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,802
There was blood everywhere.

172
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,306
l might have killed him.

173
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,185
Killed him?

174
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,529
lt makes you feel...

175
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,073
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

176
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,995
Yeah, but you had to, right?

177
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,039
lt makes you feel...

178
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,709
...alien.

179
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,177
Okay.

180
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,180
Babe, you hop in the shower.

181
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,933
And l'll take care of your clothes.

182
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,271
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

183
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,273
Here.

184
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,580
<i>91 1, police services.</i>
<i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

185
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,209
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,</i>
<i>and the door's open.</i>

186
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,170
-<i>What's the location of the car?</i>
-<i>Sydney Street.</i>

187
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:52,257
<i>lt's in the Flats by Pen Park.</i>
<i>Me and my friend just found it.</i>

188
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,052
-<i>Son, what's your name?</i>
-<i>He wants to know her name.</i>

189
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,803
<i>Your name, what's your name?</i>

190
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,556
<i>We're so fucking out of here.</i>
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

191
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,029
<i>Dispatch, this is Unit 33.</i>

192
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:19,243
<i>We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,</i>
<i>and you might want to notify Homicide.</i>

193
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,330
<i>Thirty-three, have you</i>
<i>found a body yet? 0ver.</i>

194
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,459
<i>No, but by the looks of this car,</i>
<i>we'll find one sooner or later.</i>

195
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,058
-Yeah?
-l'm in the weeds here at the store...

196
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,601
...and l need some help.

197
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,522
You and Katie can't handle <i>6</i>,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

198
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,359
-That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
-Hold on.

199
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,412
l'll be there in 1 0 minutes.

200
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,332
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 1 0.

201
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,127
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

202
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,712
She'll be there.

203
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,506
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

204
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,885
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

205
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,220
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

206
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,308
l'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

207
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,518
What the fuck's going on here?

208
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,031
-Pete, anybody show?
-No.

209
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,200
Katie didn't call?

210
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,118
No.

211
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,756
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Drew, Jimmy.

212
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,050
Sorry to wake you.
l'm looking for Katie.

213
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,179
Yeah, she's here, l think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

214
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,392
Have a nice day.

215
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,646
<i>No, it was Diane Cestra</i>
<i>who slept over. No Katie.</i>

216
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,858
<i>Eve said she dropped her off at around</i>
<i>1:00. Didn't say where she was going.</i>

217
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,735
Don't worry, l'll track her down.

218
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:20,739
-<i>She seeing anybody maybe?</i>
-1 9-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

219
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:24,117
-<i>That's the cold truth, bud.</i>
-l'll talk to you later.

220
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,253
l'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

221
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,257
-Mind if l go grab a smoke?
-You can smoke the whole pack.

222
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,938
Can l help you, Brendan?

223
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,359
No, Mr. Markum, l'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

224
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,821
-That's Barry's. Next aisle.
-Thanks.

225
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,337
-When's Sal getting here?
-Anytime now.

226
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,465
-That it, Bren?
-A <i>Globe</i>.

227
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,595
l thought Katie worked on Sundays.

228
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,806
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

229
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,893
No, l just see her here sometimes.

230
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,854
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

231
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,774
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

232
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,372
Can l ask you something, Jimmy?

233
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,000
Shoot.

234
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,336
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

235
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:01,798
lt's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

236
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,135
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

237
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:09,431
He's nice. Does sign language with
his brother even though he doesn't have to.

238
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,517
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

239
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,853
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

240
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,689
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

241
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,068
-No. Really?
-Straight up.

242
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,824
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

243
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,550
-Hey, there, bad boy.
-Sarge.

244
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:49,471
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

245
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,015
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

246
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,062
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

247
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,522
Let's go find out.

248
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:03,652
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER on his own,
steak knife sticking out of his collarbone.

249
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:07,072
He asks the nurse,
''Hey, where they keep the Coke machine?''

250
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,617
-Did she tell him?
-Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

251
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:14,454
We found the registration in the glove box.
Owner is Katherine Markum.

252
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,164
-Oh, shit.
-You know her?

253
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,917
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy l know.

254
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,796
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 1 9.

255
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,925
-Oh, fuck, that's her.
-ls it a problem? You close with the guy?

256
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:31,430
When we were kids. Now it's just
a ''hello'' around the neighborhood.

257
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,434
Nineteen.

258
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,394
Fuck, man.

259
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,147
He's in for a world of hurt.

260
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,927
Do not make her laugh.

261
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,062
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

262
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,525
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

263
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,987
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

264
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,198
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

265
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,326
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

266
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:37,496
...hits her in the shoulder, maybe the bicep.

267
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:40,874
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds....

268
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,754
-What do you think?
-Yeah, l dig that.

269
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,966
Body of Christ.

270
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,302
-Body of Christ.
-Amen.

271
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,598
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

272
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,313
Body of Christ.

273
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,483
Body of Christ.

274
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,987
Body of Christ.

275
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,117
So l'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

276
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,743
The killer shows, she bolts.

277
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,497
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

278
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,917
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

279
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,051
Body of Christ.

280
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,472
Body of Christ.

281
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:51,028
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

282
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:55,199
No, l haven't seen him since we were kids.
Once in a while, l run into him.

283
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,035
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

284
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,206
-Daddy, Daddy!
-Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

285
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,874
This dress itches.

286
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,753
Yeah, l'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

287
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,255
We are so proud of you.

288
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,568
Morning, honey.

289
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:35,906
Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. l checked three times.

290
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,284
lt was late, real late.

291
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,664
-Morning, Mikey.
-Morning, Dad.

292
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,460
-You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
-Yeah, come on, let's go.

293
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,797
Come on.

294
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,802
Put your coat on, Mike.

295
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,096
Thanks, Mom.

296
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,776
-Hey, Jimmy.
-What's up, Ed?

297
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,612
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

298
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:20,033
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

299
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,995
-Nadine's First Communion.
-What are you doing here?

300
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,706
Just curious, l guess.

301
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,136
That's my daughter's car.

302
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,308
That's my daughter's car.

303
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,897
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

304
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,815
-Want to take a walk over?
-Yeah.

305
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,151
-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, go ahead.

306
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,653
<i>We got a guy on Sydney</i>
<i>says he's the father.</i>

307
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,280
Oh, shit.

308
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,991
-Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
-<i>En route.</i>

309
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,036
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

310
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:07,664
<i>Asking for you. Says he knows you.</i>
<i>Not taking no for an answer.</i>

311
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,625
<i>And he's got some guys with him.</i>

312
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,086
-What guys?
-<i>Crazy-looking guys.</i>

313
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:17,758
-The Savage brothers.
-Just a ''hi'' around the neighborhood, huh?

314
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,760
All right, l'm on my way.

315
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,225
-Hey, guys.
-That's our niece in there.

316
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,060
-Let us in.
-We're doing our job.

317
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,520
-Let us in.
-Fuck you!

318
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,355
The doughnut shop's that way!

319
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,358
-Nick, Val, ease up.
-Fucking dickhead.

320
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,527
-Enough.
-Nick.

321
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,906
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

322
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,659
-Kevin, let's go.
-And, guys?

323
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,454
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

324
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,748
-But get answers.
-You got it.

325
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,130
Yeah, that's what l believe. Yeah.

326
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,301
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

327
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,054
-ls she in there?
-All we're doing is looking.

328
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,891
-Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
-That's my daughter's car.

329
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,144
-l understand.
-And it's got blood in it.

330
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:15,607
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

331
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:20,445
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

332
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,865
-<i>Trooper Devine?</i>
-Yeah, say again.

333
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,993
<i>Sergeant Powers says you need</i>
<i>to get in here ASAP.</i>

334
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,955
-Your location?
-<i>The old bear cage. lt's a fucking mess.</i>

335
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:31,957
All right.

336
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,084
Make sure he doesn't get through.

337
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,753
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

338
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,883
l'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

339
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,843
Go.

340
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:50,726
<i>There's a massive search underway</i>
<i>for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.</i>

341
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,562
<i>All we know now</i>
<i>is there are signs of foul play...</i>

342
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:56,648
<i>...in a car found abandoned</i>
<i>outside of Pen Park.</i>

343
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:01,111
<i>Now, police officers have moved in quickly</i>
<i>and cordoned off the area...</i>

344
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,656
<i>...but even as we speak,</i>
<i>a crowd of spectators has gathered.</i>

345
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:08,118
<i>We don't know more than that,</i>
<i>but we will stay on the story.</i>

346
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:13,665
<i>Until later, this is Jim Smith</i>
<i>reporting for WB 56, 1 0:00 news.</i>

347
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,543
Ready? Bat back.

348
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,423
All the way back.

349
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,145
l never saw anything like that before.

350
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:37,648
What do we got?

351
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,368
Oh, Christ.

352
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,347
ls that her?

353
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,601
Yeah.

354
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,856
We'll have the father
do a positive lD at the morgue.

355
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,441
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

356
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:24,486
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

357
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:29,074
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a .38.

358
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,744
What the fuck am l gonna tell him?

359
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,955
''Hey, Jimmy...

360
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:39,126
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect.''

361
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,256
-Hey.
-Hold on!

362
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:48,719
-Grab him. Stop that guy.
-Hey, you!

363
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:51,138
-l'm fucking going in there!
-Take it easy!

364
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,640
-Get his arms.
-Hold him. Come on.

365
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,143
-Let me in, you motherfuckers!
-Take it easy.

366
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:01,231
-Let me in!
-ls she in there?!

367
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:06,278
-Sean, is my daughter in there?!
-Let me in! You motherfuckers!

368
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,907
ls my daughter in there?! ls she in there?!
ls she in there?!

369
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,326
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

370
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,954
ls my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

371
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,082
ls that my daughter in there?!

372
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,419
Look into my eyes! ls she in there?!

373
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:27,174
-Get off me!
-Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

374
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,093
ls that my daughter in there?

375
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,680
No! No!

376
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,936
Oh, no!

377
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,647
No, God!

378
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:45,234
Oh, God, no!

379
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,697
No one's said anything, right?

380
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,532
What do you mean?

381
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:38,245
You haven't seen her yet, right?
lt might not be her, right?

382
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,372
Jimmy?

383
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,165
-Jimmy, please....
-Please what?

384
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:46,044
-Please--
-Please what, baby? Please what?

385
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,670
That's her.

386
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,216
That's Katie.

387
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,802
That's my daughter.

388
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,908
Fresh-brewed.

389
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,536
So we need to work a time line.

390
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:03,038
lt's details, little things
that make a case.

391
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,917
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

392
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,881
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

393
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:15,968
l heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

394
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,221
At the last minute, she changed her mind.

395
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,599
See what l mean?

396
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,269
What do you mean, Jimmy?

397
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,941
What if you or l had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

398
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,026
-What car?
-You're losing me here.

399
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:38,490
lf l'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

400
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:42,452
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

401
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,622
...she was a beautiful woman.

402
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,041
Regal.

403
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,461
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

404
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,131
You had to have balls
to go near her, and l did.

405
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:58,468
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

406
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:01,388
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

407
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:04,349
lf l'd gotten into that car,
l'd be a basket case.

408
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,561
l never would have had the juice
to go near her.

409
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:10,898
And Katie never would have been born.

410
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:14,151
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

411
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:24,494
-You ever see Dave around?
-He married my cousin Celeste.

412
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:31,460
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

413
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,128
Around 7:30.

414
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:36,256
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

415
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:43,013
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

416
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,266
She was having dinner with her friends.

417
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,731
-Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
-Yeah.

418
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:56,735
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

419
00:37:56,902 --> 00:38:00,364
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

420
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,950
And then around 8, she left.

421
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:06,245
-Do you know who she talked to?
-No.

422
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:10,165
Do you mind if we have the phone company
subpoenaed for records?

423
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,543
-No, go ahead.
-Good.

424
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:17,130
You say you spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

425
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,384
Yes and no. l was mostly in back.

426
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:23,595
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

427
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:27,015
No, she was herself, she was happy. She--

428
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,976
She what?

429
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,229
lt's nothing.

430
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,607
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

431
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,862
lt's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

432
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:43,699
...l had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

433
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:47,119
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

434
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:51,498
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

435
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:55,627
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

436
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,463
-Okay.
-lt was just a look.

437
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:03,844
lt's information. We collect it,
put it together, see what fits. Little things.

438
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:05,262
You were in prison?

439
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,763
-Oh, Jesus.
-Here we go.

440
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,266
-Whitey.
-l'm just asking.

441
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:13,645
Sixteen years ago, l did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer lsland.

442
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,648
ls that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

443
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,652
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

444
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,114
-Sorry.
-lt's all right. lt's all right.

445
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,575
Okay, Mr. Markum.

446
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:30,245
-Okay.
-Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

447
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,875
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

448
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,259
There was this kid.

449
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,887
What am l talking about?
That was this morning.

450
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,139
What? Remember, it's the little things.

451
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:53,769
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

452
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,730
-Barely knew each other.
-Could they have been dating?

453
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,690
-No.
-What makes you so sure?

454
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:01,401
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

455
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,363
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

456
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,824
No one right now, as far as we know.

457
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,078
-l mean, knew.
-l'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

458
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,540
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

459
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:19,336
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

460
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,841
And if you think of anything...

461
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,678
...anything at all, give us a call.

462
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,978
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

463
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:40,065
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

464
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,109
This car came up and took Dave away.

465
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:45,112
-Abduction?
-Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

466
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,533
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

467
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,535
-They catch these guys?
-One died.

468
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:54,580
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

469
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:58,750
Your pal Markum, the moment l laid
eyes on him, l could tell he'd done time.

470
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,045
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

471
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,007
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

472
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:09,553
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

473
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:19,605
Cause of death: the gunshot wound to
the head, not the trauma from the beating.

474
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,901
-What else?
-Her and her friends were barhopping.

475
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:27,154
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

476
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,948
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

477
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:33,118
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

478
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,579
lt doesn't sound like much.

479
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,956
What do you say, Devine?

480
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,376
We'll get the guy, sir.

481
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:45,672
That's right. All right, let's do it.

482
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:54,473
-That's the best you can come up with?
-lt made him happy, didn't it?

483
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,602
This is Sean.

484
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:02,773
-Hello?
-ls it Lauren?

485
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,362
You're in Manhattan.
l can tell by the traffic sounds.

486
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,533
ls he with you?

487
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:21,250
ls that the baby?

488
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,795
Lauren, at least tell me her name.

489
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,307
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

490
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,865
Hey.

491
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,662
Would it surprise you?

492
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,747
Wouldn't be the first time.

493
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,879
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that--?

494
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,006
Did you see her?

495
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:12,551
-l heard a car hit something.
-Hit what? Another car?

496
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,596
-Oh, no, not loud like that.
-Like hitting the curb?

497
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,639
Yes, maybe.

498
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,767
Then it stalled, and someone said, ''Hi.''

499
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:23,061
-Someone said, ''Hi''?
-''Hi.''

500
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,690
Then there was a loud crack.

501
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:30,611
-Could it have been a gunshot?
-Yes, maybe.

502
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,156
-Did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior?
-Oh, no.

503
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:37,284
l was in my dressing gown by then.

504
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,913
l don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

505
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,749
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

506
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,376
Female.

507
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:47,920
l think.

508
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,840
-lt sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
-Yeah.

509
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,218
Sorry to trouble you.

510
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,728
-Jimmy.
-Theo.

511
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,231
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

512
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,399
-She's trying.
-Let's get these on ice.

513
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,944
You got a couple of coolers?

514
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:20,118
Right here's fine.

515
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,669
So how are you handling all this so far?

516
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:31,797
-lt hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
-Yeah?

517
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,383
lt's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

518
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,262
When my Janey died,
l was no good for six months...

519
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,266
...but my kids were
all grown up. l had that luxury.

520
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:46,144
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

521
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,148
Domestic responsibilities?

522
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:55,612
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

523
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,782
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

524
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:01,535
lt just needed to be said, that's all.

525
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:05,789
You'll come through
because you're a man.

526
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:08,125
Like l said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

527
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,545
l said, ''You got yourself
a real old-school man there.''

528
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:14,298
-Like they put her in a bag.
-What?

529
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:17,718
That's what Katie looked like
when l saw her in the morgue.

530
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:21,847
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

531
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,684
-Well--
-Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

532
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:28,979
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

533
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:34,067
-You don't need to talk about Janey.
-My daughter was murdered.

534
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,905
They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab...

535
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,866
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

536
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:44,703
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

537
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,751
Good to see you, Theo.

538
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,383
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.

539
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,512
-Who was she dating?
-We already told the Savages.

540
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,431
-The Savage brothers?
-They were here yesterday.

541
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:07,976
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

542
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,437
No one special.

543
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,027
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

544
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,197
-What?
-She was leaving town, wasn't she?

545
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,742
-Going to Las Vegas?
-How do you know?

546
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:28,747
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

547
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:32,918
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

548
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:36,588
Well, a 1 9-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

549
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,633
So who was she going with?

550
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,887
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

551
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,056
Brendan.

552
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,433
Excuse me?

553
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,979
-Brendan.
-Brendan Harris?

554
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,606
Brendan Harris, yeah.

555
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:56,608
You got an address?

556
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,082
Hey, Dave.

557
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,880
Hey, Jimmy.

558
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:21,508
Sorry, l came out for a smoke.

559
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:25,220
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

560
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,812
l haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

561
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:36,648
How you doing?

562
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:38,984
How you doing?

563
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:42,404
What happened to your hand?

564
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,907
This?

565
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:50,162
l was helping a buddy move a couch.
l slammed it in the doorjamb.

566
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,957
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

567
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,003
lt's good to see you.

568
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,130
Yeah?

569
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,305
How are our girls holding up?

570
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,641
They're doing okay, l guess.

571
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,144
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

572
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:29,826
lt's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

573
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,413
Yeah.

574
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:42,381
l couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

575
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:45,509
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

576
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:49,012
-Lot of waste, huh?
-Yeah.

577
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:54,643
l just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

578
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:59,731
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

579
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,408
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

580
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,703
...that girl was neat.

581
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,624
When l got out of the joint...

582
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,920
...you know, after Marita died...

583
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:28,427
...l remember, l was more afraid
of my little daughter...

584
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:32,264
...than l ever was of being in prison.

585
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:42,941
l loved her...

586
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,153
...most...

587
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:52,326
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

588
00:49:55,204 --> 00:50:01,335
...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

589
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,129
Unwanted.

590
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:10,594
And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,
because l can't cry for her.

591
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,848
My own little daughter,
and l can't even cry for her.

592
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,605
Jimmy.

593
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,611
You're crying now.

594
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,950
Yeah, damn.

595
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:40,999
l just want to hug her one more time.

596
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:48,423
She was 1 9 fucking years old.

597
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,683
Do you want me to leave you alone?

598
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:01,228
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

599
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:05,983
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

600
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,669
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

601
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:29,423
-You don't think l'd hurt her do you?
-She isn't hurt. She's dead.

602
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:36,388
-l didn't kill her.
-Again, when's the last time you saw her?

603
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,852
About 8--
Saturday night, about 8:00.

604
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

605
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,690
lt was about 8.

606
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:52,696
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

607
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:56,366
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

608
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,620
l don't know.

609
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:05,209
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

610
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:09,338
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

611
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:13,800
-He's not a thief.
-He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

612
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:18,138
Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.

613
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:23,393
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

614
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:27,564
We were gonna leave Sunday.

615
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,735
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

616
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:36,323
Well, that was the plan, right?

617
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:39,493
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

618
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,746
-Ma, l was gonna tell you.
-Just like your father, huh?

619
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:53,966
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

620
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,510
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

621
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,428
He don't speak.

622
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:02,975
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

623
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:07,271
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

624
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:12,776
So where were you between 1 2:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

625
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,862
l was asleep.

626
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,822
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

627
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,787
l can confirm that he closed his door
at 1 0:00.

628
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,748
He came down for breakfast at 9.

629
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:32,212
l can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

630
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:36,550
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take
a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

631
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:41,763
l loved her so much.

632
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:46,560
l'm never gonna feel that again.

633
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,521
lt doesn't happen twice.

634
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,984
Doesn't happen once most times.

635
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:57,362
Celeste.

636
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:02,534
-Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
-What are you still doing here?

637
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,997
l don't know.

638
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:10,792
l don't know, l just....

639
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,837
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

640
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,715
Yeah, l convinced her to take a pill.

641
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:19,885
-Could l get one of those?
-Yeah.

642
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:27,518
One for the road and then home.

643
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:36,568
Jimmy, l can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

644
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,570
You've done enough.

645
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,077
To you and Dave for being here for this.

646
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:05,597
Okay, Jimmy. l'll be back.

647
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,852
l'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

648
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,687
Good night.

649
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:15,232
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

650
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,378
Hello?

651
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:43,177
Christ. Lauren, say something.

652
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:52,102
''Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?''

653
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:56,607
<i>0h, me? l'm tired of wishing things</i>
<i>made sense.</i>

654
00:55:56,773 --> 00:56:01,945
<i>l'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and</i>
<i>there's just gonna be another one after her.</i>

655
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:07,576
Sending killers to jail is sending them where
they've been heading all their lives.

656
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,786
The dead are still dead.

657
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:14,750
Jesus, l...

658
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,044
...can't do this tonight.

659
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,129
l just....

660
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:21,965
l can't do it.

661
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,134
Bye, baby.

662
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,438
Because...

663
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:41,068
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

664
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:42,986
He was the boy.

665
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,949
The boy who escaped from wolves.

666
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:50,619
An animal of the dusk.

667
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,788
lnvisible.

668
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,082
Silent.

669
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,751
Living in a world...

670
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:00,337
...the others never saw.

671
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,716
World of fireflies.

672
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:10,764
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

673
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:15,894
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

674
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:32,286
l just gotta get my head right.

675
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,458
Catch a nice, long sleep.

676
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,920
And the boy will go back to his forest.

677
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,092
Back to his fireflies.

678
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,101
ls he asleep?

679
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,125
How's Jimmy and everybody?

680
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,920
Okay.

681
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:24,922
lt's weird.

682
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:29,343
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

683
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,970
Dave? Dave.

684
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:37,184
There's still nothing in the paper.

685
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:39,561
About what?

686
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,772
About what?

687
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:48,737
l don't know, honey. Maybe l didn't
hurt him as bad as l thought.

688
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:51,782
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

689
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,453
Yeah.

690
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:58,205
Right.

691
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,126
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

692
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,463
l mean, Katie Markum is dead.

693
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,384
That seems more important right now.

694
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:43,375
l know in my soul l contributed
to your death.

695
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,879
But l don't know how.

696
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,525
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

697
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:11,403
Good. l didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

698
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,863
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

699
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:17,034
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

700
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:19,912
All people who, l'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

701
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,831
Considering the crime, maybe.

702
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,416
Dave Boyle?

703
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:28,045
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

704
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:29,755
Could be.

705
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:33,383
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

706
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,304
-Clam up for no reason, huh?
-We'll see.

707
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:50,192
Hey, Boyle!

708
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:53,320
-What's it been, seven, eight years?
-Yeah.

709
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,988
Yeah. How you doing?

710
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,615
This is my son, Michael.

711
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:59,159
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

712
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,204
l'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.

713
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:06,083
-So you still with the staties?
-Homicide. This is my partner.

714
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:09,002
-Sergeant Powers. How are you?
-So you got a minute?

715
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:13,423
-We'd love to ask some quick questions.
-l was just gonna walk Michael to school.

716
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:17,553
-l can be back in a few minutes.
-Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

717
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,221
Sure.

718
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:22,599
So you look good.

719
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,144
-l hear rents are rising.
-Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

720
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,939
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

721
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:30,899
We walked by there the other day.

722
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,277
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

723
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,904
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

724
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,534
''Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong.''

725
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:45,205
Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

726
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,875
Dave. Call me Dave.

727
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,002
You said the F-word, Dad.

728
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,172
Yeah, l know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

729
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:56,466
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

730
01:01:56,675 --> 01:02:00,637
-So, what's up, Sean?
-Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

731
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:03,765
Yeah, l was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

732
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,059
-Who's Celeste?
-My wife.

733
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,480
-How's Jimmy doing?
-lt's hard to tell. You know him.

734
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:14,026
-Yeah, so the reason we came by--
-Listen, l saw her.

735
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:19,239
Katie. l don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

736
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,408
That's what we wanted to talk about.

737
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:25,537
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

738
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:27,998
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

739
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:31,668
-Pretty drunk, huh?
-But it was harmless.

740
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:34,922
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 1 9.

741
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:36,673
What time did they leave?

742
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,843
l left at 1 . They must've left
1 5 minutes before me.

743
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:43,180
-So we'll say 1 2:45?
-Sounds about right.

744
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,850
You see anything unusual
or anyone--?

745
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,685
Michael.

746
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:50,896
-Like what?
-l don't know.

747
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:52,397
A guy watching the girls?

748
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:55,400
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

749
01:02:56,735 --> 01:03:01,365
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

750
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,868
-See you later, Dad.
-You got your milk money?

751
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,919
Fuck, l hated school.

752
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:15,963
What?

753
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:20,467
Yeah, me too, Sean.

754
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:26,139
Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

755
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,393
-Home.
-Home by 1 :1 5, would you say?

756
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,396
-Roughly. Sure.
-All right.

757
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:37,150
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

758
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:40,737
-Yeah, l'd like that, Sean.
-All right.

759
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,037
What?

760
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:51,790
What happened to him in that car?

761
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:00,924
Can you believe this?

762
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:05,095
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

763
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,142
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

764
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:12,227
...you're not left with a whole lot.

765
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:14,980
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

766
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:19,359
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

767
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:21,486
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

768
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:24,907
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

769
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:29,703
She turns into the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

770
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,749
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

771
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,585
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

772
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:39,379
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

773
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:42,799
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

774
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:47,262
- She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

775
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:50,974
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

776
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,353
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

777
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,231
- We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

778
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:00,234
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

779
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,528
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

780
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:06,365
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

781
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:08,700
Just a little one.

782
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:17,960
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

783
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,295
- Sure.
- Good.

784
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,635
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

785
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:28,303
Good.

786
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:35,602
And the notice?

787
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:37,813
Notice?

788
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:44,069
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

789
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:46,822
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

790
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,699
Where's my daughter?

791
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:53,245
Downstairs, in the basement.

792
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,372
I wanna see her.

793
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,088
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

794
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:49,551
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

795
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:52,596
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

796
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:59,061
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

797
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,483
The notice.

798
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:08,153
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

799
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:13,325
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

800
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:18,330
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

801
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:22,125
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

802
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:06,545
- You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

803
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,798
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

804
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:12,718
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

805
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:15,888
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

806
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:20,684
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm
gonna go get some. See you in a minute.

807
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:24,688
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

808
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:31,153
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck
my hand in, it started again.

809
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,030
- Stupid.
- Painful.

810
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,703
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

811
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:43,832
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

812
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,516
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

813
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:06,230
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

814
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,942
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

815
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:18,283
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

816
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,119
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

817
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:22,454
- Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

818
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:24,081
Yeah.

819
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:27,668
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

820
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,879
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

821
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,548
Look, I gotta go.

822
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:39,137
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

823
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:41,890
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

824
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:44,184
Come on.

825
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:52,734
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

826
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:55,737
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home on Saturday?

827
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,531
- What?
- It's a little thing.

828
01:09:57,698 --> 01:10:01,451
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

829
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:03,662
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

830
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,416
You think Dave killed Katie?

831
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:11,128
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

832
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:16,967
- I don't know.
- No, no. It's just that we could figure out...

833
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:20,721
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

834
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:24,057
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

835
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:27,686
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

836
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:29,646
I was asleep.

837
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:37,529
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

838
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:40,032
Okay. Well, thanks.

839
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:52,503
Bullshit.

840
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:54,171
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

841
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:58,008
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

842
01:10:58,217 --> 01:10:59,885
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

843
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:01,678
Remember what you said?

844
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:06,683
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

845
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:12,147
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

846
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:13,899
You're 100 percent sure?

847
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:18,862
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

848
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:24,785
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

849
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:27,371
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

850
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:31,208
He said Katie told him you'd disowned her
if she ever dated a Harris.

851
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:36,046
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

852
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:37,548
Why is that?

853
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:42,219
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

854
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:46,557
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

855
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:50,727
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

856
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:53,730
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

857
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:59,403
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

858
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,572
I don't know.

859
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,741
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

860
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:10,080
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.

861
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:15,043
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

862
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,754
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

863
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:20,090
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

864
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:24,261
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

865
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,931
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

866
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,393
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

867
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,314
- Some people don't talk to policemen, Sean.
- With all due respect...

868
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,983
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

869
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:41,153
- How long?
- How long what?

870
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:43,947
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

871
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:45,449
You bargaining with us?

872
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:48,577
Bargaining?

873
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:52,122
You giving us a deadline?

874
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:58,962
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

875
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:04,760
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

876
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:12,434
The last thing we need is Markum
and the Savages putting the fear of God...

877
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:15,687
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of them.

878
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:19,441
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran
a loose-cannon factory.

879
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:22,069
Fucking knuckleheads.

880
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,199
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

881
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:30,744
- Yeah, you got a match?
- You're gonna love it.

882
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:35,290
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

883
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:39,753
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

884
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,092
The same gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

885
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:46,593
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

886
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,390
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

887
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,686
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

888
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:59,439
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

889
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,775
Thought you'd like that.

890
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:33,432
It's okay, Ray.

891
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,018
Don't worry about it.

892
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,408
Ma said that?

893
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:55,245
That I'm better off?

894
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:04,046
I loved her! You know what that's like?

895
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:05,756
Huh?

896
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,763
I'm sorry.

897
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,689
No, you're wrong.

898
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:26,109
I won't ever feel that again.

899
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:32,032
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

900
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:36,119
- Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

901
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:38,830
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

902
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:42,876
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

903
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,714
That's the storeroom.

904
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:52,427
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

905
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,972
I always keep that door locked.

906
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:58,642
So they must have had a key.

907
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:02,813
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

908
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:07,234
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

909
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:12,114
The only reason they fired that goddamn
warning shot was they must have known...

910
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,283
...I kept this under the counter.

911
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:18,078
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

912
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:21,540
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

913
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:24,334
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

914
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,546
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

915
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:32,676
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

916
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,303
Oh, yeah?

917
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,222
This guy I fired a couple
of weeks before.

918
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:41,268
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

919
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:45,689
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

920
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,900
And I just knew.

921
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:50,819
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

922
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:53,322
You remember his name?

923
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,283
Do I look senile to you?

924
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:58,952
- No, sir.
- Name...

925
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:01,205
...was Ray Harris.

926
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,583
We used to call him "Just Ray."

927
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:10,422
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

928
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:15,135
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

929
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:28,941
Where you been?

930
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,944
Out.

931
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:37,157
What you watching?

932
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:39,451
Some vampire movie.

933
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,704
Guy just got his head torn off.

934
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:46,625
Where'd you go, Celeste?

935
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:53,215
I was sitting in my car...

936
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:56,844
...down by the channel.
You know...

937
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:58,929
...thinking about things.

938
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:04,142
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

939
01:18:04,518 --> 01:18:07,521
No, actually, I don't know.

940
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:16,572
Things. You know, the day.

941
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:21,034
About Katie being dead.

942
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,496
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know...

943
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,040
...those things.

944
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,459
Those things.

945
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,671
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

946
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,841
Vampires.

947
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:38,802
What about them?

948
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,807
They're undead...

949
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,019
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

950
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:50,731
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

951
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,816
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

952
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:56,445
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

953
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:59,198
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

954
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:01,491
You're not making any sense.

955
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,246
You think I killed Katie?

956
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:08,540
- Celeste.
- What...?

957
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:12,961
- Is that the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

958
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:16,548
You've barely looked at me since you found
out Katie was dead.

959
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,425
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

960
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:20,385
- Dave!
- What?

961
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:25,265
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

962
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,267
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

963
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,520
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

964
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:34,358
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

965
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:38,737
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

966
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,407
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

967
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:45,536
- Why don't you tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

968
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:48,288
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

969
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,667
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

970
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,502
I must have killed her, right?

971
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,629
Fuck!

972
01:20:23,448 --> 01:20:24,950
Henry...

973
01:20:25,576 --> 01:20:28,078
What? Henry?

974
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,833
Henry and George.

975
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,755
I never told anyone that before.

976
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,050
Those were their names.

977
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:46,221
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

978
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:52,394
At least that's what they called themselves,
but...

979
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:57,149
...they were wolves, and Dave...

980
01:20:57,816 --> 01:21:01,820
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.

981
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:06,200
What are you talking about, Dave?

982
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:09,161
I'm talking Henry and George.

983
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:12,956
They took me on a four-day ride.

984
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:19,004
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

985
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:22,716
And, man, Celeste...

986
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:24,676
...did they have their fun.

987
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:30,015
And no one came to help old Dave then.

988
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:36,772
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.

989
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,404
You mean, all those years ago...

990
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:49,743
...when you were a little boy?

991
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,038
Dave...

992
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:55,249
Dave's dead.

993
01:21:56,625 --> 01:22:00,754
I don't know who came out of that cellar,
but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

994
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,590
You see, honey...

995
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,217
Fuck!

996
01:22:05,509 --> 01:22:08,095
It's like vampires.

997
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:13,141
Once it's in you...

998
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:16,478
...it stays.

999
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:19,898
What stays?

1000
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,783
Did you know there were child prostitutes
in Rome Basin?

1001
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,119
What?

1002
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,418
Fuck!

1003
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:45,674
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1004
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,885
I'm warning you...

1005
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,513
...I can't trust my mind.

1006
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:58,437
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1007
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:01,773
Okay.

1008
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,779
Okay.

1009
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,656
Okay.

1010
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:15,287
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1011
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:17,998
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1012
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:20,000
These things get passed around.

1013
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:23,128
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1014
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:26,173
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1015
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:30,469
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1016
01:23:30,636 --> 01:23:35,098
They're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1017
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:39,436
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1018
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:43,732
...sexually abused as a kid.
On paper, this guy should be in jail already.

1019
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,276
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1020
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:49,821
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1021
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:53,992
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1022
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,410
He's not my friend.

1023
01:23:55,577 --> 01:24:00,123
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1024
01:24:14,721 --> 01:24:16,348
Hey, Jimmy.

1025
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:19,101
You're out late.

1026
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,019
Yeah, you too.

1027
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:24,231
It's cold, huh?

1028
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:26,733
Yeah, I guess.

1029
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,826
You know, I...

1030
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:38,370
I been sitting out here...

1031
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:40,622
...over the last few years...

1032
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:46,670
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1033
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:52,634
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while."

1034
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:59,057
Weird thing is...

1035
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:01,977
...it seemed to bring her back.

1036
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,567
I saw her, you know.

1037
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:12,070
Saw who?

1038
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,407
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1039
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:21,496
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1040
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,210
Did you talk to her?

1041
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:29,505
Just nodded hello at one point.

1042
01:25:30,339 --> 01:25:32,883
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1043
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:40,599
But...

1044
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,309
...Jimmy...

1045
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,729
...she looked...

1046
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:48,565
...happy.

1047
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:08,752
I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1048
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,851
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1049
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:27,855
- From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1050
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:29,523
...adjacent to the parkway.

1051
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:34,278
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1052
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:37,990
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1053
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:43,120
After I left you last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1054
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:48,041
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1055
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,919
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1056
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:54,923
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.

1057
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:57,968
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1058
01:26:58,135 --> 01:27:00,888
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1059
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:03,807
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1060
01:27:03,974 --> 01:27:07,769
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1061
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:12,858
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1062
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:17,154
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1063
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:18,822
Bingo.

1064
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:22,117
You wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1065
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:25,495
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1066
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:28,749
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1067
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:31,835
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1068
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:35,214
We know you didn't get that swollen hand
sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1069
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:40,594
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1070
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:43,680
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1071
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,856
How about a Sprite or something?

1072
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:57,069
How about you tell us what really happened
Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1073
01:27:57,236 --> 01:27:58,737
You lied.

1074
01:27:58,946 --> 01:28:01,448
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1075
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:06,537
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1076
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:11,124
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1077
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,918
Okay.

1078
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:16,088
All right.

1079
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:19,716
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1080
01:28:19,883 --> 01:28:22,553
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1081
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:26,431
What are you looking at him for?

1082
01:28:27,933 --> 01:28:31,603
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1083
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:33,856
Sure.

1084
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:36,149
Oh, I get it.

1085
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:38,652
You're the good cop.

1086
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:42,155
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1087
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,576
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1088
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,955
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1089
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:55,627
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1090
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:01,466
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1091
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,845
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1092
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:09,683
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1093
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,477
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1094
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:15,856
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1095
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,858
Bled like hell.

1096
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:21,528
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1097
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:25,282
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1098
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:27,159
What blood type are you?

1099
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:29,494
B-negative.

1100
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:32,414
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1101
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,083
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1102
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,753
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1103
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:41,924
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1104
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:45,802
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1105
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:49,139
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.

1106
01:29:49,306 --> 01:29:51,016
How will that look in court?

1107
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:55,062
You not knowing how someone else's blood
got in the trunk of your car?

1108
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:58,190
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1109
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,484
What report?

1110
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:05,155
The stolen-car report.
The car wasn't in my possession last night.

1111
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:08,534
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1112
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:11,328
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1113
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:20,796
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1114
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:24,591
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1115
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:27,427
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1116
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:30,222
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1117
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:32,558
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1118
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,977
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1119
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:39,147
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1120
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,859
Okay. Maybe.

1121
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,029
So, what do we do with Dave?

1122
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:49,241
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1123
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:54,037
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1124
01:30:54,246 --> 01:30:57,499
Or this lovely red marble here.

1125
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:00,210
Or a figural.

1126
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:01,920
That one.

1127
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:05,924
Very good. Nice and simple.

1128
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:16,018
Hey, Jimmy!

1129
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,607
Annabeth said you were here.

1130
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:25,110
We been asking around, like you said to.

1131
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:26,778
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1132
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:30,157
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1133
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:33,452
And it ain't about me missing your brains
running things.

1134
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:37,998
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1135
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:40,751
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1136
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:46,882
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1137
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:50,511
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1138
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:54,556
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1139
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:58,644
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1140
01:31:58,852 --> 01:32:02,105
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1141
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,900
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1142
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:09,404
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1143
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:13,283
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1144
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:17,538
What?

1145
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,377
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1146
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:25,087
Tell him.

1147
01:32:26,755 --> 01:32:29,800
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1148
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:33,679
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1149
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:36,682
I heard something else this morning too.

1150
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:41,520
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe they forgot to ask him something.

1151
01:32:42,145 --> 01:32:44,857
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1152
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:48,110
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1153
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:07,421
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1154
01:33:07,588 --> 01:33:10,215
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

1155
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:15,012
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1156
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:17,472
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1157
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:21,852
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1158
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:26,940
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned
in another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1159
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:29,359
...released on lack of evidence again.

1160
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:32,905
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1161
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:36,575
"A known associate, one Edmund Reese,
fingers Raymond...

1162
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:40,370
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1163
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:42,039
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1164
01:33:42,206 --> 01:33:44,833
Hey, excuse me,
$ 150,000 worth of comic books.

1165
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,793
Oh, excuse me.

1166
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,840
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1167
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:55,010
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1168
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:57,679
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1169
01:33:57,846 --> 01:33:59,765
Evidently not.

1170
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:04,269
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1171
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:08,899
...trafficking stolen goods across
state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1172
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:11,902
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1173
01:34:12,069 --> 01:34:16,740
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1174
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:21,745
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1175
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:23,580
...he does no time.

1176
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:27,793
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1177
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,256
- August 1989, he disappears.
- One, he's dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1178
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:35,676
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1179
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:39,471
...to murder his son's 19-year-old girlfriend?
We got nothing.

1180
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:44,226
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years ago,
during which the murder weapon was used.

1181
01:34:44,393 --> 01:34:48,272
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1182
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:51,316
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1183
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:54,111
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1184
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:59,116
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1185
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:01,869
...Anthony Waxman."

1186
01:35:03,996 --> 01:35:05,831
And one James Markum.

1187
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:10,460
And the hits just keep on coming.

1188
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:17,801
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1189
01:35:17,968 --> 01:35:20,012
I already gotta get back.

1190
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:23,640
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1191
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:27,269
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1192
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:31,940
He stole a truckload of cigarettes
from a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1193
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:35,277
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1194
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:38,906
- Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.
- But Harris walked.

1195
01:35:39,406 --> 01:35:41,408
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1196
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:45,829
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1197
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:47,539
On who?

1198
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:50,375
What the fuck was the name?

1199
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:54,505
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1200
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:56,423
Jimmy Markum.

1201
01:35:56,715 --> 01:36:01,595
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1202
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:04,640
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1203
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:08,393
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1204
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:12,356
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1205
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:14,733
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1206
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,403
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1207
01:36:19,696 --> 01:36:22,241
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1208
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:25,369
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1209
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,204
What's that tell you?

1210
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:41,176
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1211
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:44,179
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
- I'm good.

1212
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:47,057
Okay. Hey.

1213
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:49,768
- Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1214
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:53,730
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1215
01:36:56,733 --> 01:36:58,360
Step into my office.

1216
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:11,999
Beautiful day, huh?

1217
01:37:20,174 --> 01:37:22,176
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1218
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,517
I took Michael last night...

1219
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:32,811
...and I went to a motel.

1220
01:37:35,022 --> 01:37:36,273
Okay.

1221
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,193
I don't know, Jim.

1222
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:42,571
I might have left Dave for good.

1223
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:45,991
You left Dave?

1224
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,704
Yeah.

1225
01:37:51,914 --> 01:37:53,415
Well...

1226
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:58,337
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1227
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:02,841
I'm almost afraid of him.

1228
01:38:07,054 --> 01:38:08,847
Do you know something?

1229
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:14,978
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1230
01:38:15,646 --> 01:38:18,690
He saw Katie the night she was murdered.
Didn't tell me...

1231
01:38:18,857 --> 01:38:20,984
...till after the cops questioned him.

1232
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:25,280
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1233
01:38:26,198 --> 01:38:28,492
Is there anything else I should know?

1234
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,876
Come here.

1235
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:42,047
Okay.

1236
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:45,425
At 3 in the morning...

1237
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:51,139
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone else's blood.

1238
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:56,979
What did he say happened?

1239
01:38:58,605 --> 01:39:02,109
That he was mugged.
That he...

1240
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:05,112
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1241
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:06,530
That...

1242
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:09,032
That he might have killed him.

1243
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:18,750
But there was nothing in the paper.

1244
01:39:27,426 --> 01:39:30,387
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1245
01:39:33,265 --> 01:39:34,766
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1246
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:36,435
Celeste?

1247
01:39:40,939 --> 01:39:43,317
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1248
01:39:48,363 --> 01:39:50,365
Okay. All right.

1249
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:52,034
Okay.

1250
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:54,912
Oh, God.

1251
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:02,628
Okay.

1252
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:07,216
Oh, my God.

1253
01:40:08,467 --> 01:40:11,470
- Tell me about your father, Brendan.
- What?

1254
01:40:11,637 --> 01:40:15,557
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1255
01:40:15,849 --> 01:40:19,645
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1256
01:40:20,687 --> 01:40:22,981
I remember little things.

1257
01:40:23,774 --> 01:40:26,485
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1258
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,612
He...

1259
01:40:29,238 --> 01:40:30,822
He what?

1260
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:36,286
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1261
01:40:36,745 --> 01:40:38,956
You could always hear him coming home.

1262
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:44,378
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1263
01:40:45,212 --> 01:40:47,589
You remember your father having a gun?

1264
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:49,591
No.

1265
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:54,221
Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody
who was 6 when he left.

1266
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,515
What's up?

1267
01:40:56,723 --> 01:40:59,560
- What's that?
- This is what you asked for.

1268
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:04,314
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint analysis,
the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1269
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:06,149
All right, thanks.

1270
01:41:06,859 --> 01:41:09,486
We were talking about your father's gun.

1271
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:15,868
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1272
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:19,580
- When was the last time you talked to him?
- Never.

1273
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:21,081
Never?

1274
01:41:21,248 --> 01:41:23,584
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1275
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:27,212
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1276
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:29,089
Because he's not missing.

1277
01:41:29,256 --> 01:41:32,134
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1278
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:36,722
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1279
01:41:38,015 --> 01:41:40,934
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1280
01:41:42,477 --> 01:41:45,189
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1281
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:49,985
Who else would send it?

1282
01:41:51,153 --> 01:41:53,238
My ma says that's the way he was.

1283
01:41:53,447 --> 01:41:56,366
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1284
01:42:00,037 --> 01:42:02,873
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1285
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:06,251
You know why, kid.

1286
01:42:06,793 --> 01:42:08,086
No, I don't.

1287
01:42:09,004 --> 01:42:10,881
Gun that killed your girlfriend...

1288
01:42:11,048 --> 01:42:13,926
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1289
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,094
So...

1290
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:18,680
...you wanna tell me about it?

1291
01:42:21,683 --> 01:42:24,019
My father didn't have a gun.

1292
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:26,188
You are fucking lying!

1293
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:34,321
Can I go now?

1294
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:37,866
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1295
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:54,758
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1296
01:42:55,676 --> 01:42:57,469
Hey, Val.

1297
01:42:57,845 --> 01:43:00,138
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1298
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:02,891
- All right.
- It's fucked up.

1299
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:06,812
Katie.

1300
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,065
A fucking tragedy.

1301
01:43:11,233 --> 01:43:12,484
Yeah.

1302
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,362
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1303
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:16,989
Yeah?

1304
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:19,992
Yeah. What do you say, man?

1305
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,996
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1306
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:30,335
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1307
01:43:30,502 --> 01:43:32,254
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1308
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:36,592
Well, the first round's on me.

1309
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,345
Now you're talking.

1310
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:03,577
- I think the kid is lying about the gun.
- Absolutely. I told you three times already.

1311
01:44:03,744 --> 01:44:08,707
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is still alive.

1312
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:10,501
Eighty grand. I mean...

1313
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:14,296
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1314
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:19,009
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1315
01:44:19,176 --> 01:44:22,596
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah.

1316
01:44:22,763 --> 01:44:25,098
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1317
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:28,894
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1318
01:44:33,148 --> 01:44:36,360
911, <i>police services.</i>
<i>What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

1319
01:44:36,527 --> 01:44:39,738
<i>There's</i>, <i>like</i>, <i>this car with blood in it</i>,
<i>and the door's open.</i>

1320
01:44:39,905 --> 01:44:42,824
- <i>What's the location of the car?</i>
- <i>Sydney Street.</i>

1321
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:46,787
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.</i>
<i>Me and my friend</i>, <i>we just found it.</i>

1322
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:49,790
- <i>Son</i>, <i>what's your name?</i>
- <i>He wants to know her name.</i>

1323
01:44:49,957 --> 01:44:53,001
- <i>Your name</i>, <i>what's your name?</i>
- <i>We're so fucking out of here.</i>

1324
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:55,087
<i>Good luck</i>, <i>man.</i>

1325
01:44:55,337 --> 01:44:59,383
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1326
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:01,093
Her.

1327
01:45:01,844 --> 01:45:05,180
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1328
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:12,563
- <i>Son</i>, <i>what's your name?</i>
- <i>He wants to know her name.</i>

1329
01:45:12,729 --> 01:45:16,817
- He said, "Her name."
- She's a dead girl, you refer to her as a she.

1330
01:45:16,984 --> 01:45:19,611
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1331
01:45:19,778 --> 01:45:23,156
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1332
01:45:27,786 --> 01:45:29,121
Play it again.

1333
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:38,922
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1334
01:45:39,089 --> 01:45:41,341
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
- Here.

1335
01:45:41,508 --> 01:45:46,013
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1336
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,681
Fucking Carson.

1337
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:51,977
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1338
01:45:52,186 --> 01:45:54,605
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1339
01:45:54,771 --> 01:46:00,485
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts fucking screaming!

1340
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:05,157
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1341
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:07,326
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1342
01:46:07,534 --> 01:46:12,831
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1343
01:46:12,998 --> 01:46:14,708
Fucking smiley mask!

1344
01:46:17,211 --> 01:46:18,670
Idiot!

1345
01:46:18,879 --> 01:46:21,340
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1346
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:27,554
Shit like that happened all the time on jobs.
That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1347
01:46:27,721 --> 01:46:30,557
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1348
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:35,145
Why do you think he went straight?

1349
01:46:37,856 --> 01:46:40,275
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1350
01:46:42,736 --> 01:46:44,571
What about you guys?

1351
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:49,576
What? Us? Going straight?

1352
01:46:51,036 --> 01:46:53,455
That's pretty fucking funny!

1353
01:46:57,251 --> 01:47:01,964
We're like bats, we like the night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1354
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:03,799
Want another shot?

1355
01:47:07,427 --> 01:47:12,641
- You know, I should slow down till we eat.
- Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1356
01:47:12,808 --> 01:47:14,268
Come on, get up.

1357
01:47:19,481 --> 01:47:21,483
Live a little, huh?

1358
01:47:48,886 --> 01:47:50,804
Slide over, Dave.

1359
01:47:52,306 --> 01:47:55,392
- Dave.
- All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1360
01:47:55,559 --> 01:47:58,979
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1361
01:48:01,773 --> 01:48:03,567
To our children.

1362
01:48:08,405 --> 01:48:10,324
- I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1363
01:48:11,783 --> 01:48:13,827
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1364
01:48:13,994 --> 01:48:17,080
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1365
01:48:17,247 --> 01:48:20,792
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1366
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:23,545
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1367
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:26,298
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1368
01:48:26,507 --> 01:48:27,841
Yeah.

1369
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:29,718
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1370
01:48:35,641 --> 01:48:37,518
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1371
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:51,532
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1372
01:48:52,241 --> 01:48:53,909
Thanks, Kevin.

1373
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:33,198
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1374
01:49:33,365 --> 01:49:38,745
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

1375
01:49:41,164 --> 01:49:43,917
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1376
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:47,045
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1377
01:49:47,254 --> 01:49:49,173
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1378
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:52,467
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1379
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:54,136
Come on. Come on, now.

1380
01:49:54,303 --> 01:49:59,349
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1381
01:50:22,456 --> 01:50:23,832
Hey, Ray.

1382
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:39,806
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1383
01:50:44,728 --> 01:50:46,522
Come here a second.

1384
01:50:52,027 --> 01:50:53,612
Sit down.

1385
01:51:02,996 --> 01:51:05,624
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1386
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:09,670
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1387
01:51:10,337 --> 01:51:15,175
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1388
01:51:15,342 --> 01:51:17,928
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1389
01:51:18,095 --> 01:51:20,681
- That's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1390
01:51:20,848 --> 01:51:23,350
- I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1391
01:51:23,517 --> 01:51:24,810
...when she was dying.

1392
01:51:24,977 --> 01:51:29,189
The death part you do alone,
but I could have helped her with the dying.

1393
01:51:29,356 --> 01:51:31,441
Why are you telling me this?

1394
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:35,821
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1395
01:51:35,988 --> 01:51:38,407
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1396
01:51:38,574 --> 01:51:40,158
He was begging.

1397
01:51:40,325 --> 01:51:43,036
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1398
01:51:44,037 --> 01:51:47,666
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1399
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:51,253
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1400
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:53,547
Who do you hate?

1401
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:57,342
Come on, who?

1402
01:51:57,551 --> 01:51:59,011
No one.

1403
01:52:01,346 --> 01:52:06,101
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1404
01:52:06,268 --> 01:52:09,771
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1405
01:52:09,938 --> 01:52:12,357
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1406
01:52:12,816 --> 01:52:14,318
Who do you love?

1407
01:52:18,906 --> 01:52:20,574
You love me.

1408
01:52:22,743 --> 01:52:24,161
What about Ma?

1409
01:52:29,416 --> 01:52:33,003
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1410
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:40,093
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1411
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,971
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1412
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,182
This is the mugger story.

1413
01:52:45,349 --> 01:52:49,895
He wasn't a mugger, a child molester.
He was having sex with this kid in his car.

1414
01:52:50,062 --> 01:52:53,857
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1415
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:03,242
Get out of here.

1416
01:53:16,046 --> 01:53:17,464
Run!

1417
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:19,675
<i>Dave</i>, <i>run!</i>

1418
01:53:21,844 --> 01:53:25,597
- You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1419
01:53:26,431 --> 01:53:29,351
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1420
01:53:29,518 --> 01:53:34,147
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1421
01:53:34,314 --> 01:53:38,694
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1422
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:43,490
Rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1423
01:53:43,657 --> 01:53:47,119
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1424
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:51,707
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1425
01:53:51,874 --> 01:53:54,126
I didn't kill Katie.

1426
01:53:54,877 --> 01:53:59,006
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1427
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:03,510
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
- Letting this piece of shit explain himself?

1428
01:54:03,677 --> 01:54:06,638
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1429
01:54:06,847 --> 01:54:10,809
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1430
01:54:11,018 --> 01:54:14,563
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1431
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:16,064
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

1432
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:21,653
Nineteen years old.

1433
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:24,281
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1434
01:54:24,448 --> 01:54:27,618
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1435
01:54:27,784 --> 01:54:29,203
I'm looking at you.

1436
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:32,039
Why'd you do it?

1437
01:54:32,206 --> 01:54:37,461
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1438
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:40,297
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1439
01:54:40,672 --> 01:54:43,383
No more lies, no more secrets.

1440
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:46,220
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1441
01:54:47,095 --> 01:54:51,350
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1442
01:54:52,309 --> 01:54:55,521
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1443
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:57,606
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1444
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:06,365
I thought I was finished with all this.

1445
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:10,202
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1446
01:55:15,499 --> 01:55:19,044
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1447
01:55:19,419 --> 01:55:23,507
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.

1448
01:55:24,091 --> 01:55:27,761
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1449
01:55:27,928 --> 01:55:29,888
Admit what you did, Dave.

1450
01:55:30,055 --> 01:55:32,307
Admit what you did.

1451
01:55:33,976 --> 01:55:36,979
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1452
01:55:37,855 --> 01:55:39,398
I know you can speak.

1453
01:55:42,526 --> 01:55:46,113
So say it. Say you love me.

1454
01:55:49,491 --> 01:55:53,161
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1455
01:56:01,086 --> 01:56:04,840
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1456
01:56:12,222 --> 01:56:13,807
I'm coming back!

1457
01:56:19,813 --> 01:56:23,233
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1458
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:28,155
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1459
01:56:28,363 --> 01:56:30,657
Say her name. Say it.

1460
01:56:31,158 --> 01:56:35,996
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1461
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:51,053
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1462
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,388
That's a Sig, right?

1463
01:56:55,724 --> 01:56:57,976
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1464
01:56:58,894 --> 01:57:01,438
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1465
01:57:01,688 --> 01:57:04,733
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1466
01:57:05,567 --> 01:57:08,570
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1467
01:57:09,446 --> 01:57:12,366
- He broke my nose.
- We'll arrest him.

1468
01:57:12,533 --> 01:57:16,203
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1469
01:57:16,954 --> 01:57:18,664
I want him fucking dead!

1470
01:57:26,046 --> 01:57:28,215
Motherfucker.

1471
01:57:29,383 --> 01:57:31,343
Motherfucker.

1472
01:57:33,637 --> 01:57:36,557
Admit what you did, Dave...

1473
01:57:37,641 --> 01:57:39,643
...and I'll let you live.

1474
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:44,022
Just say it out loud, and I'll let you breathe.

1475
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:46,525
You'll go to prison...

1476
01:57:47,609 --> 01:57:51,029
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1477
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:54,283
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1478
01:57:59,246 --> 01:58:00,956
Yeah.

1479
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:05,043
Yeah, I did it.

1480
01:58:08,505 --> 01:58:10,132
Why?

1481
01:58:10,299 --> 01:58:11,758
Why?

1482
01:58:14,928 --> 01:58:19,266
That night in McGill's...

1483
01:58:20,225 --> 01:58:24,855
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1484
01:58:26,064 --> 01:58:27,441
What dream?

1485
01:58:28,942 --> 01:58:31,445
A dream of youth.

1486
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:36,325
I don't remember having one.

1487
01:58:38,785 --> 01:58:40,787
So it was the dream?

1488
01:58:42,456 --> 01:58:44,917
The dream, yeah.

1489
01:58:46,126 --> 01:58:51,465
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1490
01:58:58,096 --> 01:59:01,058
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1491
01:59:02,309 --> 01:59:05,270
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1492
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:29,044
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1493
01:59:32,005 --> 01:59:34,383
We wash them clean.

1494
01:59:36,677 --> 01:59:40,931
- Look, his fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1495
01:59:47,354 --> 01:59:49,398
I wasn't ready.

1496
01:59:55,404 --> 01:59:56,738
It's like I said, Dave.

1497
02:00:00,033 --> 02:00:01,785
This part, you do alone.

1498
02:00:46,705 --> 02:00:48,582
Tough night?

1499
02:00:51,335 --> 02:00:53,337
Yeah, me too.

1500
02:00:55,339 --> 02:00:58,258
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1501
02:01:06,934 --> 02:01:08,727
We got them, Jim.

1502
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:13,815
Got who?

1503
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:16,568
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1504
02:01:21,114 --> 02:01:23,951
Killers, plural.

1505
02:01:24,785 --> 02:01:30,123
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. And another kid, John O'Shea.

1506
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:32,668
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1507
02:01:37,339 --> 02:01:38,757
No doubt?

1508
02:01:39,466 --> 02:01:41,218
None.

1509
02:01:50,477 --> 02:01:51,979
Why?

1510
02:01:53,564 --> 02:01:55,274
They don't know.

1511
02:01:55,482 --> 02:01:57,985
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1512
02:01:58,151 --> 02:02:03,282
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1513
02:02:05,033 --> 02:02:08,954
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1514
02:02:09,121 --> 02:02:12,499
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1515
02:02:12,666 --> 02:02:16,628
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1516
02:02:24,511 --> 02:02:26,430
And the beating they gave her?

1517
02:02:28,932 --> 02:02:30,559
Ray Jr. Had a hockey stick.

1518
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:35,981
All right. Go easy.

1519
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:38,108
Take a breath.

1520
02:02:39,484 --> 02:02:41,320
Look at me.

1521
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:43,530
Look at me, Jimmy.

1522
02:02:45,866 --> 02:02:48,202
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1523
02:02:48,368 --> 02:02:52,706
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1524
02:02:53,665 --> 02:02:55,876
We need to talk to him.

1525
02:02:56,251 --> 02:03:00,714
Boston P.D. Found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1526
02:03:00,881 --> 02:03:03,342
A body? The body of a guy?

1527
02:03:03,967 --> 02:03:07,095
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1528
02:03:07,387 --> 02:03:10,224
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1529
02:03:10,724 --> 02:03:12,768
So, Jimmy...

1530
02:03:13,727 --> 02:03:16,355
...when was the last time you saw Dave?

1531
02:03:27,074 --> 02:03:30,244
The last time I saw Dave.

1532
02:03:31,787 --> 02:03:35,040
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1533
02:03:43,298 --> 02:03:47,678
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1534
02:03:50,305 --> 02:03:55,102
That was 25 years ago,
going up this street in the back of that car.

1535
02:04:04,361 --> 02:04:08,323
Jimmy, what did you do?

1536
02:04:16,456 --> 02:04:19,459
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1537
02:04:23,172 --> 02:04:25,674
If only you'd been a little faster.

1538
02:04:33,974 --> 02:04:37,644
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1539
02:04:44,276 --> 02:04:46,862
Sometimes I think...

1540
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:50,824
I think all three of us got in that car.

1541
02:04:51,658 --> 02:04:55,913
And all of this is just a dream, you know?

1542
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:58,248
A dream, sure.

1543
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:01,919
In reality...

1544
02:05:02,085 --> 02:05:06,798
...we're still 11 -year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1545
02:05:06,965 --> 02:05:10,511
...imagining what our lives would have been
if we'd escaped.

1546
02:05:18,685 --> 02:05:20,771
Maybe you're right.

1547
02:05:20,938 --> 02:05:23,232
Who the fuck knows?

1548
02:05:51,635 --> 02:05:53,804
Yeah, this is Sean.

1549
02:05:59,726 --> 02:06:02,813
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1550
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,232
I pushed you away.

1551
02:06:08,026 --> 02:06:10,404
I'm sorry too.

1552
02:06:11,405 --> 02:06:14,199
Things have been so messed up.

1553
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:16,910
Loving you, hating you.

1554
02:06:19,121 --> 02:06:20,789
Come home?

1555
02:06:23,584 --> 02:06:25,544
You change the locks or anything?

1556
02:06:26,628 --> 02:06:28,380
No.

1557
02:06:29,381 --> 02:06:32,509
No, everything is just the way you left it.

1558
02:06:33,677 --> 02:06:36,430
- <i>Nora.</i>
- What's that?

1559
02:06:37,723 --> 02:06:41,393
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

1560
02:06:42,519 --> 02:06:44,229
Nora, huh?

1561
02:06:44,438 --> 02:06:48,400
Well, I like that. Nora.

1562
02:07:18,305 --> 02:07:20,599
I killed Dave.

1563
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:24,478
I killed him, and I threw him in the Mystic.

1564
02:07:25,521 --> 02:07:27,439
But I killed the wrong man.

1565
02:07:28,106 --> 02:07:30,400
That's what I've done.

1566
02:07:31,026 --> 02:07:33,445
And I can't undo it.

1567
02:07:34,446 --> 02:07:36,281
Jimmy.

1568
02:07:44,122 --> 02:07:46,959
I wanna feel your heart.

1569
02:07:47,709 --> 02:07:49,044
Last night...

1570
02:07:49,503 --> 02:07:53,632
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1571
02:07:53,841 --> 02:07:56,885
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1572
02:07:57,052 --> 02:07:58,762
...because you created her.

1573
02:07:58,929 --> 02:08:02,850
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1574
02:08:03,016 --> 02:08:06,812
...felt like your heart was gonna explode...
- Please stop.

1575
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:10,816
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1576
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:14,486
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1577
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:18,615
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1578
02:08:18,782 --> 02:08:24,830
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1579
02:08:24,997 --> 02:08:28,166
And that is never wrong.

1580
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:34,298
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1581
02:08:34,464 --> 02:08:39,178
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1582
02:08:47,686 --> 02:08:52,191
You said, "Last night." You knew?

1583
02:08:53,233 --> 02:08:55,485
Celeste called, looking for you.

1584
02:08:55,652 --> 02:08:58,947
She was worried something might happen.
She told me about Dave.

1585
02:08:59,114 --> 02:09:01,992
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1586
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:05,287
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1587
02:09:05,454 --> 02:09:09,666
- Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1588
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:12,336
Their daddy's a king.

1589
02:09:12,503 --> 02:09:16,715
And a king knows what to do and does it.

1590
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:18,467
Even when it's hard.

1591
02:09:18,634 --> 02:09:23,055
And their daddy will do
whatever he has to for those he loves.

1592
02:09:23,222 --> 02:09:26,016
And that's all that matters.

1593
02:09:30,896 --> 02:09:34,566
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1594
02:09:34,733 --> 02:09:37,027
Everyone but us.

1595
02:09:37,194 --> 02:09:39,363
We will never be weak.

1596
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:41,657
And you...

1597
02:09:42,616 --> 02:09:45,244
You could rule this town.

1598
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:51,708
And after, Jimmy...

1599
02:09:51,875 --> 02:09:54,586
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1600
02:09:54,795 --> 02:09:57,548
Katie would have liked that.

1601
02:11:34,561 --> 02:11:36,480
Michael!

1602
02:11:37,147 --> 02:11:41,360
Michael! Michael!

1603
02:11:42,611 --> 02:11:44,655
Michael!

1604
02:11:45,239 --> 02:11:47,157
Michael!
