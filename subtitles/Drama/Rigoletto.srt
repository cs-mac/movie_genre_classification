1
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,525
I have to get to the bottom
Of this adventure

2
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,422
With my mysterious beauty
From the town

3
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,119
The girI you've seen in church?

4
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,423
Every Sunday for three months now

5
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,534
-Where does she Iive?
-In a remote Iane

6
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:50,865
An unknown man
Goes there every night

7
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:52,938
And does she know
Who her admirer is?

8
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,597
No, she doesn't

9
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:01,439
So much beauty!
Look

10
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,881
Ceprano's wife outshines them aII

11
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:07,850
-Don't Iet the count hear you, my Iord
-Why shouId I care?

12
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:15,360
-He might teII another Iady
-That wouIdn't bother me at aII

13
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:23,099
This woman or that
To me they're the same

14
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:27,105
Just Iike aII the others
I see around me

15
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:31,302
I won't surrender
The empire of my heart

16
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,643
To one beautifuI woman
Rather than another

17
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,913
Their charm is the gift

18
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:46,424
Which fate gives us to adorn our Iives

19
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:49,119
If one of them pIeases me today

20
00:04:49,297 --> 00:05:02,665
Perhaps tomorrow
It wiII be another one

21
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,544
We hate constancy
That tyrant of our hearts

22
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:15,815
Like a crueI disease

23
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,949
If anyone wishes to stay faithfuI
Let him

24
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:24,325
But there is no Iove without freedom

25
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:29,367
I Iaugh at the jeaIous rage
Of husbands

26
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:35,271
And the fury of Iovers

27
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,934
I defy even Argu's hundred eyes

28
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:55,224
Whenever a beautifuI woman
Attracts me

29
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:23,155
Are you Ieaving?
How crueI of you!

30
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:31,925
I am obIiged to foIIow my husband
Back to Ceprano

31
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,591
But the star of your beauty
ShouId shine

32
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,207
At court as brightIy as the sun

33
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:49,282
The heart of every man here
ShouId beat for you

34
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,653
The powerfuI fIame of the Iove
I feeI for you

35
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:05,459
Is inebriating, conquering
Destroying my heart

36
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,692
Restrain yourseIf

37
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:12,032
The powerfuI fIame of the Iove
Is inebriating, conquering

38
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,367
Destroying my heart

39
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,808
The powerfuI fIame of the Iove
I feeI for you

40
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,883
Is inebriating, conquering
Destroying my heart

41
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:28,579
What's that growing on your head
My Iord Ceprano?

42
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,982
Do you see how
He's fuming with rage?

43
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,147
What fun!

44
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,760
-Oh, yes
-Even the duke is enjoying himseIf!

45
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:38,330
Doesn't he aIways?
What's new about that?

46
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,057
GambIing and wine, parties, dancing

47
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:43,362
BattIes, banquets
He enjoys it aII

48
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:47,371
Now he's Iaying siege to the countess

49
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:51,341
WhiIe her husband stands by
In a rage

50
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,770
Great news!
Great news

51
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,210
What is it?
Come on!

52
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,907
You'II be amazed

53
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,746
TeII us, teII us

54
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,353
Ha, ha! RigoIetto....

55
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,513
-WeII?
-It's sensationaI!

56
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,591
He's Iost his hump?
Not deformed anymore?

57
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,490
Even stranger....

58
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:45,188
The jester has got....

59
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,628
-WeII, come on!
-A Iover

60
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,598
A Iover!
Who'd beIieve it?

61
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,897
The hunchback's turned into Cupid

62
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,531
That monster? Cupid!
Cupid in Iove!

63
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:01,811
Ah, Ceprano is such
A damned nuisance!

64
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:06,419
His dear wife is an angeI to me!

65
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,715
-Abduct her
-Easier said than done

66
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,519
-This evening
-But what about the count?

67
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:16,953
-What's your prison for?
-Ah, no

68
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,294
-WeII, then, exiIe
-That won't do either, fooI

69
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:24,370
-In that case, his head
-(Oh, you bIack-hearted wretch!)

70
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:28,099
What do you say to that?
Your head

71
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,511
That's fair enough
What can you do with a head Iike that?

72
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,374
What use is it?

73
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:35,174
-You viIIain!
-That's enough!

74
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,748
-He just makes me Iaugh
-He's reaIIy furious now!

75
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:37,906
Come here, fooI

76
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,450
-He's reaIIy furious now!
-He's reaIIy furious now!

77
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,609
He's reaIIy furious now!

78
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,985
Ah, you aIways take a joke too far

79
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:47,457
Who couId do me any harm?
I'm not afraid of them

80
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,720
Revenge!

81
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,023
The anger you provoke
CouId rebound on you

82
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:54,725
No one wouId Iay a hand
On a favorite of the duke

83
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:58,565
Ah, you aIways

84
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,640
Take a joke too far

85
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:07,270
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

86
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:11,043
The anger you provoke
CouId rebound on you

87
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:14,415
Ah, you aIways

88
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:18,285
Take a joke too far

89
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,987
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

90
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,759
No one wouId Iay a hand
On a favorite of the duke

91
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,834
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

92
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,992
It's aII festivity!

93
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,731
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

94
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:33,896
It's aII festivity!

95
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,770
It's aII enjoyment, aII festivity
Everything is for our amusement!

96
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:39,936
Look, doesn't this paIace now seem
To be the kingdom of pIeasure?

97
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,513
Look, doesn't this paIace now seem

98
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,343
Look, doesn't this paIace now seem

99
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,677
To be the kingdom of pIeasure?

100
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:50,882
Look, doesn't this paIace now seem
To be the kingdom of pIeasure?

101
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:56,587
-Let me speak with him
-No

102
00:10:56,764 --> 00:11:02,031
-I insist
-Monterone!

103
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:10,008
Yes, Monterone
The thunder of my voice

104
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:15,809
ShaII strike at you wherever you are

105
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:19,419
Let me speak with him

106
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:37,605
You conspired

107
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:45,034
You conspired

108
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:51,082
You conspired against us, my Iord

109
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,382
And we....

110
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,465
And we graciousIy granted you
Our pardon

111
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:14,464
So, what foIIy is this
That makes you go on

112
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,873
AII the time about

113
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:22,880
Your daughter's honor?

114
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,181
A further insuIt!

115
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:33,383
Oh, yes, I shaII come
Oh, yes, I shaII come

116
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:41,490
To interrupt your orgies
I shaII continue to cry out

117
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:47,630
As Iong as the hideous offence

118
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:55,579
To my famiIy honor
Remains unavenged

119
00:12:55,749 --> 00:13:00,243
Even if you hand me over
To the executioner

120
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:06,326
I shaII reappear to you
As a grim specter

121
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:12,295
Carrying my severed head
In my hands

122
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:20,771
CaIIing on the worId
CaIIing on the worId

123
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:22,340
WorId and on God for vengeance

124
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,771
That's enough
Arrest him

125
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,673
-He's mad
-What Ianguage!

126
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:33,651
Oh, may both of you be accursed!

127
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:40,525
To set your dogs on a dying Iion

128
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:46,496
Is viIe, O duke
And as for you, you snake

129
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:54,574
Daring to mock a father's grief

130
00:13:54,742 --> 00:14:03,343
-My curse on you!
-(What have I heard? Horror!)

131
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,384
You who dared
To interrupt our feasting

132
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,919
You were Ied here
By some spirit from heII

133
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,351
(Horror!)

134
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:13,015
Your words are in vain
Get away from here

135
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,787
Go away, oId man
TrembIe at your duke's wrath

136
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:19,194
Your words are in vain
Get away from here

137
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,926
Go away, oId man
TrembIe at your duke's wrath

138
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,662
You roused him to anger
You have nothing to hope for

139
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:28,069
This moment has seaIed your doom

140
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,539
This moment has seaIed

141
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,473
My curse on you!

142
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,613
Your doom

143
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:39,083
Go away, oId man
TrembIe at your duke's wrath

144
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,845
You have nothing to hope for

145
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:46,391
Go away, oId man
TrembIe at your duke's wrath

146
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,289
You have nothing to hope for

147
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:55,732
-My curse on you!
-You have nothing to hope for

148
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:06,037
My curse on you!

149
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:28,158
(That oId man cursed me!)

150
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:46,678
-Sir?
-Go away, I haven't got anything

151
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,405
I didn't ask you for anything

152
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:55,385
I am a man who Iives by his sword

153
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,320
A robber?

154
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:11,235
A man who, for a smaII fee
WiII get rid of a rivaI for you

155
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:18,038
-And you have a rivaI
-Who?

156
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:25,174
Your woman Iives there

157
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,877
(What do I hear? )

158
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:35,288
So how much wouId I have to pay
For a gentIeman?

159
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,158
I'd need to ask a bit more

160
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:42,359
How wouId I pay you?

161
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:48,702
HaIf in advance
The baIance afterwards

162
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,776
(The deviI!)

163
00:17:51,945 --> 00:18:02,150
And how do you manage
Your business without getting caught?

164
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:05,723
I usuaIIy get my man in the town

165
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:09,589
Or in my own house

166
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:14,598
I Iie in wait for him at night
One thrust

167
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:17,202
And he's dead

168
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,395
(The deviI!)

169
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,306
How do you do it in your house?

170
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:32,942
That's easy
My sister heIps me

171
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,185
She dances in the streets
She's pretty

172
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,854
She Iures the man I'm after
And then....

173
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:48,126
I understand

174
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:55,571
-Without a sound
-I understand

175
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:59,439
Here's my instrument

176
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:04,550
-Might it be of use to you?
-No, not just now

177
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:16,428
-Too bad for you
-But perhaps...?

178
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:24,401
My name is SparafuciIe

179
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:32,637
-A foreigner?
-From Burgundy

180
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:42,984
Where can I find you if I need you?

181
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:46,683
I'm aIways here in the evenings

182
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,657
Go now

183
00:19:48,829 --> 00:20:06,009
SparafuciIe
SparafuciIe

184
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:24,095
We are equaIs!

185
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:31,067
I've got my tongue
He's got his dagger

186
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm the man who Iaughs

187
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:44,909
He's the man who kiIIs!

188
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:16,071
That oId man cursed me

189
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:20,117
O men! O nature!

190
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:26,283
Between you
You have made me wicked!

191
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:32,227
Oh, my anger!
To be crooked!

192
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:38,668
Oh, my anger!
To be a cIown!

193
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:51,645
I mustn't
I can't do anything but Iaugh!

194
00:21:51,818 --> 00:22:01,716
Tears, the birthright of aII men

195
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:10,997
Are denied to me

196
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:24,007
That master of mine
Young, cheerfuI

197
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:30,384
So powerfuI, handsome
WiII weariIy say to me

198
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:37,963
''Make me Iaugh, jester!''

199
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:42,465
And I have to force myseIf to do it!

200
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:48,768
Damnation!

201
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:53,174
I hate you, you sneering courtiers!

202
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:57,840
What pIeasure I get
From stinging you!

203
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:11,193
If I am wicked
It is entireIy your fauIt!

204
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:34,452
But I became a different man
In this pIace!

205
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:45,054
That oId man cursed me!

206
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:54,534
Why does the thought of it
ContinuaIIy torment my mind?

207
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:04,182
WiII it bring me misfortune?
Ah, no

208
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:11,086
That's madness

209
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,695
-My daughter!
-Father!

210
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:34,371
OnIy when I am with you
Does my weary heart feeI any joy

211
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:40,679
-Oh, such Iove
-You are my Iife!

212
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,515
Oh, such Iove

213
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:47,319
What wouId I possess on earth
Without you?

214
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:54,229
Oh, such Iove, my father!

215
00:24:56,903 --> 00:25:00,100
You are sighing!

216
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:08,681
What troubIes you so deepIy?
TeII your poor daughter

217
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:15,014
If there is any mystery
Let me know it

218
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:21,149
Let me know about my famiIy

219
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:25,491
-You have no famiIy
-What is your name?

220
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,930
What does it matter to you?

221
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:38,306
If you don't want to teII me
About yourseIf....

222
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:39,945
Never Ieave the house

223
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:46,746
-I onIy go out to church
-Oh, you do weII

224
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:57,728
If you wiII not teII me
About yourseIf

225
00:25:57,897 --> 00:26:08,341
At Ieast Iet me know
Who my mother was

226
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:09,069
At Ieast Iet me know
Who my mother was

227
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:19,743
Ah, don't taIk to an unhappy man

228
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:28,156
About the joy he has Iost

229
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:36,133
She was an angeI

230
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:45,335
Who feIt pity for my sorrows

231
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:49,608
I was aIone, misshapen, poor

232
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:55,379
And she Ioved me out of compassion

233
00:26:55,555 --> 00:27:04,122
Ah! She died
She died

234
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:12,363
May the earth rest IightIy
On her beIoved head

235
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:22,574
Now you aIone remain
To this unhappy man

236
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:31,858
God be thanked for it!
Thanked for it!

237
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,257
God be thanked for it!
Thanked for it!

238
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:36,657
Oh, what grief!
Oh, what grief!

239
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:41,562
What couId cause
Such bitter weeping?

240
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,998
Oh, what grief!
Oh, what grief!

241
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,131
What couId cause
Such bitter weeping?

242
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,213
Now you aIone remain

243
00:27:55,381 --> 00:28:04,221
Now you aIone remain
To this unhappy man

244
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:12,161
God be thanked for it!
Thanked for it!

245
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:17,634
No more, Father
No more, Father

246
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:21,365
Now you aIone remain

247
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:26,740
To this unhappy man

248
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:34,547
-God be thanked for it!
-To see you Iike this is so painfuI to me

249
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:41,854
TeII me your name
And the sorrow that so torments you

250
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:45,191
Why teII you my name?
There is no point

251
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:48,095
I am your father
That shouId be enough

252
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,795
Perhaps there are peopIe in the worId
Who fear me

253
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,372
Perhaps others bear me a grudge

254
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,601
And others curse me

255
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:05,581
But do you not have a homeIand
Any famiIy or friends?

256
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:10,917
HomeIand! FamiIy! Friends!

257
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,618
My reIigion, my homeIand, my famiIy

258
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:21,256
My whoIe universe
Are aII contained in you!

259
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:26,997
Ah, how joyfuI my Iife wouId be
If I couId make you happier!

260
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:31,633
My reIigion, my homeIand, my famiIy

261
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:36,714
My whoIe universe
Are aII contained in you!

262
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:44,551
My whoIe universe
Are aII contained in you!

263
00:29:54,534 --> 00:30:04,409
I came here three months ago

264
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:14,282
And I stiII haven't seen the town

265
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:21,383
If you Iet me
I couId do so now

266
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:24,962
Never! Never!
TeII me, have you ever Ieft the house?

267
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:26,564
-No
-You never do!

268
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,030
(Ah! What have I said? )

269
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,964
Mind
Make sure you never do so!

270
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:33,037
They couId foIIow her
Even kidnap her

271
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,573
They came to dishonor
The jester's daughter

272
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,074
And they Iaugh about it

273
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:42,544
Horror!
Hey there!

274
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,117
-Sir?
-Did anyone see me coming?

275
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:50,050
-Be sure to teII the truth
-No, nobody

276
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,123
Very weII

277
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:56,022
Is the door onto the ramparts
AIways kept Iocked?

278
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:59,096
-AII the time
-Be sure to teII the truth

279
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:00,533
AII the time

280
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,056
AII the time

281
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:11,405
Ah, woman
Watch over this pure fIower

282
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:17,709
That I have confided to your care

283
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:24,221
Watch carefuIIy
Make sure

284
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:31,319
That her purity is never stained

285
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:44,570
Defend her from the raging winds
That crush other fIowers

286
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:59,489
Keep her in a state of purity
For her father

287
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:15,996
So much Iove! Such concern!
What do you fear, Father?

288
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:32,388
A protecting angeI is with God
Watching over us in heaven

289
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:48,703
My mother's hoIy prayers
Are warding off misfortune from us

290
00:32:48,875 --> 00:33:04,553
The fIower you so cherish
ShaII never be pIucked out or crushed

291
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:18,968
Ah, woman, watch over
This pure fIower that I have confi--

292
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,538
There's somebody outside!

293
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:30,578
Heavens!
AIways suspicious about something!

294
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,190
Has no one ever
FoIIowed you to church?

295
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,088
-Never
-(RigoIetto!)

296
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,025
If anyone knocks on the door
Make sure you never open it

297
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:50,328
-Not even if it's the duke?
-EspeciaIIy not to him!

298
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:56,240
-Goodbye, daughter
-(His daughter!)

299
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:05,909
Goodbye, Father

300
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:17,257
Ah, woman
Watch over this pure fIower

301
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:24,097
That I have confided to your care

302
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,467
-Watch carefuIIy
-A protecting angeI

303
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,940
-Make sure
-Is with God

304
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:39,711
-That her purity is never stained
-Ah, a guardian angeI

305
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:46,688
-Defend her from the raging winds
-A protecting angeI, a protecting angeI

306
00:34:46,859 --> 00:35:02,901
-That crush other fIowers
-A protecting angeI is with God

307
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:09,036
-For her father
-Ah, a guardian angeI

308
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:11,775
-A protecting angeI is with God
-Ah, woman

309
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:14,249
-A protecting angeI is with God
-Watch over

310
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,255
Ah, woman
Watch over this pure fIower

311
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:21,859
-A protecting angeI is with God
-Ah, woman

312
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,757
-A protecting angeI is with God
-Watch over

313
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:28,764
A protecting angeI is with God
Watching over us in heaven

314
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:32,870
Ah, woman
Watch over this pure fIower

315
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,907
Woman, watch over this pure fIower

316
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:41,274
A protecting angeI is with God

317
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:45,941
Watching over us in heaven

318
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:49,246
Ah, woman
Watch over this pure fIower

319
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:51,982
A protecting angeI is with God

320
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:58,996
Watching over us in heaven

321
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:06,335
-Daughter
-Father

322
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:12,808
-My daughter
-My father

323
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:19,577
Goodbye!

324
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:56,452
Giovanna, I feeI guiIty

325
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,216
Why shouId you?

326
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:05,557
I didn't teII him that a young man
FoIIowed us to church

327
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:11,226
Why teII him? Do you disIike

328
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:15,271
That young man?

329
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:32,086
No, no, he's so handsome
He inspires Iove

330
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:49,097
He seems generous
And a fine gentIeman

331
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:57,341
I wouIdn't want him to be
A gentIeman or a nobIe

332
00:37:57,516 --> 00:38:06,686
I think I'd Iove him more
If he were poor

333
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:24,042
Dreaming or awake
I caII out to him

334
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:31,550
My heart in ecstasy cries out
''I Io--''

335
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,677
My heart in ecstasy cries out
''I Io--''

336
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:38,153
I Iove you!

337
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:43,159
I Iove you
Say those sweet words again

338
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:48,790
Open up to me a paradise of bIiss!

339
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,402
Giovanna?
Giovanna?

340
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,004
Ah, aIas there's no one

341
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,403
To answer me!

342
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:59,976
God! Is no one there?

343
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:05,981
Here, and my heart answers you

344
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:14,081
Ah, two peopIe in Iove
Are a universe to themseIves!

345
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,626
But whoever Iet you in here?

346
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:20,390
AngeI or deviI
What does it matter to you?

347
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,158
-I Iove you
-Go away

348
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:23,801
Go away? Now?

349
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:29,373
Now that we are burning
With the same fire?

350
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:39,179
Ah, beautifuI girI
The god of Iove

351
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:46,917
Has inseparabIy joined
Your fate to mine!

352
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:58,434
Love is the sun of the souI
Love is Iife itseIf

353
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:07,171
Its voice is the beating of our hearts

354
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:14,775
Fame and gIory
Power and position

355
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:24,329
Are nothing but fraiI, human things

356
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:31,425
One thing aIone is divine

357
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:38,065
It is Iove

358
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:43,180
It is Iove which raises us up
To be with the angeIs!

359
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:53,282
So Iet us Iove, my heavenIy girI

360
00:40:53,459 --> 00:41:11,743
On our account
I shaII be the envy of aII men

361
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:17,576
(Ah, these are the tender words
I so Iove

362
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:24,656
Let's Iove each other

363
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:31,955
When I hear them
In my maidenIy dreams!)

364
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:37,728
Let's Iove each other

365
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:45,503
On your account

366
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:57,889
On your account

367
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:03,324
Ah, these are the tender words

368
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:08,956
When I hear them
In my maidenIy dreams

369
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:14,936
Ah, these are the tender words
I so Iove

370
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:21,068
When I hear them
In my maidenIy dreams

371
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:27,984
For you

372
00:42:34,326 --> 00:42:39,923
Oh, yes

373
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:50,199
Oh, yes

374
00:42:51,610 --> 00:43:03,351

TeII me again that you Iove me

376
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:28,543
-You heard me

377
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:32,150
TeII me your name

378
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:34,877
May I not know it?

379
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:37,146
Here is the pIace

380
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:39,950
-I am caIIed...
-Very weII

381
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:45,062
...GuaItier MaIde
I am a student

382
00:43:46,398 --> 00:43:51,335
I am a poor man

383
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:53,762
-I heard steps outside!
-It might be my father

384
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:57,705
(Ah, if I couId get hoId of that traitor
Who interrupts me!)

385
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,344
Show him out by the door
To the ramparts

386
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,106
-Go now
-Say, wiII you Iove me?

-And you?
-For aII my Iife, and then--

388
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,917
No more, no more
Go away

389
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:13,353
No more
Go away

Goodbye, goodbye
You aIone shaII be

(What makes me return? )

429
00:52:52,444 --> 00:52:56,608
Quiet! To work

I can't see anything in this darkness

00:53:45,563 --> 00:53:49,192
We came here for a bit of fun

00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:53,463
We want to carry off Ceprano's wife

His house is there

00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:47,791
The handkerchief
Makes him bIind and deaf

452
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:57,164
Hush, hush
Let's take our revenge

Now in his turn faIIs victim to a jest!

00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,774
SoftIy, softIy
We'II kidnap his Iover

00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:43,211
Now in his turn faIIs victim to a jest!

467
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,407
This man, who aIways sneers
So insoIentIy

468
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:50,884
Now in his turn faIIs victim to a jest!

469
00:55:51,055 --> 00:56:03,024
Hush, hush, hush, hu-- Hush
Quiet, quiet, quiet, qu-- Quiet

470
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:09,902
Let's get down to it
Let's get down to it

471
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:39,894
-HeIp, Father!
-Victory!

472
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:43,336
HeIp me!

473
00:56:43,508 --> 00:56:50,141
Haven't they finished yet?
What fooIery!

474
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:52,647
I've been bIindfoIded!

475
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:32,888
Ah! The curse!

476
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:48,457
She was snatched away from me!

477
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:52,069
And when, O heavens?
During those few moments

478
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:56,172
Before an inner foreboding

479
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:03,212
Made me retrace my steps!

480
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:10,253
The door was open!
And the house deserted!

481
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:19,728
Wherever couId that
Dear angeI be now?

482
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:26,393
The first girI to inspire in my heart

483
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:33,101
The fIame of constant Iove

484
00:59:33,277 --> 00:59:41,241
She who is so pure that
Under her modest gaze

485
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:54,663
I aImost feeI myseIf
Inspired to be virtuous?

486
00:59:54,832 --> 01:00:03,433
She was snatched away from me!
Who wouId have dared?

487
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:13,279
But I shaII have my revenge

488
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:31,234
The tears of my beIoved

489
01:00:31,402 --> 01:00:41,869
Cry out for it

490
01:00:55,493 --> 01:01:02,797
I seem to see the tears

491
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:11,067
FIowing from those eyes

492
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:18,375
When, overcome by doubt and fear

493
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:27,685
As danger suddenIy overcame her

494
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:39,965
She remembered our Iove

495
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:48,408
And caIIed out for her GuaItier

496
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:57,349
He couId not heIp you

497
01:01:57,521 --> 01:02:07,795
Dear beIoved girI

498
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:16,065
He who, with aII his souI

499
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:23,908
Wished to make you happy on earth

500
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:29,615
And aII the crowns

501
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:35,692
And aII the angeIs' crowns

502
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,795
He who, because of you

503
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:45,332
Did not envy the angeIs in heaven

504
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,200
And aII the crowns

505
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:57,439
AII the angeIs' crowns for you
For you

506
01:02:57,615 --> 01:03:07,286
Did not envy the angeIs in heaven

507
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:15,365
For you did not envy

508
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:33,316
For you did not envy

509
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,936
-Your Highness!
-WeII?

510
01:03:54,105 --> 01:03:57,199
RigoIetto's Iover has been kidnapped

511
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,967
What? Where from?

512
01:03:59,143 --> 01:04:00,303
From his house

513
01:04:00,478 --> 01:04:03,345
Ha, ha! TeII me how it happened

514
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:06,483
TeII me how it happened

515
01:04:12,123 --> 01:04:15,923
As we wandered together
In a remote Iane

516
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:19,756
Not Iong after sunset

517
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:23,866
Just as we had expected

518
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:28,027
There appeared to us
A girI of rare beauty

519
01:04:28,205 --> 01:04:31,663
It was RigoIetto's Iover

520
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:35,972
And she disappeared
As soon as we saw her

521
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:39,844
We were aIready pIanning
To carry her off

522
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:43,748
When the jester
SuddenIy came among us

523
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:47,880
And Iike a fooI
He beIieved that we meant

524
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:51,653
To kidnap Countess Ceprano

525
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:55,629
HeId steady the Iadder
We had prepared

526
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,167
Then we bIindfoIded him
And he himseIf

527
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:01,566
HeId steady the Iadder
We had prepared

528
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:04,037
Then we bIindfoIded him
And he himseIf

529
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:08,201
Up we cIimbed and quickIy managed

530
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:12,372
-To carry the girI off with us
-Heavens!

531
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,677
When he discovered
Our revenge on him

532
01:05:14,852 --> 01:05:18,913
(It's her, my beIoved!)

533
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:24,026
He couId onIy curse in vain
He couId onIy curse in vain

534
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:27,358
He couId onIy curse in vain

535
01:05:27,531 --> 01:05:32,127
He couId onIy curse in vain
He couId onIy curse in vain

536
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:35,236
He couId onIy curse in vain

537
01:05:35,406 --> 01:05:47,944
Curse in vain, curse in vain
He couId onIy curse in vain

538
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,312
Where is the poor girI now?

539
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,584
We ourseIves brought her here

540
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:02,559
(Ah, heaven has not deprived me
Of everything!)

541
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:26,453
Mighty Love is caIIing me
I must fIy to her

542
01:06:26,624 --> 01:06:41,801
I wouId give my crown
To consoIe her heart

543
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:45,806
Ah, Iet her at Iast Iearn who Ioves her

544
01:06:45,976 --> 01:06:49,639
Let her at Iast know who I am

545
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:52,680
And Iearn that even upon thrones

546
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:56,513
Love has his sIaves

547
01:06:56,687 --> 01:07:03,115
And Iearn that even upon thrones

548
01:07:03,294 --> 01:07:09,927
Love has his sIaves

549
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,797
Oh, what thoughts are troubIing him?
How his mood has changed!

550
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:18,704
Love has his sIaves

551
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,777
Oh, what thoughts are troubIing him?
How his mood has changed!

552
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:27,680
Love has his sIaves

553
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:33,812
-How his mood had changed!
-Love has his sIaves

554
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:39,258
Love!

555
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:18,991
Poor RigoIetto!

556
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:33,243
He's coming, quiet!

557
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:36,715
Oh, good morning, RigoIetto

558
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:41,324
(They were aII invoIved in it!)

559
01:08:41,925 --> 01:08:48,888
What's new, jester?

560
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:55,835
Just that you are duIIer than usuaI

561
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,701
Ha, ha, ha!

562
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:08,718
(Where couId they
Have conceaIed her? )

563
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:12,882
(See how worried he is!)

564
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:29,197
Yes, see how worried he is!

565
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:35,539
I'm gIad that you weren't harmed

566
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:41,384
By the night air tonight

567
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:47,491
-Tonight!
-Yes, ah, it was a good jest!

568
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,182
But I sIept aII Iast night!

569
01:09:50,894 --> 01:09:58,300
Ah, you sIept!

570
01:09:58,936 --> 01:10:06,274
I must have dreamed it, then!

571
01:10:13,984 --> 01:10:20,947
(See how he Iooks at everything!)

572
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:24,183
(It isn't hers)

573
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:37,731
-Is the duke stiII asIeep?
-Yes, he's stiII sIeeping

574
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:41,435
The duchess wishes to speak
With her husband

575
01:10:41,645 --> 01:10:43,203
He's asIeep

576
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:46,143
Wasn't he with you a moment ago?

577
01:10:46,316 --> 01:10:48,409
He's gone hunting

578
01:10:48,652 --> 01:10:50,847
Without attendants?
Without weapons?

579
01:10:51,021 --> 01:10:54,855
Can't you understand that
For the moment he can see no one?

580
01:10:55,025 --> 01:11:00,088
Ah! So she's here!
She's with the duke!

581
01:11:00,264 --> 01:11:03,927
-Who?
-The girI you kidnapped

582
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:07,867
From my house Iast night

583
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:11,336
But I'II get her back!
She's in there!

584
01:11:11,508 --> 01:11:14,671
If you've Iost your Iover
Look for her somewhere eIse

585
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:17,643
I want my daughter!

586
01:11:18,115 --> 01:11:20,675
His daughter!

587
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:27,017
Yes, my daughter! What a victory!

588
01:11:27,357 --> 01:11:30,258
What? Aren't you Iaughing over it?

589
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,726
She's there
I want her, give her back

590
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:51,712
Courtiers, you damned breed
Of cowards

591
01:11:51,882 --> 01:11:57,912
What price did you get
For my treasure?

592
01:11:58,155 --> 01:12:03,957
You wouId do anything for goId
Open!

593
01:12:04,127 --> 01:12:11,295
But my daughter
Is a jeweI beyond price

594
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:17,370
Give her back!
Oh, even if I am unarmed

595
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:24,003
I wiII stain my hands with your bIood

596
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:30,983
Nothing on earth
Can frighten the man

597
01:12:31,188 --> 01:12:37,957
Who is defending
His daughter's honor

598
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:42,326
Open that door, you murderers
You murderers!

599
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,328
Open that door, that door
You murderers

600
01:12:46,503 --> 01:12:50,030
Open!

601
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:04,153
Ah! You are aII against me

602
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:07,415
AII against me!

603
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:14,954
Ah! Look, I'm weeping

604
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:20,564
MaruIIo, my Iord

605
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:28,405
You are good-natured
You have a kind heart

606
01:13:28,578 --> 01:13:35,074
TeII me where they have hidden her

607
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:39,211
MaruIIo, my Iord

608
01:13:39,389 --> 01:13:42,552
TeII me where they have hidden her

609
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:46,992
She's in there, isn't she?
She's in there, isn't she?

610
01:13:47,164 --> 01:13:51,362
She's in there, isn't she?

611
01:13:52,002 --> 01:14:02,776
You don't answer, aIas!

612
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:14,250
My Iords, forgive me
Have pity

613
01:14:14,424 --> 01:14:23,628
Give an oId man back his daughter

614
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:32,139
To give her back
WouId cost you nothing

615
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:38,011
WouId cost you nothing

616
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:47,749
My daughter means everything
In the worId to me

617
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:58,496
My Iords, forgive me, have pity

618
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:03,571
Give me back my daughter

619
01:15:03,907 --> 01:15:11,473
My daughter means everything
In the worId to me

620
01:15:11,648 --> 01:15:25,392
Give me back my daughter
My daughter means

621
01:15:27,297 --> 01:15:33,566
Everything in the worId to me

622
01:15:34,938 --> 01:15:47,612
Have pity
Pity, my Iords, pity

623
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:58,692
Pity

624
01:16:17,414 --> 01:16:22,545
-Father!
-O God! My GiIda!

625
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:32,090
My Iords, she is aII the famiIy I have

626
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:37,832
Don't be afraid anymore, my angeI

627
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:42,497
It was onIy a joke, wasn't it?

628
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:46,768
I even wept, but I can Iaugh at it now

629
01:16:46,943 --> 01:16:48,877
So why are you weeping?

630
01:16:49,713 --> 01:16:55,743
-Father, the shame!
-Heavens, what are you saying?

631
01:16:55,919 --> 01:17:01,551
I can onIy teII my shame
If I am aIone with you

632
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:07,195
Get out of here, aII of you!

633
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:13,232
If that duke of yours
Dares to approach

634
01:17:13,403 --> 01:17:26,908
TeII him not to come in
For I am here!

635
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,643
It's often best to pretend

636
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:33,152
With chiIdren and madmen

637
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:35,814
We'II Ieave, but we'II keep watching

638
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:39,792
What he gets up to

639
01:17:51,174 --> 01:17:59,582
Speak now, we're aIone

640
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:12,656
(Heaven gives me the courage!)

641
01:18:54,638 --> 01:19:02,044
Every Sunday in church

642
01:19:02,212 --> 01:19:08,845
WhiIe I was praying to the Lord

643
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:17,154
My eyes feII upon

644
01:19:17,327 --> 01:19:23,926
A fataIIy handsome young man

645
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:31,336
Even if our Iips were siIent

646
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:44,444
Our eyes spoke the Ianguage
Of our hearts

647
01:19:56,966 --> 01:20:04,065
Yesterday for the first time

648
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:11,976
He came to see me secretIy
After dark

649
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:19,748
He toId me so movingIy

650
01:20:19,923 --> 01:20:26,726
How he was a student, a poor man

651
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:33,802
And with burning emotion

652
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:43,435
He spoke of his Iove for me

653
01:20:44,247 --> 01:20:56,819
He went away
My heart opened up

654
01:20:57,026 --> 01:21:03,898
To hopes of happiness

655
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:09,266
When there suddenIy appeared

656
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,706
Those men who abducted me

657
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:22,649
And forcibIy brought me here

658
01:21:22,852 --> 01:21:39,327
I was so horribIy afraid

659
01:21:39,502 --> 01:21:46,169
Ah!
It was for myseIf aIone

660
01:21:46,576 --> 01:21:51,673
That I asked for infamy, O God

661
01:21:51,848 --> 01:21:57,218
So that she couId rise as high

662
01:21:57,387 --> 01:22:02,950
As I had faIIen Iow

663
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:09,031
Ah, we needed to have an aItar

664
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:14,637
Beside the gaIIows!

665
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:19,241
But now aII is Iost

666
01:22:19,409 --> 01:22:22,344
And the aItar is overthrown!

667
01:22:22,512 --> 01:22:28,815
But now aII is Iost
And the aItar is overthrown!

668
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:37,124
Ah, weep, my chiId

669
01:22:37,293 --> 01:22:49,899
-Ah, weep, my chiId, weep, my chiId
-Father

670
01:22:50,340 --> 01:23:02,980
Let your tears faII upon my heart

671
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:08,988
Father, you speak to me Iike

672
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:12,150
A consoIing angeI

673
01:23:12,328 --> 01:23:16,526
-Ah, weep, my chiId
-Father, you speak

674
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:29,237
Ah, weep, my chiId
Weep, my chiId

675
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:34,941
-Let your tears
-Father, you speak

676
01:23:35,118 --> 01:23:44,959
Let your tears faII upon my heart

677
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:54,059
Weep, weep, weep

678
01:23:54,237 --> 01:24:02,838
Let your tears faII upon my heart

679
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:14,252
Weep, weep, weep

680
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:22,388
Let your tears faII upon my heart

681
01:24:22,565 --> 01:24:33,134
-Let your tears faII upon my heart
-ConsoIing angeI

682
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:40,806
-Ah, ah, upon my heart
-Ah, consoIing

683
01:24:40,984 --> 01:24:54,022
-Ah, Iet your tears
-Father, you speak to me

684
01:24:54,197 --> 01:25:03,799
-Daughter, my daughter
-An angeI, an angeI

685
01:25:04,007 --> 01:25:19,150
-Upon my heart
-ConsoIing

686
01:25:33,136 --> 01:25:38,733
When I have done
What remains to be done

687
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:43,538
We can go away
From this wicked pIace

688
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:44,737
Yes

689
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:53,947
(A singIe day
CouId change everything!)

690
01:25:55,391 --> 01:26:05,528
Open up
Monterone is to be cast into prison

691
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:14,700
Since my curse on you was in vain

692
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:22,841
And no thunderboIt or sword
Has pierced your heart

693
01:26:23,019 --> 01:26:31,757
Live on, duke, Iive on happiIy

694
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:31,961
No, oId man, you are wrong
You shaII be avenged

695
01:26:31,961 --> 01:26:41,097
No, oId man, you are wrong
You shaII be avenged

696
01:26:41,304 --> 01:26:47,209
Yes, revenge, a terribIe revenge

697
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:53,281
Is aII my heart desires

698
01:26:53,449 --> 01:26:59,285
The deadIy hour of your punishment

699
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:05,291
Is fast approaching Iike thunder

700
01:27:05,461 --> 01:27:12,094
Like a thunderboIt hurIed by God

701
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:17,603
Like a thunderboIt hurIed by God

702
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:23,770
The jester shaII strike you down

703
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:30,112
Father, what wiId joy

704
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:35,451
-I see fIashing from your eyes!
-Revenge

705
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:41,621
Forgive him, as upon us too

706
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:47,327
-Forgiveness wiII faII from heaven
-Revenge

707
01:27:47,503 --> 01:27:50,631
-Forgive him!
-No!

708
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,468
-Forgive him!
-No!

709
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:59,137
(He betrayed me, and yet I Iove him
Dear God

710
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:05,276
I beg for mercy for the deceiver!)

711
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:10,323
Like a thunderboIt hurIed by God

712
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:15,396
The jester shaII strike you down

713
01:28:15,565 --> 01:28:19,661
The jester shaII strike you down

714
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:24,569
The jester shaII strike you down
Yes, yes

715
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:31,543
-Forgive him, forgive him, forgive him
-The jester shaII strike...

716
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:37,516
...you down!

717
01:30:08,844 --> 01:30:13,304
-So you Iove him?
-Forever

718
01:30:13,482 --> 01:30:18,317
I aIIowed you enough time
To get over it

719
01:30:18,487 --> 01:30:20,819
I Iove him

720
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:25,222
FraiI woman's heart!

721
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:30,157
Ah, the viIe wretch!

722
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:35,093
But you wiII be avenged, GiIda

723
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:39,298
Be mercifuI, Father

724
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:45,111
And if you were certain
That he'd betray you

725
01:30:45,281 --> 01:30:49,513
WouId you stiII Iove him?

726
01:30:49,685 --> 01:30:59,026
I don't know, but he Ioves me too

727
01:30:59,195 --> 01:31:01,891
-Him?
-Yes

728
01:31:02,064 --> 01:31:07,502
Very weII, watch what happens

729
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:19,242
-I can see a man
-Wait a IittIe

730
01:31:20,983 --> 01:31:23,747
Ah, Father!

731
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:26,820
-Two things straightaway
-What?

732
01:31:26,989 --> 01:31:30,948
Your sister and some wine

733
01:31:31,127 --> 01:31:35,188
(That's his way!)

734
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:41,060
(Oh, what a fine young dandy!)

735
01:31:55,051 --> 01:32:00,114
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

736
01:32:00,289 --> 01:32:04,988
They're aIways changing their words
And their minds

737
01:32:05,161 --> 01:32:10,224
They bear a Ioving, pretty face

738
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:14,961
But it's deceitfuI
Whether weeping or smiIing

739
01:32:15,304 --> 01:32:19,968
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

740
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:28,311
They're aIways changing their words

741
01:32:30,619 --> 01:32:42,588
And their minds, and their minds

742
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:58,672
Anyone who trusts them
Is aIways unhappy

743
01:32:58,848 --> 01:33:03,945
Anyone who confides in them
Has a fooIish heart

744
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:08,682
And yet a man can never
Be entireIy happy

745
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:14,023
Without drinking deep of Iove
On their breasts!

746
01:33:14,196 --> 01:33:18,860
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

747
01:33:19,034 --> 01:33:31,640
They're aIways changing their words

748
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:38,718
And their minds

749
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:54,430
And their minds

750
01:34:28,804 --> 01:34:35,937
That's your man
ShaII he Iive or die?

751
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:44,450
I'II come back Iater
To settIe the business

752
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:52,518
I weII remember how one day

753
01:34:52,695 --> 01:34:56,187
I met you, you pretty girI

754
01:34:56,365 --> 01:34:59,801
I took pIeasure in asking you

755
01:34:59,969 --> 01:35:03,097
And discovered you Iived here

756
01:35:03,272 --> 01:35:06,571
You must know that since then

757
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,370
My heart has Ioved you aIone

758
01:35:09,545 --> 01:35:10,534
(ViIIain!)

759
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,579
Ha, ha! And perhaps it's forgotten

760
01:35:13,782 --> 01:35:16,342
About a score of others?

761
01:35:16,518 --> 01:35:19,214
The young gentIeman
Looks Iike a true rake!

762
01:35:19,388 --> 01:35:23,586
-Yes, I'm a monster!
-Leave me aIone, you idiot!

763
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:27,024
-Oh, what a fuss!
-Don't be siIIy!

764
01:35:27,196 --> 01:35:33,897
And you behave yourseIf
Don't make such a scene

765
01:35:34,436 --> 01:35:39,271
Being sensibIe means

766
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:45,903
Surrendering to happiness and Iove

767
01:35:47,383 --> 01:35:49,874
What a fair white hand!

768
01:35:50,052 --> 01:35:53,385
You're joking, my Iord

769
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:55,279
-No, no
-I'm ugIy

770
01:35:55,457 --> 01:35:57,220
-Embrace me
-(ViIIain!)

771
01:35:57,559 --> 01:35:59,754
-You're drunk!
-With burning Iove

772
01:35:59,928 --> 01:36:05,161
-Sir, do you enjoy making fun of me?
-No, no, I wish to marry you

773
01:36:05,334 --> 01:36:07,393
I want your word on it

774
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:09,662
You sweet thing!

775
01:36:09,838 --> 01:36:17,210
-Isn't that enough for you?
-Wicked traitor!

776
01:36:17,379 --> 01:36:22,373
I want your word on it
I want your word on it

777
01:36:22,584 --> 01:36:29,990
Fair daughter of Iove

778
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:37,190
I am ensIaved by your charms

779
01:36:37,366 --> 01:36:45,102
With a singIe word you couId

780
01:36:45,274 --> 01:36:51,577
ConsoIe me for my suffering

781
01:36:53,415 --> 01:37:00,878
Come and feeI how swiftIy

782
01:37:01,056 --> 01:37:11,694
My heart is beating

783
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:18,966
With a singIe word, you couId

784
01:37:19,141 --> 01:37:24,977
ConsoIe me for my suffering

785
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:28,878
Ha, ha! I can Iaugh with aII my heart
Because such fIattery costs IittIe

786
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:32,680
Ah, that's how he spoke

787
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:36,518
I know perfectIy weII, beIieve me
What your words are worth

788
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:39,525
To me of Iove, the wretch!

789
01:37:39,695 --> 01:37:43,859
Be quiet, crying wiII not heIp

790
01:37:44,032 --> 01:37:48,162
Handsome sir, I'm quite used

791
01:37:48,337 --> 01:37:54,867
Be quiet, crying wiII not heIp

792
01:37:55,043 --> 01:38:10,118
You couId consoIe me
For my suffering

793
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:15,821
Fair daughter of Iove

794
01:38:15,998 --> 01:38:29,344
You are convinced now
That he was Iying

795
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:38,010
You couId consoIe me
For my suffering

796
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:45,820
Ha, ha! I can Iaugh
Ha, ha! I can Iaugh

797
01:38:46,028 --> 01:39:01,843
Betrayed, unhappy heart
Do not break with grief

798
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,341
No, no

799
01:39:03,512 --> 01:39:10,247
I shaII strike him down!
I shaII strike him down!

800
01:39:10,419 --> 01:39:17,086
Betrayed, unhappy heart
Do not break with grief

801
01:39:17,259 --> 01:39:25,689
Be quiet, and I shaII make sure
That vengeance is carried out

802
01:39:25,868 --> 01:39:33,968
Betrayed, unhappy heart
Do not break with grief

803
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:35,609
No, no

804
01:39:35,777 --> 01:39:42,876
I shaII strike him down!
I shaII strike him down!

805
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:51,686
FeeI how swiftIy my heart is beating

806
01:39:51,860 --> 01:40:00,666
Be quiet, and I shaII make sure
That vengeance is carried out

807
01:40:00,836 --> 01:40:07,435
I know perfectIy weII, beIieve me

808
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:17,644
What your words are worth

809
01:40:47,849 --> 01:40:51,182
Listen to me! Go home

810
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:54,516
Take money and a horse

811
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:57,284
Put on the man's cIothing
I Ieft for you

812
01:40:57,459 --> 01:40:58,926
Set out for Verona

813
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:01,289
I shaII join you there tomorrow

814
01:41:01,463 --> 01:41:03,260
-Come now
-I cannot

815
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:07,027
-I'm trembIing
-Go

816
01:41:24,086 --> 01:41:26,850
Twenty scudi, did you say?

817
01:41:27,022 --> 01:41:29,286
Here are 1 0

818
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:33,053
And the rest
When you've finished the job

819
01:41:33,428 --> 01:41:35,726
-Is he going to stay here?
-Yes

820
01:41:35,897 --> 01:41:38,092
I'II come back at midnight

821
01:41:38,266 --> 01:41:42,225
No need to
I can throw him in the river on my own

822
01:41:42,404 --> 01:41:45,771
No, no, I want to do it myseIf

823
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:49,138
AII right
What's his name?

824
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:54,180
You want to know mine as weII?

825
01:41:54,349 --> 01:42:07,524
He is Crime, I am Punishment

826
01:42:10,265 --> 01:42:13,359
The storm is getting near!

827
01:42:13,535 --> 01:42:23,137
The night wiII be darker

828
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:27,141
MaddaIena?

829
01:42:27,315 --> 01:42:29,840
Wait....
My brother is coming

830
01:42:30,018 --> 01:42:34,284
-What does that matter?
-It's thundering!

831
01:42:35,924 --> 01:42:38,552
The rain's coming soon

832
01:42:38,727 --> 01:42:41,890
AII the better!
You can sIeep in the stabIe

833
01:42:42,064 --> 01:42:45,329
Or in heII
Wherever you want

834
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:48,196
-Oh, thank you
-Ah, no! Go away

835
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:53,740
-In this weather?
-It's 20 goId scudi

836
01:42:53,909 --> 01:42:57,504
I'd be happy to offer you my room

837
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:03,675
If you Iike, we can go and see it now

838
01:43:03,852 --> 01:43:12,954
AII right, I'II come with you
Come on, Iet's see

839
01:43:26,475 --> 01:43:37,943
Poor young man!
He's so good-Iooking!

840
01:43:40,155 --> 01:43:44,615
God! What a dreadfuI night!

841
01:43:44,793 --> 01:43:48,559
We sIeep in the open?
AII right, very weII

842
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,527
Good night

843
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:58,970
God protect you, sir!

844
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:17,758
I'II sIeep for a whiIe, I'm tired

845
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:24,088
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

846
01:44:24,266 --> 01:44:30,535
They're aIways changing
Their words and their minds

847
01:44:35,277 --> 01:44:41,238
They're aIways changing
Their words and their minds

848
01:44:43,185 --> 01:44:59,057
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

849
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:14,872
They're aIways changing their minds

850
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:18,042
He's reaIIy nice, that young man

851
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,950
Thanks to him we'II make 20 scudi

852
01:45:21,122 --> 01:45:25,889
OnIy 20! That's not much
He's worth more than that

853
01:45:26,061 --> 01:45:32,694
If he's asIeep
Go and fetch me down his sword

854
01:45:47,649 --> 01:45:50,083
Ah, I can't think straight anymore!

855
01:45:50,252 --> 01:45:53,050
Love draws me here
Father, forgive me!

856
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:59,417
What a fearsome night!

857
01:45:59,594 --> 01:46:02,620
Dear God, what is going to happen?

858
01:46:02,797 --> 01:46:05,027
-Brother?
-Who's speaking?

859
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:09,159
Go to heII!

860
01:46:09,704 --> 01:46:15,301
He Iooks Iike ApoIIo, that young man
I Iove him

861
01:46:15,477 --> 01:46:18,537
He Ioves me
Leave him in peace

862
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:21,841
-Let's not kiII him
-O heavens!

863
01:46:22,017 --> 01:46:23,746
-Mend that sack!
-Why?

864
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:26,353
I've got to use that sack
To throw your ApoIIo

865
01:46:26,521 --> 01:46:28,682
Into the river after I've cut his throat

866
01:46:28,857 --> 01:46:33,851
I'm staring into heII!

867
01:46:35,664 --> 01:46:40,363
But I bet you can keep the money

868
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:45,768
-And spare his Iife
-That's hard to beIieve

869
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:51,777
Listen to me
I'II teII you a simpIe pIan

870
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:56,714
You've aIready had 1 0 scudi
From the hunchback

871
01:46:56,885 --> 01:47:00,821
You'II see him when
He comes back Iater with the rest

872
01:47:00,989 --> 01:47:06,222
-KiII him, you'II have aII 20
-What am I hearing! My father!

873
01:47:06,394 --> 01:47:12,094
That way you'II enjoy aII your money

874
01:47:12,267 --> 01:47:16,829
KiII that hunchback!
What the deviI do you mean?

875
01:47:17,005 --> 01:47:22,033
Do you take me for a thief?
For a bandit?

876
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:26,510
Have I ever betrayed a customer?

877
01:47:26,681 --> 01:47:31,015
That man's paying me
I'II keep my word to him

878
01:47:31,186 --> 01:47:33,416
-Ah, have mercy on him!
-He's got to die

879
01:47:33,588 --> 01:47:36,079
-I'II warn him to get away
-Oh, she's a good girI!

880
01:47:36,257 --> 01:47:38,350
-We'II Iose the money
-Let me get on with it

881
01:47:38,526 --> 01:47:40,721
We've got to save him
We've got to save him

882
01:47:40,895 --> 01:47:44,160
If anyone eIse comes here
Before midnight strikes

883
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:45,765
He can die in his pIace

884
01:47:45,934 --> 01:47:50,166
The night is dark, the sky is too stormy
For anyone to come by at this hour

885
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:53,102
Oh, what a temptation!
To die for this deceiver?

886
01:47:53,274 --> 01:47:55,936
To die! And my father!
O heaven, have mercy!

887
01:47:56,111 --> 01:48:01,048
If anyone eIse comes here
Before midnight strikes

888
01:48:01,216 --> 01:48:05,175
He can die in his pIace

889
01:48:05,353 --> 01:48:09,551
If anyone eIse comes here
Before midnight strikes

890
01:48:09,724 --> 01:48:13,888
He can die in his pIace

891
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,942
-StiII haIf an hour Ieft
-Wait, brother

892
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:33,977
What! That woman is weeping!
And I am not heIping him!

893
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:37,017
Ah, evening he scorned my Iove

894
01:48:37,185 --> 01:48:41,588
I'II Iay down my own Iife for him

895
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:45,559
-Did someone knock?
-It was the wind

896
01:48:46,795 --> 01:48:49,593
-Someone's knocking, I toId you
-Strange! Who's there?

897
01:48:49,764 --> 01:48:57,102
Have pity on a beggar
Give him sheIter for the night

898
01:48:57,272 --> 01:49:01,140
-It wiII be a Iong night!
-Wait a moment

899
01:49:02,177 --> 01:49:04,202
Come on, hurry up
Get it over with quickIy

900
01:49:04,379 --> 01:49:06,904
I'm Ionging to save one Iife
At the expense of another

901
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:09,175
AII right, I'm ready, open that door

902
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:11,318
I'm more interested
In saving that money

903
01:49:11,486 --> 01:49:13,511
Ah! Near to death, and I am so young!

904
01:49:13,688 --> 01:49:16,589
Heaven, I ask forgiveness
For these criminaIs!

905
01:49:16,758 --> 01:49:21,559
Father, forgive your
Unhappy daughter!

906
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:25,861
Let the man I am saving
Live in happiness

907
01:49:26,034 --> 01:49:35,136
Forgive me, forgive me
Father!

908
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:41,146
Forgive me!

909
01:49:56,131 --> 01:49:58,463
-Hurry up!
-Open!

910
01:49:58,633 --> 01:49:59,793
Come in!

911
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:09,138
(God forgive them!)

912
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:32,255
The moment of vengeance
Has come at Iast!

913
01:51:32,427 --> 01:51:36,557
I've waited for it for a month

914
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:42,692
Weeping hot tears of bIood

915
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:49,366
And dressed as a jester

916
01:51:49,544 --> 01:51:54,538
This is the door
It's cIosed!

917
01:51:54,716 --> 01:52:01,713
Ah, it's not time yet
I'II wait

918
01:52:05,693 --> 01:52:11,097
What a fatefuI night!

919
01:52:11,266 --> 01:52:15,930
A storm in heaven

920
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:22,043
On earth a murder!

921
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:34,953
Oh, how powerfuI I feeI now!

922
01:52:45,066 --> 01:52:46,328
Midnight!

923
01:52:46,501 --> 01:52:49,698
-Who's there?
-It's me

924
01:52:49,871 --> 01:52:55,935
Stay there
Your man's in here, dead

925
01:52:56,110 --> 01:53:00,137
-What joy! Give me some Iight!
-Light? No, the money

926
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:03,045
QuickIy, into the river with him

927
01:53:03,217 --> 01:53:06,277
No, I can do it myseIf

928
01:53:06,454 --> 01:53:10,584
As you Iike
This isn't the best pIace for it

929
01:53:10,758 --> 01:53:13,454
It's deeper further aIong

930
01:53:13,628 --> 01:53:17,291
Hurry, don't Iet anyone see you

931
01:53:17,465 --> 01:53:25,839
Good night

932
01:53:29,644 --> 01:53:34,343
There he is! Dead!

933
01:53:34,515 --> 01:53:38,144
Oh, yes, I want to see him!

934
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,550
But what does it matter?
Of course it's him

935
01:53:41,723 --> 01:53:44,886
Here are his spurs!

936
01:53:45,059 --> 01:53:50,725
Look at me now, O worId!

937
01:53:50,898 --> 01:53:59,499
Here is the jester
And here is the prince!

938
01:53:59,674 --> 01:54:04,634
He Iies beneath my feet!

939
01:54:04,812 --> 01:54:14,744
It's him! What joy!

940
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:22,419
The time has come!
Vengeance for aII your sufferings!

941
01:54:22,597 --> 01:54:27,728
The water wiII be his grave

942
01:54:27,902 --> 01:54:36,833
A sack and his sheet

943
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:48,821
Into the river! Into the river!

944
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:54,986
Women are as fickIe
As a feather in the wind

945
01:54:55,163 --> 01:54:59,827
They're aIways changing
Their words and their minds

946
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:01,263
That voice!

947
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:06,567
They bear a Ioving, pretty face

948
01:55:06,741 --> 01:55:09,835
But it's deceitfuI
Whether weeping or smiIing

949
01:55:10,011 --> 01:55:12,809
It's some specter of the night!

950
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:15,676
Women are as fickIe

951
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:18,580
-As a feather in the wind
-No! No!

952
01:55:18,753 --> 01:55:26,319
They're aIways changing
Their words and their minds

953
01:55:26,494 --> 01:55:29,725
He's here, curse it!

954
01:55:29,897 --> 01:55:32,263
You there
You deviI from heII!

955
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:39,601
They're aIways changing

956
01:55:39,774 --> 01:55:52,881
Their words and their minds

957
01:55:57,124 --> 01:56:03,586
Who is it
Who's here in his pIace?

958
01:56:04,465 --> 01:56:13,703
I'm trembIing
It's a human body!

959
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:20,804
My daughter!
God! My daughter!

960
01:56:22,483 --> 01:56:30,288
Ah, no, it's not possibIe!
She's on her way to Verona!

961
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:35,361
It's iIIusion!

962
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:39,694
It's her! O my GiIda

963
01:56:39,867 --> 01:56:42,995
Daughter, answer me!

964
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:47,470
TeII me who did this

965
01:56:47,642 --> 01:56:49,974
You there!

966
01:56:52,713 --> 01:56:56,945
No one? No one!
My daughter?

967
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,315
My GiIda? O my daughter!

968
01:57:00,488 --> 01:57:03,184
Who is caIIing me?

969
01:57:03,357 --> 01:57:10,286
She's speaking! She's moving!
She's aIive! O God!

970
01:57:10,464 --> 01:57:16,403
Ah, my onIy treasure on earth

971
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:22,168
Look at me
Do you recognize me?

972
01:57:22,343 --> 01:57:24,573
Ah, my father!

973
01:57:24,745 --> 01:57:30,809
What is this mystery! What happened?
Are you wounded?

974
01:57:30,985 --> 01:57:32,009
TeII me!

975
01:57:32,186 --> 01:57:36,350
The weapon

976
01:57:36,524 --> 01:57:43,555
Pierced me here

977
01:57:43,731 --> 01:57:52,366
Who did this to you?

978
01:57:58,112 --> 01:58:08,113
I deceived you
It was my fauIt

979
01:58:08,756 --> 01:58:21,430
I Ioved him too much
Now I'm dying for him!

980
01:58:21,602 --> 01:58:30,032
(God of vengeance!
She herseIf has been

981
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:38,812
Struck down by the bIow
Of my just revenge!)

982
01:58:38,986 --> 01:58:46,483
BeIoved angeI
Look at me, hear me!
