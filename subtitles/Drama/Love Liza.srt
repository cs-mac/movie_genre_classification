Prescription-drug discount
cards for seniors, the high cards...

3
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,150
... in the president's hand in
proposals to revamp Medicare.

4
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,491
KFK correspondent
Peter McFadden has details.

5
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,998
The president and his congressional
allies today met on Capitol Hill....

6
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,664
-Dude, you can't leave that open.
-What?

7
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,439
Well, if you put the icon here
I could just come in the other way.

8
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,544
No, you can't.

9
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,203
-Tell him.
-The media links can't tile like that.

10
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,341
-They won't move without a T1.
-These fuckers built planes, Wilson.

11
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,081
-You still need a T1.
-Wilson, pick up line four.

12
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,354
-Hello?
-Mr. Joel? This is Evan Blackbird...

13
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,227
...from the Obituaries Department
at the Eastern Hills Journal.

14
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,427
-I'm so sorry to hear about your wife.
-Yeah.

15
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,835
I'm writing a few things down here...

16
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,067
...and as to the cause of death...

17
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,838
...did you want us to list
that she took her own life...

18
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,575
...or would you prefer
we leave that unmentioned?

19
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,168
You wrote me a note.

20
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,131
God!

21
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,568
You don't want to sleep
in my house?

22
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,732
I wanna sleep in my house.

23
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,428
Wrote me a note.

24
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,293
Your daughter wrote me a note.

25
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,535
No.

26
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,355
I knew he had called
and ordered the tuxedo...

27
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,263
...because I found him
two and a half hours later...

28
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,734
...completely passed out
on the couch...

29
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:30,035
...with Joanne's contract
right next to his laptop.

30
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,075
I'm not telling you to take time off.

31
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,245
I'm asking you
if you think it's a good idea.

32
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,880
-So you've been here before?
-Yeah. I was here on my honeymoon.

33
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,885
You know, maybe it's the sand.

34
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,650
I think it has something to do
with the granule size.

35
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,794
Right. What's a granule?

36
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,528
-The sand. You know, the little....
-Right. Right.

37
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,566
-The little sand things.
-Yeah.

38
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,103
Yeah.

39
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:46,142
-I came down here by myself.
-You should hang out with us then.

40
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,280
-Who'd you guys come down with?
-It's just us.

41
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,311
Great.

42
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,617
I'm sure you need a breather
after opening her letter...

43
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,998
...I just assumed. So....

44
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,693
I found one of those little cards
she used to make.

45
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,863
You remember those cards
she would make?

46
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,438
So where are you?

47
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,944
I miss you.

48
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,771
Lynne really wants to get you
over for dinner. Okay, buddy?

No. Thanks.

56
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,745
What are you doing with the pump?

57
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,216
Please come inside.

58
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,851
Hey.

59
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,926
I'm sorry.

60
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,190
I ran out of gas, and--

61
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,765
-I thought you drove up in that car.
-I did.

62
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,632
-I have two. One's back at the house.
-Okay.

63
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:05,266
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. What can I do for you?

64
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,645
-Can I get that?
-Sure.

65
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,878
-Yeah?
-It's 3 bucks.

66
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,354
-How much does it take?
-Two gallons, 12 ounces.

67
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,121
Two gallons, 12....

68
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,059
-Three on five?
-Sure.

69
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,496
-Okay.
-All right. Great. Have a nice night.

70
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,363
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

71
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,915
Hey, Wilson. How was your trip?

72
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,720
-lt was great.
-Do you smell gas?

73
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,055
No, do you?

74
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,832
Oh, my God, there he is. Wilson!

75
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,036
Tom Bailey, this is Wilson Joel.

76
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,731
-Wilson, how are you?
-Nice to meet you.

77
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,206
Sorry....

78
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,639
-God, were you at a meeting?
-Yeah. But you didn't miss a thing.

79
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,577
Tom's really mad.

80
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,117
Listen, I want you to know something.

81
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,620
I will do anything
to get you through this.

82
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,818
And that's a great shirt.

83
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,857
Really? Thanks.

84
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,426
Hey, Jordan.

85
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,631
-You make one yet?
-Yeah.

86
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,133
So we're finally getting you
over for dinner tonight, right?

87
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,168
Maura.

88
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,304
-Maura.
-Hey.

89
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,564
Hey.

90
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,139
I was nearby, and
I just thought I'd stop by...

91
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,743
...and tell you how much
Tom Bailey liked you.

92
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,141
Yeah? He's a good one.

93
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,942
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Are you okay?

94
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,415
Okay?

95
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,816
-You look upset.
-I am upset.

96
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,819
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, I've been crying.

97
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,484
-I wish I could do something.
-No....

98
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,257
-Hey, so Tom Bailey.... Yeah?
-Yeah. He's really excited.

99
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,166
-Do you smell gas?
-No.

100
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,207
-I've been crying.
-I know, but it really smells like gas.

101
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,574
-I have planes.
-Planes?

102
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,910
-Yeah, toy planes.
-I didn't know you did that.

103
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,654
You know, they say, "Get a hobby."

104
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,763
Well, good night.

105
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,531
You know, just...

106
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,569
-...be careful.
-They're not big.

107
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:38,036
-No, no, no. But the fumes....
-It's okay. They're models.

108
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,033
Right.

109
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,987
-Hello?
-This Wilson?

110
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,688
-Yeah, it is. Who's this?
-Denny.

111
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,630
-Danny?
-Your boss Maura's brother-in-law.

112
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,299
Hey.

113
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:18,171
She said you're out in the dumps,
and you're into remote control.

114
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,573
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Let's get together tomorrow.

115
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,681
I live right over there.
I'd like to see your plane.

116
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,409
-Okay, sure.
-Six o'clock?

117
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,077
-Sure. Sure. Six o'clock.
-Okay, 6 on the dot.

118
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,450
Okay.

119
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,067
I don't think he understood
what he was looking at, but....

120
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,266
-He didn't like the mockup?
-No, Tom Bailey is in, definitely.

121
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,968
I need to know what I'm doing.
I don't know Tom.

122
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,582
-How about this Sunday?
-Can we meet him on Sunday?

123
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:02,846
No, it'd just be us, but we could go
over everything from the meetings....

124
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,479
Okay. Great. Yeah. All right.

125
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,024
-So are you seeing Denny tonight?
-Denny?

126
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,388
Denny.

127
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,554
You know, show him your plane.

128
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,765
-Yeah, do I need to put it together?
-Yes, there is some assembly.

129
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,667
Am l--? I'm gonna need tools?

130
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,003
You usually need tools,
but not many tools.

131
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,305
My daughter put together
a Camaro, if you can believe it.

132
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,244
-Can I get that one?
-That's a display.

133
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,113
-Can I buy a display?
-Well, not usually.

134
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,587
-I don't like tools.
-Yeah. Well....

135
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,359
Now, have you ever
operated one of these?

136
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:47,021
-Me? No, no.
-Well, I hadn't when I started either...

137
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,531
...but this manual is good
for helping you out.

138
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,295
-Call me with any questions.
-This takes regular gas?

139
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,902
-That's a good question. And, no.
-lt doesn't take gas?

140
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,100
It runs on special fuel.

141
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,474
-Are you Wilson?
-Yeah.

142
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,079
I'm Denny.

143
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,280
Hey.

144
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,784
-Danny.
-It's really "Denny."

145
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:48,323
I was gonna tell you that on the
phone, but you seemed upset.

146
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,961
Are you upset now?

147
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,790
I don't know.

148
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,499
So, what do you got in there?

149
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,803
-What do I got?
-Maura said you have a plane.

150
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,867
Yeah. It's really, really....

151
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,309
-I just got it.
-Yeah? When?

152
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,543
Not today.

153
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,017
I mean....

154
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,352
Not today. You know?

155
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:23,187
I've got some more stuff in the car.
You wanna take this stuff?

156
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,901
I got another car,
but it's got a stalling problem.

157
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:41,239
This one make does that.
I'll bring it over and show you later....

158
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,913
-Whoa! That is kick-ass.
-Yeah.

159
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:50,282
-lt took me a while to put it together.
-Jesus Christ, I'll say. Is it new?

160
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,688
-I just got it.
-How does it fly?

161
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,728
-Great.
-Yeah, it looks new.

162
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,491
-lt is.
-Flat bottom.

163
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,863
What's the fuel? Tetra 5?

164
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,940
You keep your fuel in the fridge?

165
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,909
Yeah.

166
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,345
-Pretty stupid?
-Who told you to do that?

167
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,712
I don't know.

168
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,112
You got gas in there too.

169
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,653
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,619
Well, might as well. There's no food.

171
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,126
My boat runs on that. They all do.

172
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,956
Yeah, it's the same.

173
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,394
I hate going off to the hobby shop
for that stuff all the time.

174
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,632
You run out quick. It's not cheap.
Does this have lights?

175
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,141
-Where?
-Yeah, it sure does.

176
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,212
Sure does what?

177
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,941
Fuck!

178
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,452
You got a bottle opener?

179
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,886
-Now?
-Yeah, in the house?

180
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,357
-Yeah.
-Could you get it?

181
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,429
-Sure.
-Rachel must have taken mine out.

182
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:10,090
She's always fucking doing that to
keep me from drinking and driving.

183
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,334
Is it far?

184
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,479
From your house?

185
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:02,575
-This is great. You wanna try?
-No, you're fine.

186
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,181
Thanks.

187
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,910
This is kick-ass.

188
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,464
Why aren't you on the couch?

189
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,937
Because I like it here.

190
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,805
-The floor can't make you feel better.
-I don't know.

191
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,610
I don't know.

192
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,618
You wanna be near the bedroom?

193
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,919
Look, Mary Ann, I found
a place to sleep, that's all.

194
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,529
I know it's a stupid place,
but it's the place I found.

195
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,187
Okay? Okay.

196
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,442
Sleeping's important.

197
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,144
Have you ever slept
in a strange spot?

198
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,242
Yes, I have.

199
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,848
I shouldn't make you move.

200
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,654
-What did she say?
-You want to read it? Go ahead.

201
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,663
-lt doesn't have my name on it.
-You're right. It doesn't.

202
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,466
But if it did, I would open it...

203
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,269
-...because that's what she wants.
-Wanted. What she wanted.

204
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,005
-You refuse to honour that.
-ls there something you wanna know?

205
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,949
There's something
you don't wanna know.

206
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:57,520
I don't! I don't!
I loved well! I did!

207
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,850
I did! I loved well!

208
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,585
I don't want a letter!
I don't want a fucking letter!

209
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:07,253
-She left reasons, Will.
-It's my name!

210
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,372
Look, yeah, it's the one....

211
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,482
Sorry. It's the one....
It's right over there.

212
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,211
-That's our sun bear habitat.
-ls it closed?

213
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,983
-They're probably inside.
-Should we sit and wait for them?

214
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,648
-lt could be a while.
-Hours?

215
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,921
Let's walk over to the seal part.

216
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,631
And so it's difficult to plan
when to see the sun bears?

217
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,703
-Yeah.
-I'm walking over to the seal part.

218
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,405
Wilson.

219
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,011
I don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

220
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,187
Tom Bailey just loves your work...

221
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:08,519
...and he's willing to give you
as much time as you need, so....

222
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,930
This is totally inappropriate.

223
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,632
What?

224
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,907
No, not this.

225
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,369
Not what?

226
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,372
Sitting here.

227
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,942
Great.

228
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:39,454
I was trying to preface
what I was about to say.

229
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,059
You gonna say
something inappropriate?

230
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,792
Totally inappropriate.

231
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:52,435
-Totally inappropriate?
-But I'm gonna say it anyway.

232
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,004
I'm attracted to you.

233
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,704
-I should--
-Listen...

234
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,350
-...I didn't mean it like that.
-Because--

235
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,851
You don't have to say anything.
Absolutely nothing.

236
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,356
-It's just that l--
-Can l...?

237
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:18,223
You know, that was totally
inappropriate. Totally.

238
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,293
-Please, let it go.
-I need to go to the bathroom.

239
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,627
Okay.

240
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,962
I'll be right back. I wanna talk.

241
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,264
-We should.
-Okay, yeah.

242
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,517
You okay?

243
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,994
You're about to lose something there.

244
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,802
It's a suicide note from my wife.

245
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,526
I think I did something.

246
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,099
Hi. Leave a message for Liza
and Wilson here.

247
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,173
Leave us a message.
Leave us a message!

248
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,834
Do you have a Yellow Pages?

249
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,368
-Customer copy out at--
-It's all torn to shreds.

250
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,507
-I apologize, but that's for customers.
-Can I use your copy?

251
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,701
Sorry. Convenience store next door
might have one.

252
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,208
But you have one.

253
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,007
Sir, I am sorry. Try the next door.

254
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,514
I just got finished eating
your bad pancakes...

255
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,621
...and got my plane stolen
out of my car in your parking lot.

256
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,383
-Want me to call the police?
-No. I want the Yellow Pages.

257
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,182
What are you looking for?

258
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,525
-Planes.
-Planes?

259
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,256
Yeah. Model planes.
You know, remote-control planes.

260
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,832
-Toy planes.
-Yeah, toy planes.

261
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,999
-You're not going to find anything.
-Let me look.

262
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,329
Let me look.

263
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,343
You're not going to find it.

264
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,654
There, you see that? You see that?

265
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,026
Yeah, one of your fucking friends
stole my plane...

266
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,362
...somebody who eats your bad food
all the time.

267
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,699
That plane is going to ruin
this whole place.

268
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:37,708
How's this?

269
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,640
How's this?

270
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,802
-Looks great. Yeah, looks great.
-Nephew has the same one.

271
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,470
It's red, though.

272
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,015
He took it right into the grain closet
and rolled for 17.

273
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,619
My sister won't let him
in her house anymore.

274
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,650
I got a Chevy truck, like the one
that I grew up as a girl with.

275
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:59,762
-What fuel does it take?
-Omega, 15 to 20 percent.

276
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,296
-You know what that is?
-I got some in my trunk.

277
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh, you don't need any.

278
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,297
Sure.

279
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,129
Well, you're gonna run out sometime.

280
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,830
Sure will.

281
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,203
Where you off to?

282
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,680
New Orleans.
I want to go to the beach.

283
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,582
Honey, there's no beaches
in New Orleans.

284
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,248
-It's right on the water.
-I know. Funny. None.

285
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,584
There's no beach?

286
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,689
Problem over at the Pancake House?

287
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,936
Oh, it's all right. I got another one.
Thanks.

288
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,004
You got another Yellow Pages?

289
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:46,039
No, another plane.
I got my plane stolen.

290
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,176
After yelling at people?
Tearing up their phone books?

291
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,317
Let me show you the way out.

292
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,330
Attention, drivers,
are you a big fan of radio control?

293
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:17,160
If so, there's only one place for you:

300
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,173
Wilson.

301
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,893
-Anything I can help you find?
-This is totally incredible.

302
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,496
-lt is.
-Where are we?

303
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,024
You mean the name of the store
or what city are we in?

304
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,100
Yeah.

305
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,967
Well, sir,
this is Patriot Model Aeronautics.

306
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,109
You're in Prescott, Arkansas.
My name's Brian.

307
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,970
How many people in Prescott
buy these things?

308
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,672
I mean, are there that many?

309
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,318
Well, we do have a substantial
catalogue business...

310
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,818
...which better than 90% of it
is through mail.

311
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,447
-This is basically just our show room.
-Okay.

312
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,355
Jesus.

313
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,231
-What's that?
-Oh, Roundup?

314
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,267
Mainly just hobbyists get together,
have competitions, that sort of thing.

315
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,464
It was yesterday.
Hey, is there another one?

316
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,609
Lord, yes.
Seem like they've always got--

317
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,746
Hold on a minute, let me see.
Here's one this weekend.

318
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:13,076
-Where?
-Wait a minute. That's in Louisiana.

319
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,481
There's one in Little Rock,
end of the month.

320
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,246
Where's the one this weekend?

321
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,149
Slidell.

322
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,227
Hey!

323
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,695
Hey, I'm going to Slidell!

324
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,836
Are you going to Slidell?

325
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,299
Oh, no, no,
I know how to get to Slidell.

326
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,568
Are you going to the regional?

327
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,780
Look! I got a plane!

328
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,048
I'll see you there!

329
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,140
I've never seen food so big.

330
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,949
That's why I made so much.
I knew you were coming.

331
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,610
-You knew I was coming?
-Sure.

332
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,984
The plates are right there.

333
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,337
If I could have kept him here,
I would have.

334
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,238
-You do understand that?
-Right, exactly. But how did he quit?

335
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,470
-He left.
-How? Why?

336
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,309
You're not telling me anything.
He's not at his house.

337
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,213
He's not at his job. He's disappeared.

338
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,684
-Does that register? I mean, does it?
-Yes! Yes!

339
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,790
Okay, so when he said, "l quit,"
you didn't ask him why?

340
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,586
-You didn't say anything?
-I didn't get a chance to.

341
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,855
You're full of bullshit.
Know why I know you're full of bullshit?

342
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,499
Because he's distraught
and I'm distraught...

343
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,568
...and you're sitting on your ass
not giving a damn where he is...

344
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,433
-...because you can't stop this bullshit!
-I told him I liked him.

345
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,237
-You told him you liked him.
-Yes.

346
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,568
You told him
you wanted to be his girlfriend.

347
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,345
Not exactly that.

348
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,913
You want a date?

349
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,108
Date this guy. Hey, come here.

350
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,286
This is Maura.

351
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,786
You probably know Maura.
She's looking for a date.

352
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,755
She asked Wilson for a date
and now he's nowhere to be found...

353
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,292
...which I think we can all say
is a big "no."

354
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,861
So if you'll excuse me now...

355
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,193
...I'm gonna try to find
my son-in-law, who needs help...

356
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,268
...I would imagine,
dealing with the loss of his wife.

357
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,098
Sorry.

358
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:01,167
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

359
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,902
Stay hydro. Stay hydro.
Minutes.

360
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,174
Good morning.

361
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,843
I was already here.

362
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,890
-Do they have races?
-All day long.

363
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,650
-Do they race planes?
-Boats. No planes.

364
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,363
Do they have swimming?

365
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,929
Nobody does, really.

366
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,041
You know, with all the boats.
Not really.

367
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,926
Somebody's in the water.

368
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,093
Stop the boats.

369
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,971
Somebody's in the water.

370
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,701
Hey!

371
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,072
Get out of there, sir.

372
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,583
Hey! There's no swimming today!

373
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,787
-I saw swimming.
-They had to go too!

374
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,865
We can't have swimmers
when we hold races.

375
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:34,026
-I'll stay away!
-We can't have you in the water.

376
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,502
I'm a great swimmer.
I'll stay out of the way.

377
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,800
-I won't bother the race.
-Swim later!

378
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,910
Do you know who I am?

379
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:46,974
I am a big fan of radio control!

380
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,415
I got a plane in my car!

381
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,599
Hey! What are you doing here?

382
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,301
Not jumping in the lake,
pissing people off.

383
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,345
That race will be disqualified.

384
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,076
You have to leave!

385
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,081
-You have to leave.
-He's all right.

386
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,278
-This is great.
-Are they together?

387
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,255
This woman made me eggs.

388
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,858
Louis, call the cops
and get him out of here.

389
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,961
No, he's sick.
He's okay. He's with me.

390
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,289
No, I'm great.

391
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,397
You can't just do anything you want.

392
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,591
We have insurance rules we have
to abide by, and when they--

393
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,237
Listen.
This guy's wife just died, okay?

394
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,838
She blew her head off, okay?

395
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,407
Now we'll be cool, okay?
Come on.

396
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,182
-Strange seeing you here.
-Yeah, well, I'm a member.

397
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,946
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

398
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,148
I wanna be a member.
Can you sign up somewhere?

399
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,453
Well, I don't think
you could sign up now.

400
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,529
What do you think?

401
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,632
Yeah, I guess.

402
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,428
Here, check this out.

403
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,033
That's yours?

404
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,199
-Check it out.
-Wow!

405
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:24,143
-This is the bad-boy boat, Wilson.
-Try it out yet?

406
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,906
-Did I try it out yet?
-Have you?

407
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,313
I won my prelim.
Is that trying it out?

408
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,713
-What?
-My prelim.

409
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:30,875
What's a prelim?

410
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,579
-I won my race.
-You did! Really?

411
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,453
This morning.
It's just a prelim.

412
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,323
Quarters are today, 5:00.

413
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,761
-This is in the quarters?
-Yeah.

414
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,233
-You can't swim in the quarters.
-I won't.

415
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,431
-No swimming.
-That's great.

416
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,208
-5:00.
-Today.

417
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,708
It doesn't matter, Wilson, because
I won my quarters, and that's it.

418
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,184
I won my quarters...

419
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,756
...and I can go into the semis
tomorrow and I can be loose.

420
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,394
I might do very well
'cause I don't give a shit.

421
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,760
It's all just gravy on the--
lcing on the cake.

422
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,828
When you win quarters,
you race on Sunday.

423
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:29,096
Everybody can race on Saturday,
so that doesn't matter.

424
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:32,105
When you race on Sunday,
it means you won.

425
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,774
I don't care if I come in last.
I don't care...

426
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,075
...because I already won.

427
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,516
So I will definitely be loose.

428
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,389
-Have fun.
-Yeah.

429
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,360
What time is it tomorrow?

430
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,020
Noon.

431
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,763
Noon.

432
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,862
I have all morning to prep.

433
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,295
-That's good.
-Yeah.

434
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,906
-I have all morning--
-Yeah.

435
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,599
To prep.

436
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,163
Hey!

437
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,164
I'm sorry.

438
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,505
I want to start a fire.

439
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,371
Well, don't use my fuel.

440
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,341
-You wanna start a fire?
-Yeah.

441
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,344
Why?

442
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,142
I don't know.

443
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,385
Hi.

444
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,526
Is Liza here?

445
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,703
No.

446
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,365
No, she's not.

447
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,608
I'm Mary Ann.
I'm Liza's mother.

448
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,008
You're Liza's mom?

449
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,688
-I'm Mary.
-Yeah?

450
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,820
Is Wilson here?

451
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,251
No.

452
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,456
No.

453
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,826
He's not here either.

454
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,326
They're both gone.

455
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,795
I'm sorry.

456
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,336
I'm sorry.

457
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,075
I'm sorry.

458
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,537
Let go! I got--

459
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,122
Did your wife do
what your friend said she did?

460
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,186
Maybe not exactly
like he said, but...

461
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,425
...yeah.

462
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,193
-I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.

463
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,508
-Why'd she do it?
-God, shut up, Stacy! God!

464
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,807
I don't know.

465
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,945
She wrote me a letter,
but I can't read it.

466
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,419
She probably wrote some really
cool stuff about you in there.

467
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,792
-About the both of you, even though--
-You can tell.

468
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,164
I wouldn't wanna read it.
Like, "Here you go, read it."

469
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,730
Oh, my God! No way.

470
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,728
It's cool that you miss her so much.

471
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,068
Oh-fucking-well.

472
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,968
Second-to-last place.

473
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,940
I am fucking out of here.

474
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,678
-Losers don't stay for finals.
-Well, nobody else is leaving.

475
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:43,384
Do tennis players stay
and watch other tennis players win?

476
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,528
-I don't know.
-No, they don't.

477
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,589
Losers leave.

478
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,092
You didn't...

479
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,972
..."lose" lose.

480
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,076
I'm not in the finals, which means
we don't have to drive in the dark.

481
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,712
That's cool. I'm cool,
but I'm out of here.

482
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,972
Okay.

483
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,352
Hey, someone left you a letter.

484
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:21,855
What?

485
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,159
Yeah. I found it when I got up.
I forgot.

486
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,862
-Where is it?
-I put it in here so it wouldn't get wet.

487
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,907
You ain't gonna open it?

488
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,746
I'm an idiot.

489
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,716
It's from my wife.

490
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,254
-I don't think so, Wilson.
-No.

491
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,898
-She left it for me.
-Not here, obviously.

492
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,193
-No, not here.
-Good.

493
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,805
I thought you were more fucked up
than I thought you were.

494
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,833
She left it for me.

495
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,144
You haven't opened it?

496
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,885
-I should probably just open it here.
-Now?

497
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,724
I don't know.

498
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,623
We might not be able
to drive afterward.

499
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,930
You ain't gonna open that thing
in here, are you?

500
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,904
-Why not?
-Because it's stupid.

501
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,099
-Why's it stupid?
-First off, because I'm in here.

502
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,710
-I don't care if you're here.
-Well, I do!

503
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,540
Why?

504
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,707
I don't wanna be here when you open
a letter from a person who shot herself.

505
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,115
Excuse me,
but it scares the shit out of me.

506
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,618
She didn't shoot herself.

507
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,383
That's why cops
and psychologists do that...

508
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,719
...because they've been trained
to do that.

509
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,521
Yeah, you're probably right.

510
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,427
You can't open it here
in a bathroom.

511
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,896
-You're in a public bathroom.
-It's stupid.

512
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,073
No, you need to open this
near some candles or something.

513
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,870
With a dog, you know, or a priest.

514
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,148
But not here.
Jesus Christ, not here.

515
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,910
I wouldn't wanna open it.
No way.

516
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,822
I mean, who the hell
wants to know, really?

517
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,751
Especially you.

518
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,124
Oh, God!
I gotta take a mean shit.

519
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,565
Always after camping,
gets all backed up.

520
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,453
Hey, Wilson.

521
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,823
-You got a phone call.
-What?

522
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,158
It's some lady.

523
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,675
Hello?

524
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,772
And a guy named Tom Bailey
called me about a job for you.

525
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,849
-He did?
-Yeah.

526
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:07,819
I guess your old boss gave him
your number, or my number.

527
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,670
I haven't read the letter yet.

528
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,718
That's hilarious.

529
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:16,050
-Hey, run out of gas again?
-Yeah.

530
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,256
-Five dollars on two.
-Hey, you fly those planes.

531
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,420
-Yeah.
-That's wild.

532
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:26,426
-Sometimes the gas is for that.
-Gas is for what?

533
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,935
You know, sometimes I come in--
Sometimes it's for the planes.

534
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,634
You know,
sometimes it's for the planes.

535
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,079
The two planes my buddy's got
don't use gas.

536
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,216
-Synthetic blend?
-Yeah.

537
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:42,817
They don't run on gas.

538
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,354
What the hell have I told you?
Go somewhere else!

539
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,688
Do it somewhere else!

540
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,628
Do it somewhere else!

541
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:05,641
-This is simple stuff.
-I can't believe it.

542
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,541
-This is simple stuff.
-I can't believe it.

543
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,974
-I did this two years ago.
-You're kidding.

544
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,614
Sure. I can generate pop-ups
with the new Java...

545
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:15,250
...which can maintain several
windows simultaneously.

546
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,410
And you can count unique
users within each one.

547
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,783
And I can throw in
a half-dozen firewalls...

548
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,857
...so guys can't steal jack shit.

549
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:36,731
-I was trying to track you down.
-Yeah. I heard you called.

550
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,771
How was your vacation?

551
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,866
Good.

552
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,210
-You look great.
-I do?

553
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,082
-I think.
-You do.

554
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,848
So maybe we can just set you up
at your house...

555
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,389
...and you could get started.

556
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,157
I'm really happy about this.

557
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,953
Me too.

558
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,661
-All right.
-Thank you.

559
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,943
Oh, fuck.

560
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,318
Fuck.

561
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,698
No!

562
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,391
Oh, God, no!

563
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,227
No!

564
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,730
Yeah?

565
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:48,001
No, I can't talk now, Mary Ann!

566
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,339
I got robbed, Mary Ann.
They took everything!

567
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,679
Yeah, everything!
The letter's missing. I don't--

568
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,717
No, I haven't opened it.

569
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,981
I didn't read it!
I didn't open it. No!

570
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,775
Where the fuck is everything, Wilson?

571
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,871
Wilson, wake up.

572
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,915
Wilson, all your shit's missing.

573
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,791
What?

574
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:19,290
What happened to your stuff?

575
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,864
I got robbed.

576
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,762
-They took everything?
-Yeah. How'd you get in here?

577
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,926
The door was open.

578
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,400
-The door was open?
-lt wasn't wide open. It was unlocked.

579
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,634
And you just walked right in?

580
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,745
-Are you getting high on the gas?
-No. Fuck that, Denny.

581
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:41,576
-Did you just walk right in?
-Well, yeah. I saw your car.

582
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,513
You didn't answer the doorbell.

583
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:47,144
So you thought you could
just walk right in my house?

584
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,256
What the fuck are you doing?

585
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,396
-What the fuck am I doing?
-Yeah!

586
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,123
My God, Denny, give me a break!

587
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,597
Do you think you can just
come right in, like--?

588
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,032
We're not in a motel room together!

589
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,037
-I'm sorry.
-Well, fuck your sorrys!

590
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,504
-Denny!
-Sorry, l--

591
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:10,111
God, what the hell are you think--?
What the fuck are you doing?

592
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:13,840
-I didn't think it would be a big deal.
-Well, it is a big deal!

593
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:17,577
You come in here, like,
you know....

594
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:22,281
We're not in a motel room,
you know, Denny?

595
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:27,486
God! I got stuff I might be
doing in here, Denny!

596
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,291
You don't just come in here.
"Hi, I'm Denny!

597
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:34,266
Who cares what anyone thinks?"
You don't care what I think!

598
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,667
"I'm Denny." Who cares?
Coming in here.

599
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,536
Don't come in here!

600
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,007
Two on one.

601
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,239
Guy at Arlington Hobby said
planes don't run on gas.

602
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,575
Well, mine does.

603
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,547
He said it's impossible because--

604
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:54,485
I own a plane, and it runs on gas, and
I wanna fly the thing right fucking now!

605
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,124
You don't have to yell.

606
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,819
Well, I just wanna buy
$2 worth of fucking gas!

607
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,754
Two on one!

608
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,592
Two on one.

609
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,556
Here you go.

610
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,012
Well, Mary Ann, you wanted me
to come back, and now I'm back.

611
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,379
I'm sorry I didn't open
your fucking letter.

612
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,681
I want some goddamn pictures
of my wife. You're her mother!

613
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,790
All right? And you got--

614
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,323
Fuck!

615
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,626
Are you Wilson?

616
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,964
I'm Angela Ryan
from Bailey Federated. We--

617
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,110
Yeah. I got the computer.

618
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:26,112
-So it showed up all right?
-Yeah, it did. Yeah.

619
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,546
Do you want to do this
another time?

620
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,245
-What are we doing?
-We were going to discuss...

621
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,856
...budget parameters for this design
that you're doing for us.

622
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,623
Okay.

623
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,625
-So....
-Yeah. All right, okay.

624
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,695
Yeah. Come on in.

625
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:49,596
I heard you were robbed.
That's awful.

626
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,969
Terrible. Just terrible.

627
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,639
Have a seat.

628
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:03,714
-Hey, you want something?
-I'm fine.

629
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,615
I don't have anything anyway.

630
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,960
-So the computer's fine?
-Yeah.

631
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,687
-Still feeling it out?
-Yeah, I think so.

632
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,925
You're sitting on it, actually.

633
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:36,475
Can we have some gas?
Like, a whole can.

634
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,780
Why don't you get it yourself?
It's not illegal to buy gas.

635
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,924
-The places know us.
-So why don't you get drunk?

636
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,961
-Because we don't like to.
-You don't like to?

637
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:49,755
Okay?

638
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,170
Denny!

639
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,844
-What do you want?
-I need your help.

640
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:07,811
-Really? No shit?
-I need your help, really.

641
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:10,110
Remember, I'm Denny?

642
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:13,914
I need some pictures of Liza, and
Mary Ann keeps hanging up on me.

643
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,920
God, I wonder why.

644
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,582
-Please. I'm sorry.
-We're not at the hotel.

645
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:19,750
I know.

646
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,691
-We're not at the hotel.
-All right.

647
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,856
Look, I know your wife killed herself,
and it's been hard...

648
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,591
...but all I did was come in...

649
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,932
...and you had
this fucking gas hangover.

650
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,506
Fuck you!

651
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,276
Okay, please. I'm sorry.

652
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,848
-Yeah, you are too!
-I am!

653
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,485
She probably--

654
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,996
-She's probably not here.
-I don't care.

655
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,126
Mary Ann!

656
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,470
Open up!

657
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,496
Mary Ann, open up!

658
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:09,007
I don't think she's home.
Would've answered already.

659
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,380
I don't think she's in there, buddy.

660
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,120
Come on.
Let's go back to the house.

661
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,384
I got this karate tape we can watch.

662
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,152
This is crazy.

663
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:30,423
-That's not even gonna work.
-Look, I'm going in!

664
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:38,429
This guy's wife did herself in
just three weeks ago, not even.

665
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,775
What the hell are you doing?

666
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,278
It's my son-in-law
and somebody else.

667
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:50,212
Are you breaking into my house?
Are you out of your mind?

668
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,818
-I'm Denny.
-I was at the gate.

669
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,956
Because I don't answer immediately,
you're breaking in?

670
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,353
I want pictures!
You keep hanging up on me!

671
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:01,185
You keep calling me and swearing
at me like I did something wrong!

672
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,352
I want pictures!

673
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,726
-You expect me to do what you want?
-Yes!

674
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,868
-Yes?
-I have nothing!

675
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,868
You had everything.

676
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,410
You had everything!

677
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,819
-I need some fuel for my plane.
-We're not open yet, sir.

678
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,823
Can you sell me some fuel?

679
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,224
All the registers are down.
I really can't.

680
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:36,990
-Can't you ring it up later?
-I really can't. Sorry.

681
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,427
-Can--?
-We open at noon.

682
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,864
If I gave you some money now...

683
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,971
...can you ring it up
when you're open?

684
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,600
I really am unable to help you.

685
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:51,405
See, I gave the rest of it
to some kids in the neighbourhood...

686
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,949
...and I have a demonstration
with some handicapped kids...

687
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:59,554
...in a half an hour,
and I'm really in a bind.

688
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,882
-Sir.
-I'm--

689
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,687
I do this every Sunday,
and I fucked up.

690
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,628
Can't I ever fuck up?

691
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,530
Here.

692
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,177
-No, that's all right.
-All right. Thanks.

693
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,840
-Where's the demonstration?
-You can't come.

694
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,920
What are you doing here?

695
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,183
Can we get some more
of the stuff in the jug?

696
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,421
I just gave you some.

697
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:19,332
-We spilled it.
-Well, don't spill it.

698
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:22,166
Just take it with you.

699
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:25,431
-You can't do it here.
-Hello?

700
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,876
Look, leave.
You can't do it here.

701
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,341
Wilson?

702
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,281
Hey, Wilson.

703
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,645
Tom Bailey.

704
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:45,959
Tom Bailey!

705
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,627
These are my...

706
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:58,096
...niece and nephew.
They just came by to say hi.

707
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,264
This is the....

708
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:04,774
-That's the hardware I sent you.
-lt is. Yeah, it really is.

709
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,345
You'll be here later?

710
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,848
-I will. I am going to be.
-Good. Good.

711
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,919
-I'll send somebody by to pick it up.
-The design?

712
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:15,522
You don't-- You don't--
You don't--

713
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,659
The computer, Wilson.

714
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:21,193
The boxes.
You two go home right now.

715
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:24,957
Go home. I'm gonna call the police
if you come back.

716
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:30,399
Whatever's going on here stops now.
You understand?

717
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:36,000
I'm gonna call the police to watch
for these kids coming back over here.

718
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,546
Tom Bailey.

719
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,647
It's cool. They'll be--

720
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,079
Wilson.

721
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,309
We're done.

722
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,156
Open up!

723
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,647
Oh, my God.

724
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,403
Mary Ann!

725
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,352
"Will....

726
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,721
I probably made a mess...

727
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,130
...and you deserve better.

728
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:32,731
But love me to take this
onto your life...

729
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,773
...and bear it.

730
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,379
Find another...

731
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,453
...and carry me in your heart.

732
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,589
I talk to you from there.

733
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,928
I talk to you from there.

734
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,104
Love, Liza."

735
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:22,183
"l talk to you from there."
