1
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,130
<i>There he lies.</i>

2
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,388
<i>God rest his soul,
and his rudeness.</i>

3
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:34,073
<i>A devouring public can now share
the remains of his sickness,</i>

4
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:36,560
<i>and his phone numbers.</i>

5
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:40,342
<i>There he lay...</i>

6
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,701
<i>poet,</i>

7
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:43,146
<i>prophet,</i>

8
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,585
<i>outlaw,</i>

9
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:46,185
<i>fake.</i>

10
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:49,026
<i>Star of electricity.</i>

11
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:51,845
<i>Nailed by a peeping Tom</i>

12
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,490
<i>who would soon discover...</i>

13
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:57,258
A poem is like a naked person.

14
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:59,164
<i>Even the ghost...</i>

15
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:01,091
<i>was more than one person.</i>

16
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:11,220
But a song is something
that walks by itself.

17
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:21,522
<i># Aw, the ragman draws circles #</i>

18
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:24,734
<i># Up and down the block #</i>

19
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:28,104
<i># I'd ask him what the matter was #</i>

20
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:31,088
<i># But I know that he don't talk #</i>

21
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:34,701
<i># And the ladies treat me kindly #</i>

22
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:38,286
<i># And they furnish me with tape #</i>

23
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:41,665
<i># But deep inside my heart #</i>

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,092
<i># I know I can't escape #</i>

25
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:48,085
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

26
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,401
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

27
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,789
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

28
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:58,285
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

29
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,916
<i># Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley #</i>

30
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:07,304
<i># With his pointed shoes and his bells #</i>

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,676
<i># Speaking to some French girl #</i>

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,933
<i># Who says she knows me well #</i>

33
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:17,595
<i># And I would send a message #</i>

34
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:20,813
<i># To find out if she's talked #</i>

35
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:24,477
<i># But the post office has been stolen #</i>

36
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:27,888
<i># And the mailbox is locked #</i>

37
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,221
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

38
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:34,084
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

39
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,522
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

40
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,720
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

41
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:46,912
<i># Now the rain man gave me two cures #</i>

42
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,030
<i># Then he said, "Jump right in" #</i>

43
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,599
<i># The one was Texas medicine #</i>

44
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,823
<i># The other was just railroad gin #</i>

45
00:03:56,756 --> 00:04:00,089
<i># And like a fool I mixed them #</i>

46
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,457
<i># And it strangled up my mind #</i>

47
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:06,749
<i># And now people just get uglier #</i>

48
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:10,375
<i># And I have no sense of time #</i>

49
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:13,697
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

50
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,890
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

51
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:20,227
<i># To be stuck here inside of Mobile #</i>

52
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:23,955
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

53
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,597
Hey. How old are you, boy?

54
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,251
Eleven years old.

55
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,609
Oh.

56
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,073
What's your name, son?

57
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,314
Woody.

58
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,520
Woody Guthrie.

59
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,008
Just like the singer.

60
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,121
Way I see it,

61
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,415
singin's kept me right in this world
more than any Bible's ever done.

62
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,006
And somethin' else I learned?

63
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:12,093
Takes just about a fountain pen
to get yourself robbed.

64
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,085
Hey, Joe. What do you
make about that?

65
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,992
Uh, son...

66
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:23,846
you wouldn't be stashin' no weapons
in that case of yours?

67
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,747
No, sir. Not in any literalized way.

68
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:31,073
What'd you say his name was?

69
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,149
<i>A- R-T-H.</i>

70
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,159
Please sit down.

71
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:43,942
"A-R-T-H-U-R...

72
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:47,418
R-I-M-B-A-U-D."

73
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,558
Born October 20th.

74
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:53,777
That makes you 19,
nearly 20.

75
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,013
Is that correct?

76
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,518
That's correct.

77
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,039
So what's all this about?

78
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,248
Well, Missouri, originally.

79
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,094
A little town called Riddle.

80
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:07,078
But all over, really.

81
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,966
Been to Gallup, Phillipsburg,
Sioux Falls...

82
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,209
I got me a cousin in Sioux Falls.

83
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,982
Yeah! That's right.

84
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:17,667
Uh, is there really
a town called Riddle?

85
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:21,392
Tell you the flat truth,
that's sort of a... a whatchamacallit.

86
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,467
A, uh...

87
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,981
A composite.

88
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,793
A compost heap is more like it.

89
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,598
Truth is, my mind
got mixed with ramblin'

90
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,865
when I was, oh, so young.

91
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,676
I reckon it was Arvella Gray,

92
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,429
the blind protest singer from Chicago.

93
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,817
She first taught me the blues

94
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:43,944
four...

95
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,993
about five years back.

96
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,954
That's also when I first started
writin' songs on my own.

97
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,365
I've written some hillbilly songs.

98
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,134
You know Carl Perkins,
from Nashville?

99
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,063
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,457
He sings some of my songs.

101
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,623
Yep. Talkin' blues kind
of stuff, you know?

102
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:59,663
Union songs.

103
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,816
I also played piano with Bobby Vee.

104
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:06,159
I would've been a millionaire
if I stayed with him.

105
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:11,181
Well, what brings you
around these parts?

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,465
Carelessness.

107
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:24,077
<i>I lost my one true love.</i>

108
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,477
<i>And I started drinking.</i>

109
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,866
<i>Next thing I know, I'm in a crap game.</i>

110
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,509
<i>I wake up in a pool hall.</i>

111
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,535
<i>One night, I meet up with a Chinaman</i>

112
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:40,485
<i>working at a dime store
who says he loves my sound.</i>

113
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,231
<i>And next thing I know,</i>

114
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:45,318
<i>I'm all booked up
at his boss's establishment.</i>

115
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,289
The Tiny Troubadour!

116
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:52,185
<i># I've been a... #</i>

117
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,917
<i># Moonshiner #</i>

118
00:07:57,652 --> 00:08:03,557
<i># For 17 long years #</i>

119
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,467
There you go, boy.

120
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,674
<i>Of course, success ain't all</i>

121
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:14,994
<i>it's cracked up to be, now.</i>

122
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,437
There's something
sort of freakish, I suppose,

123
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:21,065
setting someone up on stage
apart from all the rest,

124
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:25,549
when down in every boxcar
there's men of all ranges bouncing together.

125
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:28,234
You got hobos, nobos,
gentlemen loafers.

126
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:31,316
One or all-time losers.

127
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,230
Call us what you will.

128
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:36,301
Deep down, we're all getting ready

129
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:39,653
to tuck our heads
under our wings for sleep.

130
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,017
We of the Pullman side-car
and the sunburned thumb.

131
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:45,681
We ain't kidding ourselves.

132
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,398
It's lonesome roads we shall walk.

133
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,093
Till I joined the Union cause!

134
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,556
Don't he know it's 1959?

135
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,469
We done unionized 20 years ago.

136
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:05,474
Records indicate that you've been away,

137
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:07,247
that you've stopped writing.

138
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:08,466
I've been on too many streets

139
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,455
to be doing the same thing
over and over.

140
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,963
Can I smoke in here?

141
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,273
You sound,

142
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,017
for someone so widely known,

143
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:15,949
a bit fatalistic.

144
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:19,003
I'm not fatalistic.

145
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,478
Bank tellers are fatalistic.

146
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,684
Clerks are fatalistic.

147
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,731
I'm a farmer.

148
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,749
Who ever heard
of a fatalistic farmer?

149
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,829
# The sweet, pretty things
are in bed now, of course #

150
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,507
# The city fathers,
they're trying to endorse #

151
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:41,119
# The reincarnation
of Paul Revere's horse #

152
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,908
# But the town has no need
to be nervous #

153
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:48,946
# The hysterical bride
in the penny arcade #

154
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:52,478
# Screaming, she moans,
"I've just been made" #

155
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,930
# Then sends out for the doctor
who pulls down the shade #

156
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:59,693
# Says, "My advice
is to not let the boys in" #

157
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:04,041
# Where Ma Raney and Beethoven
once unwrapped their bed roll #

158
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:07,555
# Tuba players now rehearse
around the flagpole #

159
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,344
# And the national bank for a profit #

160
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,269
# Sells road maps for the soul #

161
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:15,659
# To the old folks home
and the college #

162
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:16,842
# Mama's in the factory #

163
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,121
# She ain't got no shoes #

164
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,827
# Daddy's in the alley #

165
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,919
# He's lookin' for food #

166
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,498
# I'm in the kitchen #

167
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:28,170
# With the tombstone blues #

168
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:31,220
# Hey, hey, yeah #

169
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,291
Whoo!

170
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,580
Oh!

171
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,192
Boy, look like you found...
you found your freedom

172
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,780
before you found your technique.

173
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:45,514
Now, real American music
come from the bottom up.

174
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,464
You take Blind Willie McTell.

175
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,722
He's the best blues singer
east of Cannery Row.

176
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,961
He say, "Son, if you can
sing these songs

177
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:56,102
and understand them,
ain't no place you can't go.

178
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,595
Ah, thank you very much, ma'am.

179
00:10:57,604 --> 00:10:58,628
You're welcome.

180
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,025
I reckon I come out the womb

181
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:02,130
singing and picking
and playing and all that mess.

182
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,276
So where your people at?

183
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,166
Your kinfolk?

184
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,454
Oh, they back in Stockton, ma'am.

185
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,495
California.
That's where I was raised.

186
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:11,455
I figured they got plenty
of mouths to feed as it is.

187
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,834
Not that I care a fig about material things,

188
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,860
you know, except for
maybe a decent car.

189
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,674
See, us thumb-slummers
and box-jumpers,

190
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:20,860
we get a little peckish
when it comes to cars, you know?

191
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,242
That boy sound just like Doughboy Hawkins,

192
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,802
a fella I met in the Dust Bowl.

193
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,972
Tell you what I think.
I think it's 1959,

194
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,821
and this boy's singing
songs about the boxcar?

195
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,337
Hmm. What a boxcar
gonna mean to him?

196
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,143
Right here, we got race riots,
folks with no food.

197
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,578
Why ain't he out there
singing about that?

198
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,955
The boy a guest in our house.

199
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:40,400
I know he's a guest.
I'm just trying to speak what's in my mind.

200
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,595
No!

201
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,815
Say it.

202
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:55,148
Live your own time, child.

203
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,027
Sing about your own time.

204
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,213
<i>Greenwich Village,</i>

205
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,884
<i>once the in spot
for beatnik jazz and bebop,</i>

206
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,975
<i>is today home
to the popular folk music fad,</i>

207
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,649
<i>a do-it-yourself musical expression</i>

208
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:17,845
<i>that's attracted youngsters
from all across the nation.</i>

209
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:20,754
<i>For them,
these homespun songs of the working man</i>

210
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,188
<i>express a truth and candor</i>

211
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:26,104
<i>sorely lacking in today's
growing consumer society.</i>

212
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,208
Why do you prefer folk music
to other types of music?

213
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,673
Because it's honest.

214
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,478
Commercial songs,
pop music can't be honest.

215
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,660
It's controlled and censored
by the people who run society

216
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:38,929
and make the rules.

217
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,342
<i>Yet, among the many new</i>

218
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,114
<i>and talented artists to emerge,</i>

219
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,636
<i>one name stands alone
as the heart and soul</i>

220
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,804
<i>of this growing musical trend.</i>

221
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,776
<i>A young individual
who both writes and performs</i>

222
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,924
<i>some of his era's finest tunes,</i>

223
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,588
<i>and hailed by the New York Times</i>

224
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:56,834
<i>as folk music's
Troubadour of Conscience.</i>

225
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:00,639
<i>His name is Jack Rollins.</i>

226
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:02,413
<i>Jack Rollins,</i>

227
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:04,736
<i>folk sensation of the early '60s,</i>

228
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,144
<i>was the promise of a new generation.</i>

229
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,101
<i>So what was it that made him run</i>

230
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,689
<i>at the height of his career
and throw it all away,</i>

231
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:15,648
<i>trading in the limelight
for a different kind of light altogether?</i>

232
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,358
He saw what was going on
in the world,

233
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:22,079
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

234
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:24,019
He could do a funny thing.

235
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,479
He could do a pathos thing.
He was sensational.

236
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:30,470
# For the times, they are a-changin' #

237
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,673
<i>Now, this young man has
taken to the hearts of young people</i>

238
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:41,582
who seem to somehow identify with, uh...

239
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,219
Jack, why do you think that is?

240
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,076
Well, I don't know.

241
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,863
L... I guess...

242
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:52,082
I got a lot of thoughts inside of me,

243
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,816
and most people, they...

244
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,206
they... keep them all inside.

245
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:01,590
And I guess it's for them
that I do what I do.

246
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,459
<i>Today, the name Jack Rollins</i>

247
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,606
<i>might best be remembered
as the tortured singer</i>

248
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:08,820
<i>battling his conscience
in the 1965 drama,</i>

249
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:10,089
Grain of Sand.

250
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:11,798
<i>The role, of course,
that launched the career</i>

251
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,824
<i>of Hollywood rebel Robbie Clark.</i>

252
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,214
Hell, I don't pick what I sing.

253
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:17,250
<i>It picks me.</i>

254
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,538
Some of it ain't pretty.

255
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,043
I mean, how you ever
gonna change anything

256
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,854
if you only wanna show what's pretty?

257
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,750
<i>In his first exclusive interview in 20 years...</i>

258
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:30,395
Tonight, we bring you face-to-face
with the real Jack Rollins.

259
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:38,489
# William Zanzinger
killed poor Hattie Carroll #

260
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,662
# With a cane that he twirled #

261
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,903
# 'Round his diamond ring finger #

262
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,473
<i>He saw what was going on
in the world,</i>

263
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,103
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

264
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,822
And this elevated the discussion.

265
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,785
I mean, certainly
within the folk world,

266
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,570
but all through popular music,
the bar had risen.

267
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,814
<i>Alice Fabian</i>

268
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:00,763
<i>was herself a leading figure
in the folk revival,</i>

269
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,677
<i>achieving international success</i>

270
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,994
<i>a few years before
their first meeting in 1962.</i>

271
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:09,383
Hey, you're in my chair.

272
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:12,360
I was at a party in the Village,

273
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:15,226
and this twerpy little kid
who'd been hanging around,

274
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:17,736
kind of flirting with my baby sister
and kissing up to me,

275
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,002
starts playing these songs
that he'd written on guitar.

276
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:23,378
Now, this was '61, '62,

277
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,797
and all anybody sang were traditionals,

278
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:30,572
and here's this kid, applying traditional form
to contemporary concerns,

279
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,435
but with such insight, you know?

280
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:33,862
<i>It was devastating.</i>

281
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,928
<i>You couldn't believe
this was coming out of this little toad.</i>

282
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:40,814
<i>Nobody was writing songs like that.</i>

283
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,482
It was as if he was giving voice to ideas

284
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,915
that I wanted to express
but didn't know how.

285
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,434
Um, his finger-pointing songs,
he called 'em.

286
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:52,360
He was churning them out
like ticker tape.

287
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:55,675
Well, folk music has always
been a political music,

288
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:59,003
but he was really expressing
it as an art form

289
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:02,800
in a way that was multileveled and very deep.

290
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,668
# Hattie Carroll
was a maid of the kitchen #

291
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:09,049
# She was 51 years old #

292
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,244
# And gave birth to ten children #

293
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:15,750
# Who carried the dishes
and took out the garbage #

294
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,202
# And never sat once
at the head of the table #

295
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,253
# And didn't even talk
to the people at the table #

296
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:28,818
# She just cleaned up
all the food from the table #

297
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,194
# And emptied the ashtrays
on a whole other level #

298
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:38,148
# Got killed by a blow,
lay slain by a cane #

299
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,003
<i>Every night,</i>

300
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:41,336
<i>I would call this ragamuffin on stage</i>

301
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:45,441
<i>and introduce America
to Jack Rollins.</i>

302
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,608
<i>I'd say, you know,
that he has something to say,</i>

303
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:51,385
<i>you know, and that he is...
he is speaking for me</i>

304
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:53,788
<i>and everybody who wants
a better world.</i>

305
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:59,029
# Oh, but you who
philosophize disgrace #

306
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:03,183
# And criticize all fears #

307
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:08,241
# Bury the rag deep in your face #

308
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:11,594
# Now is the time for your tears #

309
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,154
<i>He knows how to peel the surface</i>

310
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,251
<i>from what he sees.</i>

311
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,579
<i>His songs are like a true vision
of how things really are.</i>

312
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:20,004
<i>Well, I just find
he's the most piercing</i>

313
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:23,538
and aware insight working today.

314
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,558
You'd have thought we invented it,

315
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,781
we were so pleased and proud.

316
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:34,549
Sure, there was a certain tendency
in the folk movement

317
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:37,207
for nostalgia about the Depression

318
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,135
and the radicalism
that came out of it.

319
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:41,568
They were coming out
of a shitty time...

320
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,948
the McCarthy era, Eisenhower era.

321
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,685
<i>So, as long as folk remained
strictly a minority taste,</i>

322
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,728
<i>it would always be us against the big, bad
commercial tastelessness.</i>

323
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:53,108
<i>But when the big, bad commercial
tastelessness</i>

324
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:56,043
<i>finally caught on to Jack,</i>

325
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:59,387
<i>then, well, all of a sudden,</i>

326
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:01,682
the race was on.

327
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,882
And this time,
somebody was going to win.

328
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:04,828
He was a rebel.

329
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,718
I wanted to record protest.

330
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,176
Of course, that's right
when we were getting

331
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,173
into that whole Nam business.

332
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:14,665
Jack really stopped protesting after 1963.

333
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,817
He said that you couldn't
effect change with a song.

334
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:21,375
You could only write
about what was inside you,

335
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:24,568
and folk music, he said, was, um...

336
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:26,599
was fat people.

337
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:29,317
He said it made him feel
like the Establishment,

338
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,575
you know, and he always
fought the Establishment.

339
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:36,709
<i># You will search, babe #</i>

340

346

<i># I'll keep it with mine #</i>

347
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:13,790
<i>You don't have to write anything down</i>

348
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,096
<i>to be a poet.</i>

349
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,545
<i>Some work in gas stations.</i>

350
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,713
Some shine shoes.

351
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:24,400
I don't really call myself one,
'cause I don't like the word.

352
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,300
Me, I'm a trapeze artist.

353
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:33,728
<i>Sighting it and hearing it

355
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:38,323
<i>And the wind between my eyes</i>

356
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:41,152
<i>knocking honey in my comb.</i>

357
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,083
You reckon he's some kind of midget?

358
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,065
Get off of there, grunt!

359
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,683
I ain't doing nothing!

360
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,783
Now look what you done!

361
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,448
You talk English?

362
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:56,825
Yes, sir.

363
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,375
You carrying money, boy?

364
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:59,319
Weapons?

365
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,406
N-No, sir.

366
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,131
He's lying.

367
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,463
What's that?

368
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,501
That your fiddle? Huh?

369
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:06,687
Give it back. Huh?

370
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,769
What's it say on that thing?

371
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:11,913
What you got stashed in here?

372
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,054
Nothing!

373
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,376
Get him, boys!

374
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:16,154
Ahh!

375
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,663
Ah, you little...

376
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,422
Give me...

377
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,456
This here young'un,
the Tiny Troubadour,

378
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,372
is going to sing a little song.

379
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,800
So what bring you around these parts?

380
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,734
Could've sworn he was an older man.

381
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,208
Live your own time, child.

382
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:45,155
Get him, boys!

383
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,209
You reckon he's
some kind of midget?

384
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,725
<i>He's lying!</i>

385
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:54,502
<i>I dreamed of the Crusades.</i>

386
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,665
<i>Republics without history.</i>

387
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,731
<i>Secret religious wars.</i>

388
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:04,338
<i>I believed in every kind
of witchcraft.</i>

389
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,024
<i>At first it was a study.</i>

390
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:10,041
<i>I wrote out silences and nights.</i>

391
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,788
<i>Later I determined vertigos.</i>

392
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,751
<i>Here's the boot camps, with tanks, jeeps,</i>

393
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,203
<i>bullet-shooting machine guns,
and 80 soldiers.</i>

394
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:56,614
I just don't want to go.

395
00:21:56,562 --> 00:22:00,328
Oh, my poor, sad little thing.

396
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:04,979
Do you know what a wonderful time
you're going to have...

397
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,613
on a boat with the water?

398
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,734
Sounds pretty neat
what your daddy's planned.

399
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:11,879
Me, too!

400
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,863
Why can't you come?

401
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:18,959
Molly, you know I can't come.

402
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,462
Is that why...

403
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,134
you think you're feeling
nervous about the boat?

404
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,257
Hmm?

405
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,876
When's Daddy coming?

406
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:29,072
Uh, Saturday, I think.

407
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,245
I only spoke to Sally
because it's impossible

408
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,421
to get your father on the phone.

409
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:35,769
It's Emily.

410
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,330
Molly, you didn't eat a thing.

411
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:46,258

You didn't answer my question.

477
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,519
Once, maybe, you could sing

478
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:41,213
about Mary Hamilton and lemon trees,

479
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:45,651
or you can step out like me
and try and shake this flytrap.

But they took away the meaning, Alice.

481

- Yeah, so?

488
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:29,829
- Well, you gotta be kidding me.
- Why?

489
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,031
No, nothing. It's perfect.

490
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,746
You kidding?

491
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:36,135
I think you're making a joke.

492
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,539
Oh, no. No, no, no.

493
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:39,709
No joke.

494
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,661
Then what else
aside from being French

495
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:42,873
you like so much about me?

496

00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,560
So, um...

You're an actor.

500
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:59,184
Yeah, yeah. So?

501
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,813
I like what you said in that scene.

502
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,231
Uh, what scene?

503
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:07,295
But they were just lines from a movie.

504
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:08,842
- They were not...
- Wait, wait, wait. What scene?

505
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,083

- The scene in the lane.

506
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:13,188
Hmm.

507
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:17,305
I would like to know
what is at the center of your world.

508
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,435
The center of my world?

509
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:21,913
Uh...

510
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,316
Well, you're no monkeying around.

511
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,380
Why?

512
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,030
It's very simple, this question.

513
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:30,470
Um... hmm.

514
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:33,523
Well, I'm 22.
I guess I would say me.

515
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:38,491
I suppose you're honest.

516
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:40,154
Well, don't you think
that you're the center

517
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:42,490
or that you should be the center,

518
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:45,590
thinking with your own head,
talking with your own mouth?

519
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:46,592
Yeah.

520
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,683
But there are things in the world, too,
that are important.

521
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,190
I'm not denying that.

522
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,963
That's not what I'm saying.

523
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:58,814

00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:49,484
And no formal training?
Remarkable.

634
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:52,101
# Sayin' we'll meet
all your demands #

635
00:34:52,064 --> 00:34:56,228
# But we'll shout from the bow
"Your days are numbered" #

636
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,460
# And like Pharaoh's tribe #

637
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:00,334
# They'll be drownin' in the tide #

638
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:02,051
# And like Goliath #

639
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,113
# They'll be conquered #

640
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,145
- Just terrific!
- Fantastic!

641
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:14,284
That was a fine job.

642
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,971
- Thank you, thank you.
- That's just wonderful.

643
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:17,771
How about another helping?

644
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,791
- Woody?
- Yes, ma'am.

645
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:20,977
More wine, Woody?

646
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:22,227
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

647
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:24,079
Do you know
what your plans are from here?

648
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,837
My only real plan
is to become a singer,

649
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,658
a real singer on television,

650
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:31,083
either that or a kind of voice
of the people, you know?

651
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:32,177
Interesting.

652
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:34,364
Because I've been
writing me some songs,

653
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:37,339
songs about what's going on.

654
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,520
And I'm going
to take these songs,

655
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,100
and I'm going to head
straight to Hollywood.

656
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:43,662
Going to make it big just like Elvis Presley.

657
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,530
Well, Woody, I wouldn't be surprised

658
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,644
if you did just that.

659
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,365
- There you are, Woody.
- Thank you.

660
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:52,861
And don't you go rushing off anyplace
until you feel 1000/0, you hear?

661
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:53,844
Yes, ma'am.

662
00:35:53,872 --> 00:35:56,705
Have to mother you while you still have
a roof over your head.

663
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,180
Who on earth?

664
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:02,408
- Are you expecting a call?
- No.

665
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,047
So, Hollywood?

666
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:07,270
- Hello?
- Not Tin Pan Alley?

667
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:10,482
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

668
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:12,116
Minnesota?

669
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:14,813
Well, how could...

670
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,900
Dr. Field, yes.

671
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,685
Would you hold on
just a moment, please?

672
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,731
Esther?

673
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:23,660
It's a juvenile center in Minnesota.

674
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:24,540
A what?

675
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:26,935
Something... Corrections.

676
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:29,396
You talk to 'em, Jack.

677
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,463
They think it's Woody.

678
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,384
What do they know about Woody?

679
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,634
They said they're looking for some...

680
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,374
a juvenile, but...

681
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:42,741
some state, you know, fugitive.

682
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:45,183
Certainly not Woody.

683
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:54,701

685
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,294
Now, I'm just one walker that's stood way up

686
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:07,756
and looked way down
across plenty o' sights

687
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,676
in all their veiled
and nakedest seasons.

688
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:15,252
Sighting it, hearing it,

689
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,472
seeing and feeling
and breathing it in.

690
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:22,687
Sucking down on it.

691
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,757
Rubbing it all
in the pores of my skin,

692
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,542
and the wind between my eyes

693
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,897
knocking honey in my comb.

694
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:32,487
Whoa.

You could hear it.

715
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:47,680
I was pulling up
chunks of grass with my fist

716
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,326
and feeling like we were splitting apart.

717
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,847
And... And, yeah, I asked him

718
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,874
what did he think
made us so different?

719
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:57,799
And he said it was simple.

720
00:39:57,745 --> 00:40:00,270
You know, I thought
that I could change things,

721
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,833
and he knew that no one could.

722
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:04,242
You know, look at Kennedy.

723
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:10,604

726
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,252
Thank you.

727
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,238
I wanna accept this
on behalf of, uh,

728
00:40:19,223 --> 00:40:21,885
everybody that
went down to Cuba.

729
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,187
First of all,
because you're all young, you know?

730
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:27,899
And it's took me
a long time to get young,

731
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:30,889
and now I consider myself young.

732
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:33,902
And I'm proud of it.

733
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,375
It ain't old people's world out there.

734
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:40,408
I mean, you all
shouldn't even be here.

735
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:46,328
I mean... it's not like before.

736
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:47,896
There's no black or white,

737
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:50,336
no more left wing,
right wing, you know?

738
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:53,238
There's up wing
and there's down wing,

739
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,583
which is why I think that, you know,

740
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:58,926
this man who shot President Kennedy,

741
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:01,877
this Lee Oswald,

742
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:07,765
I think I saw something
that... that he felt... in me.

743
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,550
Hey, but I'm just saying...

744
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:16,773
You can boo, but booing's
got nothing to do with it!

745
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,302
<i>They didn't understand me,
you know,</i>

746
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,834
because they got mind blinders on.

747
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:20,870
All they see is the cause

748
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:22,370
and how they use people
for their cause.

749
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,967
And now they're trying
to use me for something.

750
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:25,966
The want me to... want me
to carry a picket sign

751
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,396
and have my picture taken,

752
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,050
be a good little nigger, you know,

753
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:33,040
and not mess up their little game.

754
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,970
All they want from me
is finger-pointing songs.

755
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,275
I only got ten fingers.

<i>I nearly killed myself

772
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:49,849
<i>And then I wrote it.</i>

773
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:54,650
<i>It was like swimming in lava.</i>

791
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:16,423
Hey what's wrong?

792
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:17,699
Man, what are you going to do?

793
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:18,946
What are you going to do up there?

794
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,730
I'm going to cut
the goddamn... lead!

795
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,971
Sorry for everything I've done,

796
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,994
and, uh, I hope
to remedy it soon.

797
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,071
- Shit!
- Crap!

798
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,564
<i>Garbage! J'accuse!</i>

799
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,129
Ah, it's just like
he's trying to conform

800
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:06,726
to some sort of popular taste

801
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,558
with this incredibly
corny group behind him,

802
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:13,466
but he's just... he's just prostituting himself.

803
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,440
He's... He's just
changed completely.

804
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,051
He's changed from what he was.

805
00:45:19,014 --> 00:45:21,642
He's not the same
as he was at first.

806
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:23,768
Nothing but a fake neurotic

807
00:45:23,751 --> 00:45:24,979
crawling through the gutter.

808
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:26,796
If that is the way
he walks through a gutter,

809
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,727
I would rather walk with my head up
through a gutter than like him,

810
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,140
crawling through the bloody gutter,

811
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,442
just making a pile out of it!

812
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,857
That's what he is doing!

813
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,699
He is just making a pile out of it!

814
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,417
I kinda liked getting
blasted out of my skin.

815
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:44,018
I think he's evil.

816
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:46,506
And we were his biggest fans.

817

It's not folk, it's not rock,

but a brand-new way
of telling it like it is.

827
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,838
And Jude Quinn is definitely what's happening.

828
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,019
Here he comes now.

829
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,304
Mr. Quinn! Mr. Quinn!

830
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:37,119
Have you got a word
for your fans?

00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:38,706

837
00:46:58,912 --> 00:46:59,844
Thank you.

838
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:01,134
Why do you think you were booed

839
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:03,587
at your recent appearance
in New England?

840
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:07,284
Well, um, I f...

841
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,898
I figure there's
a little boo in all of us.

842
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,952
- Jude!
- Mr. Quinn, Mr. Quinn!

843
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:12,776
Is it true you no longer
sing protest songs?

844
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:14,034
Who said that?

845
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:14,985
I didn't say that.

846
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:18,881
I was just, uh... I read somewhere
that you no longer do the protesting.

847
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:25,062
Well, that's all I ever do is protest.

848
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:26,698
Do you have a message?

849
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:29,083
Do you?

850
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,064
I mean, are you trying
to accomplish anything?

851
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,074
Am I trying to accomplish anything?

852
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:35,226
Are you trying to change
the world or anything?

853
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,508
What am I trying to change
the word, did you say? Is...

854
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:40,941
You know, are you trying
to push your idealism to the people?

855
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:43,208
- No.
- Excuse me, Mr. Quinn.

856
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,875
Perhaps you could tell us...

857
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:46,367
Do you have a match?

858
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:49,350
...how many people who labor
in the same musical vineyards

859
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:50,225
in which you toil...

860
00:47:50,254 --> 00:47:51,915
That's very pretty.

861
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:54,284
How many would you say
are protest singers today?

862
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:59,887
That is, people who protest
against the social state we live in?

863
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:01,287
Uh, how many?

864
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,697
Yes. Are there many?

865
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:07,227
Yeah, um...

866
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:10,488
I-I think there's about 136.

867
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:13,411
<i>Mr. Quinn, Keenan Jones
from Culture Beat.</i>

868
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:18,165
As someone symbolic of the protest
movement among young people,

869
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:20,268
some have questioned,
given your latest recordings,

870
00:48:20,246 --> 00:48:23,272
whether or not you still care
about people as you once did.

871
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:27,343
Yeah, but, you know,

872
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:30,314
we all have our own definitions
of all those words.

873
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:34,565
"Care" and "people..."

874
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,018
Well, I think we all know
the definition of people.

875
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:39,387
Yeah.

876
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:41,152
Do we?

877
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:42,739
Well, is it your belief,
then, that folk music

878
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:45,808
has, perchance, failed to achieve
its goals with the Negro cause

879
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,349
or the cause of peace?

880
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,758
You know, saying "cause of peace"

881
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:54,622
is just like saying...
like a hunk of butter.

882
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,927
You know, I don't know
how you can listen to anybody

883
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:59,126
who wants you to believe
is dedicated to the hunk

884
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,298
and not the butter.

885
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:02,050
I'm not sure I follow.

886
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:07,077
You know, I didn't come
out of some cereal box.

887
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:08,607
There's... There's no one out there

888
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:10,272
who's ever going to be
converted by a song.

889
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:14,609
There's no Phil Ochs song
that's going to keep

890
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,958
a movement moving
nor the picket line picketing.

891
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:20,862
His songs are acts
of personal conscience,

892
00:49:20,806 --> 00:49:24,708
like burning a draft card
or burning yourself.

893
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:28,415
Doesn't do a damn thing
except disassociate you

894
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:31,024
and your audience from
all the evils of the world.

895
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:34,317
I refuse to be
disassociated from that.

896
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:38,592
All these people, you know,

897
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:40,436
sitting around being offended
by their own meaninglessness.

898
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:41,587
What am I asking?

899
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,342
I'm asking for your
goddamn hotel security

900
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,790
to keep these assholes out of the lobby.

901
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:48,797
What? What?

902
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,117
And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes
and most stupid persons

903
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:54,412
I've ever spoken to
in my life, understand?

904
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:56,044
What?

905
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:57,947
Well, I certainly hope so.

906
00:49:57,936 --> 00:49:59,631
Son of a bitch English bastard.

907
00:49:59,632 --> 00:50:00,826
Meaningless is right.

908
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:02,941
Do you think the average cat
who works eight hours a day

909
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:05,625
gives a tit what I do?

910
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,384
Anyway, it's not going
to keep me in heaven

911
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,569
or out of the fiery furnace, that's for sure.

912
00:50:11,507 --> 00:50:13,134
Not gonna make me happy.

913
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,903
Let me see that.

914
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:21,742
Whoa, there she is again,
your little debutante.

915

She's queen of the underground,

She's here?

924

So you dated her, did you?

925
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,084
Never. That girl's trouble.

926
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:49,722
Will you invite her to the party?

927
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:52,489
Sure. I always invite trouble.

00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,728
If you know what's good for you, you'll turn
right around and get the fuck out of here.

950
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,225
Come on. Hey!

951
00:52:18,197 --> 00:52:19,425
Hurry up.

952
00:52:19,445 --> 00:52:22,141
Jason! You got to get in here, man.
You better hurry.

953
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:25,037
- It's your boy I want.
- Put that knife down. You hear me?

954
00:52:25,879 --> 00:52:27,710
- Hey, man.
- Jesus Christ.

955
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:30,400
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
What are you gonna do? Stab us all?

956
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,760
It's his fault! He's the one.

957
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:33,923
Stabbing truth in the eye.

958
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:35,572
I'm listening.
What's the truth, man?

959
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:38,240
Easy, easy, easy.
Now just put that down...

960
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:39,999
No! Walk away.

961
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:42,189
- Just relax.
- Hey, back up.

962
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:43,763
Either be groovy or leave, man.

963
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,465
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

964
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:53,877
Everybody all right?

965
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,254
- Thanks for steppin' in.
- My pleasure.

966
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:59,811
Just like a woman.

967
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:28,366
<i># They sat together in the park #</i>

968
00:53:28,296 --> 00:53:31,754
<i># As the evening sky grew dark #</i>

969
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:34,886
<i># She looked at him
and he felt a spark #</i>

970
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:37,760
<i># Tingle to his bones #</i>

971
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:41,132
<i># 'Twas then he felt alone #</i>

972
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:45,297
<i># And wished that he'd gone straight #</i>

973
00:53:45,196 --> 00:53:49,098
<i># And watched out
for a simple twist of fate #</i>

974
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,797
<i># They walked along
by the old canal #</i>

975
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:58,195
<i># A little confused, I remember well #</i>

976
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,287
Claire! Claire, honey,
you got to meet someone.

977
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:03,070
Hang on a second. Am I shitting you?

978
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:06,426
- Dirty son of a gun.
- Claire, this is Sidney Green.

979
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:08,322
A very bad old friend of mine.

980
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:09,796
Hello.

981
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,539
She's a doll. Actress.

982
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,099
Uh, no, a painter. She's unbelievable.

983
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,399
And Sid's a collector.

984
00:54:15,412 --> 00:54:17,380
What do you paint, honey?

985
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:20,698
Oh, they're... They're abstracts,

986
00:54:20,629 --> 00:54:22,597
- most of what I do.
- She's French?

987
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:25,016
Aw, for cryin' out loud.

988
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:28,077
Oh, oh. It's Mailer.

989
00:54:28,023 --> 00:54:30,651
Norman Mailer?

990
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,722
Abstracts, huh?

991
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,432
<i># People tell me it's a sin #</i>

992
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:49,595
<i># To know and feel too much within #</i>

993
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:52,696
<i># I still believe she was my twin #</i>

994
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:55,334
<i># But I lost the ring #</i>

995
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:58,821
<i># She was born in the spring #</i>

996
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:02,711
<i># But I was born too late #</i>

997
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:06,321
<i># Blame it on a simple twist of fate #</i>

998
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:22,733
Silence, experience shows,

999
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:26,351
is what terrifies people most.

1000
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,495
If he said he'll be here, he'll be here.

1001
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:48,173
It's just such a terribly important booking.

1002
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:49,691
Keenan seldom interviews.

1003
00:55:49,702 --> 00:55:51,226
He's really more of
an opinion maker really,

1004
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:54,765
on the telly, so, there's
apt to be no time at all.

1005
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:57,323
Is there a handler?
Someone who looks after him?

1006
00:55:57,288 --> 00:56:00,018
I told you, he and John
and Paul and George...

1007
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:02,946
Yes, but did he ever get back?

1008
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:04,754
- Pardon me.
- What?

1009
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:07,270
Do you know if Jude
Quinn is in attendance?

1010
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,266
The country-western singer?

1011
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,699
No time for autographs, dearie.

1012
00:56:11,979 --> 00:56:14,243
- What's that over there?
- Where?

1013
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:19,833
Do the Watusi, John!

1014
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,478
Whoa!

1015
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,981
Mr. Quinn?

1016
00:56:26,991 --> 00:56:28,856
Mr. Quinn, yoo-hoo.

1017
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,348
Yes, Mr. Quinn, hello!
We're all just here at the car. No worries.

1018
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,952
Good. Sayonara.

1019
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:45,570
Mother. Mother.

1020
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:47,579
Oh, Mr. Quinn! What a privilege

1021
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,131
to have in our midst...

1022
00:56:49,142 --> 00:56:53,135
...a true visionary, and such a splendid
example to the youth.

1023
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:56,574
And such marvelous songs.
So truly wonderful.

1024
00:56:56,503 --> 00:56:57,800
- Howdy.
- Our dear friend,

1025
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,840
Carolyn Hester, the folk singer?

1026
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:02,266
She was saying,
just the other day, how liberating

1027
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:04,963
what you're doing really is
for all... Mr. Quinn, hello!

1028
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,049
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry.

1029
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:09,867
Carolyn said that? You tell Carolyn
to come see me anytime,

1030
00:57:09,819 --> 00:57:11,719
now that she's, uh, liberated.

1031
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:14,733
Jude, you know, like in the song
"Generation Dungeon,"

1032
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:16,549
when you say "he has the eyes of a camel

1033
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:19,203
- and sleeps on a hook..." That's Victor, right?
- Mr. Quinn!

1034
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:22,465
'Cause I saw a picture of him once
in a magazine, smoking Camels,

1035
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:24,195
which I know
Danny Ronk used to smoke,

1036
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,124
but then he switched
to Lucky Strikes in '64.

1037
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:28,739
Mr. Quinn, we really ought to hurry.
Everyone's at the car!

1038
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:30,194
<i>...till early '65.
- Norman, Mona, Sammy...</i>

1039
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:32,802
Sammy? Who's Sammy?

1040
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:35,260
Sonny. Sonny Dover.

1041
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,293
The central doyen of the inner circle,

1042
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:39,341
and Jude's oldest ally.

1043
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,629
He plays maracas
on "Medicine Sunday."

1044
00:57:41,603 --> 00:57:44,265
Judey! Lover boy! Ah!

1045
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:48,790
Two words on Shakespeare,
Mr. Quinn, for our listeners.

1046
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,736
Two words?

1047
00:57:50,725 --> 00:57:52,522
Raving queen,

1048
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:54,713
and cosmic amphetamine brain.

1049
00:57:54,695 --> 00:57:56,890
I dig Shakespeare.

1050
00:57:56,872 --> 00:57:58,203
I have a question for Mr. Quinn.

1051
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:00,150
Oh, Keenan, please
forgive us. Mr. Quinn,

1052
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:02,366
allow me to introduce to you
Mr. Keenan Jones,

1053
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,312
arts editor and host of the BBC.

1054
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:05,424
I remember you.

1055
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,748
Yes, I was going to ask
Mr. Quinn why he insists

1056
00:58:07,722 --> 00:58:11,180
on putting us and the rest
of the world on so?

1057
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:13,709
Some might be persuaded
to doubt his sincerity.

1058
00:58:13,676 --> 00:58:16,907
Well, who said I was sincere?

1059
00:58:16,844 --> 00:58:20,211
Are you saying you're not sincere?

1060
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:23,042
No more than you, you know?

1061
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,548
No more sincere than you are.

1062
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:30,223
See, you just want me to say
what you want me to say.

1063
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:38,439
You might think

1064
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,680
nothing can reach
those tens of thousands,

1065
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:43,184
living by the dollar.

1066
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,359
But you'd be wrong.

1067
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,879
Hey. What are you doin' here?

1068
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:02,196
You alone?

1069
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:05,229
Now, why would that be
any concern of yours?

1070
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:09,136
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

1071
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:11,918
- Nothing happened.
- Fine. Nothing happened.

1072
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:16,464
Oh, come on.
I was straight with you.

1073
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:18,711
I thought you had no recollection.

1074
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:22,815
Look, I can't recall
San Francisco at all.

1075
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:24,618
And I can't really
remember El Paso,

1076
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,905
but you shouldn't take
it all so personal.

1077
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,609
I don't, believe me.

1078
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:32,935
My current situation far precedes
anything from the past.

1079
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,510
But you never know how
the past will turn out.

1080
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:38,916
Sorry.

1081
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:41,009
But your kisses are nothing like his.

1082
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,859
I bet.

1083
00:59:42,852 --> 00:59:45,980
- Anyone I know?
- Good one.

1084
00:59:45,924 --> 00:59:49,451
No, your lucky tongue will not decay me.

1085
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:51,907
Fine, you take your glands,
and your medallions,

1086
00:59:51,878 --> 00:59:54,039
and make love for once, freely.

1087
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,151
So that's what you think
you have over everyone.

1088
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:02,089
Freedom.

1089
01:00:04,169 --> 01:00:06,967
I just got to clean up a little bit.

1090
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:10,373
And I'll be fine.

1091
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:12,939
Here's a tip: Use your fists.

1092
01:00:13,803 --> 01:00:15,771
Very funny, Coco.

1093
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:22,011
Hey, Coco!

1094
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,958
Coco!

1095
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:34,004
You look and sound very tired, very ill.

1096
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:35,596
Is this your normal state?

1097
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,364
I take that as an insult.

1098
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:41,890
Do you suffer from sore eyes,
groovy foreheads, and curly hair?

1099
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:43,713
Take Zoomdom!

1100
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,103
Hey. Hey, isn't that
what's-his-name, the poet?

1101
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:50,787
- Ginsberg?
- Allen Ginsberg?

1102
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh, my God! It is!

1103
01:00:54,038 --> 01:00:55,596
Wait a minute.

1104
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,938
Hey! Allen thought
that was you in there!

1105
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:07,084
I don't think you two have met.

1106
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:10,557
- Hi.
- Hey.

1107
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:12,322
Allen, tell him what you said to that reporter,

1108
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:15,012
the one that asked
if you thought that Jude had sold out.

1109
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:16,303
<i>What, they're asking you?</i>

1110
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:20,912
I said I didn't know.
Perhaps you sold out to God.

1111
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,234
What's that even mean?

1112
01:01:24,158 --> 01:01:27,321
Well, if your mission
was to see whether

1113
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:29,959
you could do great art on a juke box,

1114
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,854
well, you know, then we all benefited.

1115
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,174
Profited, you said, by his coercion.

1116
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:40,025
That was it. So. What now?

1117
01:01:39,938 --> 01:01:43,567
Now? What's left?

1118
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:47,223
Oh, my salvation?

1119
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,234
Well, see what we could do.

1120
01:01:55,975 --> 01:01:58,136
Oh, he'll give it to you!

1121
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,228
That was Allen Ginsberg, man!

1122
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,436
See ya later, Allen Ginsberg.

1123
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:11,205
Would you say, then,

1124
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,177
that the collective struggles

1125
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:14,467
of the color discrimination
or the war have failed,

1126
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,502
or as I believe you inferred earlier,

1127
01:02:16,492 --> 01:02:18,517
do you think it's the process
itself that's at fault?

1128
01:02:18,509 --> 01:02:22,240
Who cares what I think?
I'm not the president.

1129
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:25,525
I'm not some shepherd.
I'm just a storyteller, man.

1130
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,718
- It's all I am.
- Well, certainly.

1131
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,129
But as someone
who once cared deeply,

1132
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,997
as a storyteller, as...

1133
01:02:32,944 --> 01:02:36,778
for social justice, equality...
certainly you still care as a human being.

1134
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:41,758
Well, why? Why?

1135
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:45,067
I mean, what do you care?

1136
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:48,045
If I care, or I don't care, what's it to you?

1137
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:53,081
All right, what if I said
I never cared about, you know, folk music?

1138
01:02:53,014 --> 01:02:54,914
About, you know, protest songs?

1139
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:56,734
It was all about jumping into a scene.

1140
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:02,206
You know, I was never
gonna stay there. I mean, I just...

1141
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:04,970
I knew I could do it
better than anybody else.

1142
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,888
Well, I don't believe you.

1143
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:09,274
No, I mean, you know,
what matters to me...

1144
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:11,836
you know, it matters
what's happening now.

1145
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:14,202
Does it matter to you when
songs you're writing now

1146
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,196
are being used as recruitment tools

1147
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:19,021
for militant street gangs,
like the all-Negro faction in the United States?

1148
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:19,996
Oh, yeah.

1149
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,724
A group that promotes precisely
the kind of violence

1150
01:03:21,725 --> 01:03:23,192
your earlier songs oppose?

1151
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:25,666
If you're asking me, man, am I a member
of the Black Panther Party,

1152
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:28,623
the answer's no.

1153
01:03:30,495 --> 01:03:34,295
Man, I can't really tell you how I care.

1154
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:36,109
Well, I presume at the very least

1155
01:03:36,098 --> 01:03:39,625
that you care something
about what you sing every night.

1156
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:42,887
What are you...
How can I answer that,

1157
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,481
if you got the nerve to ask me?

1158
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:48,242
I mean, you've got a lot of nerve,
asking me a question like that.

1159
01:03:48,196 --> 01:03:50,960
- Do you ask the Beatles that?
- Do I...

1160
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,715
- Or Mr. Eve of Destruction?
- Would you ask Barry McGuire that?

1161
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,298
I have to ask, because you have the nerve
to question whether I care.

1162
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:58,458
I'm not questioning you because I don't
expect any answers from you.

1163
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,465
Maybe Victor Mature.
He looks like Victor Mature.

1164
01:04:00,456 --> 01:04:03,619
More like Elsa Lanchester,
man, with a North Mexican kind of thing.

1165
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,085
That's very protest-y, man.
You know, it's very very protest-y.

1166
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:09,390
You know, I am convinced of one thing.
You either do care about nothing at all,

1167
01:04:09,322 --> 01:04:11,415
or tremendously much
that people think so.

1168
01:04:11,467 --> 01:04:14,493
And you ask for my time?

1169
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:18,576
Mr. Quinn, we really do need you in...

1170
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:22,102
Listen, I know more about you, right,
than you will ever know about me.

1171
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:25,158
You think I give a crumpet
what you write in your lousy paper?

1172
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:27,969
Now, I don't need to look to someone else,
man, to tell me I'm good.

1173
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:30,012
Slaughter me, for all I care.

1174
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,626
I refuse to be hurt.

1175
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,623
Mr. Quinn, we really
do need you in the car.

1176
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:34,914
Hey, man.

1177
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:37,124
You refuse feeling deeply about anything.

1178
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:39,938
It's clear to anyone
how entirely self-conscious you are,

1179
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,289
in everything you do.

1180
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:43,130
- That's enough!
- Feeling deeply?

1181
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:45,785
That's what this is about?

1182
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:49,114
What precisely, please do tell,
am I supposed to be feeling, huh?

1183
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:51,308
I'm simply referring
to standard emotions:

1184
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:54,482
Pain, remorse, love.

1185
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:57,255
Yeah, I have none of those feelings.

1186

1240
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,256
I missed it.

1241
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:50,496
Bobby, now you ain't hearin' me, man.

1242
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:52,814
No, we are the geeks. You dig?

1243
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:54,381
But then why is that cool?

1244
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,824
No, man, we are the ones
being paraded around

1245
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,621
like some sort of circus freaks.

1246
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,081
"Come on up and see Harlem,
Mr. Jones,

rolled up tight."

1248
01:09:02,135 --> 01:09:04,296
This song is hell, man.
You've got to understand,

1249
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,148
this song is saying
a hell of a lot about society.

1250
01:09:08,057 --> 01:09:10,082
All power to all people,
man, that's what it's saying.

1251
01:09:10,073 --> 01:09:11,335
- I missed it again.
- Bobby.

1252
01:09:11,354 --> 01:09:13,151
Aw, Bobby nothing.
Just play it again, Huey.

1253
01:09:13,147 --> 01:09:15,547
Let's play it one more time.

1254
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:19,531
# Because something
is happenin' here #

1255

1257
01:09:25,406 --> 01:09:27,897
# Mr. Jones? #

1258
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,998
You know, this is music.

1259
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:54,852
You know, what you're hearing
is not English music, all right?

1260
01:09:55,717 --> 01:09:57,412
You've never really heard
American music before.

1261
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:01,882
And what you hear, obviously, right now,
doesn't have a name.

1262
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:05,289
It's words, all right? And sounds.

1263
01:10:05,224 --> 01:10:08,125
If it's something
you disagree with, that's great.

1264
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:11,225
Judas!

1265
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:18,376
I don't believe you.

1266
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,373
Judas!

1267
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:25,575
Come up here and say that.

1268
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:29,796
You're liars, all of you.

1269
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,601
I accept chaos.

1270
01:10:46,548 --> 01:10:48,448
I'm not sure whether it accepts me.

1271
01:10:56,182 --> 01:11:00,050
We hadn't spoken in a long while.

1272
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:04,589
I think he was involved
with someone, actually...

1273
01:11:04,472 --> 01:11:06,235
He said something to me on the phone

1274
01:11:06,232 --> 01:11:08,928
about angels hanging off of buildings,

1275
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,414
which was frightening.

1276
01:11:11,386 --> 01:11:13,411
I thought he was hallucinating.

1277
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:17,578
That was the last I heard.

1278
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:22,059
It was like what people say
about Billy the Kid...

1279
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,577
that he really just dodged
a bullet and went into hiding.

1280
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:29,848
And Jack, he always
loved Billy the Kid.

1281
01:11:29,759 --> 01:11:32,660
Whoo!

1282
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:37,841
Henry.

1283
01:11:47,075 --> 01:11:48,633
What the hell's wrong with you?

1284
01:11:52,677 --> 01:11:55,544
<i>Paper said Pat Garrett tracked me down.</i>

1285
01:11:55,493 --> 01:11:57,324
<i>Stopped me dead.</i>

1286
01:11:57,318 --> 01:12:00,617
<i>That outlaws always die.</i>

1287
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:03,384
<i>Only a fool would believe
what they read in the papers.</i>

1288
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:06,234
Come on.

1289
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:18,338
<i>Here, I'm invisible.</i>

1290
01:12:19,692 --> 01:12:21,592
Come on, now.

1291
01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:29,466
<i>Even to myself.</i>

1292
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:57,205
Henry! Calm yourself down.

1293
01:12:57,174 --> 01:12:58,402
Gettin' everybody zigaboo here.

1294
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:01,852
Henry. Henry! Henry!

1295
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:04,714
Come on back here! Henry!

1296
01:13:04,664 --> 01:13:06,655
You get back here!

1297
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:11,163
<i>And here, by the road
where nobody goes,</i>

1298
01:13:11,097 --> 01:13:12,621
<i>where it causes no worry,</i>

1299
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:16,365
<i>where the show must go on,</i>

1300
01:13:16,283 --> 01:13:18,251
<i>is where I'll die.</i>

1301
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:34,759
Henry! Come back here!

1302
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,950
Henry! Come back here!

1303
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,894
<i># There must be some kind
of way out of here #</i>

1304
01:14:35,824 --> 01:14:39,658
<i># Said the joker to the thief #</i>

1305
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:43,164
<i># There's too much confusion #</i>

1306
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:47,083
<i># I can't get no relief #</i>

1307
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:49,657
<i># Two riders are approaching #</i>

1308
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,351
<i># And the wind began to howl #</i>

1309
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,010
Henry! Henry!

1310
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:11,604
God damn it, get back here!

1311
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:13,874
Hey! Come back, Henry!

1312
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,283
Come on, now.

1313
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:19,882
<i>How long had it been?</i>

1314
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:21,165
<i>I couldn't even say.</i>

1315
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,491
<i>The day I arrived looks a lot like today.</i>

1316
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,022
<i>Least, that's how it seemed at the time.</i>

1317
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:59,039
Homer, is that you?

1318
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:01,482
Mr. B.

1319
01:16:05,192 --> 01:16:07,126
What's the trouble, there?

1320
01:16:07,112 --> 01:16:09,307
A useless bag of thumbs what I am.

1321
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:13,777
There you go.

1322
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:16,832
Sellin' off whatnot.

1323
01:16:16,778 --> 01:16:18,939
Mm-hmm.

1324
01:16:18,923 --> 01:16:23,121
Well, ain't seen no
yellow dog runnin' loose

1325
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,681
by any chance, have you?

1326
01:16:25,613 --> 01:16:27,513
Old Henry tore off on me.

1327
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,833
- What, she get spooked?
- Seemed to.

1328
01:16:29,806 --> 01:16:31,569
Why? Critters know what's goin' on.

1329
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:34,695
- What do they know?
- Well, for one, they know

1330
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:36,470
Shadow Valley's gettin'
blown to kingdom come.

1331
01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:41,026
What, that old highway plan?
No, never had a chance.

1332
01:16:40,913 --> 01:16:43,074
You mean, you really ain't heard?

1333
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,423
Heard what?

1334
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:48,329
Mr. B, that plan's official.
It's gone through.

1335
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,505
Last Tuesday, they all come.
Old Man Garrett and them bunch?

1336
01:16:50,484 --> 01:16:51,951
Wavin' all sorts of papers?

1337
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,890
- I never seen such a stupor.
- What are you talkin' about?

1338
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:55,901
- Wh-What's official?
- Six-laner headed

1339
01:16:55,894 --> 01:16:57,452
straight through
the heart of Shadow Valley.

1340
01:16:57,461 --> 01:16:59,929
Commissioner Garrett done
give us 30 days come November.

1341
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:02,362
Why haven't I heard
nothing about this?

1342
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:05,023
Mr. B, you don't get out much.

1343
01:17:04,984 --> 01:17:08,351
Don't sound credible to me, Homer.

1344
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:13,006
What have people been saying?
They been doin' anything?

1345
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:15,320
Well, first Charley Harper,
the zookeeper?

1346
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,690
Shot hisself in the face in front of them

1347
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:19,627
three maiden sisters
and two bachelor brothers.

1348
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:21,545
Them all went insane on account.

1349
01:17:21,532 --> 01:17:23,329
Been five hangings, six Phenobarbitals,

1350
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:25,623
and, well...

1351
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:27,428
you familiar with young Clarice Henry?

1352
01:17:27,422 --> 01:17:29,083
Mrs. Henry, the Captain's girl?

1353
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:31,452
Of course I am.

1354
01:17:31,423 --> 01:17:34,859
Well, what?

1355
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,482
The Captain found her.

1356
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:38,913
Throat cut.
By her own hand, they say.

1357
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:44,333
Well, where you fixin' to?

1358
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,589
Well, if it's true,

1359
01:17:47,523 --> 01:17:50,515
gonna pay my respects
to Captain and Mrs. Henry.

1360
01:17:50,468 --> 01:17:52,936
This whole thing's sounds
fishy to me. You comin'?

1361
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,892
Oh, no. No, not today.

1362
01:17:56,069 --> 01:17:59,869
- Shameful day.
- Suit yourself.

1363
01:17:59,782 --> 01:18:04,481
Anyway, Charley gone,
and all of his brothers,

1364
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:05,951
who's mindin' the zoo?

1365
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,031
Homer?

1366
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:14,238
<i>1968.</i>

1367
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,480
<i>America watched its war plan collapse,</i>

1368
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,392
<i>its cities burn, its youth erupt,</i>

1369
01:18:18,379 --> 01:18:21,871
<i>its president crumble,
its greatest leaders fall slain.</i>

1370
01:18:21,804 --> 01:18:23,965
<i>And there we were.</i>

1371
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,711
<i>All alone with Richard Nixon.</i>

1372
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,338
No. No. Not at all.

1373
01:18:29,358 --> 01:18:32,555
Come on, face it. Face it, it's over.

1374
01:18:32,495 --> 01:18:34,759
All these groups
promoting the movement

1375
01:18:34,735 --> 01:18:37,727
are so full of their own
president, vice president,

1376
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:40,013
- and secretary bullshit.
- Not at all.

1377
01:18:39,985 --> 01:18:41,543
They just think
it's all about them, man.

1378
01:18:41,553 --> 01:18:43,612
All these right-wing corporate hawks

1379
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:45,933
plotting to invade the world,
and drug us to death

1380
01:18:45,906 --> 01:18:48,170
with happy pills and the Bible.

1381
01:18:48,146 --> 01:18:50,979
- It ain't gonna happen.
- I never said that.

1382
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:54,162
What are you talking about?
You say it all the time.

1383
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:56,968
I don't know. I think we all agree

1384
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:58,908
that the world is
a terribly fucked-up place,

1385
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,928
but I happen to feel that
there's something to be done

1386
01:19:01,879 --> 01:19:04,905
to change the situation, and you...

1387
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:06,379
don't really sound like you...

1388
01:19:06,391 --> 01:19:09,827
He doesn't. Well...

1389
01:19:09,753 --> 01:19:13,587
Well, you want to know
why you think that?

1390
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:16,467
That, uh, something can
be done to change things?

1391
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,708
Why?

1392
01:19:18,683 --> 01:19:21,311
- Because you're a chick.
- Oh, Jesus, Robbie.

1393
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:23,210
What's that supposed to mean?

1394
01:19:23,196 --> 01:19:24,891
Oh, forget it.

1395
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:30,066
Son of a bitch.

1396
01:19:30,014 --> 01:19:32,505
So you're basically a chauvinist.

1397
01:19:32,478 --> 01:19:35,709
Why? Because I think guys
and chicks are different?

1398
01:19:35,648 --> 01:19:37,115
Come on, that's all I'm saying.

1399
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:38,586
And they are.

1400
01:19:38,592 --> 01:19:41,186
They each have access
to different kinds of pain,

1401
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,314
which is pretty much
why chicks can never be poets.

1402
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:45,492
- Jesus!
- What?

1403
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:46,964
Robbie, please,
you're not serious.

1404
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:48,843
That's the most
preposterous thing I've ever heard.

1405
01:19:48,835 --> 01:19:49,767
Emily Dickinson.

1406
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:51,457
No, that's not the same.

1407
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,722
As what?

1408
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,765
Whitman, Rimbaud, Shakespeare.

1409
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:58,522
Grace is...
she's really big into Women's Lib.

1410
01:19:58,438 --> 01:20:00,429
Guys and chicks
are different, I'm sorry.

1411
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:03,914
I cannot believe you're actually
saying these things.

1412
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:07,874
I cannot believe you actually think
that women are incapable of...

1413
01:20:07,784 --> 01:20:09,012
Okay, okay, okay.

1414
01:20:09,032 --> 01:20:11,057
Let's try something, huh?

1415
01:20:12,586 --> 01:20:14,417
You write down the nastiest thing
you can think of,

1416
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:18,403
and I'll write down the nastiest thing
I can think of, and...

1417
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,339
- What?
- We'll compare.

1418
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:22,822
- But what does that prove?
- Just do it.

1419
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:24,354
- No.
- Claire, sit down.

1420
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,423
No!

1421
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:26,943
- No, no, no! I want to know...
- Come on, honey.

1422
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:28,390
Play the game!

1423
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:31,595
I want to know what this thing is
that women cannot experience or...

1424
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:33,001
Cut the fucking snaps!

1425
01:20:33,007 --> 01:20:36,568
Or write about or talk about
or what, put on paper?

1426
01:20:36,496 --> 01:20:38,794
What is this place?

1427
01:20:38,769 --> 01:20:40,760
Do you own this place?

1428
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:42,219
Did you invent it?

1429
01:20:42,225 --> 01:20:43,783
Uh, no, honey, I don't.

1430
01:20:43,793 --> 01:20:45,385
Claire, come on,
you're missing the point completely.

1431
01:20:45,394 --> 01:20:47,225
L-I worship women.

1432
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:48,583
Everybody should have one.

1433
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:50,290
- Yeah, fine.
- Claire!

1434
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:53,659
Claire, come on. I was kidding.

1435
01:20:53,588 --> 01:20:54,885
Hey, God's a woman.

1436
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:57,241
Claire.

1437
01:20:58,582 --> 01:20:59,514
Hey!

1438
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:01,271
Fuck you, man!

1439
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:02,601
What are you, fucking deaf?

1440
01:21:02,615 --> 01:21:04,776
I told you to stop fucking doing that.

1441
01:21:05,656 --> 01:21:06,918
Fuck.

1442
01:21:10,841 --> 01:21:12,433
What?

1443
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:15,197
What?

1444
01:21:15,226 --> 01:21:16,693
Nothing.

1445
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:21,060
You've changed.

1446
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:22,018
Yeah. Fuck right, I've changed.

1447
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,840
All of this... these new clothes,

1448
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:25,497
new car, these shades.

1449
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:26,832
You'd never wear shit like that before.

1450
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:28,676
Man, you tell me I've changed

1451
01:21:28,669 --> 01:21:30,694
as if that's all there is to say,
you know,

1452
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:31,675
in this completely different voice

1453
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,178
than the one you had
ten minutes ago.

1454
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:36,338
You know, kids shooting craps
in an L.A. Garage pot,

1455
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:38,446
and you say nothing's perfect.

1456
01:21:38,432 --> 01:21:41,697
I say it again: There are no politics.

1457
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,505
Right.

1458
01:21:45,474 --> 01:21:47,533
Well, then, what the fuck is there?

1459
01:21:47,522 --> 01:21:48,716
Huh?

1460
01:21:50,211 --> 01:21:51,576
Sign language.

1461
01:22:13,865 --> 01:22:15,856
<i>No town ever loved Halloween</i>

1467

and, boys, I sure was slick.

1468
01:22:34,447 --> 01:22:37,507
What the heck
are you supposed to be?

1469
01:22:37,455 --> 01:22:39,582
Well, if you don't know,

- Billy.
- Mr. McCarty.

1481
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:24,189
Ma'am.

1482
01:23:24,156 --> 01:23:28,286
So what's with all this

Seven simple rules for life in hiding.

1488
01:23:49,187 --> 01:23:51,178
One...

1489
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,572
never trust a cop in a raincoat.

1490
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,161
<i>Two...</i>

1491
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:59,692
<i>beware of enthusiasm and of love.</i>

1492
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:03,955
<i>Each is temporary and quick to sway.</i>

1493
01:24:03,847 --> 01:24:06,247
<i>Three...</i>

1494
01:24:06,215 --> 01:24:09,673
<i>when asked if you care
about the world's problems,</i>

1495
01:24:09,608 --> 01:24:13,271
<i>look deep into the eyes of he who asks.</i>

1496
01:24:13,193 --> 01:24:16,094
He will not ask you again.

1497
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:17,737
Pack up the meat, sweet.

1498

It's king for king

Hey. Hey, hey.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1507

Hey!

Please, dear man,

This here's chicken town.

1572
01:28:03,302 --> 01:28:04,894
<i>How are the girls?</i>

1573
01:28:04,902 --> 01:28:06,301
They're great.

1574
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,039
<i>Busy. Enjoying school.</i>

1575
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:10,007
That's great.

1576
01:28:09,992 --> 01:28:11,482
And you?

1577
01:28:11,496 --> 01:28:13,623
<i>Fine. We're all fine.</i>

1578
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:18,774
So, um, which night is boat night?

1579
01:28:20,235 --> 01:28:22,066
Saturday?

1580
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:25,523
<i>- Hello?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

1581
01:28:25,515 --> 01:28:28,382
<i>Saturday, that's, um...</i>

1582
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,631
day after tomorrow.

1583
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,266
<i>Yep.</i>

1584
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:33,237
That's fine.

1585
01:28:33,262 --> 01:28:36,254
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1586
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:38,266
All right, so what time?

1587
01:28:38,255 --> 01:28:41,053
Uh, 11:00?

1588
01:28:41,008 --> 01:28:43,875
Fine.

1589
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:45,656
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1590
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:47,276
Molly, what did I tell you about pickup?

1591
01:28:47,282 --> 01:28:48,772
<i>- Upstairs...
- Or I can get 'em earlier, just...</i>

1592
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:51,254
<i>No, no, no, it's fine, fine.</i>

1593
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:53,619
<i>But please bring those boxes, okay?</i>

1594
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:56,249
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Wait, what boxes?</i>

1595
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:59,272
The photos. My photos?

1596
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,517
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1597
01:29:00,533 --> 01:29:01,591
Fine. Fine, fine.

1598
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:03,953
Molly!

1599
01:29:03,926 --> 01:29:04,915
Okay, I gotta go.

1600
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:05,917
Uh, welcome back.

1601
01:29:05,942 --> 01:29:08,069
<i>Thanks...</i>

1602
01:29:17,754 --> 01:29:19,278
<i>That's right, my friends.</i>

1603
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:21,850
<i>I am holding the only true account,</i>

1604
01:29:21,818 --> 01:29:24,878
<i>so buy it here, read it there.</i>

1605
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:27,592
<i>Buy it here, read it there.</i>

1606
01:29:27,548 --> 01:29:29,948
Buy it here, read it there.

1607
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:33,182
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1608
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,349
a withering saga
of mystery unveiled,

1609
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:40,314
a swan song to America
before Chaplin set sail

1610
01:29:40,223 --> 01:29:43,124
or the children of dawn in crazy duress

1611
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:46,873
ever watched the red sun
without bothering to dress.

1612
01:29:46,785 --> 01:29:49,253
Buy it here, read it there!

1613
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:52,415
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1614
01:29:52,355 --> 01:29:56,052
a withering saga of mystery unveiled,

1615
01:29:55,972 --> 01:29:59,999
a swan song to America
before Chaplin set sail

1616
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:02,639
and the children of dawn
in crazy duress...

1617
01:30:03,557 --> 01:30:06,219
Thief! Somebody stop that man!

1618
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:08,276
Stop!

1619
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:12,172
No!

1620
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,212
# I'm goin' down #

1621
01:30:29,165 --> 01:30:32,601
# To Rose Marie #

1622

# Plain as day #

1625
01:30:45,745 --> 01:30:50,580
# And gives it to me for a song #

1626
01:30:50,451 --> 01:30:54,478
# It's a wicked lie #

1627
01:30:54,388 --> 01:30:57,846

1628
01:30:57,781 --> 01:31:02,582
# Don't everybody got to eat? #

1629
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:07,354
# And I'm just the same #

1630
01:31:07,286 --> 01:31:09,777
# As anyone else #

1631
01:31:09,752 --> 01:31:12,778

1632
01:31:12,728 --> 01:31:15,094

1633
01:31:16,825 --> 01:31:22,821
# Goin' to Acapulco #

1634
01:31:24,059 --> 01:31:28,393
# Goin' on the run #

1635
01:31:29,853 --> 01:31:31,912
# Goin' down #

1636
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:36,565

# And I ain't complainin' none #

1640
01:31:53,795 --> 01:31:57,356
# Well, I can blow my plum #

1641
01:31:57,284 --> 01:31:59,775
# And drink my rum #

1642
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:02,046

1643
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:05,218

1644
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:12,818

1648
01:32:30,765 --> 01:32:36,761
# Yeah #

1649
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,809
# Gonna have some fun #

1650
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,460
<i>Trouble was, I'd grown
partial to the place...</i>

1651
01:32:47,409 --> 01:32:50,503
<i>that sudden smell of fear</i>

1652
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:52,077
<i>and the thrill of waiting up</i>

1653
01:32:52,082 --> 01:32:54,346

1657
01:33:18,649 --> 01:33:20,776
Congratulations, you're a millionaire.

1658
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,662
- Huh?
- They agreed to everything.

1659
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:25,084
- Full guarantees.
- How many dates?

1660
01:33:25,052 --> 01:33:27,452
There's 55 additional, I think it was.

1661
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:28,819
Plus the 30?

1662
01:33:28,828 --> 01:33:30,819
Well, 29, minus tonight is 28.

1663
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,075
That's 83 total.

1664
01:33:32,093 --> 01:33:33,617
83 shows?

1665
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:34,688
Well, it's not really 83 shows...

1666
01:33:34,717 --> 01:33:37,948
Man, I can't do 83 more shows.

1667
01:33:37,887 --> 01:33:40,685
It's going to fucking kill me
doing 83 more shows.

1668
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,199
Who the fuck said I ever
wanted to be a millionaire?

1669
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:45,102
Jude!

1670
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,020
Hey.

1671
01:33:46,049 --> 01:33:47,243
Far out show.

1672
01:33:47,265 --> 01:33:48,232
Thanks, man.

1673
01:33:48,257 --> 01:33:49,986
Grab a throne.

1674
01:33:49,986 --> 01:33:51,078
Really?

1675
01:33:51,106 --> 01:33:52,698
Far out.

1676
01:33:52,706 --> 01:33:56,301
You know Norman, my executioner.

1677
01:33:56,228 --> 01:34:01,996
Norman, this is Brian Jones
from that groovy covers band.

1678
01:34:01,829 --> 01:34:05,265
<i># Now you're walkin' round

Find the drinks.

1683
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:23,458
Look at all these medicines.

1684
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:26,133
Hey, man, what... what are those?

1685
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:27,456
Mandies.

1686
01:34:27,468 --> 01:34:28,526
They make you sleep.

1687
01:34:28,556 --> 01:34:31,992
Sleep! I ain't sleepin'.

1688
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,509
Sleep's for dreamers.

1689
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:36,350
I haven't slept in 30 days, man.

1690
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:39,203
Takes a lot of medicine
to keep up this pace.

1691
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,052
Coco!

1692
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,208
Norman, darling.

1693
01:34:47,153 --> 01:34:49,144
I know I'm a wretch for being late.

1694
01:34:49,138 --> 01:34:52,972
And it was entirely my fault.

1695
01:34:52,883 --> 01:34:54,874
Hey, what's happening?

1696
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,546
I feel like complete shit
is what's happening.

1697
01:34:58,516 --> 01:35:00,507
Well, you don't look it.

1698
01:35:06,454 --> 01:35:08,945
Aw, true love...

1699
01:35:08,918 --> 01:35:11,546
here in the land
of Charles Atlas and the bomb.

1700
01:35:11,511 --> 01:35:13,843
Oh, fuck off.

1701
01:35:13,816 --> 01:35:17,912
She's been kinda... uptight lately.

1702
01:35:17,817 --> 01:35:19,114
Oh, she has.

1703
01:35:19,129 --> 01:35:20,221
Oh, I see.

1704
01:35:20,249 --> 01:35:23,616
Yes, in fact, if you'd like to know,
it's been complete shit.

1705
01:35:23,547 --> 01:35:26,107
- Angelina's been missing for four days.
- Her cat.

1706
01:35:27,323 --> 01:35:29,553
Judey knows who Angelina is,
don't you, Judey?

1707
01:35:29,533 --> 01:35:33,629
If you're asking if I remember
your little pussy, of course I do.

1708
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,137
Charming.

1709
01:35:38,142 --> 01:35:41,407
She has the sweetest little pussy.

1710
01:35:41,343 --> 01:35:42,367
If you don't count the teeth.

1711
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,424
Okay, man.

1712
01:35:43,456 --> 01:35:45,924
Oh, but properly protected.

1713
01:35:48,161 --> 01:35:49,924
Meow!

1714
01:35:49,921 --> 01:35:51,718
- Baby!
- Don't call me that!

1715
01:35:51,714 --> 01:35:53,739
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1716
01:35:53,731 --> 01:35:57,827
I tell you, love and sex are two things

1717
01:35:57,732 --> 01:36:00,667
that really hang people up.

1718
01:36:01,861 --> 01:36:04,728
Why that is...

1719
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:07,703
I'Il... I'll never fully understand.

1720

<i>Death to all those
who would whimper and cry.</i>

1721

Did she... Do you think she...

1722
01:36:18,889 --> 01:36:20,516
Don't worry, man.

1723
01:36:20,522 --> 01:36:23,116
She'll be back.

1724
01:36:23,082 --> 01:36:26,176
Chick's gotta shit on something.

1725
01:36:26,123 --> 01:36:27,385
What do you mean?

1726
01:36:27,404 --> 01:36:30,237
What do I mean?

1727
01:36:30,188 --> 01:36:33,282
Who are you?

1728
01:36:33,229 --> 01:36:34,491
I mean...

1729
01:36:34,509 --> 01:36:38,843
who gave you permission
to even be here?

1730
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,479
You're... You're like a shadow, man.

1731
01:36:45,393 --> 01:36:48,021
Maybe you were hip once,

1732
01:36:47,985 --> 01:36:50,283
but that trick got old, man,

1733
01:36:50,257 --> 01:36:52,282
a long time ago.

1734
01:36:52,274 --> 01:36:54,174
Now, every time
you open your mouth,

1735
01:36:54,163 --> 01:36:58,224
it's like, how long is this gonna take?

1736
01:36:58,132 --> 01:37:01,659
It's not like anyone's
gonna tell you to your face.

1737
01:37:01,588 --> 01:37:03,453
No one wants to deal,
you know, with, like,

1738
01:37:03,445 --> 01:37:06,937
a pathetic situation.

1739
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,394
Guess I'm the asshole, right?

1740
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:12,035
Because I'm the only one
with any balls.

1741
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:22,479
Oh, man, it's sad.

1742
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:26,429
You used to be funny.

1743
01:37:26,395 --> 01:37:28,556
And you honestly think
that chick sees you

1744
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:31,998
as anything but a... as a tool?

1745
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:39,094
Oh, no, you're kidding me.

1746
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:40,799
I can't even watch this.

1747
01:37:40,799 --> 01:37:42,494
<i>The sky isn't yellow.</i>

1748
01:37:42,496 --> 01:37:44,088
<i>It's chicken.</i>

1749
01:37:46,081 --> 01:37:49,710
You know, people said
you could be a real cocksucker.

1750
01:37:49,633 --> 01:37:53,399
Well, it's not what goes
into a man's mouth, babe,

1751
01:37:53,315 --> 01:37:54,247
that defiles it.

1752
01:37:54,275 --> 01:37:57,210
No, it's what comes out.

1753
01:37:57,156 --> 01:38:02,423
Good and evil were invented
by people trapped in scenes.

1754
01:38:05,573 --> 01:38:06,972
Uh!

1755
01:38:06,982 --> 01:38:08,108
Oh, damn it.

1756
01:38:08,134 --> 01:38:09,965
Come on, let's get him outta here.

1757
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:12,188
Get that door!

1758
01:38:26,027 --> 01:38:30,020
<i># I'm beginning to hear voices #</i>

1759
01:38:29,932 --> 01:38:33,129

1760
01:38:33,069 --> 01:38:36,596

1761
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:40,394
<i># And the fields have turned brown #</i>

1762
01:38:40,303 --> 01:38:42,669
<i># 20 miles out of town #</i>

1763

<i># Cold irons bound #</i>

1764
01:39:04,949 --> 01:39:08,043
Son, you better get down
off of that thing.

1765
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,754
You're liable to get yourself killed!

1766
01:39:12,247 --> 01:39:14,875
How does it feel?

1767
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,899
<i># I got to know, Lord #</i>

1768

1769
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:22,495
<i># Death can be the result of the most
underrated things #</i>

1770
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:26,121
Man that is born of woman
is of few days...

1771
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,409
<i>and full of trouble.</i>

1772
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,972
Why don't you do your early stuff?

1773
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,914
<i># Satan whispers to ya #</i>

1774

<i># But when you get tired

1777
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:41,120
<i>Why, when nations rage</i>

1778
01:39:41,087 --> 01:39:42,554
<i>and kingdoms totter,</i>

1779
01:39:42,559 --> 01:39:45,221
<i>when disaster follows hard upon disaster</i>

1780
01:39:45,184 --> 01:39:47,118
<i>and terror hangs on every side...</i>

1781
01:39:51,201 --> 01:39:54,102
Why hast Thou made me Thy mark?

1782
01:39:54,051 --> 01:39:57,111
<i># Trouble in mind, Lord #</i>

1783
01:39:57,059 --> 01:39:59,391
<i># Trouble in mind #</i>

1784
01:39:59,364 --> 01:40:02,891
<i># Lord, take away this trouble in mind #</i>

1785
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:06,153
<i>It's hard not to go to hell.</i>

1786
01:40:06,086 --> 01:40:10,216
<i>There's so many distractions,
so many influences.</i>

1787
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:12,485
<i>Start walking right,
and pretty soon,</i>

1788
01:40:12,456 --> 01:40:14,515
<i>there's someone
gonna drag you down.</i>

1789
01:40:14,504 --> 01:40:17,905
<i>Sure as we're living, sure as we're born,</i>

1790
01:40:17,832 --> 01:40:20,323
<i>look up, look up.</i>

1791
01:40:20,297 --> 01:40:23,824
<i>Gabriel blows his horn.</i>

1792
01:40:23,754 --> 01:40:25,949
He was having a lot of worries,

1793
01:40:25,931 --> 01:40:28,729
telling me things.

1794
01:40:28,683 --> 01:40:32,676
I just asked him one day,
I said, "Have you ever prayed?"

1795
01:40:32,588 --> 01:40:37,048
And he said, "Pray?"

1796
01:40:36,942 --> 01:40:39,433
You know, like that.

1797
01:40:39,406 --> 01:40:42,239
And he started asking
a lot of questions.

1798
01:40:42,191 --> 01:40:44,659
<i>I didn't know him then,</i>

1799
01:40:44,624 --> 01:40:47,457
<i>but I sure knew who he was.</i>

1800
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:49,467
<i>People worshipped him.</i>

1801
01:40:49,457 --> 01:40:51,948
Maybe only Jesus
could've unburdened

1802
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:55,790
someone like that
from such omnipotence.

1803
01:40:55,699 --> 01:40:58,224
In spring of 1974,

1804
01:40:58,196 --> 01:41:01,131
Jack Rollins followed
girlfriend Angela Reeves

1805
01:41:01,076 --> 01:41:02,805
to Stockton, California,

1806
01:41:02,804 --> 01:41:05,034
and enrolled in a course in Bible study

1807
01:41:05,013 --> 01:41:08,608
here at the California
Gateway Brotherhood Church,

1808
01:41:08,534 --> 01:41:11,765
a Pentecostal assembly
just outside Stockton.

1809
01:41:11,703 --> 01:41:13,170
Six months later,

1810
01:41:13,175 --> 01:41:16,372
Rollins accepted Jesus into his heart.

1811
01:41:16,312 --> 01:41:18,803
<i>Today, the one-time '60s folk hero</i>

1812
01:41:18,776 --> 01:41:21,404
<i>is a fully ordained member
of the Gateway Ministry</i>

1813
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:24,600
<i>and an active figure in the state's
evangelical community.</i>

1814
01:41:24,538 --> 01:41:27,063
<i>And yet, for the past two decades,</i>

1815
01:41:27,035 --> 01:41:29,799
<i>Father John has remained
silent about his past.</i>

1816
01:41:29,756 --> 01:41:31,189
<i>I asked him why.</i>

1817
01:41:31,196 --> 01:41:35,530
Old things are passed away.

1818
01:41:35,421 --> 01:41:37,753
All things are made anew.

1819
01:41:37,725 --> 01:41:39,989
It doesn't matter what I did before.

1820
01:41:40,862 --> 01:41:43,660
I've never lied to you.

1821
01:41:43,615 --> 01:41:46,482
Never told you who to vote for
or to follow anybody,

1822
01:41:46,432 --> 01:41:49,595
back then when
I was selling my records.

1823
01:41:49,537 --> 01:41:51,095
What I didn't know
is that it didn't matter

1824
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:53,870
what kind of music you were playing.

1825
01:41:53,826 --> 01:41:59,162
Folk, pop, rock 'n roll...

1826
01:41:59,011 --> 01:42:00,945
we're all rolled up
in the devil's pocket.

1827
01:42:00,932 --> 01:42:07,030
Now, I'm not talking about a devil
with the pitchfork and horns.

1828
01:42:06,853 --> 01:42:12,655
I'm talking about a spiritual devil
in the midnight hour.

1829
01:42:12,487 --> 01:42:15,854
He's gotta be overcome.

1830
01:42:15,783 --> 01:42:21,050
And we here in America,
we shall overcome.

1831
01:42:20,905 --> 01:42:24,705
What greater honor for a nation

1832
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:27,110
than to speak for God?

1833
01:42:27,146 --> 01:42:29,307
For some say that the war
to end all wars

1834
01:42:29,291 --> 01:42:31,589
has already begun
right now in the Middle East,

1835
01:42:31,564 --> 01:42:35,330
where it is prophesized
that the weak will fall.

1836
01:42:37,486 --> 01:42:40,512
And that Jesus will set up
His kingdom in Jerusalem.

1837
01:42:40,462 --> 01:42:44,364
So why should we worry
when we're already free,

1838
01:42:44,272 --> 01:42:45,637
right here, right now?

1839
01:42:45,647 --> 01:42:46,875
And why are you free?

1840
01:42:46,896 --> 01:42:48,693
You're free because Jesus
paid for you to be.

1841
01:42:48,688 --> 01:42:50,121
That's why you're free.

1842
01:42:50,129 --> 01:42:54,532
You're free to seek
the higher calling of the Lord.

1843
01:42:55,858 --> 01:43:00,022
Now pick up your bed and walk.

1892
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:34,774
All right.

1893
01:46:39,278 --> 01:46:41,610
Thank you.

1894
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:47,999
Not with the girls.

1895
01:46:47,983 --> 01:46:50,417
- Yes, Robbie.
- No.

1896
01:46:50,385 --> 01:46:51,317
Robbie!

1897
01:46:51,345 --> 01:46:53,609
You're not taking my kids!

1898
01:46:53,586 --> 01:46:55,315
What are you going to do?

1899
01:46:55,313 --> 01:46:57,611
What would you do?

1900
01:46:57,586 --> 01:46:59,383
Because I would, you know?

1901
01:46:59,379 --> 01:47:01,279
Perhaps I even would.

1902
01:47:01,268 --> 01:47:03,532
If you actually could, who knows?

1903
01:47:06,293 --> 01:47:09,558
But I'm not going to take your children
away from you, Robbie,

1904
01:47:09,494 --> 01:47:13,453
so you don't have to...

<i>...and try and shake this flytrap.</i>

1942
01:50:06,916 --> 01:50:08,884
<i>But they took away
the meaning, Alice,</i>

1943
01:50:08,869 --> 01:50:11,337

1944
01:50:11,302 --> 01:50:14,294
<i>I'm telling you, if I don't

1946

1947
01:50:21,928 --> 01:50:23,759
<i>Jack, where are you gonna go?</i>

01:50:25,706 --> 01:50:28,266
<i>First place that

1949
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:37,284
So, good people of Riddle,

1950
01:50:37,261 --> 01:50:40,594
we come here with no intent to disrupt,

1951
01:50:40,525 --> 01:50:43,824
but only to commend you
for your patient courage

1952
01:50:43,758 --> 01:50:45,692
in this time of change.

1953
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,648
And in addition,
we are pleased to announce

1954
01:50:48,592 --> 01:50:51,959
the evacuation fund has been established
by the state of Missouri

1955
01:50:51,888 --> 01:50:53,515
as I pledged to you it would be.

1956
01:50:57,041 --> 01:51:00,533
Exactly what does that do
for the common folk like myself?

1957
01:51:00,467 --> 01:51:02,230
Dollar compensation

1958
01:51:02,227 --> 01:51:05,719
will be made available to, uh, uh...

1959
01:51:05,652 --> 01:51:07,517
Eligible evacuees.

1960
01:51:07,508 --> 01:51:09,271
So what you want to do
is throw some pennies

1961
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:10,760
after you done took our lives!

1962
01:51:11,734 --> 01:51:13,668
I assure you, boy,

1963
01:51:13,654 --> 01:51:16,088
nobody here in the business
of taking lives.

1964
01:51:16,055 --> 01:51:20,151
Might wanna explain that
to Ms. Henry up there.

1965
01:51:20,056 --> 01:51:22,650
Yeah, or Ms. Montgomery.

1966
01:51:22,616 --> 01:51:24,880
Or how about Old Man Sykes?

1967
01:51:24,857 --> 01:51:26,188
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

1968
01:51:26,202 --> 01:51:28,636
you can either go through Riddle,
or you can go around them,

1969
01:51:28,602 --> 01:51:30,001
so why are you going
through our town?

1970
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:32,069
Yeah, that's right,
that's right, he said it.

1971
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:33,618
Who is that talking?

1972
01:51:33,628 --> 01:51:35,892
You there.

1973
01:51:35,868 --> 01:51:37,665
- What's your name?
- My name?

1974
01:51:37,661 --> 01:51:40,425
- Mm.
- William.

1975
01:51:40,381 --> 01:51:42,849
William, did you say?
Show your face.

1976
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:46,171
Yes, sir.

1977
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:50,373
I had... I had a friend...

1978
01:51:52,544 --> 01:51:54,944
However, thing is, sir, truly,

1979
01:51:54,913 --> 01:51:57,882
you got us hanging by a thread here.

1980
01:51:57,826 --> 01:52:00,556
Who are you? I know you.

1981
01:52:00,515 --> 01:52:02,915
I don't reckon so.

1982
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:04,681
You ever live in Dallas County?

1983
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:07,167
- Can't say I have.
- New Mexico?

1984
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,698
No!

1985
01:52:08,708 --> 01:52:12,474
You were talented.
Boy, you could shoot.

1986
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:14,950
You could sing a ditty
like nobody I ever seen.

1987
01:52:14,919 --> 01:52:17,319
You got... You got any musical strain?

1988
01:52:18,952 --> 01:52:21,216
I never had the knack.

1989
01:52:21,192 --> 01:52:24,491
What we're saying
is that you and your boys,

1990
01:52:24,425 --> 01:52:25,653
you go do as you please,

1991
01:52:25,674 --> 01:52:28,199
just so long as you stay clear
of Riddle County.

1992
01:52:31,146 --> 01:52:33,137
Do you think you're speaking
for the people, sir?

1993
01:52:33,131 --> 01:52:36,123
You are just stirring up lies
and getting folks agitated.

1994
01:52:36,076 --> 01:52:37,168
Now, we have methods

1995
01:52:37,197 --> 01:52:39,256
for dealing with
scoundrels like yourself.

1996
01:52:48,655 --> 01:52:50,282
Boys, bring him in!

1997
01:52:50,288 --> 01:52:52,381
Hey, hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1998
01:52:54,545 --> 01:52:55,910
Quiet down!

1999
01:52:55,921 --> 01:52:58,890
No need to get off to cause
another insurgence...

2000
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:02,371
Take care of my horse!
Take care of my horse!

2001
01:53:11,381 --> 01:53:13,406
<i>Takes a thief to catch a thief.</i>

2002
01:53:13,398 --> 01:53:15,025
<i># She cried both day and night #</i>

2003
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:19,899
<i># I know it because it was there #</i>

2004
01:53:21,656 --> 01:53:24,716
<i># It's a milestone #</i>

2005
01:53:24,665 --> 01:53:27,600
<i># But she's down on her luck #</i>

2006
01:53:27,546 --> 01:53:31,107
<i># And she mainly so lonely #</i>

2007
01:53:31,035 --> 01:53:34,300
<i># But to make him hard to buck #</i>

2008
01:53:34,235 --> 01:53:36,795
<i># I was there #</i>

2009
01:53:39,133 --> 01:53:41,067
<i>I know I have a sickness...</i>

2010
01:53:41,053 --> 01:53:43,783
<i>festering somewhere.</i>

2011
01:53:43,742 --> 01:53:45,334
<i>I don't mean like Woody Guthrie,</i>

2012
01:53:45,342 --> 01:53:47,003
<i>wasting away in some hospital.</i>

2013
01:53:47,006 --> 01:53:49,634
His vitals are stable.

2014
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:51,226
What he needs is sleep.

2015
01:53:51,232 --> 01:53:52,631
<i>I couldn't do that.</i>

2016
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,540
<i>Decay like that.</i>

2017
01:53:54,529 --> 01:53:58,090
That's nature's will,
and I'm against nature.

2018
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:02,256
I don't dig nature at all.

2019
01:54:02,211 --> 01:54:05,305
I don't think he can get back on stage.

2020
01:54:05,251 --> 01:54:07,981
He's gotten inside so many psyches,

2021
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:12,036
and death is just such a part
of the American scene right now.

2022
01:54:11,941 --> 01:54:14,375
It's the reds that make him mean.

2023
01:54:14,343 --> 01:54:17,244
He's already gone.

2024
01:54:17,191 --> 01:54:21,355
<i>The only truly natural things are dreams,</i>

2025
01:54:21,256 --> 01:54:24,089
<i>which nature cannot
touch with decay.</i>

2026
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:27,135
<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

2027
01:54:27,082 --> 01:54:30,518
<i># But she's not when I'm gone #</i>

2028
01:54:32,843 --> 01:54:36,370
<i># Heaven knows that the answer #</i>

2029
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,497
<i># She don't call no one #</i>

2030
01:54:39,437 --> 01:54:40,699
<i># She's the way #</i>

2031
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:42,617
<i># For sailing beautiful #</i>

2032
01:54:42,605 --> 01:54:45,506
<i># She's mine for the one #</i>

2033
01:54:45,454 --> 01:54:48,719
<i># And I lost a heavy tension #</i>

2034
01:54:48,656 --> 01:54:51,682
<i># By temptation as it runs #</i>

2035
01:54:51,632 --> 01:54:54,123
<i># But she don't follow me #</i>

2036
01:54:54,097 --> 01:54:56,065
<i># But I'm not there #</i>

2037
01:54:56,049 --> 01:54:57,778
<i># I'm gone #</i>

2038
01:55:03,572 --> 01:55:06,837
<i># Now I'll cry tonight #</i>

2039
01:55:06,772 --> 01:55:09,400
<i># Like I cried the night before #</i>

2051

And you too, Homer.

01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:45,435
Henry!

2076
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:46,684
Come on, Henry. Come on, girl.

2077
01:56:46,703 --> 01:56:47,635
Come on.

2078
01:56:47,663 --> 01:56:49,290
Come on!

Come on!

01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,845
Bye, Henry!

2082
01:57:02,227 --> 01:57:04,388
Good-bye, my lady.

2083
01:57:36,284 --> 01:57:40,744
<i># With your mercury mouth #</i>

2084
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:44,937
<i># In the missionary times #</i>

2085
01:57:44,830 --> 01:57:48,732
<i># And your eyes like smoke #</i>

2086
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:53,338
<i># And your prayers like rhymes #</i>

2087
01:57:53,216 --> 01:57:56,743
<i># And your silver cross #</i>

2088
01:57:56,673 --> 01:58:01,667
<i># And your voice
like chimes #</i>

2089
01:58:01,538 --> 01:58:03,165
Doesn't really matter, you know,

2090
01:58:03,171 --> 01:58:07,904
what kind of nasty names
people invent for the music.

2091
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:11,580
But, uh, folk music
is just a word, you know,

2092
01:58:11,493 --> 01:58:15,190
that I can't use anymore.

2093
01:58:15,110 --> 01:58:18,204
What I'm talking about
is traditional music,

2094
01:58:18,151 --> 01:58:20,619
right, which is to say
it's mathematical music,

2095
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:23,245
it's based on hexagons.

2096
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:26,905
But all these songs
about, you know,

2097
01:58:26,825 --> 01:58:28,918
roses growing
out of people's brains

2098
01:58:28,906 --> 01:58:30,999
and lovers who are
really geese and swans

2099
01:58:30,987 --> 01:58:32,545
are turning into angels...

2100
01:58:32,555 --> 01:58:35,183
I mean, you know,
they're not going to die.

2101
01:58:35,147 --> 01:58:36,944
They're not folk music songs.

2102
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:39,773
They're political songs.

2103
01:58:39,725 --> 01:58:41,488
They're already dead.

2104
01:58:42,637 --> 01:58:46,539
You'd think that these traditional music people

2105
01:58:46,447 --> 01:58:49,575
would... would gather
that mystery, you know,

2106
01:58:49,519 --> 01:58:51,453
is a traditional fact, you know,

2107
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:54,068
seeing as they're
all so full of mystery.

2108
01:58:54,033 --> 01:58:55,500
And contradictions.

2109
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:57,734
Yeah, contradictions.

2110
01:58:57,714 --> 01:59:00,239
And chaos.

2111
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:02,974
Yes, it's chaos, clocks,
and watermelons...

2112
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:04,454
You know, it's... it's everything.

2113
01:59:10,164 --> 01:59:12,997
These people actually think
I have some kind of, uh...

2114
01:59:14,774 --> 01:59:18,733
fantastic imagination.

2115
01:59:18,647 --> 01:59:20,547
It gets very, uh, lonesome.

2116
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,807
But traditional music

2117
01:59:24,792 --> 01:59:26,282
is just, uh...

2118
01:59:26,297 --> 01:59:27,992
It's too unreal to die.

2119
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:30,485
It doesn't need to be protected.

2120
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:32,289
You know, I mean,
in that music is the only

2121
01:59:32,283 --> 01:59:34,114
true valid death
you can feel today,

2122
01:59:34,107 --> 01:59:37,565
you know, off a record player.

2123
01:59:37,499 --> 01:59:40,900
But like everything else in great demand,
people try to own it.

2124
01:59:44,989 --> 01:59:48,550
Has to do with, like,
uh, the purity thing.

2125
01:59:50,367 --> 01:59:52,858
I think its meaninglessness is holy.

2126
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:58,115
Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer.

2127
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:49,321
<i>People are always talking about freedom.</i>

2128
02:00:49,295 --> 02:00:52,059
<i>Freedom to live a certain way</i>

2129
02:00:52,015 --> 02:00:54,108
<i>without being kicked around.</i>

2130
02:01:00,018 --> 02:01:02,919
<i>Course, the more
you live a certain way,</i>

2131
02:01:02,866 --> 02:01:04,561
<i>the less it feels like freedom.</i>

2132
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:15,136
<i>Me? I can change during
the course of a day.</i>

2133
02:01:15,062 --> 02:01:17,155
<i>I wake and I'm one person,</i>

2134
02:01:17,142 --> 02:01:18,905
<i>and when I go to sleep, I know for certain</i>

2135
02:01:18,903 --> 02:01:21,599
<i>I'm somebody else.</i>

2136
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:23,619
<i>I don't know who I am,
most of the time.</i>

2137
02:01:37,435 --> 02:01:39,995
<i>It's like you got yesterday,</i>

2138
02:01:39,964 --> 02:01:43,263
<i>today, and tomorrow,
all in the same room.</i>

2139
02:01:47,998 --> 02:01:50,364
<i>There's no tellin' what can happen.</i>

2140

<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

2164
