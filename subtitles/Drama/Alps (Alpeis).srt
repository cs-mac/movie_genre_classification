1
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,313
What's the problem?

2
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,550
You know what's the problem.

3
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,548
It is nice. Rhythmic.

4
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,472
I don't like it.

5
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,991
It unstrings me.

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,834
Why not work with something
more... pop?

7
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,110
You're not ready for something
more pop.

8
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,718
If you really want to know what the real
problem is, I'm going to tell you.

9
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,033
The problem is
you don't trust me.

10
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,236
The problem is...

11
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,150
you believe I'm not yet ready
for something more pop while I am.

12
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,715
If you raise your voice
to me again...

13
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,509
I'll take a juggling club
to smash your head.

14
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,956
And, then, I'll break
your arms and legs.

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,034
And then you won't be able
to work with "something more pop".

16
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,675
In fact, you won't be able
to work with anything at all.

17
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,556
Either rock or fox-trot,
either latin or whatever.

18
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,797
I know very well when one
is ready for pop.

19
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,831
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,395
You know very well when one
is ready for pop.

21
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,993
What's your name?

22
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,478
Mary.

23
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,794
Mary or Maria?
How do they usually call you?

24
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,198
- Mary.
- I'm going to call you Maria.

25
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,396
Have you got any
brothers and sisters?

26
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,079
No.

27
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,592
Maria, you have been badly hit.

28
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,752
The chances of dying
are high.

29
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,031
If I asked you now to pick
an actor, whom you'd say?

30
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,230
Who's your favorite?

31
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,071
Well, I'll tell you names.

32
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,596
If I find it, wave to me.

33
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,872
Brad Pitt.

34
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,672
No?

35
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,752
Johnny Depp?

36
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
What? Not even Johnny Depp?

37
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,872
We've brought a young girl,
around 16 years old.

38
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,749
Car accident. Internal
haemorrhage, broken ribs.

39
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,632
She plays tennis.

40
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,396
Maybe for several years, cause
her racket was quite lightweight.

41
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,312
Was she taken to surgery?

42
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,833
Yes.

43
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,638
- Any relatives?
- Her parents are notified.

44
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,796
Where's she going to?

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,951
To room 205.

46
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,479
OK.

47
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,956
She has no brothers or sisters.

48
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,550
Her favorite actor is Jude Law.

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,033
OK.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,355
Brown-haired? Blonde? Brunette?

51
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,150
Dark brown, though her head
was covered in blood...

52
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,709
I think, dark brown.

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,755
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes.

54
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,957
- There's inside.
- Shall I take your cup?

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,913
Only for today.
Tomorrow, I'll bring mine.

56
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,632
What's yours like?

57
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,554
I'm asking for not to mess it
with another that looks alike.

58
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,830
Blue with red letters.

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,837
What's written on it?

60
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,672
"Los Angeles".

61
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,996
No, there's no other like it.

62
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,510
In these occasions
you need stay calm...

63
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
however hard it's what I'm saying.

64
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
- Have you got any other kids?
- No.

65
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,955
Everything's going to be all right.
She'll make it.

66
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,957
She seems a tough nut to crack.

67
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,395
She's a sportswoman.
She plays tennis.

68
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,272
That's very good.

69
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,998
I play tennis too.

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,118
I've surely suffered an injury
that held me back...

71
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
but for the last two years
I'm getting better.

72
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,438
My wife is a former
tennis champion.

73
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,070
I don't want you to worry.
We're going to do everything we can.

74
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,998
You're daughter is going
to be all right.

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,469
She'll come back to the tennis court
sooner than you may realize.

76
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,437
And you won't even remember
all this.

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,551
I want you to make me a favor.

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,594
This is her favorite wristband.

79
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,115
She used to wear it
in every match.

80
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,715
I want you to give it to her.
It will give her strength.

81
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,554
I don't know if it's allowed
to wear it.

82
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,596
There's no problem.

83
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,079
You may give it yourself to her
whenever you see her.

84
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,593
Thank you.

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,313
Hi, dad.

86
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,873
You're late.

87
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,997
It's just five minutes to ten.

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,071
It's 10:10!

89
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,715
- There was heavy traffic.
- I was worried.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,479
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,792
I don't mind that you're being late.
Just warn me about.

92
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,999
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,796
I go to bed.
Do you want me for something else?

94
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,632
Tomorrow it's going to rain.
Take your jacket with you.

95
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,194
OK.

96
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,119
Good night.

97
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,634
Good night.

98
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,869
Today is a special day.

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,635
As you know, we've been long
looking for a good-sounding

100
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,759
and suitable name for our team.

101
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,153
After a lot of thought, I ended up...

102
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,233
...to the name "Alps".

103
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,753
Alps?

104
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,558
Yes, Alps.

105
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,352
Why Alps?

106
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,312
Alps, for two important reasons.

107
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,833
The first one...

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,197
it doesn't by any means reveal
what exactly we are doing.

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,318
And the second one is purely
symbolic.

110
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,992
No other mountain can stand in
for the mountains of the Alps.

111
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,796
Anything else would be smaller
and less imposing. Therefore...

112
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,194
...a poor substitute.

113
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,316
What is amazing with
the mountains of the Alps is...

114
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,229
that while can not be
replaced by any other...

115
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,914
they can stand in for
all the others.

116
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,233
Who could mind seeing in
the place of Ararat

117
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,919
or Mount McKinley...

118
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,832
the Alps?

119
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,078
Would you mind?

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,079
Neither could I.

121
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,438
Besides, I will take the name
of the highest mountain of the Alps...

122
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,790
which is called Mont Blanc.

123
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,918
What about us?

124
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,993
You may choose names among
the smaller mountains.

125
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,478
Do you know them?

126
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,350
Monte Roza, Dom...

127
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,714
Weisshorn, Matterhorn...

128
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,831
Finsteraarhorn...

129
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,957
Aletschhorn...

130
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,196
Barre des Ecrins...

131
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,672
Gran Paradiso,
Piz Bernina and one more.

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,672
Weissmies.

133
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,997
I've printed copies for you.

134
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,755
I'd like to take Matterhorn.

135
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,879
That's good.

136
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,073
Why?

137
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,430
It reminds my father.

138
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,314
When I was very small,
we had gone there for excursion.

139
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,873
Where to?

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,474
- Matterhorn!
- In Switzerland?

141
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,551
At the foot of the mountain.

142
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,879
Good evening.

143
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,439
Good evening. Just a moment.
I'm coming.

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,797
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

145
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,357
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

146
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,472
I've brought you the list you asked
and the photo.

147
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,318
Very nice.

148
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,113
- Don't you have a closer one?
- Unfortunately no.

149
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,557
- A captain.
- A captain of the merchant navy.

150
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,715
These are sub-lieutenant’s badges.

151
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,911
The photo is old.

152
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,072
I couldn't find
a more recent one.

153
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,237
He used to wear glasses.

154
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,558
I couldn't find them.

155
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,313
But you have to.

156
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,312
I'm going to look over again.

157
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,149
We can't replace them with others.
It wouldn't be plausible.

158
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,799
I'm going to look over again.

159
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,039
Zachos.

160
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,952
Yes.

161
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,874
Any relation with the chop-house
in Varkiza?

162
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,313
No, no. It's just a coincidence.

163
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,234
Did you know each other for years?

164
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,834
We were friends for about 20 years.
From higher school.

165
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,637
Cause of death?

166
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,873
Heart failure.

167
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,990
Favorite food?

168
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,271
Not something special.

169
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,233
Maybe he liked spaghetti
a bit more.

170
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,999
Plain spaghetti?

171
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,435
- With tomato sauce.
- Alla Napoletana.

172
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,397
Yes, alla Napoletana

173
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,311
Don't get upset.

174
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,232
He was using very frequently the word
"yet", before any sentence.

175
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,914
That is, he was saying "yet,
today it's very windy".

176
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,197
Or "yet, see you later."

177
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,393
Or "yet, today it's too cold."

178
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,358
Got it.

179
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,039
Favorite foreign actor?

180
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,077
It was Morgan Freeman.

181
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,674
He liked going to the movies alone.

182
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,717
He went to see all his movies.

183
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,949
He was usually going alone.

184
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,513
Is it too small?

185
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,915
- Yes.
- I think so, too.

186
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,991
We'll have it remade.

187
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,555
Is it that your hair is too thick?

188
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,796
No, it's not that.

189
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,070
My friend had no hair.

190
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,838
- Does this bother you?
- No.

191
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,193
I don't think so. No.

192
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,672
Very nice.

193
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,519
If he wore glasses,
he would be completely different.

194
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,434
I'll look again.
I'll find them.

195
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,830
- You have to.
- I'll do it.

196
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,919
Hello!

197
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,790
Darling, Anna came.

198
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,036
My beloved friend.

199
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,757
Come on. Take a seat.

200
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,193
What a pleasant surprise!
I wasn't expecting you.

201
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,391
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

202
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,278
Anything you want? Some tea?

203
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,032
- Tea.
- Good.

204
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,749
- Come on.
- Thank you.

205
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,879
How are you?

206
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,752
- I'm fine.
- I'm glad to hear it.

207
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,713
Hello there.

208
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,756
How are you, Anna?
It is so long.

209
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,758
We've admittedly missed you.

210
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,471
I'm all right.

211
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,389
- Isn't it a fine day, today?
- Indeed.

212
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,789
I go to the office.
I've some important business.

213
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,952
- Will you be late?
- Yes, I'll be back very late at night.

214
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,674
Good! I'll make your
favorite food.

215
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,432
Schnitzel with mashed potatoes?

216
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,033
Perfect!

217
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,710
I don't know what I could do
without him.

218
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,472
You're very lucky.

219
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,119
- Do you want me to read for you?
- Yes. I'd like it.

220
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,072
A book or a magazine?

221
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,753
A magazine.

222
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,076
"Fashion trends of the Summer"

223
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,919
"Gianfranco Ferre:
The King Is Naked."

224
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,270
"Trip to Guatemala:
Exotic and unknown."

225
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,789
- "Interview: Winona Ryder."
- This one!

226
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,230
"Tell me how do you
start your day?"

227
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,550
"If I'm not working, I get up
around ten o' clock...

228
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,278
and prepare a cup of tea.

229
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,040
Then, I sit down and read
NY Times.

230
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,470
For the rest of the morning
I make my phone calls...

231
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,319
and arrange several tasks.
When I am in Los Angeles...

232
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,796
some times, I take a long walk
around my house...

233
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,033
either to refresh myself
or in the evening to relax."

234
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,071
I've got a surprise for you.

235
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,238
Close your eyes.

236
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,519
Do you like it?

237
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,998
Isn't it awesome?

238
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,479
Sorry.

239
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,115
It's amazing
we've become friends.

240
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,236
Would you like me to sit next
to you to talk just for a while?

241
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,151
I want you to know that whatever
you have to say to me,

242
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,272
I won't say a word to your parents.
It's going to stay between us.

243
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,636
Are you possibly pregnant?

244
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,917
Don't get upset!

245
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,350
After all, you are too young
to have a child.

246
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,596
You got a lot of time
ahead of you.

247
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,150
Now, you must focus
in your homework and tennis.

248
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,510
I also want you to know
that if you were pregnant

249
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,759
you shouldn't dye your hair.
It's too dangerous.

250
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,837
Besides, your natural color
is very nice.

251
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,515
It's dark brown, isn't it?

252
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,999
What happened?

253
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,638
Nothing.

254
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,837
What happened?

255
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,797
I couldn't say something
I had to.

256
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,031
What was that you couldn't say it?

257
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,956
"Grandpa look here a nice cup
for your coffee or your tea."

258
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,077
And Grandpa, what did he do?

259
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,275
He got upset.

260
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,718
And you?

261
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,996
Me? Nothing.

262
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,838
I left.

263
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,994
Don't speak to Mont Blanc about it.

264
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,756
Please.

265
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,479
He won't give me the girl with the
car accident, if you speak to him about.

266
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,515
You're the King of the coaches.

267
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,598
You're the best...

268
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,112
You're the best coach
in the world.

269
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,035
It is impossible not to say it.

270
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,678
I'm sorry.

271
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,717
It is wonderful!

272
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,399
Is it cold?

273
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,875
No, not at all.

274
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,277
Come out now. It's getting late.

275
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,351
We have to leave.

276
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,355
Just a little longer.
Please. A little longer.

277
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,079
All right.

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,030
Cold is a word

279
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,397
but winter swimmers don't know it.

280
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,950
It's an odd fate that you can not
eat ice-cream.

281
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,469
Because of your diabetes.

282
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,629
But you hate chocolate anyway.

283
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,950
I would have a different flavor
like strawberry

284
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,917
which is my favorite.

285
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,191
There's no point to talk about it.
The doctor was quite clear on it.

286
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,839
You're right.

287
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,628
How about a walk on the beach?

288
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,358
That's a wonderful idea!

289
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,559
Light fittings fall into
three main categories.

290
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,237
Domestic interior, domestic exterior
and professional.

291
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,876
Then, there are various
subcategories...

292
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,190
such as ceiling lamps...

293
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,635
shade lamps, wall lamps...

294
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,116
modern chandeliers,
classic chandeliers...

295
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,113
rack-lighting, uplighters...

296
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,232
spotlights, pendant lamps
and floor lamps.

297
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,072
Repeat them back to me.

298
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,991
Wall lamps, ceiling lamps...

299
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,435
classic chandeliers,
modern chandeliers...

300
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,192
uplighters...

301
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,914
floor lamps, table lamps....

302
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,712
And pendant lamps.

303
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,118
And pendant lamps.

304
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,592
Uplighters...
and uplighters...

305
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,272
Once more in the evening.

306
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,796
This evening we have a ball.

307
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,309
- What types of dances do you dance?
- Various.

308
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,674
Blues, tango, waltz...

309
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,033
And latin?

310
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,513
And latin.

311
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,671
- Nice.
- Will you come?

312
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,559
I will come.

313
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,232
Are you ready?
Now.

314
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,514
Your daughter lost in
the most important...

315
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,352
...the most important match
of her life.

316
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,118
I'm very sorry.

317
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,397
My condolences.

318
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,396
Nonetheless, keep in mind...

319
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,438
death is not the end.
On the contrary.

320
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,713
It is a new,
often a better start.

321
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,389
Your daughter fought hard

322
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,034
but the opponent was stronger.

323
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,155
She was a remarkable person
that everybody will remember.

324
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,510
I'm sure about that.

325
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,357
And now, I got something
very pleasing to tell you.

326
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,552
I myself can replace her
if you want it.

327
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,117
You're grief will ease
and after a while...

328
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,356
will disappear completely.

329
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,835
A couple of two-hours visits
a week are enough.

330
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,590
The end can be a new,
better start.

331
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,550
It's up to you.

332
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,309
For the first four visits
you won't be charged.

333
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,317
"Grandpa look here a nice cup
for your coffee or tea."

334
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,348
As soon as Granma sees it,
she will surely feel jealous.

335
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,477
but never mind...

336
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,473
because I bought her a gift too,
this wallet here...

337
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,110
which has a coin compartment
and a photo holder.

338
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,439
"Grandpa, look here a nice cup
for your coffee or your tea."

339
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,318
The girl with the car accident
is getting much better

340
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,193
and doctors say that she
has overcome the danger.

341
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,112
They speak of a miracle.

342
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,312
What a pity.

343
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,033
Indeed.

344
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,553
Again.

345
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,955
"Grandpa, look here a nice cup
for your coffee or tea."

346
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,228
As soon as Granma sees it, she
will surely feel jealous but...

347
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,035
never mind because I bought her
as a gift this wallet

348
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,232
which has a coin compartment
and a photo holder.

349
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,914
However, you lost a great deal
by not coming.

350
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,198
It was wonderful and the view
from the room was amazing.

351
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,795
You won't be paid this month.

352
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,991
I'll keep your money.

353
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,954
Repeat and clearer.

354
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,600
"Grandpa, look here a nice cup
for your coffee or tea."

355
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,759
As soon as Granma sees it, she
will surely feel jealous...

356
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,916
but never mind because
I bought her too...

357
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,798
What's the matter with her?

358
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,831
She made a mistake.

359
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,071
Has it happened before?

360
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,077
This is the second time.

361
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,797
With the grandpa again.

362
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,670
The man who cut my hair for the
last twelve years died yesterday.

363
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,476
He had no relatives.

364
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,991
I went to the hair salon
today and he was not there.

365
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,795
He was the only one
to cut my hair. No one else.

366
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,711
He was always taking care of my side-burns
to be at the exact same length.

367
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,439
Both of them.

368
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,920
- Are they now at the same length?
- Don't know.

369
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,475
They're not.

370
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,358
I've not gone for a long time.

371
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,034
I never fixed an appointment
without him being there.

372
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,317
I was on any occasion arranging it
when he was there.

373
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,469
- Are you going to attend the funeral?
- No.

374
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,628
- Why?
- I don't go to funerals.

375
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,195
- How did he die?
- Heart failure.

376
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,873
You danced very nice.

377
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,116
Thank you very much.

378
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,078
Your escort was amazing too.

379
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,635
We always dance together.

380
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,431
Do you know each other
for a long time?

381
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,191
Almost five months.

382
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,152
Do you like her?

383
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,757
She's very likeable.

384
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,638
What's the time?

385
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,758
I didn't know you are
so good a dancer.

386
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,833
We used to dance
with your mother as well.

387
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,076
Save for latin.

388
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,750
She hated latin.

389
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,513
You should always tie
your hair back.

390
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,156
- These are not tennis shoes!
- I see.

391
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,595
What is your shoe size?

392
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,268
Thirty-eight or thirty-nine.
As the case may be.

393
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,155
This is incredible.
This is perfectly fit to me.

394
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,833
Incredible.

395
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,159
That's her perfume, "Eternity".

396
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,789
It was a gift by her boyfriend.

397
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,318
You have to meet him someday.

398
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,115
I was quite sure
I will drive her off.

399
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,673
I knew it.

400
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,072
Her reverse forehand was lousy...

401
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,312
I knew it right from the start
she was hopeless!

402
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,953
Do you want some water?

403
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,356
No, dad. Thanks.

404
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,998
You usually drink a plenty
of water after the match.

405
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,111
It's OK. Thank you.

406
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,435
Bite your nails a bit.

407
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,479
That's enough.

408
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,149
I like last replacement a lot.

409
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,231
- The blind one?
- Yes.

410
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,953
She lost her vision at an old age.
She hasn't ever told me how.

411
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,517
She's a beautiful woman
with vivid colors.

412
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,995
What do you mean "vivid colors"?

413
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,993
Green eyes, light brown hair.

414
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,997
A peculiar combination.

415
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,193
I go to her house,

416
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,358
in Athens center,
a maisonette with yard.

417
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,275
She hasn't much furniture
not to stumble.

418
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,637
- We sit and I play her husband.
- Yes, I know.

419
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,237
And I tell her stories for hours.
She likes them a lot.

420
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,233
Whatever comes to mind.

421
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,273
Sometimes, she asks me
to kiss her.

422
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,476
And we kiss.

423
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,311
- Do you like her.
- I like her a lot.

424
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,272
I'm having fun.

425
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,994
I mean, do you like
your kissing.

426
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,997
Yes, I like it.
She's an active woman.

427
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,073
Imagine you were blind.

428
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,232
You couldn't do rhythmic gymnastics.

429
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,957
Get out of here. Collect your things
from home and leave.

430
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,276
Go back to Toronto,
go wherever you like...

431
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,112
so long as I will
never see you again.

432
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,999
Fuck you. You are so controlling.
You make me miserable.

433
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,628
I'm only thinking of your health,
idiot!

434
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,038
But I don't care any more. Leave and
then eat all the cakes and all the deserts you like.

435
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,519
I will leave.

436
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,836
Get out of my sight.

437
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,110
I don't want to see you again.

438
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,234
Get out of here. Collect your things
from home and leave!

439
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,039
Go back to Toronto,
go wherever you like

440
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,952
so long as I will
never see you again.

441
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,277
Fuck you. You are so controlling.
You make me miserable.

442
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,238
I'm only thinking of your health!

443
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,237
But I don't care any more. Leave and
then eat all the cakes and all the deserts you like.

444
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,799
I will leave.

445
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,232
Get out of my sight!

446
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,271
I don't wanna see you again!

447
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,996
I'm sorry. I love you.

448
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,912
I love you too.

449
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,556
I'm only hard on you
for your own good.

450
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,358
I know.

451
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,958
If Mont Blanc learns about,
there will be a problem.

452
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,958
Our collaboration may be over.

453
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,717
He won't learn anything.

454
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,159
I for one won't tell him
anything.

455
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,233
Let your blouse.
Take off your skirt.

456
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,672
- The pantyhose?
- Take off the pantyhose, too.

457
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,319
Try not to speak loud.

458
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,755
To be nearly inaudible.

459
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,596
There will only be a moment
when you are going to say

460
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,548
"Please, please don't you stop."

461
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,550
It feels like heaven."

462
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,199
That's it.

463
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,390
Please, don't you stop!

464
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,949
It feels like paradise.

465
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,478
Heaven!

466
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,033
Please!

467
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,790
Don't you stop!
It feels like heaven!

468
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,076
Please, don't you stop!
It feels like heaven!

469
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,830
He said we are never going
to work with something more pop.

470
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,594
- Why?
- Don't know.

471
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,431
But I can't stand it any more.

472
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,438
What you were about to do
it was completely immature.

473
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,633
You're a very good gymnast
and it would be a shame to die.

474
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,115
I'm going to speak to him.

475
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,550
Thank you, Monte Roza.

476
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,069
You imagine that's very difficult
for him to step back.

477
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,800
But there's nothing to lose
giving a try.

478
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,790
Do you want any specific
piece of music?

479
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,677
There are two pieces
for me to choose.

480
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,036
I'll do anything you want.

481
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,358
Let her work with a piece that
is more pop and I'll do anything.

482
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,795
- Anything I want?
- Anything you want.

483
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,079
Think about it.

484
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,472
I thought it over.

485
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,271
- Tell me.
- Come closer inside.

486
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,510
- Come on, Ok?
- Yes.

487
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,028
How could you do it? With my husband?
You, my best friend!

488
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,516
I hate you both.

489
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,796
Shame on you!
Get out the way!

490
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,951
You have a nice body.

491
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,679
You, too.

492
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,558
- Are you getting cold?
- No, not in the least.

493
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,957
I've turned the heat on
but it's a bit slow to warm up.

494
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,553
I don't mind.

495
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,076
Dad, want to dance with me?

496
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,033
Not right now.
Some other time.

497
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,594
- In the evening?
- In the evening.

498
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,350
- You promise me.
- I do.

499
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,832
I have to leave.

500
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,789
Stay a little longer, please.

501
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,193
All right.

502
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,714
I say not waiting for her.
She probably won't come

503
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,595
Agree. She's too late.
Who's first?

504
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,518
May I go?

505
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,917
A man or a woman?

506
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,559
A man.

507
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,636
I keep waiting for a while.

508
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,429
- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

509
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,348
- It's Prince.
- Who?

510
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,638
Prince.

511
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,030
You can't replace Prince.

512
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,391
- Why?
- Prince hasn't died yet.

513
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,510
- Prince has died.
- Prince is alive.

514
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,558
I'm sorry.

515
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,354
You didn't come to our
yesterday meeting.

516
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,749
I know it.

517
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,391
I was just needed to replace
a colleague who had something to do.

518
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,159
Here.

519
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,871
That is to say, you were here.

520
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,197
Your cup is cleaned up. Didn't you
drink any coffee all night long?

521
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,072
I did used it.
I hope you don't mind.

522
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,760
No, it doesn't bother me.
Not at all.

523
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,870
I couldn't find my own.

524
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,799
Anyway it's a shame you didn't come
yesterday. It was so much fun.

525
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,312
Junior replaced Prince
who hasn't died.

526
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,431
Isn't Prince dead?

527
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,879
No.

528
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,078
He's not.

529
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,958
Have you ever seen anyone
drinking from my cup?

530
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,795
That one with the red letters
that say "Los Angeles"

531
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,031
No. As far as I remember.

532
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,633
That's strange!

533
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,398
You may take mine
whenever you want.

534
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,471
Thank you very much.
I don't smoke.

535
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,989
You better quit smoking too.

536
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,230
- Nice shoes.
- Thanks.

537
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,833
I watched a movie yesterday
with a veteran...

538
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,309
whom they called
for his last mission.

539
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,557
While he wouldn't initially accept,
then he took up arms and went.

540
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,278
I think I've seen it.

541
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,028
Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you
so early.

542
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,630
Vasilis is a friend from school.
All we did was dancing.

543
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,635
- Do you want to go to my place?
- Sure.

544
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,273
Hi, dad.

545
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,069
Here's Vasilis.
Vasilis, here's my dad.

546
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,236
- Hello.
- Hello there.

547
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,631
We're going to sit in my room
and listen to music.

548
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,354
- If you need something, say it to me.
- All right.

549
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,552
If volume's too high, tell me
to turn it down.

550
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,557
- All right?
- All right.

551
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,191
Volume is high.
Turn it down.

552
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,759
If you're getting cold,
tell me to turn the heat on.

553
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,232
I'm not cold.

554
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,594
Vasilis is younger than me
but we do match together.

555
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,111
In several things.

556
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,035
We got many common interests.

557
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,712
Music, sports...

558
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,954
We met at the hospital.

559
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,314
He's a track & field athlete.
In the 110 meter hurdles.

560
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,788
In a race he fell down

561
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,193
while jumping over the hurdle

562
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,231
and suffered a fracture of
the pyramidal bone.

563
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,748
I helped put the splint on him
and gave him a painkiller.

564
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,431
He is also very good
in arts.

565
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,438
He plays the guitar.

566
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,910
They make some covers.
With his band at school.

567
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,916
He is the singer and...

568
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,029
Hi.

569
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,673
Who is it, darling?

570
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,229
A schoolmate, mum.

571
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,117
Unfortunately
I can't come with you.

572
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,874
I have homework and after that...

573
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,549
I must attend a very
important tennis tournament.

574
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,756
See you tomorrow at school.

575
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,791
We're going to make a test.

576
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,873
We're going to use this object.

577
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,877
If it doesn't change color
and stays white,

578
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,314
that will automatically mean
you are competent

579
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,353
and reliable
to stay with us.

580
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,232
If it changes...

581
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,596
there are two possibilities.

582
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,239
First.

583
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,232
It becomes blue.

584
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,517
If it becomes blue,
that will automatically mean...

585
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,908
that you are competent
but not reliable.

586
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,672
So?

587
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,311
There's no "so".
It doesn't matter becoming blue.

588
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,596
I said it just like that.

589
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,079
The second possibility
and the worst is...

590
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,350
this club to become red.

591
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,632
This will automatically mean
you are unreliable

592
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,757
and incompetent
to stay with us.

593
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,671
Let's see.

594
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,834
It changed.

595
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,917
It became red.

596
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,714
Unfortunately, you must leave.

597
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,679
Drink it up before
the ice melts away.

598
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,438
It was very nice.

599
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,793
Who was mother's favorite actor?

600
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,637
Robert Redford

601
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,078
Mine, too.

602
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,190
Her favorite singer?

603
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,550
Harry Belafonte.

604
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,353
Yours?

605
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,712
Elvis Presley

606
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,198
Mine, too.

607
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,431
Nice shoes. Thank you.

608
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,835
I watched a movie yesterday
with a veteran...

609
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,712
whom they called
for one last mission.

610
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,553
While he wouldn't initially accept,
then he took up arms and went.

611
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,994
I think I've seen it.

612
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,232
Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you
so early. Vasilis is a friend.

613
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,313
All we did was dancing.
Nice shoes. Thank you.

614
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,988
I watched a movie yesterday
with a veteran...

615
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,156
whom they called for one
last mission.

616
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,920
While he wouldn't initially accept,
then, he took up arms and went.

617
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,519
I think I've seen it.

618
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,678
Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you
so early.

619
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,513
Dad, can you bring me some water
please?

620
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,318
Dad?

621
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,518
I'm back.

622
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,911
Can you open for me, please?

623
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,436
I was very good today.

624
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,156
4-2 in sets.

625
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,758
You're the best coach in the world!
