1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,510
Death ends a life...

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,552
...but it does not end a relationship...

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,915
...which struggles on
in the surviv or's mind...

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,594
...toward some resolution...

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,035
...which it may never find.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,151
Northeast Airlines announces
the arrival of flight number four.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,073
Yellow Bird service from Miami
and Fort Lauderdale...

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,357
...now arriving at Gate Number 9.

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,513
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,399
- Tell me where I can get a wheelchair?
- Yes, at the ramp.

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,516
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,838
Attention please.
Flight number 10 from Los Angeles...

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,399
Hello, Dad.

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,519
Well, Gene, as I live and breathe.
This is a surprise.

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,917
- I wrote you I'd be here.
- You did?

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,036
Oh, well, my mind is a sieve.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
- Hello, Mother.
- Northeast Airlines announces...

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,990
I got a wheelchair for you.
Save you the walk.

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,071
Oh, my precious.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,037
What would we do without you?

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,713
You look great.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,917
I'm all right, but listen to him.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,031
I couldn't get him
to see a doctor there.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,476
I told you I wasn't gonna let
those bozos charge me tourist prices.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,790
That wind down there
never stops blowing.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,872
- He's had me sick with worry.
- Now, now, Mother.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,554
I've taken pretty good care of myself
for 80 years.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,597
- I know, but...
- Take care of your mother.

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,432
I'll see you at the baggage section.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,989
- Bags won't be there yet, Dad.
- I want to be there.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,276
Don't want anyone making off
with our luggage.

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,509
Where's the car parked?

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,477
- It's in the lot.
- Is that the Buick?

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,835
I wrote you from California.
I bought a Mustang.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,798
- I thought you like Buicks.
- No, you like Buicks.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,315
Things to worry about.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,311
Nobody's gonna walk off
with your bags.

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,994
I've travelled a good deal more
than you have, old man.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,391
You keep an eye on your luggage
or some savage will walk off with it.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,910
You can't change him, lovey.
There's no use trying.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,516
He's a remarkable man.

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,433
Look how he walks.
Like a brigadier general.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,190
He may not always remember
where he's going...

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,511
...but he always goes there
with a firm step.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,319
Who took this picture of you?

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,357
A friend.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,715
I guess it's supposed to be artistic.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,429
It looks weak.

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,229
Oh, now, lovey, don't go on like that.
It's a very nice picture.

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,437
No, I like a picture of a man
to look at me straight in the eye.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,235
I suppose we should stop and shop.
There'll be nothing in the house to eat.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,914
- I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
- Hooray for our son.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,149
Can you spare the time?

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,596
- Mother, he said he would.
- I wanna tell you about California.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,797
- Yes. We haven't heard anything.
- Gene, take the next to the left.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,520
I'll bet Tom didn't bring
that battery for the car.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,671
- Did you write him?
- Yes.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,989
And the next right, Gene.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,233
You don't mind
my giving you directions, do you?

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,673
- Well, he did bring it back.
- Good.

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,513
Can't count on anyone these days.

62
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,636
- Where's your mother?
- She's in her garden.

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,949
What?

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,111
She's walking in her garden.

65
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,919
You know, Gene,
I don't mean to criticise...

66
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,752
...but you're mumbling a great deal.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,275
I have great difficulty
understanding you.

68
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,714
You need a hearing aid, Dad.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,236
Oh, I can hear perfectly well
if people would only enunciate.

70
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,234
"Mr. Garrison,
if you would only enunciate."

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,789
Professor Aurelio at night school.

72
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,911
Where did you say your mother was?

73
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,550
In her garden.

74
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,718
You know, Gene...

75
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,394
...the strain has been awful.

76
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,669
- She looks well.
- I know.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,037
You never know when she'll have
another one of those damned seizures.

78
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,316
It's been rough, I know.

79
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,313
Well, we'll manage.
She's a good soldier.

80
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,392
But, you know, she eats too fast.

81
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,994
The doctor said she must slow down.

82
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,193
Well...

83
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,394
...we got all of your letters
from California, Gene.

84
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,711
- I have them here someplace...
- Sorry I didn't manage every Sunday.

85
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,996
We do look forward to your letters,
old man.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,600
There isn't much else for us
these days.

87
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,990
But this girl, this woman
you mentioned several times...

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
I'll tell you all about California
at dinnertime, okay?

89
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,475
- You seem to see a great deal of her.
- Well, I do.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,355
Carol's been dead, let's see now...

91
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,033
It's over a year.

92
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,078
There's no reason why you
shouldn't go out with another woman.

93
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,434
No.

94
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,993
I was in California many years ago.
It's a beautiful place.

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,835
- I can understand your enthusiasm.
- I like it a lot.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,672
But, Gene...

97
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,633
...if you were to go out there
to live...

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,433
...it would kill your mother.

99
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,678
God, you're her whole life.

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,796
- Dad, no.
- Yes, you are.

101
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,033
Oh, she's fond of your sister,
but you are her life.

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,550
You think I haven't known that
all these years?

103
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,676
- Dad, I know we're very close, but...
- Gene.

104
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,319
Father.

105
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,349
Just remember what I've said.

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,675
Well, let's get the rest
of the luggage.

107
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,597
Here she is.

108
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,512
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mary.

109
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,398
- Mr. Garrison.
- We missed you.

110
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,028
We had a girl down in Florida
with no sense of humour.

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,998
- Couldn't get a rise out of her.
- We'll have some jokes then.

112
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,469
- Dry martini?
- You twist my arm.

113
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,278
Six-to-one.

114
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,908
What's your pleasure,
Gene, Dubonnet?

115
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,750
- I'll have a martini.
- But not six to one.

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,960
- The same, please.
- Well.

117
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,389
- Mother?
- No, nothing.

118
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,437
My joints would be
as stiff as a board.

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,195
- Did you say you'd be stiff?
- Oh, my joints. My joints.

120
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,828
We wouldn't want you stiff.

121
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,597
Did I ever show you this ring?

122
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,512
You've shown it to him
a hundred times.

123
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,672
I never thought
I'd wear a diamond ring...

124
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,718
...but when T.J. Parks died,
I wanted something of his.

125
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,598
The last time I had it appraised,
they told me it was worth 4000.

126
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,433
Whenever I go see a doctor,
I always turn it around.

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,160
I don't want him to think
I'm rolling in money.

128
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,198
It's his favourite occupation,
getting that ring appraised.

129
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,828
That and telling
the gruesome details of his life.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,989
Now, wait a minute.

131
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,914
I can't have anyone in. Your father
won't play bridge or do anything.

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,834
He just wants to watch Westerns on TV
or tell the story of his life.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,672
Well, people seem to be interested.

134
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,919
That story of your mother's funeral.

135
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,750
- I don't remember that.
- Don't get him started.

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,108
He keeps telling how he wouldn't allow
his father to his mother's funeral.

137
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,840
- You suggesting I should've let him?
- I'm not saying...

138
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,230
He'd run out on us
when we were kids.

139
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,152
Can you imagine telling everyone...

140
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,629
...how he shoved his father
off the funeral coach?

141
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,157
I'd do it again.

142
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,072
I was 10 years old.

143
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,437
He hadn't been around to see us
for over a year.

144
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,758
Four of us living together
in that two-room tenement.

145
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,150
Suddenly, he showed up
at the funeral...

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,231
...weeping, begging.

147
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,356
Drunk as usual.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,636
I shoved him off.

149
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,193
I didn't see him until years later, when
he was dying in Bellevue of drink.

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,437
- What looks good to you?
- I haven't finished yet.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,151
I went down to see him,
asked if he wanted anything.

152
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,117
He said he wanted an orange.

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,919
So I sent him in
a half dozen oranges.

154
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,071
I would've sent more,
except he was dying...

155
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,277
...and there was no point
in just sending oranges to the nurses.

156
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,435
The next morning, he died.

157
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,752
Look at your menu, Father.
What looks good to you?

158
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,957
I don't feel like anything.
I have no appetite.

159
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,954
- This is the way it's been.
- Here we are.

160
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,714
Six-to-one.

161
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,269
Oh, damn it.

162
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,033
You always ask for lemon peel.

163
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,112
But twisted over it,
not dumped into it.

164
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,153
It's all right. It's all right.

165
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,278
Well, to your smiling Irish eyes.

166
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,271
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?

167
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,952
I like to get a rise out of them.

168
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,111
If they kid with me,
I give them a good tip.

169
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,511
If not, straight 10 percent.

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,438
Now, what's the matter?

171
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,795
If you wanna make a fool of yourself,
go ahead.

172
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,717
- It's lovely, dear.
- Thank you.

173
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,635
I don't know how he can stand listening
to those Westerns hour after hour.

174
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,597
I think he always wanted
to be a cowboy.

175
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,274
He won't listen to the things
I wanna hear.

176
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,238
Down in Florida,
there was only one TV in the lounge...

177
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,879
...and he rode herd on it.

178
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,199
And then he'd go to sleep
in three minutes.

179
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,838
Still, he's a remarkable man.

180
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,677
Good old Mom.

181
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,829
What a shame that children
can't see their parents...

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,594
...when they're young
and courting and in love.

183
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,788
Gene!

184
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,111
Come and watch this one.
It's a real shoot-'em-up.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,590
I'll be down in a minute, Dad.

186
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,076
Now, tell me about California.

187
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,837
Well, I liked it a lot.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,070
It was good for you to get away
for a while...

189
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,595
...from your apartment
and memories of Carol.

190
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,318
Mother...

191
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,029
...I told you about the woman
that I met in California, Peggy.

192
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,430
The doctor with the children.

193
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,239
I'm thinking of marrying her.

194
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,672
Well, she sounds
like a lovely woman.

195
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,152
And people would expect a man
your age to marry again.

196
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,311
And she has her practice out there.

197
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,836
And children and their friends
and their schools.

198
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,352
Well, there's still trains and planes.

199
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,196
And Alice comes home from Chicago
once or twice a year with the children.

200
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,435
Your father and I
can take care of each other.

201
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,999
He makes the beds...

202
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,435
...which is the only work
I'm not allowed to do...

203
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,479
...and I'll remember
where he put his chequebook.

204
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,275
I'm sorry it's worked out like this.

205
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,910
We're fortunate to have had you
so near us for so long.

206
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,711
Have you told your father?

207
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,438
No...

208
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,557
...but I think he's guessed
from my letters.

209
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,472
He says if I went out there to live,
it would kill you.

210
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,234
Why can't he say it would kill him?

211
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,516
Because he thinks
it wouldn't hold you...

212
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,035
...or mean anything to you.

213
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,631
I'll talk to him.

214
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,031
- He'll make a dreadful scene but...
- No.

215
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,873
You've always done that
for Alice and me.

216
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,358
I'll do it.

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,319
What?

218
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,110
- Where's your mother?
- She's upstairs. She's gone to bed.

219
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,119
Dad.

220
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,590
This is a good one.
This fellow can really handle a gun.

221
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,593
- Dad, I wanna talk to you about...
- Just a minute.

222
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,877
- I'm gonna go.
- Oh, so soon?

223
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,439
We see so little of you.

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,874
I'm up at least once a week.

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,669
Oh, I'm not complaining,
but there never seems to be any time...

226
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,559
...and when you are here
your mother does all the talking.

227
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,474
Well...

228
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,710
...all's lost, all's spent...

229
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,394
...when we our desires
get without content.

230
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,111
'Tis better to be that
which we destroy...

231
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,716
...then by destruction
dwell in doubtful joy.

232
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,069
Well, we'll get a chance to talk, Dad.

233
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,710
Maybe you can come down into town
in a couple of days and have lunch.

234
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,440
- I'd like to talk to you.
- That's a wonderful idea.

235
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,113
I'll call.

236
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,511
Can't tell you what a comfort it is
knowing you're down in the city.

237
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,035
Don't know what we'd do
without you, Gene.

238
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,760
- No hat or coat?
- No.

239
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,639
It's still chilly.
You should be careful.

240
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,556
You're coming up
for your mother's birthday?

241
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,439
- Yes.
- Gonna be my party.

242
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,512
And Gene...

243
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,835
...remember what I said
about California.

244
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,878
Good night, Dad.

245
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,909
Be careful. I noticed you were
inclined to push it a little up there.

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,675
You make a full stop at the end
of the driveway and then turn left.

247
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,673
Then there's a lot of traffic out...

248
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,669
Take the first left
and then the second right.

249
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,831
Good night, old man.

250
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,432
Hello, Norma?

251
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,432
It's Gene.

252
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,111
Couple days ago.

253
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,399
Listen...

254
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,155
...would you like to come out
for a drink?

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,560
Okay. Good.

256
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,314
I'll see you in about 10 minutes,
all right?

257
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,519
Bye.

258
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,350
Just once.

259
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,794
Just once I'd like you
to come see me and then after...

260
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,632
Afterwards, smile.

261
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,753
Thanks.

262
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,119
You feel guilty, that upsets me and the
whole thing gives me the willies.

263
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,998
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,273
What are you feeling
so guilty about now?

265
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,873
That you're gonna get married
and you're here with me?

266
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,431
Oh, I don't know, I just...

267
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,034
...always feel like I'm using you.

268
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,468
I don't think of it as using.

269
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,232
Back when Carol was dying, when you
first came running up those steps...

270
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,558
...I was pretty damn touched
by the whole thing.

271
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,836
You make it sound great.

272
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,675
- Somewhere you must hate me.
- No.

273
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,310
- You're bad.
- Coming to you like this, l...

274
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,268
"Hello, are you gonna be in?
I wanna come over."

275
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,594
Still I get all like...

276
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,073
So...

277
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,198
...some other men
go out on a binge.

278
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,311
You come to me.

279
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,153
Frankly, I like your way better.

280
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,514
- It's just...
- Friendlier.

281
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,114
I get so fed up
with being treated like a child.

282
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,035
I mean, like an ungrateful child
by a senile old man.

283
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,716
I sit there and watch television
with him for hours while he sleeps.

284
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,475
Then when I'm going he says,
"We don't ever get to see you."

285
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,036
Why can't your sister
do some of his babysitting?

286
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,430
She's in Chicago...

287
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,995
...and banished away.

288
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,151
I told you...

289
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,430
...for marrying a Jew.

290
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,431
I hate him.

291
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,275
And I hate hating him.

292
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,678
I hate what it does to me...

293
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,309
...because when I'm around him l...

294
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,076
Somehow...

295
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,437
...I shrink.

296
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,515
Well, you'll be going away soon.

297
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,198
Yeah.

298
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,992
Yeah.

299
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,115
For some damn reason,
I feel guilty about leaving him.

300
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,475
Arguing with each other.

301
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,155
He was a big man in that city.

302
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,638
He was the mayor.

303
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,835
He was the president
of the board of education...

304
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,756
...and a lot else.

305
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,474
Now they don't know he exists.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,434
All his contemporaries are dead.

307
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,355
Who reads the bronze plaques
on school buildings?

308
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,430
A forgotten man
in an ungrateful city.

309
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,880
Now I'm gonna walk out on him too...

310
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,355
...and for some reason,
that just depresses the hell out of me.

311
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,800
It's a lousy world, my friend.

312
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,433
Yeah.

313
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,873
Only you wanna set it all right.

314
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,918
Make it like in storybooks.

315
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,430
Love eternal beyond death.

316
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,868
Grandma and Grandpa with the kiddies
gathered around them.

317
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,708
And sex always an expression
of abiding love.

318
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,353
Grow up, huh?

319
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,632
No.

320
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,676
Don't change.

321
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,393
Hello.

322
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,752
What is it, Dad?

323
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,630
Oh, Jesus.

324
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,917
I'll be right up there.

325
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,349
Excuse me.

326
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,999
Mrs. Garrison's room, please.

327
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,037
- Room 507.
- Thank you.

328
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,079
Mr. Beauhart. Mr. Beauhart
please come to admitting office.

329
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,278
I'm her son.

330
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,594
- Is Dr. Mayberry around?
- No, but he saw her an hour ago.

331
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,074
He seems to think everything is going
just as well as can be expected.

332
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,712
Thank you.

333
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,876
Miss Chilton.
Miss Chilton, number 2256.

334
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,075
Dad. Dad.

335
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,196
Oh, Gene.

336
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,755
Am I glad to see you.

337
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,115
- You've seen your mother?
- Yes, I have.

338
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,955
That doesn't sound any better, Dad.

339
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,517
I've had a shot.

340
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,432
After your mother got settled here...

341
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,672
...I went down to the doctor's office
and had a shot.

342
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,869
I just don't understand it.

343
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,191
I was getting breakfast...
You know, I've been getting breakfast.

344
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,874
- when suddenly,
I heard your mother scream.

345
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,473
"Tom! Tom!"

346
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,471
I went running up the stairs...

347
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,235
...and there she was,
stretched out on the floor.

348
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,152
"Nitro, nitro," she whispered.

349
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,276
You know,
we've got it all over the house.

350
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,954
Well, I gave her the nitro...

351
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,159
...and I called the doctor
and the ambulance...

352
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,273
...and here we are.

353
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,911
She had such a good time in Florida.

354
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,989
Oh, she worried about my cough
but she had a good time.

355
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,390
Dad, these things happen.

356
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,672
I suppose I could have seen
more of her down there...

357
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,314
...but she only wanted to play bridge.

358
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,630
I met some very interesting people.

359
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,679
You know, I met this man
came from Waterbury, Connecticut.

360
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,910
He used to know Helen Moffett.

361
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,753
I've told you about Helen Moffett,
haven't I?

362
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,080
When I was a kid, when the clouds
hung low and dark for me...

363
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,519
...my grandfather used to take me
out there sometimes on Sundays.

364
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,113
A city slum kid
in that beautiful country.

365
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,592
And Helen and l...

366
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,116
Oh, it never amounted to much.

367
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,435
We'd go to church,
then we'd take a walk.

368
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,231
Sit in a hammock
or under an apple tree.

369
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,316
I think she liked that.

370
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,909
But I didn't have any money,
so I didn't get out there very often.

371
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,276
Her mother never liked me.

372
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,955
"That young man will end up
the same way his father did."

373
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,949
And that scared her off.

374
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,750
This man from Florida,
I have his name here.

375
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,753
He said that Helen
had never married.

376
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,234
She'd been in love as a kid...

377
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,951
...and then never married.

378
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,592
Dr. Wish. Dr. Wish,
please come to Emergency.

379
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,469
Now, I would like to make
a suggestion.

380
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,709
What's that, Dad?

381
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,839
If we move right along, we might just
be able to make Rotary for dinner.

382
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,954
I've been away for three months.
They don't like that.

383
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,635
If you're absent too often,
they drop you or fine you.

384
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,392
What about it?

385
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,949
I thought we'd just grab a bite
here at the hospital.

386
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,079
Oh, I had lunch at the coffee shop
downstairs and it's terrible.

387
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,595
We'll just say hello to the fellas
and come back.

388
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,672
Your mother's sleeping now.
She'd want us to go.

389
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,319
Sure, Dad.

390
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,029
Dr. Robbins, please call 399.

391
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,668
I don't know what I'd do without you,
old man.

392
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,794
- You've been here before, haven't you?
- Yes.

393
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,598
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello Sam.

394
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,239
Good to see you back. Good trip?

395
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,871
Fine. Except for those damn winds
down there. Excuse my French, Sam.

396
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,951
You know my son Gene.
Reverend Pell.

397
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,155
- Yes.
- How are you?

398
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,357
Gene was a Marine.
You were a Marine, weren't you Sam?

399
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,238
- Oh, no, Navy.
- Well, same thing.

400
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,710
- Don't say that to a Marine.
- Gene saw the flag go up at lwo.

401
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,757
Dad, let's order a drink, shall we?

402
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,593
Oh, Sam, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

403
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,352
This isn't the appropriate time...

404
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,512
...but some bozo has been
crowding our pew at church.

405
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,275
I don't wanna seem unreasonable,
but there's a whole church to sit in.

406
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,749
Well, we'll see what we can do.

407
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,033
Martini, George. Six-to-one.

408
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,000
- Dubonnet, Gene?
- Martini.

409
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,636
I hope you don't drink
too many of those, Tom. Six to one.

410
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,509
My grandmother used to give me
every morning before school...

411
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,716
...when I was knee-high
to a grasshopper...

412
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,871
...a jigger of gin with garlic in it.

413
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,233
That was to keep away colds.

414
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,473
I wonder what the teachers thought.
I must have stunk to high heaven.

415
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,710
I don't want you to think
I'm running away...

416
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,031
...but I was on my way to the
little boys' room. Catch up at dinner.

417
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,792
Go ahead.
We don't want an accident.

418
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,316
- You got a great dad there, Gene.
- Thank you.

419
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,639
Dr. Peggy Thayer, please.

420
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,634
If she wants to know who's calling,
it's Gene Garrison from New York.

421
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,710
Hello, Peggy? How are you?

422
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,635
I'm sorry I didn't call earlier.

423
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,238
I'm okay.

424
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,438
Listen.

425
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,798
You know I picked up my mom and dad
at the plane and took them home.

426
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,033
Well...

427
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,152
...yesterday my...

428
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,675
My mother had a heart attack.

429
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,639
I went up there last night, and...

430
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,831
No, I'm in the city now.

431
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,555
The hospital just called.

432
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,068
My mother died a few minutes ago.

433
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,679
I'm sorry, Gene. There was nothing
that could be done.

434
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,593
She's been living on borrowed time
for quite a while.

435
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,512
Your father's all right.

436
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,194
You know, Gene, he's been prepared
for this for years.

437
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,830
It may, in many ways, be a relief.
He's taken wonderful care of her.

438
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,351
I know I'm touching
on a difficult matter...

439
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,517
...but, as an old friend, he shouldn't
be living in that house alone.

440
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,357
Do I have to look at all these?

441
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,714
It's the only way, Tom.

442
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,190
The best way is to let you just
wander around and look at them.

443
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,796
The prices are all marked
inside the caskets.

444
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,758
Nine hundred dollars. For the casket?

445
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,198
Well, that includes everything, Tom.
All our services...

446
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,158
...and one car for the mourners.
Other cars are extra.

447
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,754
We'll have your car.
We don't need any other.

448
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,390
If anybody else wants to come,
let them use their own cars.

449
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,716
Oh, dear, Gene.

450
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,640
Two thousand dollars?

451
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,792
- What are these made of?
- They vary, Tom.

452
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,430
Steel, bronze, wood.

453
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,592
What accounts for that variation
in price?

454
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,115
Material, workmanship,
the finish inside.

455
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,874
You see, this is all silk.

456
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,799
I suppose the metal ones
stand up the best.

457
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,111
Of course, the casket does not
go directly into the ground, Tom.

458
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,033
We first sink a concrete outer vault.

459
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,668
That prevents seepage, et cetera.

460
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,796
- That's included in the price?
- Oh, yes.

461
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,110
I suppose the metal ones
are welded at the seams.

462
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,872
Yes.

463
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,997
The plot up there is on a slope.
I suppose that's not so good.

464
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,397
I never thought of that
when I bought it.

465
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,269
I don't think it makes
much difference, Tom.

466
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,190
- For a child.
- Yes.

467
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,593
My mother would've fit into that.

468
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,228
She was just a little bit of a thing.

469
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,435
She died when I was 10.

470
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,439
I don't remember much
about the funeral except for my father.

471
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,116
He had run out on us...

472
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,669
...but he came back when she died...

473
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,313
...and I wouldn't let him come
to the cemetery.

474
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,551
Well, that's water over the dam...

475
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,109
...but this made me think of her.

476
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,708
Five hundred?
What do you think of this, Gene?

477
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,111
I like the colour of the silk.

478
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,236
Did you say this was silk
or satin, Marvin?

479
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,879
Silk.

480
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,760
I don't think it makes any difference.
Whatever you say.

481
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,912
Well, I mean, they all go
into that concrete thing.

482
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,352
This one's 800.
I don't see the difference.

483
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,789
I don't like the metal.
The wood seems warmer.

484
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,428
- Don't you agree, Gene?
- Yes, I do.

485
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,637
Nine hundred.

486
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,078
- Is there a tax?
- That includes the tax, Tom.

487
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,520
All right, let's settle on this
and get out of here.

488
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,749
Fine.

489
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,036
I'd estimate that Mrs. Garrison
should be...

490
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,158
That is if people want to come
and pay their respects...

491
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,151
...about noon tomorrow?
- That's fine.

492
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,515
Like to see where Mrs. Garrison
will be resting?

493
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,795
That won't be necessary.

494
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,396
- Will your sister be coming on?
- Yes, this afternoon.

495
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,952
Shall we go, Dad?

496
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,154
She was just a little bit of a thing.

497
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

498
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,915
I'm so glad you're here.

499
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,073
You didn't have to meet me
in all this rain.

500
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,115
- I wanted to get out of the house.
- I can imagine.

501
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,952
How is he?

502
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,555
He's fine.

503
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,476
God, how fine he is.

504
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,312
What do you mean?

505
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,436
No change. No change that I can see.

506
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,270
Reverend Pell came,
he told him his life story.

507
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,558
- How much money he made in 1929.
- Oh, God.

508
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,630
Damn it. You know,
our mother just died...

509
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,552
...and I wanted to talk about her...

510
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,909
...but she was never mentioned.

511
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,070
Except as my inspiration, which is
his cue to start the story of his life.

512
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,071
Sorry you've had to take it all alone.

513
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,754
I get so fed up with people
coming up to me and saying:

514
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,639
"Your dad is a remarkable man."

515
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,474
Nobody ever talks about Mother.
You'd think he died.

516
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,309
I just wanna say to them,
"You don't know my father.

517
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,436
You just know the man
in the newspapers.

518
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,229
He banished my sister for marrying
a Jew. That didn't get in the papers."

519
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,311
What a night that was.

520
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,034
Mother running out, sobbing,
you shouting at him, storming out...

521
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,875
...and the two of us sitting there,
father and son...

522
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,952
...eating...

523
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,832
...in silence.

524
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,633
Afterwards, I threw up.

525
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,153
I shouted and you threw up.

526
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,832
That was pretty much the pattern.

527
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,193
I felt guilty about Mother
all the way coming here.

528
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,830
I should've seen her more often,
brought the kids more often.

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,560
Instead I sent flowers.

530
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,598
Well, that's inevitable.
I felt the same way.

531
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,273
You?

532
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,113
You made her life.

533
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,835
A son shouldn't have to make
his mother's life.

534
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,758
Dad always said he didn't know
the meaning of the word quit.

535
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,751
Well, he quit on her.

536
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,319
And l...

537
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,470
I was just there. l...

538
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,234
Every time I see him like this, asleep,
the old tiger...

539
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,354
...the old man, my father.

540
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,033
Then he wakes up and becomes
Tom Garrison and I'm in trouble.

541
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,799
Margaret.

542
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,473
Dad.

543
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,435
I must have dozed off.

544
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,397
Where's your mother?

545
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,469
Dad, Alice is here.

546
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,675
Alice? What for?

547
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,317
Hello, Dad.

548
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,037
"For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God...

549
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,273
...to take from the world
the soul of our departed sister...

550
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,478
...we commit her body to the ground.

551
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,272
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

552
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,757
The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

553
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,594
Blessed be the name of the Lord."

554
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,394
Don't know how you feel...

555
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,836
...but I'd like to figure out
some kind of memorial for Mother...

556
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,315
...use some of the money she left.

557
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,357
Yes, definitely.

558
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,229
Maybe some shelves of books
for the children's library.

559
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,559
Christmas books with the stories
she liked to tell.

560
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,797
That's a good idea.

561
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,109
Well, Gene, what are we going to do?

562
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,878
I don't know.

563
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,115
I think you should go and get married
and move to California, but...

564
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,598
I might as well get it off my chest.

565
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,594
It would be murder
if he came to live with us.

566
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,957
In the first place he wouldn't do it,
feeling as he does about Sidney.

567
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,914
Kids can't stand how he tells them
how to do everything.

568
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,310
I can't tell you how it makes me feel
as a man...

569
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,835
...to see someone like that who's...

570
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,438
...distinguished and remarkable, just...

571
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,958
Just...

572
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,599
...become a nuisance.

573
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,909
I know I sound hard...

574
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,033
...but as long as we can be assured
that he's taken care of...

575
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,068
Oh, I'll feel some guilt
and you maybe more...

576
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,914
...but my responsibility
is to my husband and children.

577
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,153
Yes.

578
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,395
- That's your responsibility.
- And your responsibility is to yourself.

579
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,395
Get married again to get away
from memories of Carol...

580
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,278
...and her whole world.
- Oh, well...

581
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,913
Maybe it's Mother's death, the funeral.

582
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,834
All I can think about is Carol.

583
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,913
Gene, my friend, my brother.

584
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,195
Get out of here.

585
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,040
You know we only remember
the terrible things about Dad.

586
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,475
I've been trying to remember
some of the...

587
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,918
...others.

588
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,915
- What he did for us.
- I'm doing a lot for my kids.

589
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,674
I don't expect them to pay me back
at the other end.

590
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,875
I'm sure we can find a full-time
housekeeper and he can afford it.

591
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,598
He wouldn't agree to that.

592
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,478
Either that or finding a home.

593
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,631
We might as well face it.
His mind is going.

594
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,837
Sooner or later we'll have to start
thinking powers of attorney...

595
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,230
...perhaps even committing him
to an institution.

596
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,753
God, it's all so ugly.

597
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,358
He kicked me out.

598
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,988
He said he never wanted
to see me again.

599
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,958
He broke Mother's heart over that
for years.

600
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,509
He was mean, unloving.

601
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,592
He used to beat you when you were
a kid if you disobeyed him.

602
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,955
You've hated and feared him
all your adult life.

603
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,599
Still, he's my father and a man.

604
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,479
And what's happening to him as a man
appals me.

605
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,075
You know how ashamed I feel.

606
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,752
Not being able to say to him:

607
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,912
"Papa, come live with me. I love you.
I wanna take care of you."

608
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,119
I'm going to talk to him tonight
about a housekeeper.

609
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,713
I'll do the dirty work...

610
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,075
...but when he turns to you,
don't you give in.

611
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,315
I've always wanted to love him.

612
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,355
I've always needed to love him.

613
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,751
How are you coming?

614
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,154
Oh, Alice.

615
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,075
I've written out receipts for you to sign
for the jewellery your mother left you...

616
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,674
...and the things she left
for Charlotte.

617
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,349
All right.

618
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,152
It may not be necessary,
but as the executor...

619
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,709
...l'll be held responsible
for these things.

620
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,271
- Dad, I wanna talk with you...
- All right.

621
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,274
But first I want Gene to hear this letter
I've written to Harry Hall.

622
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,908
He and I used to play golf together
out in Jersey.

623
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,275
He wrote me a nice letter
about your mother...

624
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,034
...and I've written to him.
It will only take a minute...

625
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,953
...if I can read my own shorthand.

626
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,672
"Dear Harry.

627
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:51,075
How thoughtful of you to write me
on the occasion of Margaret's death.

628
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,635
It was quite a blow.

629
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,755
As you know,
she was my inspiration...

630
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,954
...and had been since that day
55 years ago...

631
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,439
...when I first met her...

632
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,668
...when the clouds hung low
and dark for me.

633
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,832
At the time, I was supporting
my younger brother and sister...

634
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,956
...and my aged grandfather...

635
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,399
...in a two-room flat,
going to work every day...

636
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,831
...in a lumber mill.

637
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,598
Providence, which has always been
my guide...

638
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,998
...prompted me to take a night course
in shorthand and typing...

639
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,109
...and also prompted me to go to
the Underwood Typewriting Company...

640
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,190
...seeking a position
as stenographer.

641
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,876
They sent me, God be praised...

642
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,160
...to the office
of T.J. Parks of Colonial Brass...

643
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,191
...and a job that started
at $5 a week...

644
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,876
...ended in 1954, when I retired...

645
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,474
...at 50,000 a year."

646
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,512
That's as far as I've gotten.

647
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,800
Dad, I don't think financial matters
are appropriate...

648
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,795
...in answering a letter of condolence.
- But it's true.

649
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,954
You see, it follows. I'm saying
that she was my inspiration...

650
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,634
...and it seems entirely appropriate
to explain it.

651
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,069
It's your letter, Dad.

652
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,153
- Dad, I'm leaving tomorrow and...
- What?

653
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,914
I'm going home tomorrow.

654
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,200
Well, Alice,
I'm grateful to you for coming.

655
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,114
Your mother would've appreciated it.
She was very fond of you.

656
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,514
I think we ought to talk over
what your plans are.

657
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,476
My plans?

658
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,194
I have many letters to answer...

659
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,794
...and a whole mess
in my files and accounts.

660
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,077
If the income-tax people
ever ask me to produce my books:

661
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,357
I didn't mean exactly that kind of plan.
I meant...

662
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,079
You plan to keep the house?

663
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,669
Why, of course. All my things are here.
It's... It's...

664
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,312
Oh, I'll be back on my feet.

665
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,759
My... will clear up...

666
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,150
...now this strain is over.

667
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,119
I'm confident I'll be in shape
any day now.

668
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,750
I worry leaving you in this house
alone, Dad.

669
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,638
I'm perfectly all right.

670
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,909
Don't you worry about me.
Either one of you.

671
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,993
Why... Why for the last year,
ever since your mother's first attack...

672
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,956
...l've been getting the breakfasts,
making the beds, using a dust rag.

673
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,873
And the laundress comes in
once a week to clean up for me...

674
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,319
...and Gene here, he'll keep an eye
on me, drop in once or twice a week.

675
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,708
- That's the point...
- Alice.

676
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,270
We think you should get
a full-time housekeeper to live here.

677
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,353
Alone, here with me?
Well, that's not very proper, is it?

678
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,673
- Nevertheless...
- No.

679
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,951
Now, that's final.

680
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,953
- Gene and I would feel a lot better if...
- Look, Alice.

681
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,119
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm perfectly all right.

682
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,159
You go. Leave with a clear mind.
I'm all right.

683
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,517
I will appreciate Gene's dropping in
now and then, but I'm all right.

684
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,596
We would still like to get
a full-time housekeeper.

685
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,069
What do you mean
you would like to get?

686
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,710
I've hired and fired
thousands of people in my day.

687
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,394
I don't need anyone
getting someone for me.

688
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,471
- Well, will you do it yourself then?
- No.

689
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,555
I told you no.

690
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,032
Since I was 8 years old,
I've taken care of myself.

691
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,677
What would you know about it?
You were given everything on a platter.

692
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,196
At an age when you were swinging
on that tree out there...

693
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,271
...breaking all the branches...

694
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,432
...I was selling newspapers
five hours a day.

695
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,588
And at night, dancing a jig in saloons
for pennies.

696
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,877
You tell me
I can't take care of myself.

697
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,068
If I want a housekeeper, and I don't,
I'll hire one myself.

698
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,109
I've hired and fired
thousands of people in my day...

699
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,909
...when I was vice president of
Colonial Brass at 50,000 a year.

700
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,395
Two thousand people.

701
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,714
And you tell me I'm incompetent
to hire a housekeeper.

702
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,389
How many people have you hired?

703
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,719
You teach.

704
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,517
All right. If that's what you want to do,
that's your business...

705
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,875
...but don't talk to me
about hiring and firing.

706
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,515
Dad, you might fall down.

707
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,876
Why fall down?

708
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,279
Nothing wrong with my balance.

709
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,796
- When you get up, you're dizzy.
- Nonsense.

710
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,479
l...

711
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,435
I appreciate your concern...

712
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,354
...but I'm perfectly able to carry on
by myself.

713
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,549
As I said, with Gene's help
from time to time.

714
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,628
I imagine we could have dinner
once in a while, couldn't we, Gene?

715
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,190
Once or twice a week?
Take you up to Rotary.

716
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,635
- Some of the speakers are amusing.
- Sure, Dad.

717
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,032
Give us time to get together at last,
a chance to know each other.

718
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,474
Gene wants to get married.

719
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,312
- Alice.
- What?

720
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,199
Gene wants to move to California
and get married.

721
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,475
Alice, will you shut up?

722
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,710
I can't help it.
You've never faced up to him.

723
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,110
- Let him ruin your life.
- I can handle my own life!

724
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,554
- You can't.
- Children.

725
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,077
Children.

726
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,595
I don't want to interfere
with either of your lives.

727
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,311
I took of myself at 8,
I can take care of myself at 80.

728
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,789
I've never wanted to be a burden
to my children.

729
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,997
- I'm gonna hang around, Dad.
- There's no need to.

730
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,151
I'll move in until you start
feeling better.

731
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,878
I don't want to ruin your life.

732
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,794
I didn't say that.

733
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,839
I've long had the impression
that my only function in this family...

734
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,592
...was to supply the money...
- Dad.

735
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,594
- To supply funds for your education.
- Dad, will you stop it!

736
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,350
As far as I'm concerned,
this conversation has ended.

737
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,429
Alice, we've gotten along very well
for some years without your attention...

738
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,955
- Dad.
- You sent me away. Don't forget that.

739
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,112
You chose to lead your own life.
Well, we won't keep you now.

740
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,269
Dad, come on, stop it.

741
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,352
I've been competent to go into the city
year after year...

742
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,355
...to earn money for your clothes,
your food, the roof over your head.

743
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,354
Am I now incompetent?

744
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,194
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

745
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,515
For God's sakes, Alice...

746
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,148
I'm trying to get a practical matter
accomplished.

747
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,390
You didn't have to destroy him
in the process.

748
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,838
I wasn't discussing his competence,
so that will be a matter for discussion.

749
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,788
You can go with a clear conscience.
I'm doing this because I want to.

750
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,313
You can't help yourself.

751
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,391
When I wanna be analysed,
I'll pay for it.

752
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,154
Did you see yourself
when he started to rage? You shrank.

753
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,959
I shrank at the ugliness
of what was happening.

754
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,715
You're staying because you can't stand
his wrath the day you say:

755
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,279
"Dad, I'm leaving."

756
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,034
You've never been able
to stand up to his anger.

757
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,833
Oh, look, Alice...

758
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,150
He'll call you ungrateful
and you'll believe him.

759
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,630
What do you want us to do?
Let it be known that Alice and Gene...

760
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,268
...have done all we can
to help this old man...

761
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,032
...in old age and make him happy...

762
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,997
...without inconveniencing
ourselves.

763
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,958
He's refused our help,
so if he falls and hits his head...

764
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,872
...lies and rots, it's not our fault.

765
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,349
Don't think anyone expects us
to ruin our lives...

766
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,953
...for an unreasonable old man.

767
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,076
- It's not gonna ruin my life.
- It is.

768
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,151
- It's a week or a month.
- Forever.

769
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,716
Oh, Alice...

770
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,593
...let's stop this.

771
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,953
I know what I'm gonna do.
I just can't do anything else.

772
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,791
Maybe there isn't the same thing
between a mother and a daughter...

773
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,476
...but the old man in me...

774
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,712
...wants to extend some kind of mercy
to that old man.

775
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,597
I never had a father.

776
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,832
I ran away from him,
he ran away from me.

777
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,116
Maybe he's right.

778
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,713
It's time we found each other.

779
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,319
Excuse me for saying so,
but I find that a lot of sentimental crap.

780
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,795
What do you hope to find?

781
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,715
You hope to find love?

782
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,394
Can't tell from what he said
what you're going to find?

783
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,232
Alice, don't give me the textbooks.

784
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,753
He wants your balls.

785
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,591
And he's had them.

786
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,638
I'm sorry.

787
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,791
I want to shock you.

788
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,190
When has he ever regarded you
as a man...

789
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,113
...an equal, a male?

790
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,474
When you were a Marine.

791
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,234
And that you did for him.
You didn't wanna be a Marine.

792
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,356
"Now, Papa, will you love me?"

793
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,468
When was he ever proud
of the things you do?

794
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,676
The things you value?

795
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,354
When did he ever mention
your teaching or your books...

796
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,033
...except in scorn?

797
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,668
I just do not wanna let my father
die a stranger.

798
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,920
You're looking for something
that isn't there, Gene.

799
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,356
You're looking for a mother's love
in a father.

800
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,829
Mothers are soft and yielding.

801
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,996
Fathers are hard and rough...

802
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,628
...to teach us the way of the world...

803
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,872
...which is rough, which is mean...

804
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,952
...which is selfish and prejudiced.

805
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,633
That's your definition.

806
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,870
Because of what he did,
you're entitled to it.

807
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,316
I've always been grateful
for what he did to me, kicking me out.

808
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,076
He taught me a marvellous lesson,
and has made me able to face a lot.

809
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,075
And there's been a lot to face,
and so I'm grateful as hell to him.

810
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,153
If I couldn't get the understanding
and compassion from a father...

811
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,595
...who could I expect it from?

812
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,877
So I learned, and I didn't expect it.

813
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,670
And I've found very little,
and so I'm grateful to him.

814
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,158
I'm grateful as hell to him.

815
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,595
Let's not argue anymore.

816
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,433
I'm gonna stay, Alice...

817
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,750
...for a while, at least,
for whatever reasons.

818
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,638
And Peggy?

819
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,872
Oh, we'll see.
She'll be here in a week for a meeting.

820
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,190
Don't lose her, Gene.

821
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,512
Maybe I'm still fouled up
on myself...

822
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,990
...but I think I've spoken near the truth
about you.

823
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,075
Suddenly I miss Mother so.

824
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,998
Board!

825
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,749
Let me emphasise that this place would
only be equipped to handle your dad...

826
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,629
...while he's still able
to function reasonably well.

827
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,637
Of course, at Christmas
we fix it up with holly and candles.

828
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,916
Make it very attractive.

829
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,837
This is a superior place.

830
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,638
Rates run around $50 a day.

831
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,153
Well, the state hospital's
just a few minutes drive from here.

832
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,317
Oh, my God.

833
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,316
It may sound brutal to say it...

834
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,597
...but that's the other side
of our miracle drugs.

835
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,434
We keep them alive...

836
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,789
...but a grim alternative.

837
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,597
Attention, please.
Flight number 10 from Los Angeles...

838
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,194
...has arrived at Gate Number 3.

839
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,278
Come over here.

840
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,796
It's great to see you.

841
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,993
The real world.

842
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,991
Promise me one thing.

843
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,111
We'll die young.

844
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,874
It's a little late for me.

845
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,237
I mean, before we...

846
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,398
Before we become public nuisances.

847
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,671
Oh, my love.

848
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,316
It's been rough.

849
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,636
- That old man...
- I know.

850
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,075
I see it all the time.

851
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,035
Have you managed
to find a housekeeper for him?

852
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,113
I looked at the homes the other day.
The institutions, it's...

853
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,835
We'd all come east, you know.

854
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,792
The kids.

855
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,751
- lf you want it that way.
- I don't want it that way.

856
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,911
I don't know what I want.

857
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,829
I just know I want you.

858
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,958
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

859
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,236
I told you when I left
I'd be out tonight.

860
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,389
- You did?
- Yes.

861
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,313
Oh, well,
my mind's a complete sieve.

862
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,040
Dad, this is Peggy Thayer.
Dr. Peggy Thayer.

863
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,670
Oh, doctor,
I have a slight pain right here.

864
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,599
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do, Mr. Garrison?

865
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,638
I don't think Peggy can help you much.
She's a gynaecologist.

866
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,836
- A what?
- I'm a woman's doctor.

867
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,788
Oh, yes, yes. Margaret
was always running to one of those.

868
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,713
Well, I'll just have to take my trade
to someone else.

869
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,237
I must apologise
for the condition of this house.

870
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,914
You see,
Mrs. Garrison passed on just recently.

871
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,913
Yes. I was very sorry
to hear about that.

872
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,872
Hundreds of letters to answer.

873
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,952
And look at this, we simply must do
something about this.

874
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,238
Your mother's magazine subscriptions.
And this book club.

875
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,995
I've been reading some of it.
Absolutely revolting...

876
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,879
...the things they get away with
nowadays.

877
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,437
I'm sure you don't read
things like this.

878
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,352
What you mean
"things like this," Dad?

879
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,396
I'm not going to describe them
in front of this charming girl.

880
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,878
Are you from this area, Miss?

881
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,554
- Did you tell me your name?
- Dad, this is Peggy from California.

882
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,311
Oh, yes.

883
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,273
- Do you intend to stay long, Miss...?
- Please, call me Peggy.

884
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,273
May I? Thank you.

885
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,394
Is that your real name,
or is it short for Margaret?

886
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,030
- My real name's Margaret.
- My wife's name was Margaret.

887
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,033
But she was never called Peggy
or Maggy.

888
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,349
Always Margaret.

889
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,312
Yes, it would never have occurred
to me to call her Peggy.

890
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,189
She was a Margaret,
but Peggy is right for you.

891
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,554
I'm gonna go tuck him in
and say good night.

892
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,435
- Gene.
- What?

893
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,477
- Don't get mad.
- What?

894
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,515
I think he's charming.

895
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,958
Most people do.

896
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,434
I'll just be a minute.

897
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,998
- You ready to be tucked in?
- Yes.

898
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,756
Look at all the weight I've lost.

899
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,558
You got quite a little pot there.

900
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,280
Yeah, but through here,
through my chest.

901
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,954
We're gonna put all that back
on you.

902
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,759
You know, I never had any hair
on my chest.

903
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,480
I don't understand it.
You had hair on your chest.

904
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,710
I just never had any.

905
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,230
Oh, well. I'm confident
if I can get some exercise.

906
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,789
Remember when I used to
get you up in the morning...

907
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,949
...we'd go down...

908
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,270
...do callisthenics to the radio?
- Oh, yeah.

909
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,038
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

910
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,192
Take it easy, now.
Gotta wait till morning for that.

911
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,276
And then we'd put on the gloves
and spar on the side porch.

912
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,874
- Oh, yeah.
- The manly art of self-defence.

913
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,873
Gentleman Jim Corbett.

914
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,676
Wait, wait, wait.

915
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,915
- Hey!
- What?

916
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,278
Well, I'm gonna get over to the club
and play some golf.

917
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,277
Sit around
and swap stories with the boys.

918
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,954
Too bad you never took up golf.

919
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,557
I was just going through
these desk drawers.

920
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,759
I don't know, just going over things...

921
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,718
...pictures.

922
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,956
I think you've seen most of them.

923
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,838
The family.

924
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,672
You know, Dad...

925
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,078
...I don't think I've ever seen
a picture of your father.

926
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,869
He's just a boy.

927
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,676
That was just about the time
he got married.

928
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,277
Oh, he was a fine looking man
before he started drinking.

929
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,557
Big, square, high colour...

930
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,268
...but he became my mortal enemy.

931
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,755
Did I ever show you this? Careful.

932
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,232
I made a home
for my brother and sister.

933
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,639
We were out one day
and he came around...

934
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,952
...and ripped up
all my sister's clothes and shoes.

935
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,956
Drunk, of course.

936
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,950
A few days later
he came around to apologise...

937
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,156
...and ask for some money...

938
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,351
...and I threw him out.

939
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,674
The next day he left that note.

940
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,190
- And you kept it?
- Yeah.

941
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,670
I didn't see him again
till many years later...

942
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,354
...when he was dying in Bellevue.

943
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,839
Somebody got word to me.

944
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,072
And I went down to see
if he wanted anything.

945
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,470
He said he'd like some fruit.

946
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,434
So I sent him in some oranges.

947
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,879
He died the next day.

948
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,037
There must have been something
there to love, understand.

949
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,111
In my father?

950
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,870
Do you remember this, Gene?

951
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:15,951
"To the greatest dad in the world
on Father's Day, 1946."

952
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,238
I appreciate that, Gene.
That's a lovely tribute.

953
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,516
I think I have all
of your Father's Day cards here.

954
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,672
You know, I never wanted children,
coming from the background I did.

955
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,919
We didn't have Alice for a long time...

956
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,358
...but Margaret finally persuaded me.

957
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,751
She said they'd be a comfort
in our old age.

958
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,393
And you are, Gene.

959
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,073
Well, l...

960
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,118
A programme of yours in college,
some glee club concert.

961
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,358
I have everything in here
but the kitchen stove.

962
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,318
- Do you still sing?
- No, Dad. No, I haven't for years.

963
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,631
Oh, that's too bad.
You had a good voice.

964
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,199
Well, we can't do everything.

965
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,715
Oh, I remember your mother would sit
at the piano, hour after hour...

966
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,395
...and I'd be up here at my desk,
listening to you sing.

967
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,948
You always used to asked me to sing
"When I Grow Too Old To Dream."

968
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,792
Did I?

969
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,913
I don't remember
your ever singing that.

970
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,035
You always seemed to be just finishing
when I came into the room.

971
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,039
Did you used to sing that for me?

972
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,913
No...

973
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,354
...but you always asked me
to sing it for you.

974
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,071
Well, I certainly enjoyed
sitting up here and listening.

975
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,228
- That was my mother.
- Oh, yes.

976
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,356
I've seen this, Dad.

977
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,112
It's lovely.

978
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,236
She was just 25 when that was taken.

979
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,910
She died the next year.

980
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,239
I used to carry it in my wallet
all the time...

981
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,756
...and I felt I was wearing it out,
so I put it away.

982
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,357
Just a little bit of a thing.

983
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,433
Hey. Hey.

984
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,477
Dad.

985
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,750
I never thought it would be like this.

986
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,276
I always thought I'd go first.

987
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,678
I'm sorry.

988
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,118
Just comes over me. l...

989
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,231
It'll pass.

990
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,039
I'll get hold of myself.

991
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,556
Don't try, Dad. Believe me, it's best.

992
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,356
No, no, it...

993
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,917
It's just that...

994
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,079
- I'll be all right.
- No, it's rough, Dad.

995
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,073
- It's bound to be rough.
- It'll pass.

996
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,316
It'll pass.

997
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,356
- Want me to put these things away?
- No, I can...

998
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,795
Yes, if you would.

999
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,238
I don't know what we'd do
without you, Gene.

1000
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,274
Dad. How'd you like Peggy?

1001
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,958
Who?

1002
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,513
Oh, yes.
Oh, very nice, very attractive.

1003
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,357
Dad, I'm thinking very seriously
about marrying her...

1004
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,590
...and going out to California to live.

1005
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,515
Dad, I know this is your home,
what you're used to...

1006
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,956
...but, well, I'd like you to come
out there with me, Dad.

1007
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:20,113
It's lovely out there.
We'd get you an apartment close to us.

1008
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,158
You know...

1009
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,200
...I would like to make a suggestion.
- All right.

1010
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,157
Why don't you all come here to live?

1011
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,195
- Peggy has her practice out there, Dad.
- A what?

1012
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,034
She's a doctor. I told you.

1013
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,953
And she has children
and they have their school and friends.

1014
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,749
Well, we have a big house here,
and you always liked this house.

1015
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,399
It's wonderful for children.

1016
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,630
You used to play baseball
out back...

1017
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,395
...and then
there's that basketball thing.

1018
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,473
Well, Dad, I'd like to get away
from this country for a while.

1019
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,710
It's been rough here
ever since Carol died...

1020
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,950
...and it would be good for you,
getting away.

1021
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,669
Your mother would be very happy
to have the house full of children.

1022
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,516
I won't be around long,
and then, it's all yours.

1023
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,555
Dad, that's very kind of you.

1024
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,595
I don't think it would work out.

1025
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,517
Besides, Peggy's work
and her children...

1026
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,955
...all her family's out there.

1027
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,515
Your family's here.

1028
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,957
Yes, I know.

1029
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,473
You know, Gene, I'm just saying this
for your own good...

1030
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,395
...but you went out to California
shortly after Carol's death...

1031
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,151
...and you were exhausted
from her long illness...

1032
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,518
...and, well, naturally,
very susceptible.

1033
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,399
I'm wondering if you waited
long enough to know your mind.

1034
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,549
I know my own mind.

1035
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,792
I mean, taking on
another man's children.

1036
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,836
Did you mention this business
to your mother?

1037
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,877
Yes, she told me to go
with her blessing.

1038
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,077
She would say that, of course,
but I warned you.

1039
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,913
Oh, for God's sakes.

1040
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,436
All right, go ahead.

1041
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,512
I can manage. Send me
a Christmas card, if you remember.

1042
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,194
- Dad.
- What?

1043
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,669
- I've asked you to come with me.
- I'm not going.

1044
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,957
I understand that but not this
"send me a card, if you remember."

1045
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,997
I'm sorry if I offend you.

1046
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,357
Your mother always said
I mustn't raise my voice to you.

1047
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,080
Want me to make it easy for you
the way your mother did?

1048
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,196
Well, I won't. If you wanna go, go!

1049
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,873
Oh, goddamn it.

1050
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,157
I always knew it would be like this
after your mother was gone.

1051
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,073
I was only tolerated in this house
because I paid the bills.

1052
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,913
- Oh, shut up.
- Don't you tell me to shut up.

1053
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,832
Shut up!

1054
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,550
I've asked you to come with me.
What do you want?

1055
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,836
What the hell do you want?

1056
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,397
If I lived here the rest of my life,
it wouldn't be enough for you.

1057
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,031
I've tried, goddamn it,
I've tried to be the dutiful son.

1058
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,953
Commanded into your presence
on every conceivable occasion.

1059
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,554
Easter, birthdays, Christmas,
Thanksgiving.

1060
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:08,349
Even the Thanksgiving when Carol was
dying, I was with her in the hospital.

1061
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,636
"We miss you.
Our day is nothing without you.

1062
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,631
Could you come
after you leave Carol?"

1063
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,872
You had no regard for what was really
going on. My wife was dying!

1064
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,076
Is it so terrible
to wanna see your own son?

1065
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,755
It's terrible to wanna possess him
entirely and completely, yes.

1066
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,358
There'll be some papers to sign
for your mother's estate.

1067
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,717
- Leave an address with your lawyer.
- Oh, Dad.

1068
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,075
From tonight on,
you can consider me dead.

1069
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,313
I've given you everything.

1070
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,913
Since I was a snot-nosed kid...

1071
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,150
...l've worked my fingers
to the bone for you.

1072
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,788
You had everything, I had nothing.

1073
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,474
I put a roof over your head,
clothes on your back.

1074
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,313
- Food on the table.
- You ungrateful bastard!

1075
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,710
What do you want for gratitude?
Nothing!

1076
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,996
Nothing would be enough for you!

1077
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,674
You resented every damn thing
you ever gave me!

1078
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:59,559
The orphan boy in you
resented everything!

1079
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,152
I'm sorry as hell
about your miserable childhood.

1080
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,630
When you used to tell me those stories,
I'd come to my room and cry...

1081
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,519
...but there's nothing I can do
about it now...

1082
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,160
...and it does not excuse everything.

1083
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,719
And I am grateful to you!

1084
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,519
I admire, respect you,
stand in awe of what you've done.

1085
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,875
I'll never even be able to touch it.

1086
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,510
But it does not make me love you,
and I wanted to love you.

1087
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,714
You hated your father
and I saw what that did to you...

1088
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,677
...and I did not wanna hate you.

1089
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,991
- I don't care what you feel about me.
- Well, I do.

1090
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,391
I came so close
to loving you tonight.

1091
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,516
I'd never felt so open to you.

1092
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,989
You don't know what it cost me
to ask you to come.

1093
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,069
When I've never been able to sit
in the same room alone with you.

1094
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,151
You think your door
was always open to me?

1095
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,392
It's not my fault
if you never came through it.

1096
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,029
Goodbye, Dad.

1097
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,112
- I'll have somebody stay with you.
- I don't want anybody.

1098
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,671
I can take care of myself.
I've always had to take care of myself.

1099
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,478
Who needs you? Out!

1100
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,718
I've lived my whole life...

1101
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,714
...so that I could look any man
in the eye and tell him to go to hell.

1102
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,235
That night,
I left my father's house forever.

1103
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,512
I took the first right
and the second left...

1104
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,354
...and this time,
went as far as California.

1105
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,432
We saw each other a few times
after that.

1106
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,434
We visited him and he visited us...

1107
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,268
...but then the arteries
began to harden.

1108
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,714
We put him in a hospital...

1109
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,872
...and he gradually slipped
into speechless senility.

1110
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,192
Not long after...

1111
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,510
...sitting and staring
without comprehension...

1112
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,272
...at the television...

1113
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,272
...he died...

1114
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,238
...alone...

1115
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,800
...without even an orange
in his hand.

1116
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,709
Death ends a life...

1117
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,831
...but it does not end a relationship...

1118
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,069
...which struggles on
in the surviv or's mind...

1119
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:25,155
...towards some resolution
which it may never find.

1120
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,832
Alice.

1121
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,989
Alice said I would not accept
the sadness of this world.

1122
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,915
What does it matter
if I never loved him...

1123
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,435
...or he never loved me?

1124
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,711
Perhaps she was right.

1125
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,112
But still...

1126
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,233
...when I hear the word "father"...

1127
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,197
...it matters.
