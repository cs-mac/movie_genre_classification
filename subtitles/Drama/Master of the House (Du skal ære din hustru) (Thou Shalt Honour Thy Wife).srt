1
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:19,138
A vacancy just opened up.

2
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:27,538
Will it be okay
if I fill the empty spot?

3
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:36,658
<i>Episode 19</i>

4
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:45,738
Do you know this?
I came into politics with power.

5
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:56,897
Gil Do, only live today as an animal.

6
00:00:56,898 --> 00:01:01,517
If you continue to do so I'll chew you up.

7
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,468
I asked if I'm capable of filling in?

8
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:11,038
Come in.

9
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,758
How could I stop this animal?

10
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:21,498
Your name is...

11
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:25,837
Hwang Seong Woo.

12
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:29,807
Which crime committed by the Noodle
Master will you be testifying about?

13
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:32,137
<i>Soliciting murder and</i>

14
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,637
<i>numerous incidents of
embezzlement and corruption.</i>

15
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,367
Also forgery of documents and...

16
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:43,268
I'll testify regarding assault,
blackmailing and other crimes.

17
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,427
<i>Let's do it here.</i>

18
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:08,507
<i>Please spare me.</i>

19
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,367
<i>Go beg the Noodle Master.
It's no use asking me.</i>

20
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:16,047
<i>You're not able to kill anyone.</i>

21
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:23,387
<i>But if you send me to the Noodle Master
it's like sending me to my death.</i>

22
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:26,327
<i>What's the difference
from your killing me?!</i>

23
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:27,867
<i>Shut him up.</i>

24
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:32,407
<i>Kim Dae Ha. Kim Dae Ha.</i>

25
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:34,248
<i>Move it.</i>

26
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:40,767
<i>Why is Dae Ha's name
coming out of your mouth?</i>

27
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:47,278
<i>What's going to happen when So Tae Seop finds
out that Dae Ha is the Noodle Master daughter?</i>

28
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,288
<i>Do you think he's going to let her live?</i>

29
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,307
<i>Why does So Tae Seop know that?</i>

30
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:58,728
<i>The moment that you kill me, all
the information will be sent.</i>

31
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,857
<i>Should I believe your bluff?</i>

32
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:06,007
<i>That's up to you whether
you believe me or not.</i>

33
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:12,338
<i>However if I'm telling the
truth, Kim Da Hae will die.</i>

34
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:20,278
<i>The Noodle Master isn't finished yet.</i>

35
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,567
<i>It's been bothering me.</i>

36
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,937
<i>Forget it.</i>

37
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:39,857
<i>Nothing will happen, right?</i>

38
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:43,337
<i>Stop imagining things.
Nothing is going to happen.</i>

39
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:47,268
<i>Then this is where I step out.</i>

40
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:10,638
<i>Let's go.</i>

41
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:47,447
I can testify to everything from the Noodle
Master's murder case to his money laundering.

42
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:52,497
Of course I have relevant evidence.

43
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:55,848
Say what your conditions are.

44
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:59,137
We seem to communicate well.

45
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:07,138
Doggoo... I mean CEO Lee Jeong Bum... You dropped
his case, right? I saw that and came forward.

46
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:15,497
Clean everything that is connected to me.

47
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,338
Then I will testify.

48
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:24,447
<i>I had sent a package to
Madam Go Gang Sook also.</i>

49
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:32,448
She couldn't quite use it to her benefit. I hope
you don't make the same mistake, Prosecutor.

50
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:38,068
I need time to think.

51
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:41,438
Think it over slowly.

52
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:45,998
However don't take too long.

53
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:53,737
<i>[Prosecution Service]</i>

54
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,767
<i>[After 3 Days]</i> What's going
on with Assemblyman Choi?

55
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:57,717
I haven't been able to
make contact for 4 days.

56
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:02,167
He hasn't attended the assembly
sessions or gone to his office.

57
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:06,357
As of now, we're not sure whether
he disappeared or is missing.

58
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,567
It seems to be a hush hush situation.

59
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,477
He can't have gone anywhere.

60
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,157
He must be hiding somewhere. As it was a parliamentary
session, we weren't able to conduct the arrest promptly.

61
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,587
You scared me.

62
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:20,447
Take a look at this.

63
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,887
<i>The police found the trace of briquettes inside the car... [Breaking news,
Choi Seong Do of Hanguk Freedom Party found dead, suicide suspected]</i>

64
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:27,727
<i>and evidence that shows the deceased's
family was going through recent stress.</i>

65
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:30,737
<i>It's being treated as a suicide
but is under investigation.</i>

<i>On the other hand, according to a friend
of Assemblyman Choi Seong Do, his aide</i>

67
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,627
<i>was arrested for violation
of the Foreign Exchange Law.</i>

68
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,637
<i>The pressure from the Prosecutor's
Office and the investigation...</i>

69
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:40,677
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

70
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,347
<i>Had a great influence over his
decision to commit suicide.</i>

71
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,448
<i>I'll be there shortly.</i>

72
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:52,657
<i>Opposed to Assemblyman So Tae Seop, who has been Assemblyman longest,
Assemblyman Choi Seong Do won by a landslide in his election,</i>

73
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:55,677
<i>and won an important Assembly seat.</i>

74
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:58,727
<i>Due to this incident, the district
of Assemblyman Choi Seong Do</i>

75
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,748
<i>is forced to hold an
election for a replacement.</i>

76
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:05,347
What oldest presider...

77
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:08,787
Experience, something that
can't be underestimated.

78
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:14,667
The first time is awkward. The second
time easier. The third effortless.

79
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,608
I didn't know you'd wrap it up so neatly.

80
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:25,487
You'll be nominated soon. A
lot of people are watching.

81
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:30,668
So, stay put and prepare for the election.

82
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:36,188
If I am to prepare for the election,
shouldn't I have something so I can prepare?

83
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:43,627
Money, gold nuggets. You took everything.

84
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:49,527
Except for what you digested, give back
your cud. I'm asking you to regurgitate it.

85
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,658
That way I can get ready
for the election also.

86
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,367
Are you really not afraid of anything?

87
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,997
You and I are now on the same side.

88
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:04,497
Whether we both live or we both die.
It's one of the two.

89
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:07,347
If possible I'd like us
to both live together.

90
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,298
For a long time.

91
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:16,967
Bring me original of the
classified document first.

92
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:20,297
I'll give it up to you then.

93
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:25,068
I'll think about it after
I put on my badge.

94
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,647
If I give it to you before
then, you'll chew me up.

95
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:34,507
Why do I need to fill your stomach?

96
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:39,327
You're filled up to your
throat for eating so much.

97
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,508
Isn't that so?

98
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:54,267
<i>You do only what you're told. I'll
be the one to make the decisions.</i>

99
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,868
<i>Think about it just once.</i>

100
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,867
<i>I have a request.</i>

101
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:05,638
<i>Make sure that the Noodle Master
doesn't do anything else bad.</i>

102
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:24,967
Where is you head?

103
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,798
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,827
Secretary Park, do you have
any desire to study more?

105
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,408
Pardon?

106
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:42,807
Evening college or cyber university.
Places you can study while you work.

107
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:48,228
After the election, I'll make you an aide.
Prepare in advance.

108
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,498
Do you hear what I'm saying?

109
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,908
I heard you.

110
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,277
Boss.

111
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,498
They're ordering us to forget everything.

112
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,857
I've been issued temporary standby.

113
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,888
As soon as the new prosecutor
is assigned, I'll be let go.

114
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:32,508
This is how messy things get when a criminal
case gets tangled in political matters.

115
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,597
I'm sorry, it's all because of me.

116
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:38,928
Yes. It's all because of you.

117
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:43,087
I worked my butt off to
get to this position.

118
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:46,008
All because of you, I'm gone in a blow.

119
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:50,558
So, destroy the Noodle Master.

120
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:52,958
Pardon?

121
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:57,067
When you're feeling out the
card is at it's most dangerous.

122
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,638
Do you watch soccer?

123
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:06,067
To not get ejected from the game, the player
begs before the umpire pulls out the card.

124
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,807
But as soon as he gets a red card, he
leaves the field foaming at the mouth.

125
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:11,467
Why?!

126
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:14,008
What's there to fear when
you're ejected from the game?

127
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:16,368
That's how I'm right now.

128
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:19,277
Take care of it quickly!

129
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,338
You have until the new Special
Investigative Team lead prosecutor comes.

130
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,948
Thank you.

131
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:32,947
I'm closer to corruption than justice.

132
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:37,117
Personal vendetta is more important
to me than public order.

133
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,848
No need to thank me.

134
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,108
Then, why exactly...

135
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,497
Try having your face shoved
into a bowl of mixed noodles.

136
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,548
You'll understand my feelings.

137
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:53,368
How does working here feel like?

138
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:09,097
I got fired after being a noodle master
for three years. Why hang it up there?

139
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:13,457
But still, you've brought the
Goong Rak Won thus far...

140
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,767
I don't want to leave any trace
of myself at Goong Rak Won.

141
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,147
Take it down.

142
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,028
Yes.

143
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,477
- Right now.
- Noodle Master.

144
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:24,808
Take it down.

145
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,977
I... I'll do it.

146
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:35,288
I... I'm taller than him.

147
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,438
Your name?

148
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,637
Gil Yong, right?

149
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,098
Yes, dishwasher Go Gil Yong.

150
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:56,517
Take it down and take it
to my living quarters.

151
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:58,208
Yes, I understand.

152
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,837
I can't really live.

153
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:38,408
I thought it would hang for at least 30
years. Why is he taking it down already?

154
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:43,168
You surprised me!

155
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,457
What is this?

156
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,808
It's nothing, so leave it.

157
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,727
Who did you receive it from?

158
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:58,188
You don't have to know. Give it to me.

159
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,528
Yeo Gyeong, right?

160
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:03,688
Yes.

161
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:10,048
I'll keep it. It can't
be left alone like this.

162
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,997
I didn't just leave it.

163
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:17,587
I pulled my hair out to find the
safest place in Goong Rak Won.

164
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,717
And I promised Yeo Gyeong

165
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,137
that I'll protect it, no matter what.

166
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,428
I can keep it better.

167
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,857
Why would I believe you?

168
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:29,678
You're on the side of Noodle Master.
What if you take it to him?

169
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,038
Go Gil Yong.

170
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:38,427
I don't know what this is and I
don't even want to know about it,

171
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,807
but this is really important to Yeo Gyeong.

172
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:44,647
I know I must protect it no matter what.

173
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,698
- So you back off. -Listen
carefully, Go Gil Yong.

174
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:51,387
It's dangerous for the person who has it.

175
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,347
The person who has it may even die.

176
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:56,347
No! The person will die.

177
00:14:56,348 --> 00:15:00,178
If you have it, then you will die. If
Yeo Gyeong has it, then she will die.

178
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,228
But what if you have it?

179
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,008
Prosecutor Chae.

180
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,998
Of course, I kept it safely.

181
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:25,317
Right now?

182
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,978
Okay.

183
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,477
Yeo Gyeong wants everyone to get together.

184
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,038
Everything.

185
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,617
<i>Assemblyman Choi committed suicitde?</i>

186
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:49,337
<i>That can't never happen. A
cockroach never kills itself.</i>

187
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:52,538
<i>Kim Gil Do is involved in this for sure.</i>

188
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:56,768
<i>No, perhaps So Tae Seop and Kim Gil Do?</i>

189
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:18,397
Kim Gil Do is the one who ordered
Tae Ha's father to commit murder.

190
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:21,567
I can threaten Kim Gil Do with
that classified document.

191
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:25,247
If it gets to Assemblyman So Tae
Seop, I no longer need Kim Gil Do.

192
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:28,817
Instead, we lose a way to cut
off Assemblyman So Tae Seop.

193
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:32,578
If Assemblyman So Tae Seop obtains the classified document,
he'll try to get rid of the evidence first and foremost.

194
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,318
You're included in that, Yeo Gyeong.

195
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:41,768
I... Thankfully, I'm still a prosecutor.

196
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,907
He can't mess with me rashly.
I'll try to negotiate.

197
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,447
It's dangerous, Yeo Gyeong.

198
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:48,107
Let's summarize.

199
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,387
We'll finish making a deal with
Assemblyman So before Myeong's program.

200
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:54,037
Then we arrest him right
away after the program.

201
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:57,808
And make him die of old
age sitting in jail.

202
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,387
OK, let's do that then.

203
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:05,938
We all fought the same enemy separately.

204
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,707
Out of care for each other and to
prevent each other from worrying...

205
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,167
We fought on the inside
and outside separately.

206
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,958
Let's not do that anymore.

207
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,438
Do you want to eat noodles?

208
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,877
This is too much.

209
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:52,978
They're treating you like
an old man in the corner.

210
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,598
What's the matter?

211
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,788
Since you have your nomination,
you should really get started.

212
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:12,417
My office and campaign staff...
you take care of it all.

213
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,107
That's not even an issue.

214
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,738
Why don't we do a live show?

215
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:23,307
It's unfortunate to waste the last broadcasting
opportunity right before your election.

216
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:27,568
Gather a panel of judges and
have viewer participation.

217
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:33,177
I think we can make a big deal if
we do our first live cooking show.

218
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,387
I quit being the Noodle Master.

219
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,708
It seems too transparent.

220
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:42,097
Do you want to know how to
become a good politician?

221
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,518
You have to be a good pretender.

222
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:48,977
Pretend to be just, on
the side of the weak...

223
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,748
Pretend to be genuine...

224
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:57,218
You're a born poser, so I'll
just provide the forum.

225
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,588
Play a bit and don't miss
out on a good opportunity.

226
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,638
Proceed with it.

227
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,367
He took the bait.

228
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,387
The live show will happen.

229
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,948
Yes. Good work.

230
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,278
<i>Assemblyman So Tae Seop</i>

231
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:58,248
Prosecutor Chae, what
brings you to call me?

232
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,488
You want to meet me?

233
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,728
Is there a reason for us to meet?

234
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,477
There are misunderstandings we need to hash
out and I also want to show you something.

235
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:12,957
<i>You still have something to interest me?</i>

236
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:18,178
K120-17. How about it?

237
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:24,617
You said you couldn't find it.

238
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:29,547
Why is it in your hands?
Did you deceive me?

239
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:33,327
Isn't it important that I have it now?

240
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:36,848
See me. Come to my office.

241
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,577
Long time no see.

242
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:10,058
Long time no see indeed, but

243
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,988
I must be the only one
happy to see you all.

244
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:26,078
Why did you call the meeting?

245
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:30,967
As you know, I'll be entering an election.

246
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:35,657
I'll start getting busy and I won't be
able to pay attention to Goong Rak Won.

247
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:42,467
I thought it would be better if I passed on my shares.
That's why I called for this difficult meeting.

248
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,577
Just keep it. Why are you causing trouble?

249
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,567
He wants to erase everything that's connected to
Goong Rak Won only until the election is over.

250
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:55,367
Erase? Goong Rak Won is where my roots are.

251
00:21:55,368 --> 00:22:00,217
We'll see about that. We should see what happens to Goong
Rak Won after you let go of your rights in Goong Rak Won.

252
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,287
Don't be afraid. I won't eat you up.

253
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,437
He's exercising his rights.
We can't stop him.

254
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:10,698
Let's hear who you'll
transfer your shares to.

255
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:16,888
Madam Seol, please lead Goong
Rak Won in the right direction.

256
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:22,927
How unexpected.

257
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:25,347
But why all of a sudden to me...

258
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:30,307
Who else can I trust besides
you among people present here?

259
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:35,877
You have 40% shares. So, if the Prime
Noodle Chef wavers, please keep him steady.

260
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:38,278
Until I come back.

261
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:43,307
Why wait? I'll tell you my opinion now.

262
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:48,278
I cannot accept you as the
Noodle Master successor.

263
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:53,568
There's a rumor that you have a
problem with your sense of taste.

264
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,707
Nonsense! Don't even say what's not true.

265
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:08,157
If he can't taste, how could he make the palace
pheasant buckwheat noodles exactly the same way?

266
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:12,647
There's no need to get upset. He just
has to prove that there's no problem.

267
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:16,117
I heard the upcoming show is a live one?

268
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:17,038
That's right.

269
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,237
Let's make the palace pheasant
buckwheat noodles on the show.

270
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:27,307
Without any editing or fooling the eyes, prove
your skills. Then, I'll believe you as well.

271
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:29,317
Fine.

272
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:34,587
But if I prove myself, please agree
on my becoming the Noodle Master.

273
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:36,588
Of course.

274
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,167
<i>And the original?</i>

275
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:54,318
<i>I'll give you the original as soon
as the nomination is completed.</i>

276
00:23:55,258 --> 00:24:01,008
Look at these guys. They're
trying to play me.

277
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:06,518
Come in.

278
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:18,497
Aren't you the Noodle Master's bastard?

279
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,707
I'm Secretary Park Tae Ha.

280
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,348
So, what brings you here?

281
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:31,038
What is it?

282
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:42,498
It's the classified document you're
looking for. Is this the one?

283
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:52,338
It's the original. Why did you bring
it to me instead of the Noodle Master?

284
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:57,308
What the hell are you doing, you a**hole!

285
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,847
The Noodle Master didn't send me here.

286
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:03,707
It's in my hands and it will
stay with me from now on.

287
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:09,187
Don't even try to take it away from me.
If you try, I'll reveal it to the media.

288
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:13,697
You're asking me to kill you.
You know that?

289
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,407
I don't know about politics.

290
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:19,407
So, threats and conciliation
won't work on me.

291
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:23,748
I'll say what I have to say before I go.
You be the judge.

292
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:26,107
Let me hear you.

293
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,837
Do whatever Prosecutor
Chae wants you to do.

294
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:33,547
If you do that, this classified
document will be yours.

295
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,857
What's your relationship
with Prosecutor Chae?

296
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:38,467
I can't answer any of your questions.

297
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:40,787
Just keep your end of the bargain
about what I've requested of you.

298
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:45,058
Then, I'll wrap up the deal cleanly.

299
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:51,367
Such a young kid wants
to make a deal with me?

300
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:59,368
The deal works... if what I have can
either kill you or keep you alive.

301
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:03,027
Do you need anything else?

302
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,248
Right, that's right. But...

303
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:13,597
only death awaits you. This isn't a
deal, but an act of desperation.

304
00:26:13,598 --> 00:26:19,657
Asyou die, you'll remember my words.

305
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:25,828
There will be someone I'll remember
when I die. But it won't be you.

306
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:14,918
Never mind.

307
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:20,138
Would you lie over something if
you'll get caught right away?

308
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:24,028
What is it you want?

309
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:31,087
I have a witness I can
nail Kim Gil Do with.

310
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:35,498
In order for that witness to testify,
I need your help, Assemblyman.

311
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:43,287
Are you listening to me?

312
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,727
You guys are clueless as to what kind of
world you're living in. Completely clueless.

313
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:49,357
But do you know what's so funny?

314
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:52,778
I'm afraid of you guys who are
so clueless about the world.

315
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:56,527
Did you say, "you guys?"

316
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:59,348
Catch Kim Gil Do.

317
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,908
This is your last chance.

318
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:06,658
Go ahead.

319
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,748
Alright then.

320
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:50,137
What happened? How about Yeo Gyeong?
Did you cause trouble?

321
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:53,317
I took care of it. Nothing
will happen to Yeo Gyeong.

322
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:57,007
Are you sure? I can trust you, right?

323
00:28:57,008 --> 00:29:01,797
Trust me. You just have to keep
it a secret from Yeo Gyeong.

324
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:03,228
Okay.

325
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:26,408
What are you doing here?

326
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:32,098
Do you have time right now?

327
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:36,637
Well? I'm off work and...

328
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:39,118
I'll wait for you in the parking lot.

329
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,707
Look! I said "Well?" Don't you get that?

330
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:48,438
It means it's closer to a "No!"

331
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:24,638
<i>All you will experience is death</i>

332
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:29,678
<i>As you die you will remember what I said.</i>

333
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:41,587
Please get in.

334
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,728
Do I pay your salary?

335
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:50,167
Forget it but

336
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:52,147
Why are you here?

337
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:53,988
It's up to the driver.

338
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,208
Are you not eating?

339
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,148
I'll believe that you've
never dated anyone.

340
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:34,157
What do dumplings have
anything to do with dating?

341
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,308
Let's not even talk about it.

342
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:45,638
It does taste good.

343
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,538
Recently,

344
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,518
I ate dumplings with the Noodle Master.

345
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:59,138
That was the day I saw you at the ossuary.

346
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:02,277
I realized then

347
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,787
that you are his daughter.

348
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,918
Let's not talk about this.

349
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:13,618
My father is a murderer.

350
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,507
He killed 2 people.

351
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:22,598
And he was executed.

352
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:28,488
I wanted to run away from

353
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:32,978
the dirty blood of a
murderer's son and so I ran.

354
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,988
So, this is where I arrived.

355
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,808
I don't want to run away anymore.

356
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,338
You shouldn't run away either.

357
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:52,528
Regardless of what kind of person
you father is or his actions.

358
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,378
It's not your fault.

359
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,588
Just endure it from your position.

360
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:05,958
I wanted to tell you this.

361
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:13,578
But what if I run away?

362
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,638
You hold on to me.

363
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:44,208
I've already marked you.

364
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,498
Do you know what you smell like?

365
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:57,658
Sweat, the scent of automobiles and

366
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,068
the scent of dumplings.

367
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:04,777
I'm sorry.

368
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:09,638
But do you know what all the
scents combined result?

369
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:13,378
Your scent.

370
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:56,538
You've never dated anyone.

371
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,408
That's true.

372
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,198
I've been kissed twice.

373
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:09,627
You may not remember since you were drunk.

374
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:12,438
You were the first.

375
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,938
Goodnight.

376
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:50,548
There won't be too many people.

377
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:00,147
- Please edit it.
- Edit?

378
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:01,968
This is, you know...

379
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,838
Dae Ha.

380
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:11,267
That outfit looks good on you.

381
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:12,747
Thank you.

382
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:14,838
But what brings you here?

383
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,627
How do you feel?

384
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,098
Your senses?

385
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,508
Nothing yet.

386
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,887
But it's getting better slowly.

387
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:30,367
I can help you during the live show.

388
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,757
Salty, spicy, and sour.
I can give you signals.

389
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,727
I can signal to you with my fingers
like 1 finger equals one spoon.

390
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,298
Something like this.

391
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:41,047
You don't need to do that.

392
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:43,287
I can do it by myself.

393
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:44,507
But

394
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,937
Thank you for your concern.

395
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,858
But today I can't receive
anyone's assistance.

396
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,168
I must endure whatever happens.

397
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:11,117
The make-up artist didn't show up?

398
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:14,228
I'm stuck in a corner so
they couldn't find me.

399
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,678
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

400
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,357
Is it possible that you're feeling nervous?

401
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:29,377
You've been on the show a dozen times.

402
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,638
This is the first time on a live show.

403
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:34,217
Just be comfortable.

404
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:40,247
You can look at your past as a noodle
maker and talk about your future plans.

405
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:42,357
You can't lose that opportunity.

406
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,348
That's why I'm doing this show.
I won't lose my opportunity.

407
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:58,917
<i>Do whatever Prosecutor
Chae wants you to do.</i>

408
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:03,018
<i>If you do that, this classified
document will be yours.</i>

409
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,768
Assemblyman, it's me.

410
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,598
This person. Am I the only busy one?

411
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:24,398
I have a request that's why I'm calling.
Can you help me out?

412
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:30,227
I'll consider that I owe you a big debt.

413
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:32,748
You need to hear me out.

414
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,827
At this point you need to
recognize this person's ability.

415
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:43,508
When you grill someone you
get something like this.

416
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:48,518
Warrant for urgent arrest and order to
drop the case against Hwang Seong Rok.

417
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:51,767
This was decided by the
Secretary General at the least.

418
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:54,788
So Tae Seop will have to acknowledge this.

419
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:59,197
This is the last. Both for
myself and the Noodle Master.

420
00:38:59,198 --> 00:39:00,777
Detective Kim, let's go.

421
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,358
Yes, Prosecutor.

422
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,488
Should I go with you?

423
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,247
Did you see the Cue Sheet?

424
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:33,327
After about 20 minutes of talking,
we'll get into the noodle competition.

425
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:36,417
During the 20 minutes 3 different noodles.

426
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,607
The dough is done, right?

427
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:40,738
I've finished the aging process as well.

428
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:44,037
Good.

429
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:45,818
Let's do our best.

430
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:51,398
Have an audience member with
a red shirt ask a question.

431
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:58,368
There won't be any problems, right?

432
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,138
Promise me.

433
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:04,688
What?

434
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:10,298
That you won't run away.

435
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,628
I'll keep the promise.

436
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,248
Alright, we'll start.

437
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:25,878
Cue!

438
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:29,867
They must've started, right?

439
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:33,497
Just now. It'll take about
10 minutes to get there.

440
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:35,368
Step on it.

441
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:44,907
Noodle Master's, "Steal, change..."

442
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:49,327
"and imitate." It's become a trademark.

443
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:52,707
I had no idea you had such a story.

444
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:57,837
Now, why don't we take a
question from the audience?

445
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,547
What you'd like to find out from the
masters of traditional noodles...

446
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:05,468
I'm very curious myself. Now...

447
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:15,278
Yes, the audience member wearing
the red top on the left side.

448
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:33,437
- No...
- Can you give him the microphone?

449
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:34,978
Don't.

450
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:40,497
Question please.

451
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:44,938
I have a question for
Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae.

452
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:51,968
Yes, I'm listening.

453
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:57,038
How does it feel to kill a human being?

454
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:08,777
Hey, take away the mic!

455
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:11,678
You killed people.

456
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:14,707
You even ordered murder.

457
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:18,958
I want to hear how you felt at the time.

458
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,888
What's he saying? Kill someone?

459
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:51,358
I need guys to order a job.

460
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:56,137
Not thugs. Right.

461
00:43:56,138 --> 00:44:00,008
Find a few people who can take
care of business cleanly.

462
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:06,917
<i>Genetics Test Center: This is evidence that proves client 1 (Ha
Jung Tae) & client 2 (Kim Da Hae) are biologically related.</i>

463
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:08,657
Ha Jung Tae...

464
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:11,427
<i>Yes, there was a small
commotion for a moment there.</i>

465
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:14,837
You have too many enemies.

466
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:17,137
How could we work like that?

467
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:20,827
Why don't we change the mood at this point?

468
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:26,988
Chef Moo Myeong... why don't we hear about
the time you first learned to make noodles?

469
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,287
I learned how to make
noodles from my father.

470
00:44:31,288 --> 00:44:35,077
He devoted his entire
life to making noodles.

471
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:39,237
He perfected the palace pheasant buckwheat
noodles with his blood and sweat.

472
00:44:39,238 --> 00:44:44,038
But his trusted friend stole
it from him and killed him.

473
00:44:47,538 --> 00:44:49,447
W... wait...

474
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:55,818
The person who perfected the palace pheasant buckwheat
noodles for the first time... is Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae.

475
00:44:57,348 --> 00:44:59,358
Is that so?

476
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:06,637
Why don't you stop? This
won't change anything.

477
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:09,597
No, it will change.

478
00:45:09,598 --> 00:45:16,097
At the least, the world will know
whether you're a man or animal.

479
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:21,277
Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae murdered
Noodle Chef Moo Myeong's father and...

480
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:24,507
stole the recipe to the palace
pheasant buckwheat noodles?

481
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:27,338
He also killed my mother.

482
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:32,698
And he even stole my father's name.

483
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:38,218
The name he's using, Ha Jung
Tae, belongs to my father.

484
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:03,737
Don't run away.

485
00:46:03,738 --> 00:46:08,348
If you run away now, you'll have to
run away for the rest of your life.

486
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:20,778
Kim Gil Do... <i>Looking for a robbery
murder suspect in Seongbukdong.</i>

487
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:24,018
Is that animal's real name.

488
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:31,538
What's going on here?

489
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:36,417
Gangnam San 323-37.

490
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,337
The current Noodle Master's office
is where Kim Gil Do was born.

491
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:45,107
Gangwondo Bongpyeong Yupori 802-2.

492
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:50,257
It's my birthplace and also the spot
where Kim Gil Do killed my father...

493
00:46:50,258 --> 00:46:52,227
Noodle Master... Noodle Master!

494
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:56,027
And my mother. As if that wasn't enough...

495
00:46:56,028 --> 00:47:01,468
he stole my father's name and
his life entirely there.

496
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:16,707
<i>What went wrong?</i>

497
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:21,198
<i>Where... did it go wrong?</i>

498
00:47:39,848 --> 00:47:41,848
<i>Why is he doing that to me?</i>

499
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:47,447
<i>All I did was struggle to survive.</i>

500
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,388
<i>Why exactly?</i>

501
00:48:05,188 --> 00:48:08,358
<i>Warrant for exigent arrest</i>

502
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:32,448
<i>Choi Soon Seok... Choi Soon Seok!</i>

503
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:34,077
<i>Choi Soon Seok!</i>

504
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,928
Choi Soon Seok!

505
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,368
You guys...

506
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:43,218
Stay calm.

507
00:48:45,168 --> 00:48:48,107
If I were you, I'd enjoy the
scenery rather than doing that.

508
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:53,238
When we arrive, you'll never
see the outside world again.

509
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:08,937
There's something I'm curious
about, Prosecutor Chae.

510
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:11,818
I'll accept questions at
the Prosecutors' Office.

511
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:19,087
You know how you bind people
when you arrest them?

512
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:20,587
Shut up, Kim Gil Do.

513
00:49:20,588 --> 00:49:22,698
But why...

514
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:28,888
do you leave the head to move freely?

515
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:33,808
No...

516
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:42,907
<i>This after, breaking the Foreign
Exchange Law and tax laws...</i>

517
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:45,997
<i>murders, ordering murders, and numerous
other charges have been pressed</i>

518
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:52,067
<i>against Ha Jung Tae of Goong Rak Won. While he was being
transported to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, he escaped.</i>

519
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:56,497
<i>At the live show taping of Goong Rak
Won at 4 p.m., he was arrested.</i>

520
00:50:56,498 --> 00:50:58,677
How is Yeo Gyeong?

521
00:50:58,678 --> 00:51:00,668
Her injury isn't bad.

522
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:05,908
What will do you now?

523
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:10,997
He'll come to me. I'll have to see the end.

524
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:13,367
You got what you wanted.

525
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:19,868
You revealed his true face and he's completely
finished. There's no need for you to fight him again.

526
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,188
Tae Ha... I want to see it.

527
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:29,788
Kim Gil Do's facial expression
knowing he lost everything.

528
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:33,868
I'll see his fall clearly.

529
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,778
That's the end of my revenge.

530
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,088
Do what you have to do.

531
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:49,598
I'll do what I have to do.

532
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:55,738
And Yeo Gyeong... protect her from now on.

533
00:51:57,718 --> 00:51:59,947
What... do you mean?

534
00:51:59,948 --> 00:52:06,538
I'm putting her on you now. I've
repaid all the debt I owe her.

535
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,088
<i>Da Hae</i>

536
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:32,588
<i>Blocked Number</i>

537
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:40,797
<i>Bring me the classified document.</i>

538
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:45,738
<i>Then I'll let Da Hae live.
You must come alone.</i>

539
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:54,407
Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae?

540
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:59,247
No, I should call you Kim Gil Do now.

541
00:53:59,248 --> 00:54:00,967
Where are you hiding?

542
00:54:00,968 --> 00:54:05,827
Let's make a deal. I'll give you the
classified document right away.

543
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:09,357
<i>Please clean up this situation.</i>

544
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,458
Where is the classified document? How
can you give me what you don't have?

545
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:17,677
Did you know?

546
00:54:17,678 --> 00:54:21,068
<i>The whole world knows. You're
the only one who doesn't know.</i>

547
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:26,957
There must be another way.

548
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,877
There has to be a way to
turn everything back.

549
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:34,117
Listen carefully. I'll let you know
how to resolve this situation.

550
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:39,417
Your daughter Da Hae...
I have her right now.

551
00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:44,097
Don't lie. I just talked to her.

552
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:50,048
<i>Really? She's gagged. What a talent.</i>

553
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:04,757
Let Da Hae go. She has
nothing to do with this.

554
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:07,017
<i>She's your daughter. How could she
have nothing to do with this?</i>

555
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,657
Let her go!

556
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:12,717
We're exchanging your daughter
for your life. It's simple.

557
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:18,288
There's a storage space in Incheon. I'll
give you the address. Hurry up and go there.

558
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:25,288
You die and let your daughter live.
Isn't that a fair trade?

559
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:41,348
This is very fun. Whether the father will
come to save her or Secretary Park...

560
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:26,067
Look at this guy. He's got guts.
Bring me the classified document.

561
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:28,458
I don't have it with me right now.

562
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:32,887
I'll check Da Hae's safety and
will let you know where it is.

563
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:34,697
How can I trust you?

564
00:56:34,698 --> 00:56:36,678
I came here alone.

565
00:56:38,018 --> 00:56:40,158
Must I prove more?

566
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:14,467
<i>Hello?</i>

567
00:57:14,468 --> 00:57:16,067
Are you okay?

568
00:57:16,068 --> 00:57:17,958
Tae Ha?

569
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:21,997
Where are you right now?

570
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:25,917
You're okay, right, Tae Ha?
You're okay, right?

571
00:57:25,918 --> 00:57:30,877
It's nothing. You'll be fine.

572
00:57:30,878 --> 00:57:32,878
Everything will be fine.

573
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:39,977
- Da Hae.
- Speak. I'm listening.

574
00:57:39,978 --> 00:57:43,968
Next time, let's go somewhere
nice and eat something delicious.

575
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:48,968
I've been feeling bad about that.

576
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:56,967
Why do you say such a thing
all of a sudden? I had fun.

577
00:57:56,968 --> 00:57:59,898
So, don't say strange things.

578
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:03,618
I have a request.

579
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:10,368
My scent... please remember it.

580
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:30,338
Listen to me carefully.

581
00:58:31,898 --> 00:58:37,038
I don't know what you're about to do.
But don't do it.

582
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:41,557
<i>No, never.</i>

583
00:58:41,558 --> 00:58:46,878
If you hang up my phone right now,
I'll hate you for the rest of my life.

584
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:52,848
Are you listening? I said I'll
hate you for the rest of my life!

585
00:59:14,828 --> 00:59:18,387
<i>Tae Ha, what have you been up to all day?</i>

586
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,487
Go to Da Hae. Right now.

587
00:59:21,488 --> 00:59:25,507
<i>What's going on? Did
something happen to Da Hae?</i>

588
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,087
Go and protect her.

589
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:30,278
<i>Tae Ha! Tae Ha!</i>

590
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,428
End it here.

591
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:05,338
<i>Master: God of Noodles</i>

592
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:29,277
<i>To destroy Kim Gil Do, my friend died.</i>

593
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,587
<i>Don't drag in innocent
people into your revenge.</i>

594
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:37,807
<i>My friends came into
this hell because of me.</i>

595
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:40,247
<i>You have two choices.</i>

596
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:42,437
<i>How about dismissal?</i>

597
01:02:42,438 --> 01:02:46,028
<i>Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong wants
to meet you, Assemblyman.</i>

598
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:50,297
<i>Kim Gil Do will show up for sure.</i>

599
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:54,668
<i>Whoever dies, we'll have
