1
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,425
<i>...and the "Beast of the Middle East":
"the Ayatollah"</i>

2
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,350
<i>And the Ayatollah will not let go...</i>

3
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,235
<i>...he's punishing away. Oh my goodness!
How much can this man take...?</i>

4
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:10,585
<i>Will he defeat him or a draw</i>

5
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,549
<i>the horns are out... Here it comes...</i>

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,339
<i>Ram Jam! He's done it!
One! Two! Three! It's over!</i>

7
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,773
<i>This is one for the ages: April 6, 1989.</i>

8
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:30,422
<i>This event will go down
in professional wrestling history...</i>

9
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,635
Great show, "Ram".
Really put them over.

10
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,084
Here you go.

11
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,864
Sorry, I was sure
the gate’d be bigger.

12
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,683
But don't forget: two months,
Raw Way, legends signing.

13
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,221
I need you, man.

14
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,471
Yo, "Ram".

15
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,529
- Think you could,... sign this for me?
- Sure.

16
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,947
My first match ever was you versus
Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.

17
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,010
- Oh yeah.
- 1985.

18
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:45,643
- That was good.
- Yes

19
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:47,913
You were awesome.

20
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,457
- Appreciate it, man.
- Thanks, man.

21
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,390
Oh, shit.

22
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:23,550
Lenny.

23
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:29,996
Lenny.

24
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,505
Come on, Lenny.

25
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,049
Open up.

26
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:40,799
Goddamn, Lenny.

27
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:24,991
Ram.

28
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,929
Ram.

29
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:28,837
Ram.

30
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,810
Ram, wake up.

31
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:34,926
Wake up.

32
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,707
Who woke me up?

33
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:55,496
Come on, man.

34
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,369
I'll see you maniacs
in a little while.

35
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,378
Alright. I'll be back.
I'll be back.

36
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:04,777
I ain't going anyplace.

37
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,832
- Lenny.
- Yes?

38
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,709
Lenny, why are you doing this to me?

39
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,040
You’ll get in when I get my money.

40
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:14,570
Oh, c'mon, Lenny, you know
I’m always good for it.

41
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:17,824
Yes, you're always good for it,
that is why this happens.

42
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,730
Come on, brother, my back went out.
Just let me at least get my icepack.

43
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,699
- I cannot help you.
- Oh come on, man!

44
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:26,044
Oh, God.

45
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,339
Hey, Wayne, you got a second?

46
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,161
Not really, why?

47
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,613
I was wondering if you could throw me
some more hours.

48
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,639
What's the matter?
Did they raise the price of tights?

49
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
Funny.

50
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,935
Let's see what we've got.

51
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,000
Weekdays, I'm busy
on the weekends.

52
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,993
- Hi, boys!
- Hey, what's up?

53
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,870
- Well you're good looking, you diesel man.
- How are you?

54
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,292
Go to change.

55
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:03,068
Hi guys, listen up!
Where is OG?

56
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,280
- You are first against TDS.
- Thank you.

57
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:09,091
Second we've got Harvey Concordbey
vs. Billy the Kid and Lex Lethal.

58
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,058
Third, Sadie versus Daddy More.

59
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,478
Fourth, in Judas the Traitor
versus Rod Beckos.

60
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,417
Intermission.

61
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,513
Fifth, Kevin Mathews
versus Inferno.

62
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:22,054
Sixth, we have Suga and DJ Hyde
versus the Funky Samoans

63
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:26,049
Seven, Paul Enormous and Andy Anderson
versus Jim Powers and Papa Don.

64
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:30,741
And last but not least, for the strap,
we got Tommy Rotten versus Randy The Ram.

65
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,859
- All you guys got it?
- Yep. Got it.

66
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,220
Alright, let's do this.
Have a good time.

67
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,313
- Hey, Ram.
- Hey there.

68
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,158
- How're you doing, man?
- Hey.

69
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:58,521
I'm Tommy, we're gonna be working tonight.

70
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,668
I know you're Tommy, I saw you at
Pennsylvania a couple of months ago.

71
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:04,666
- Allentown.
- It was really good, you really brought it.

72
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,059
Thank you.

73
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,595
Keep working, man, you know.
People who drive the Cadillacs,

74
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,932
want you to politics, they run the show,
they're about abilities. You just hang in there.

75
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,721
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Right?

76
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,447
But as far as tonight, I dunno
what you wanna do.

77
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,202
It had a few ideas.
I was thinking, you know,...

78
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:24,077
maybe just for the heat, I'll give you
a low blow, followed up by a bulldog.

79
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,138
Just bring the cheap heap, bro...

80
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,916
You guys can heat on us right away.

81
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:31,435
Keep the heat on us, beat the shit
out of us. Bum, bum, bum, bum.

82
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,313
We'll come up, we get on the ropes.

83
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,438
- You guys bring us both in the hard way.
- OK.

84
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,770
Then we got up, double-drop you,
quick patter out again.

85
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:39,840
So we're gonna really milk it tonight.

86
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,282
- We're gonna milk it, nice and
slow, old-school, easy. - Awesome.

87
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,943
Don't work his leg, man. That's,...
Everybody does that.

88
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:48,423
- Work his neck. Work his neck.
- Yo, yo, we will be working the neck.

89
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,148
- You will?
- Good. Oh, you work your leg?

90
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,725
Maybe you can make your
come-back right off there.

91
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,087
A splay off the ropes, then
super-kick...

92
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,697
and ram-jam
and we go and have a beer.

93
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,338
It sounds good, doesn't it?

94
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:03,369
You hang in there; you got a lot of ability.

95
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,701
- Alright.
- OK?

96
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,397
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

97
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,421
And now for you, Randy "The Ram"

98
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,546
Come on.

99
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,219
Randy "The Ram"!

100
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,108
Be friends, alright?

101
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,862
Want to stop?

102
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:45,941
Do you want me to stop it?

103
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,366
Are you sure?

104
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,017
Come on!

105
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,750
Ram!

106
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,418
Ram!

107
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:24,687
Ram!

108
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,430
Use the post.

109
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,641
Use the post.

110
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,583
Use the post.

111
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:54,908
Come on, you fat piece of crap!

112
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,905
Get off to the rest of your likes...

113
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,908
And I'll beat the hell out of
each and every one of you...

114
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,701
You don't wanna see what it means?

115
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,412
I will destroy you too!

116
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,400
Shut the hell up!

117
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,008
Get up, old man.

118
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:20,217
Ram! Ram!

119
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:23,002
Ram!

120
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,564
Ram!

121
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,293
Ram!

122
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,172
Ram!

123
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,715
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

124
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,832
Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

125
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,047
One, two, three.

126
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:35,328
Ladies and gentlemen, here is your winner
Randy "The Ram" Robinson.

127
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:47,275
- Randy, you popped that crowd.
- Yeah.

128
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,440
- Let's clean of this stuff, okay?
- Yes.

129
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,897
Hey, Ram. You got a sec?

130
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,250
Right here.

131
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,498
Do you realize what’s coming up?

132
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,530
- Huh?
- On April 6.

133
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,377
The 20th anniversary of you and
Ayatollah at the Garden.

134
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,359
Yeah, well, that was long time ago.

135
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,344
Time fucking flies, right?

136
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,054
Here's what I'm thinking.

137
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,132
Two words:

138
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:15,070
Re Match.

139
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:16,698
Hey, man, you're all set.

140
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:20,045
I’m doing this big Fanfest thing down
in Nevada that weekend.

141
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,071
...and I want to main-event it
with you two guys:

142
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,007
"Ram - Ayatollah, II"

143
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,221
Hey, I heard Bob's doing really good with
his used car line out in Arizona.

144
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,169
- I just don't see how he...?
- For this...?

145
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,653
Bob is going to dust off
the old turban

146
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

147
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,165
Well, let's bring it.

148
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,583
Come on, guys, let's all go
take a shower together.

149
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,458
What's up, Ram?
How are you doing?

150
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,578
- What's up Big Chris? What's shaking?
- I'm alright.

151
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,038
Yo, man, you still have that hook-up
with that crack at your gym?

152
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,701
- What do you need?
- My back is killing me, Vicodin,...

153
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:09,251
whatever he's got.
- Drop by at the mansion...

154
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,524
in a couple of days and I'll hook you up
- You're the man, Ram!

155
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:30,349
- Hello, Ruby, how you doing, baby?
- Hey, Ram, how's it going?

156
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,498
Give me a cold one.

157
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,372
Here you go.

158
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,883
- Cassidy around?
- I think she’s working a VIP.

159
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:17,203
I'm sorry, sweetie, we said
the other girl.

160
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:21,049
Yeah, the blondie with the belly chain.
- Yes, I know, but she's not as great...

161
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,288
I'm sorry, but we really
don't want you.

162
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,589
- How old are you anyway?
- Oh, you're like my mom, dude.

163
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,325
I do things your little fiancée’s
never even dreamed of...

164
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,310
Yes, like graduate in 1985.

165
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,394
Hey, hey, hey, you are being
a little rude to the lady.

166
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,210
- How about an apology, huh?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

167
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,052
You don't talk to a lady like that.

168
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,053
I talk to her like that
when I wanna talk like that.

169
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:45,869
- No, no, It's okay.
- No, don't need to be talked to like that.

170
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,115
It's cool. It's cool.
I got it. I got it.

171
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,478
It's alright, guys...

172
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,815
Let me tell you something.

173
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,692
I guarantee you this lady's
100 times hotter than

174
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,770
any skank ass pussy
you’re gonna be marrying.

175
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,771
- What are you...?
- What the fuck...?

176
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:03,583
Are you kidding me?!

177
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:06,075
- Fucker!
- Easy.

178
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,393
200 fucking bucks just walked out.

179
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,468
Just trying to help.

180
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,164
Shit, they're punks

181
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,039
Easy!

182
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,338
I'm sorry.
I'm better looking than them anyway.

183
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,851
I didn't mean to piss you off...

184
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,939
OK.

185
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:27,483
It's good to see you back.

186
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,420
Good to see you too.

187
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,267
I have not seen in a while.
How have you been?

188
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,202
I'm telling you, it was one
of the historic matches in history.

189
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,169
There's 20,000 people

190
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,589
and another millionand half sitting
at home watching on pay-per-view.

191
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:45,842
We're slamming the piss out of each other,
I mean, for god knows how long...

192
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:50,292
...we're both gashing... You ask any
wrestling fan, they've heard about that one.

193
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,562
- Million and a half?
- Yeah, it was big.

194
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:55,924
In a rematch, it could be
history all over again.

195
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,851
Damn, look at you! You are
really smokin’ baby!

196
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,971
Let me make an honest woman out of you.

197
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,785
Who knows? I'm in pretty good
shape right now.

198
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:11,265
You know, with a little luck,
this could be my ticket back on top.

199
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,324
You never know who’s in that crowd.

200
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,049
That would be a dream.

201
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:20,529
Oh, Jesus, you're bleeding.

202
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:24,137
Yes, I got cut tonight.

203
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:27,739
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

204
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:31,039
- And they say wrestling’s fake, huh?
- Fake? I'll show you fake. Look at this...

205
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,789
1986, Denver Coliseum

206
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:37,090
Billy BobBanjo hit me with a two-by-four.
He had a loose nail

207
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,861
...and it split my biceps.
Cut it the hell open...

208
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,394
It's better with it now.

209
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,421
Look at this one here.

210
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,551
1988 Orlando, Civic Center

211
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:50,858
Mr. Magnificent threw me
over the top ropes,

212
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:53,682
landed on my shoulder,
cracked my clavicle way in half.

213
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,566
Oh, God. Did it hurt?

214
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:59,543
I hurts you when I breathe, but, I mean,
you get the roar of the crowd,...

215
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:02,300
you just, you just,
put it through, you know...

216
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,907
<i>"He was pierced for our transgressions,
He was crushed for our iniquities.</i>

217
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:10,615
<i>The punishment that brought
us peace was upon Him,</i>

218
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:13,225
and by His wounds we were healed. "

219
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:18,194
- What was that one?
- "The Passion of the Christ. "

220
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:21,009
You have the same hair.
You never seen it?

221
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:26,315
Dude, you gotta! It’s amazing.
They throw everything at him:

222
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,918
Whips, arrows, rocks...

223
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,873
Just beat the
living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours.

224
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:32,922
And He just takes it.

225
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,208
Tough dude.

226
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,092
A sacrificial ram.

227
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:45,415
<i>Next on the main stage will be Cassidy.
Harmony on the small stage.</i>

228
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,725
Oh, well, fuck.

229
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:50,872
- Gotta go.
- Where're you going?

230
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,452
- How much do I owe you?
- That's 60.

231
00:22:57,178 --> 00:22:58,606
Keep the change.

232
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,791
Thank you.

233
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,786
<i>On stage, the lovely Cassidy.</i>

234
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:30,267
A bottle Andrilon, 250.
Vali Q, 75 bucks.

235
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,054
Two bottles of Trans, $25 each.

236
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,234
The box 50.
Bio-insulin, 100 bucks.

237
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,567
You've got four boxes of Sustanon,
it's three amps to the box...

238
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,310
30 for a box, 1 buck 20,
Dianabol, 100 bucks.

239
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,251
With this, I've got you a bottle extra,
200 bucks. Altogether 995.

240
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,331
If you've only got 400, give me the 400
then we're good for the rest.

241
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:47,988
Got any GH?

242
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,033
I've got Chinese and I've got Serostim.

243
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:53,179
I don't want any of that Chinese stuff.

244
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,326
My poor Ram,
I'll help you out, alright?

245
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,320
Fuck you.

246
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,894
You've got to take the
bacteriostatic water with it too.

247
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:04,332
Makes your growth last longer.

248
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,314
Anything else?

249
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:09,766
Painkillers, spikes, barbs?

250
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,870
No, I'm tabbed.

251
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:14,949
- Sure?
- Those will dope me.

252
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,106
- Viagra.
- No.

253
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,130
Things to blow?

254
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:19,967
Got it all man, whatever you need.

255
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:21,846
Some kind of pharmacy, brother.

256
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,752
- Well man, I look out for you.
- Yeah, sure.

257
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:27,629
You take your shoots
and you're alright then, right?

258
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:29,961
- I'm just gonna get big and strong.
- Yes, you sure are my friend.

259
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:34,443
- You're looking good, brother.
- I'm trying, baby, I'm trying...

260
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,502
- Show me what you've got.
- Oh, come on, come on...

261
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:38,595
- Show me.
- Come on...

262
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,327
Little something,
there's not much there, baby...

263
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:41,903
Come on, bring it up.
Look at that motherfucker...!

264
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,266
Now, right up there,
stay right up there.

265
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,690
- Do you see it right up there?
- Aha.

266
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:20,460
I don't need these curls on too long,
because last time they broke off

267
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,960
I think they got too fried.

268
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,073
So how's the old man doing these days?

269
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:33,494
- Work, work, work...
- Work, work, work, huh?

270
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,071
We still have a job, right?

271
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:43,068
- Hey, Gloria, how're you doin'?
- Hey babe, how's everything?

272
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:20,461
Here we go.

273
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:21,886
Lay it on, brother. Lay it on.

274
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,458
There you go...

275
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:25,246
You're supposed to fall to your knees.

276
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,724
- So where's the bug spray in here?
- Row 6 at the right side bottom.

277
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:34,147
Right side. Bug spray.

278
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:40,812
Come on, once more.

279
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:43,992
- Give it to me, brother.
- Okay, man.

280
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:46,717
Fuck.

281
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:50,803
- A couple of mouse traps?
- Load them, set them in the ring and body slam them.

282
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,407
Good.

283
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,462
How're you doin', sir?
- How you doing?

284
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,579
Now what do you think?
What do you think about this? Huh?

285
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,560
- That'll work.
- OK.

286
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,527
Come here.

287
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,737
Hey, I don't look good, but I feel good.

288
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:23,643
My knees, my back, anything
you need me to do, sir,

289
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:25,336
just, maybe, keep the running
to a minimum.

290
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:28,058
Like, maybe I could hit the ropes once,
take a bump for you...

291
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,405
But like no criss-crossing, please.

292
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,404
That hardcore stuff is not for me.
Talk to me about what you wanna do tonight.

293
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,704
- Are you cool with staples?
- Staples?

294
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:38,923
- Staple gun.
- What dya mean?

295
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,285
- Like staple gun...
- Staple gun?

296
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,346
- You never did it before?
- No. Does that hurt?

297
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,861
It is a silly question.

298
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,161
Man, they're not so bad going in.
Kinduv scary.

299
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,015
You got a big metal thing up against you...

300
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:55,923
Pull them out, they're gonna leave
a couple of holes, little bit of blood loss there.

301
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,094
- Rock 'n roll!
- Thank you, sir.

302
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:01,545
- Take it easy with the stapler, though.
- No problem, sir.

303
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:27,405
One, two, three.

304
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:38,093
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner:
the one and only Randy "The Ram" Robinson.

305
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,071
Good job.

306
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:19,880
Helluva mess up there, man,
helluva mess.

307
00:29:19,986 --> 00:29:24,065
(?), man... Good work, properly done.
Fucking insane, Ram!

308
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,117
Wow, say Ram, let's get some glue...

309
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,417
Crazy shit, man, crazy...

310
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,282
- You were OK with the table hit?
- I'll live, sir. I'll live.

311
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:04,218
Ant & Roach Killer

312
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,910
Oh, shit.

313
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:10,484
You have a lot of staples, gonna pick them out.

314
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:11,698
Alright, take it easy, doctor.

315
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:13,695
Hold still.

316
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:17,238
Damn.

317
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,892
Time to eat.

318
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:47,977
Aaaah. Goddammit!

319
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,415
Kill him.

320
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,116
Use this leg!

321
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,145
Use this leg!

322
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:40,659
Use this leg!

323
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:54,616
Ram.

324
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:00,095
Fuck you.

325
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:02,336
Fuck you.

326
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:07,817
OK, let me get you this out of you.

327
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,027
Doesn't look very good, man

328
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,307
Almost done.

329
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,747
OK, Ram, you can go and take a shower.

330
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,232
Nice work, man.

331
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:45,411
I think we achieved what we wanted.

332
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:50,901
Relax.
Try to relax.

333
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,294
Molly, get some help in here, please.

334
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,111
Keep your hands down.
Try to relax.

335
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,078
Come on.

336
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,345
Relax.

337
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:07,863
Ok, and again, touch;
there we go.

338
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,282
Thank you, Marilyn. OK.

339
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:41,571
Mr. Ramsemsky.

340
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:46,415
- Call me Randy
- Randy, I'm Dr. Wade Disadale.

341
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,019
So, how is it all looking?

342
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,103
Much better than before the bypass.

343
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:54,463
So, we're in the clear.
We're all good.

344
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:58,340
Well, it's your heart. You need to start
taking better care of it.

345
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:02,731
- How will I do?
- Well, for starters, you're gonna be under a slew of medications...

346
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:07,358
And the stuff that you're putting
in your body, you need to cut it out.

347
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:10,054
I know, I know.

348
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:13,567
I can live without that.

349
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:16,686
When can I get back in the gym and huh...

350
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,440
and start working out?
- As far as the exercise goes...

351
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:24,346
it's still okay, as long
as it is moderate.

352
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:29,650
- Doc, I am a professional wrestler.
- That's not a good idea.

353
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,654
What do you mean?

354
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,250
Your heart has been through a lot and

355
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,949
won't be able to handle this strain of activity.

356
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:44,082
Well, I can slow my routine down.
I can just pace myself.

357
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:46,505
- Mr. Ramsemsky.
- Randy, call me Randy.

358
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:50,418
Randy, you almost died.

359
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:53,542
Next time
you might not be so lucky.

360
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:01,809
Well, hey doc, thanks for all
the good news.

361
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:27,284
This copy is for you.

362
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:33,431
Someone left this here,
said he was your promoter.

363
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:44,867
<i>You earned it, dude! You're a warrior!
rest up, feel better. - Jerry Difusco</i>

364
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:46,207
<i>P.S. If you're up by the 23rd,
I got something in Yonkers</i>

365
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:32,347
Robert Ramsemsky, come to the pharmacy,
your prescription is ready.

366
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,065
- Robert Ramsemsky?
- Randy.

367
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,414
Sign here, please.

368
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:52,743
Thank you.

369
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,711
There you go.

370
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,947
My money.

371
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,843
Welcome home.

372
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,329
Adam.

373
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,933
- Want to play Nintendo?
- Alright.

374
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,538
OK, let's see what you've got there.

375
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,689
Alright, here comes the Ayatollah.

376
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:16,537
Here we go. Come on.

377
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,141
<i>Say, did you hear about
"Call of Duty IV"?</i>

378
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:22,139
<i>- What?
- "Call of Duty IV".</i>

379
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,108
<i>- What?
- "Call of Duty IV".</i>

380
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,616
<i>- "Call it Duty IV"?
- "Call of Duty IV"</i>

381
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:28,349
<i>- "Call of Duty IV"?
- Yes</i>

382
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:31,642
- Very cool actually.
- Really?

383
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,973
This is so old...

384
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:38,304
- And what is about?
- It's a war game.

385
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,514
Most of the other Call of
Duties are like based...

386
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:43,606
on World War II,
but this one is with Iraq.

387
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:46,937
- Yeah?
- You switch off between a Marine,...

388
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:50,935
and an SAS British Special Operatives.
It's pretty cool.

389
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:55,316
Wow! Hold on. Alright, alright,
there we go.

390
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:58,556
Alright, There, there is it: Ram Jam!

391
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,039
- You're finished, OK. One more.
- I gotta go.

392
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,525
- I gotta go.
- I just gave you an ass whipping...

393
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,765
- Don't you wanna get even?
- No, that's OK.

394
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,794
- Really?
- I'll catch you later, right?

395
00:42:09,884 --> 00:42:11,640
Do your push-ups, brother.

396
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:21,427
Hey!

397
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:22,701
Hey.

398
00:43:22,702 --> 00:43:24,197
Ram Man!

399
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,328
Been a while.

400
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:28,092
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood...

401
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,048
I thought that maybe we could go
grab a hamburger.

402
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:36,166
- I'm working.
- OK. Maybe later.

403
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:38,709
Are you okay?

404
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,465
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure, yeah. What's up?

405
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,044
Someplace more quiet.

406
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:50,352
Randy...

407
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:55,015
Randy, I can’t leave with a customer.

408
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:58,364
Listen, I had a heart attack.

409
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:05,753
- Where are you parked?
- Out in the back.

410
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:08,561
Great. Go to your car. I’ll meet you out
there in 15 minutes.

411
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:19,643
You know what? I wanna go on a break.
I need a cigarette, I can't quit.

412
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,075
Thanks. I appreciate it.

413
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:37,589
That's OK.

414
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:39,648
When was it?

415
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:42,464
A couple of weeks ago.

416
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:45,849
How are you feeling?

417
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,695
I don't feel like Hercules.

418
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:51,634
What happened?

419
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:53,572
I was walking in the dresser room

420
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,393
and the guys told me
I just dropped like a brick.

421
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:00,506
I don't remember nothing.

422
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:08,199
And now the doctors tell me
that I can't wrestle no more.

423
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:13,267
What you gonna do?

424
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:17,452
You know, I just don't feel right.

425
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:21,066
And that's why...

426
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:25,674
that's why I wanted to talk to you.
Cos I don't wanna be alone.

427
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:31,821
Oh, Randy.

428
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:37,939
You should be with your family now.

429
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,694
Don't you have a daughter?
Where's your daughter?

430
00:45:43,086 --> 00:45:46,357
- My daughter, she don't like me very much.
- I don't blame her.

431
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,722
Everyone needs a father and, trust me, this
kind of thing brings people together.

432
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:56,993
You should call her.

433
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:02,502
I should go back in.
You gonna be okay huh?

434
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:06,168
- I'll be okay.
- OK

435
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,282
Stephanie.

436
00:47:06,134 --> 00:47:08,199
Hi, we're not in,
leave a message.

437
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,649
Uh, is Stephanie home?

438
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,374
Who can I say it is?

439
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:04,617
Tell her it's her father.

440
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:26,540
Hey, Stephanie, where're you going?

441
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:31,324
- What do you want?
- Well, I just have to talk to you.

442
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:34,050
Can't really talk right now.

443
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,872
- I really need to talk to you.
- I have school.

444
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,931
- You're going to school?
- Yeah.

445
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:40,267
That's great!

446
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,320
Listen, I had a heart attack
and I just thought I needed to tell you.

447
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,138
You're such an asshole.

448
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:58,728
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

449
00:48:59,656 --> 00:49:03,744
I've just been alone and you're my daughter
and I love you. And I just...

450
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:06,501
- ... just needed to see you.
- It's bullshit.

451
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:10,195
- You want me to take care of you.
- No.

452
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:12,957
Yes. Well, I'm not gonna do that.

453
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:17,626
Where the fuck were you when I
I needed you to take care of me?

454
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:22,623
You know, on all my birthdays
which you never been even to one.

455
00:49:23,016 --> 00:49:24,713
You probably don't even know when it is...

456
00:49:27,142 --> 00:49:29,874
So you may want to know: I don't care
if you had a heart attack. Fuck you!

457
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,633
Hi Ram, I didn't think I'd see you here.

458
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:53,304
- Why not?
- Hiya

459
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:56,866
Heard you collapsed
at the DiFusco show.

460
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,955
Ah, man I just overheated
and blacked out, that's all.

461
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:00,480
Really?

462
00:50:00,485 --> 00:50:02,355
I was out of the hospital in less than an hour.

463
00:50:03,017 --> 00:50:05,348
- So you're fine?
- Bruno, I'm good to go!

464
00:50:06,468 --> 00:50:08,949
That's excellent, I was just
gonna cancel the minivan.

465
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:11,674
- What minivan?
- The rented one for FanFest.

466
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:15,430
Me and the whole gang is driving down,
Terry C, Casiano, Fat Bag...

467
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:19,943
I am so fuckin’ psyched.
Volpe gave me an assload of flyers...

468
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:22,795
There...

469
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,345
It's gonna be epic.

470
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:28,609
Volpe said the scout
from the show is gonna be there.

471
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:31,942
- 20 years in the making.
- It's gonna be something.

472
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:33,365
Come on, I've got you settled down here.

473
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:36,545
- Hey bro.
- Hey, what's going on, bro?

474
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:39,966
Ya, you've got a pretty good crowd today.

475
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,434
- Great, I'll loosen up.
- Alright.

476
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:46,976
Hey, my man, how're you doing, big guy?

477
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:48,437
Good to see you.

478
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,216
- I've been a big fan of yours for years.
- How are you doing, brother?

479
00:51:16,582 --> 00:51:17,580
- It's really great to meet you.
- Alright.

480
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,369
- I've got a Polaroid?
- Absolutely.

481
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:22,065
Here it goes.

482
00:51:23,337 --> 00:51:24,609
- What's your name again?
- Evan.

483
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,698
- E-V...?
- E-V-A-N

484
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:30,576
One, two...
Ram!

485
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:37,594
- That's 8. There you go, Matthew.
- OK, here you go.

486
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:24,303
- Hi, I'm Cassidy.
- Henry.

487
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:26,482
Nice to meet you.
Where you from?

488
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:28,907
Hartfield.

489
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:30,936
Yes?
How are you doing tonight?

490
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:32,480
OK.

491
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:35,426
How about a private dance
to make you feel better?

492
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:38,454
- No, not tonight.
- No, Henry?

493
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:40,302
- No.
- No?

494
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:42,211
Okay.

495
00:52:51,953 --> 00:52:53,165
No.

496
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:57,768
<i>On the main stage
The Exotic...</i>

497
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:00,607
Hey.

498
00:53:02,968 --> 00:53:06,020
- Hey, when did you get here?
- I just moved in.

499
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:07,656
You did?

500
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,868
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good.

501
00:53:11,593 --> 00:53:13,230
- I'm better.
- Good.

502
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:16,561
And I took your advice, so I went
and saw my daughter.

503
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,803
Yeah? How did that go?

504
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:23,133
Huh... It didn't go very well...
She sort of... cut me a new asshole.

505
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,042
Oh, sorry to hear that...

506
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,880
Well hey, what're you gonna do?

507
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:33,845
Maybe if we went out,
did something special? Or a present?

508
00:53:34,937 --> 00:53:36,331
That's a really great idea.

509
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,238
What's she into?

510
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:40,752
I don't know really.

511
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,569
- What kind of music does she like?
- I really don't know.

512
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:50,353
Is she into something else like
cooking, or books or something like that?

513
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,137
- I don't know.
- OK... well

514
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:58,864
You should get her clothes,
some kind of clothes...

515
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:00,680
- ... all girls dig that.
- Yeah?

516
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:01,773
Yes

517
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,744
Hey, I know the right place.

518
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:08,316
It's this kickass little
vintage shop in Elizabeth.

519
00:54:09,648 --> 00:54:11,079
I think on Elisabeth Avenue;
you should go on a Saturday,

520
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,760
that's when they get all the best shit.

521
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:15,161
Thanks, thanks a lot.

522
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:19,375
Wanna dance?

523
00:54:22,556 --> 00:54:24,342
I don't think I am quite ready for that yet.

524
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:27,881
Okay.

525
00:54:55,982 --> 00:54:57,194
That was fast.

526
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:00,037
Listen, why don't I meet
you there on Saturday

527
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:03,551
and help you pick something out?

528
00:55:06,255 --> 00:55:07,426
I'd like that a lot.

529
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:09,848
- One?
- Yeah.

530
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,443
Alright.

531
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,783
Alright. One.

532
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:30,225
Hey, hello.

533
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:35,228
Did you forget how to knock? We'll
try that again. Right? I am serious.

534
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,916
- What do you want?
- I was wondering if I could get some...

535
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,581
more work, something huh,...
you know, steady, full time.

536
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:55,954
All I've got is weekends.

537
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:57,863
That works...

538
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:01,045
Isn't that when you sit
on other dudes' faces?

539
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:04,996
- So what've you got?
- Deli counter.

540
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,131
Deli counter...

541
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:09,563
- Dealing with the customers and stuff?
- Yeah.

542
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:13,478
A parade of hot horny housewives
begging for your meat.

543
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,170
You got anything else?
