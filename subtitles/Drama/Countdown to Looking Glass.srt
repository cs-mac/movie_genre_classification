1
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,326
Sir, shoals on every side.

2
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,407
Sand or reef, I cannot say.

3
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,243
Captain, the Malay pirates
have us cornered.

4
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,751
We must surrender.

5
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,998
Surrendering my father's ship

6
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,004
will not guarantee survival,
Mr Phelps.

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,385
Shallow water.

8
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,555
Dead ahead, full sails!

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,311
Captain!
The ship will run aground.

10
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,809
It's impossible!

11
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,937
You know my views
on that word, Mr Phelps.

12
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,241
Full sails. Full sails!

13
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,572
Full sails, boys.

14
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,362
Full sails!

15
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,664
Hard to port, Harper!

16
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,331
Turning to port at full sail
will tip us over.

17
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,172
Exactly!

18
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,548
Lads, get those sails down!

19
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,508
We haven't got all day!

20
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,265
Hold on, everyone!

21
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,939
It's too shallow.

22
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,075
We need full sails!

23
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,204
Will! Hold on, lad!

24
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,371
Help!

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,853
She's going over.

26
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,799
Hold on, boys!

27
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,705
Hold on, lads!

28
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,649
You did it, Captain!

29
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,661
The only way to achieve
the impossible

30
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,583
is to believe it is possible.

31
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,253
Set a course
for London, Harper.

32
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,332
Our work here is done.

33
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,532
Splice the mainbrace, lads!

34
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,836
We're going home!

35
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,931
Captain ashore.

36
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,430
Captain.

37
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,116
- Mother.
- Well...

38
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,654
Here you are.

39
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Finally.

40
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,327
Miss Kingsleigh?

41
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,577
You and the <i>Wonder</i> have been
expected for over a year.

42
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,915
There were complications.

43
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,378
Pirates and such.

44
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,747
The ledgers are in my cabin.

45
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,358
And would you please
let Lord Ascot know

46
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,043
I should like to
see him immediately.

47
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,884
I'm afraid Lord Ascot passed
away whilst you were at sea.

48
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,799
The title's been passed on
to his son.

49
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,921
- Hamish?
- Indeed.

50
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,593
Now chairman of the board.

51
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,388
How unfortunate.

52
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,486
<i>Your letters were
so infrequent.</i>

53
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,993
I hardly know where
you've been all this time.

54
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,820
Mother, China's incredible.

55
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,285
We followed the Yangtze
deep into the interior.

56
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,742
Most of the people
had never seen

57
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,247
a person with
yellow hair before.

58
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,128
- Were you never afraid?
- Of course.

59
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,298
But, when I was,
I thought of Father.

60
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,634
You sound just like him.

61
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,467
I miss him.

62
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,299
I do, too.

63
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,097
But the years
pass quickly for me now.

64
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,142
Time is a cruel master.

65
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,067
Time is a thief.
And a villain.

66
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,688
I hear the Ascots are marking
Hamish's succession tonight.

67
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,866
Perfect.

68
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,277
We should go.

69
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,989
I'm afraid the invitation must
have been lost in the post.

70
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,741
Nonsense. Lady Ascot once said
we would always be welcome.

71
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,309
Besides, I have
a proposition for Hamish.

72
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,372
Hamish married
last year, Alice.

73
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,791
He seems to have got over
your public rejection.

74
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,171
A business proposition,
Mother.

75
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,708
You're leaving again?

76
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,171
So soon?

77
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,678
There are matters here

78
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,326
which might benefit
from your attention.

79
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,049
After my next voyage...

80
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,218
you won't have to
worry about anything.

81
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,804
Am I permitted to
worry about tonight?

82
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,193
I do wish
you'd worn that yellow dress.

83
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,473
If it's good enough for

84
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,203
the Dowager Empress
of China...

85
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,035
then it's good enough
for the Ascots.

86
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,325
Must you always be
so headstrong?

87
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,209
No. It's just
more fun that way.

88
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,076
What is she wearing?

89
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,535
It's the Kingsleigh girl.

90
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,599
Excuse me.

91
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,717
Outrageous.

92
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,095
Circus performer.

93
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,399
Miss Kingsleigh?

94
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,641
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,751
I've come to give
my report to Lord Ascot.

96
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,562
Right.

97
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,071
Well, follow me.

98
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,584
Helen.

99
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,205
What a surprise.

100
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,211
Alice. Well. Welcome home.

101
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,248
We were afraid you might
never come back with our ship.

102
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,758
My ship. Hello, Hamish.

103
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,920
It's proper to refer to
my husband as Lord Ascot.

104
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,930
That is why we're having
this little soirée after all.

105
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,435
Miss Kingsleigh,
this is my wife, Alexandra.

106
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,054
The new Lady Ascot.

107
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,461
Hamish tells me
you've travelled

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,765
the world
these last three years.

109
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,272
Yes. I've just returned.

110
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,197
Well, then how was it?

111
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,449
The world?

112
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Yes.

113
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,490
Highly enjoyable.
You should visit it sometime.

114
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,046
Apologies for
the intrusion, Lord Ascot...

115
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,326
but I've come
to give my report.

116
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,297
Of course.

117
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,755
Follow me, Miss Kingsleigh.

118
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,508
And you, Mr Harcourt.

119
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,217
Gentlemen, might I introduce
Miss Alice Kingsleigh.

120
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,885
Miss Kingsleigh, the board.

121
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,191
Good evening, gentlemen.

122
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,100
The world has opened to us,
but we must move quickly.

123
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,027
It is my belief
that further expeditions

124
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,194
along the Wu River...

125
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,821
I'm sorry, Miss Kingsleigh.

126
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,358
There will be
no further expeditions.

127
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,954
What?

128
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,160
Now, there is a position
in our clerking office.

129
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,453
You will start in files...

130
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,622
but in time...

131
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,415
This isn't about China, is it?

132
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,542
It's because I turned you down

133
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,834
when you asked me
to marry you.

134
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,132
I am sorry, Miss Kingsleigh,

135
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,743
but this is all that
we can do for you.

136
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,306
No other company
is in the business

137
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,133
of hiring female clerks.

138
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,720
Let alone ship's captains.

139
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,188
You can't do this.

140
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,478
I own 10% of the company.

141
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,363
Your father set
those shares aside for me.

142
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,323
Oh, correction.

143
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,238
He gave them to your mother...

144
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,118
who sold them to me
a year ago,

145
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,241
while you were gone.

146
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,076
Along with the bond
on the house.

147
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,831
Her house?

148
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,993
The bond we will redeem
against your ship.

149
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,204
But that was my father's ship.

150
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,842
Indeed.

151
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,376
Sign over the vessel...

152
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,297
and you will redeem the house.

153
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,952
Report to work
Monday morning...

154
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,887
and you will receive a salary
and a pension.

155
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,518
And give up the Wonder?

156
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,014
Otherwise, we cannot help you.

157
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,057
Or your mother.

158
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,373
Alice.

159
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,084
Alice.

160
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,290
Alice!

161
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,901
How could you
sell our shares?

162
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,620
Everything I do
is for you, Alice.

163
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,611
So you can make
a decent start in life.

164
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,959
Five minutes ago
I was a sea captain.

165
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,705
A sea captain is
no job for a lady.

166
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,383
Time is against you, and
you're being careless with it.

167
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,142
I once believed
I could do as many

168
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,891
as six impossible things
before breakfast.

169
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,681
That is
a child's dream, Alice.

170
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,109
The <i>Wonder</i> is just a ship.

171
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,942
It's not just a ship.

172
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,276
It's Father's ship.

173
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,449
Everything he loved.

174
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,201
Everything I love.

175
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,771
He never would have
let this happen.

176
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,116
Well, he's not here any more!

177
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,702
You can't just make things
however you want them to be.

178
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,584
Every woman
must face that, Alice.

179
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,794
I've had to.

180
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,088
Well, the last thing I want
is to end up like you.

181
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,024
Sign over the <i>Wonder?</i>

182
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,648
And give up on the impossible?

183
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,737
Then who will I be?

184
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,573
You're Alice, of course.

185
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,619
Absolem?

186
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,011
Absolem.

187
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,727
She had spent months up river.

188
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,392
Dressed like
she'd gone native.

189
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,090
Of course, it's known
to do strange things

190
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,150
to a man's mind,
let alone a woman's.

191
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,489
- Wait!
<i>- Just like her father.</i>

192
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,450
A great man, no doubt,
but one touched in the head.

193
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,078
<i>It appears the apple has
not fallen far from the tree.</i>

194
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,354
Absolem.

195
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,250
Curious.

196
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,562
It's locked!
Someone's in there.

197
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,068
- Who's in there?
- Who's in there?

198
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,003
You're trespassing!
This room is out of bounds!

199
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,670
Someone get the key!

200
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,215
Lord Ascot, there's someone
in your father's study.

201
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,121
Curiouser and curiouser.

202
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,737
Ooh.

203
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,820
Oh, no, not again!

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,749
All my horses. All my men.
To the rescue.

205
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,989
All the pieces
together first, chaps.

206
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,590
In a pile, over here.

207
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,422
How do I look?
Tell me. I can take it.

208
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,366
He's not all
he's cracked up to be.

209
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,030
He's a mere shell of a man.

210
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,633
Oh, please.
You always make that joke.

211
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,846
Don't you mean "yolk"?

212
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,373
Get some new material.

213
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,037
I would be most grateful...

214
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,065
Sorry.

215
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,603
Clumsy as always,
and twice as dim.

216
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,772
I thought you'd
never get the idea.

217
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,946
Oh, Absolem.

218
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,716
Excuse me, young lady.
We'll be needing that.

219
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,355
Oh, you all disgust me.

220
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,025
You've been gone
too long, Alice.

221
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,324
And he will be gone
before long.

222
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,498
Who will be gone?

223
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,743
What has happened?

224
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,497
All will become clear
in the fullness of Time.

225
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,378
For now, hurry.

226
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,216
Oh...

227
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,712
And do mind your step.

228
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,277
Hey!

229
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,414
- Alice.
- Oh, Alice.

230
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,295
Thank goodness
you're finally here.

231
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,959
It's that girl again.

232
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,427
Alice.

233
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,762
You're back.

234
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,768
Don't be nice to her.

235
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,102
She's late.

236
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,552
Have I come at a bad time?

237
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,730
On the contrary.

238
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,665
We were afraid
you weren't coming at all.

239
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,942
What's the matter?

240
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,478
The Hatter's the matter.

241
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,401
Or the matter of the Hatter.

242
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,145
- The former.
- No, the latter.

243
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,865
- Mmm...
- Tweedles?

244
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,827
He's mad.

245
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:18,909
The Hatter?

246
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,121
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

247
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,950
Yes, I know.

248
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,618
That's his muchness.

249
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,081
That's what makes him so...

250
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,250
him.

251
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,501
But he's grown darker...

252
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,711
less dafter.

253
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,122
Denies himself laughter.

254
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,501
And no scheme of ours
can raise any sort of smile.

255
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,048
We rather hoped
you might help us save him.

256
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,851
What happened?

257
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,142
There was a great storm.

258
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,186
We ventured out into

259
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,811
the Tulgey Woods
to investigate.

260
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:53,989
Come, quadruped.

261
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,533
Fetch!

262
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,824
Your turn!

263
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,950
Fetch, doggy.

264
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,244
<i>Hatter was
perfectly hatterish.</i>

265
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,538
<i>Until...</i>

266
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,917
<i>that blue paper hat...</i>

267
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,794
<i>somehow put him in mind...</i>

268
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340
<i>...of his family's tragedy.</i>

269
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:26,185
<i>Slain by the Jabberwocky,
on Horunvendush Day...</i>

270
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,387
many years ago.

271
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,685
He's just not himself any more.

272
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,983
But, if anything could bring
the Hatter back,

273
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,688
it would be seeing you again.

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
- Oh, yes.
- Indeed.

275
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,485
Well, where is he?

276
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,580
Uh...

277
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,388
Go away!

278
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,221
You can't come in.

279
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,927
Hatter, it's me.

280
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,637
Alice.

281
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,398
Alice.

282
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,307
You're you.

283
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,233
And you're here.

284
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,439
You are you, aren't you?

285
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,318
Yes, Hatter.

286
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,241
Good.

287
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,581
You're the only one.

288
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,706
But you've always been Alice.

289
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,798
And that's how I know
you'll believe me.

290
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,587
I've missed you, Hatter.

291
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,882
It's my family, Alice.

292
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,517
Your family?

293
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,473
Yes.

294
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,020
My family.

295
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,769
Lost for many years.

296
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,693
Or so I thought.

297
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,612
Look.

298
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,899
I found this.

299
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,110
The first hat I ever made.

300
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,905
I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.

301
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,372
It's impossible for it
to be here, and yet...

302
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,415
here it is.

303
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,753
So if this hat survived...

304
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,627
my family must have too.

305
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,882
But, Hatter, that's...

306
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,349
I thought I wasn't worthy
of the Hightopp name.

307
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,308
Very serious man, my father.

308
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,481
We had a terrible fight.

309
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,486
I never said I was sorry
when I had the chance.

310
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,066
But this means...

311
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,907
that I can make things right.

312
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,533
Hatter...

313
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,328
your family, uh...

314
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,084
You...

315
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,330
do believe me,
don't you, Alice?

316
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,333
I want to. I...

317
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,056
Hatter!

318
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,090
You're not well.

319
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,849
What can I do?

320
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,439
Of course.

321
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,894
My Alice...

322
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,855
could bring
my family back to me.

323
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,362
Oh, but...

324
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,240
Hatter, the thing is...

325
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,075
your family died.

326
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,787
Long ago.

327
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,407
You told me so yourself.

328
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,082
No one can bring them back.

329
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,587
No one but you.

330
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,965
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,434
But it's...

332
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,305
It's impossible.

333
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,900
You...

334
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,070
are not you.

335
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,413
Hatter, please.

336
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,997
Get out.

337
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,922
I don't know who you are.

338
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,631
You're not my Alice.

339
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,422
My Alice would believe me.

340
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,607
Hatter!

341
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,214
Hatter, please!

342
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,113
Please!

343
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,369
We must do something.

344
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,538
He's so terribly ill.

345
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,120
I fear he's...

346
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,295
dying.

347
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,796
Oh, dear.

348
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,441
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

349
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,465
No...

350
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,631
We can't lose him, Alice.
We can't.

351
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,127
He said, to make him better,
I must bring his family back.

352
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,845
But that...

353
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,765
cannot be.

354
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,101
Unless it could.

355
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,595
- What?
- Oh.

356
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,310
Unless there was a way.

357
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,938
No, no, no.
You mustn't. You mustn't.

358
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,113
What is it?

359
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,946
It is dangerous. Perilous.
It is too much to ask!

360
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,489
What is it?

361
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,164
Alice.

362
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,540
You must travel back in time.

363
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,836
Oh, no.

364
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,120
Go back into the past and
save the Hatter's family.

365
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,710
If the Hatter's delusion
is made true...

366
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,341
...then he would be
made well again.

367
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,509
- Go back in time?
- Hmm.

368
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,889
But how?

369
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,554
The Chronosphere.

370
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,515
I'm sorry, the Chrono-what?

371
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,725
The Chronosphere.

372
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,683
The source that powers
the Grand Clock of All Time.

373
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,477
Legend has,
it also lets one travel

374
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,650
across the Ocean of time.

375
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,277
None of us can use it because

376
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,150
we've already
been in the past.

377
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,157
And if your past self
sees your future self...

378
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,036
What happens?

379
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,605
There is no history
of it happening.

380
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,428
But it is said that
if it were to happen...

381
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,124
everything would be history.

382
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,535
That sounds very dangerous.

383
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,795
It is. Extremely so.

384
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:31,045
Because you're not from here,
only you can use it, Alice.

385
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,588
It's not impossible...

386
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,013
merely...

387
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,596
un-possible.

388
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,510
Got ya!

389
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,268
Hatter is my truest friend.

390
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,100
If he's in need,
I will help him.

391
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,268
No matter what.

392
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:47,728
Oh, Alice!

393
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,727
- So brave.
- I knew she'd help us.

394
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,355
Where exactly is
this Chronosphere?

395
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,857
In the hands of Time.
It's his.

396
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,241
I'm sorry. Time is a he?

397
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,412
He lives in
a void of infinitude,

398
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,285
in a castle of eternity.

399
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,581
Through here,
one mile past the pendulum.

400
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,467
Very cold.

401
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,102
Find Time's castle,
borrow the Chronosphere...

402
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,934
travel back in time to
Horunvendush Day...

403
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,973
save the Hatter's family
from being killed,

404
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,604
and thereby save the Hatter.

405
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,612
And do try not to break
the past, present, or future.

406
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,866
Shh!

407
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,940
I was only trying to help.

408
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,013
What could go wrong?

409
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,802
Fairfarren, Alice.

410
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,759
Hatter's counting on you.

411
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,673
We all are.

412
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,391
Hello?

413
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,225
Anybody here?

414
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,086
Hello?

415
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,772
Whoa...

416
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,869
Stupid me-shaped corridor.

417
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,127
Will this day never end?

418
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,009
It clings to me like a pair
of sweaty pantaloons.

419
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,643
Who has stopped?

420
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,027
Who has ticked...

421
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,821
their last tock?

422
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,991
Tocked...

423
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,491
their last tick?

424
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,922
Ah.

425
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,581
Brilliam...

426
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,133
Hinkle.

427
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,136
Brilliam Hinkle.

428
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,938
Your time is up.

429
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:47,952
Hmm.

430
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,778
Let's put you away,
Mr Hinkle...

431
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,662
...in the right place,
like alphabetical order.

432
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,463
Ah, Higgens.

433
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,128
Highbottom.

434
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,884
Not here yet.

435
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,219
Highturn.

436
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,339
Highview, Himmelby.

437
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,301
Ah, Hinkle.

438
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:14,854
I hope you were happy.

439
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,887
I hope you used
your time well.

440
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,065
Good night.

441
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,187
Hmm?

442
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,363
Who is there?

443
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,109
I saw you.

444
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,156
How did you get in?

445
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,408
It is impossible.

446
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,286
Come out, you little,
wriggling worm!

447
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,917
Oh.

448
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,625
- It's a girl.
- Please, sir.

449
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,418
I'm sorry to disturb you...

450
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,734
but if I could just have
a moment of your time.

451
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,089
Time?

452
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,546
Young lady...

453
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,007
I am...

454
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,797
Time.

455
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,259
The infinite...

456
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,931
the eternal...

457
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,263
the immortal...

458
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,940
the immeasurable.

459
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,065
Unless you have a clock.

460
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,359
So, being Time...

461
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,900
I must give some of myself...

462
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,944
for you to have me.

463
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,034
Are you following
what I'm saying?

464
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,208
Yes.

465
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,376
Really? Oh.

466
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,626
Do you promise to be concise?

467
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,290
Well, I can most...

468
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,443
Because if there's one thing
I do not like, it is...

469
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,209
people who are unable,
unwilling, or, um...

470
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,470
Un...

471
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,469
Un... Uh...

472
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,557
uncompelled to
form short sentences.

473
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,884
My friend is in mortal danger.

474
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,757
Enough of your
incessant jabbering!

475
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,394
I have important work to do.

476
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,319
Please!

477
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,318
You haven't answered
my question.

478
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,659
One minute.

479
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,402
Why do you carry that
fallen soldier in your pocket?

480
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,914
Reveal him now.

481
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,666
He is broken.

482
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,501
Kaput.

483
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,842
It was my father's.
I would never part with it.

484
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,208
Everyone parts with everything
eventually, my dear.

485
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:13,848
Behold.

486
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,642
The magnificent
Grand Clock of All Time.

487
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,485
He is me, and I am he...

488
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,239
and all that was
or ever shall be.

489
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,654
I thought up that poem.

490
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,778
Now, remember.
Look lively, everyone.

491
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,830
Ah, Wilkins!

492
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,494
Shoulders back, eyes forward.

493
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,205
How is, uh,
my invincible machine, hmm?

494
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,336
- Well, it's... Oh.
- Silence!

495
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,999
You will speak
when you are spoken to.

496
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,549
- He was spoken to.
- Nonsense!

497
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,050
The machine, Wilkins.

498
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,673
How is it?

499
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,380
Um...

500
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,728
Hello.

501
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,560
And who might you be?

502
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,315
These miniscule artisans
are my Seconds.

503
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Curious!

504
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,311
And I suppose
every Second counts.

505
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,695
Count? I wish.

506
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,694
They are rather stupid.

507
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,991
That was rude of me.

508
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,673
I told you. Imbeciles.

510
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,882
Come on.

511
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,183
So, your question.

512
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,846
What is it?
You have exactly one minute.

513
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,557
It's about the Hatter...

514
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,105
Tarrant Hightopp.
He's a great friend of mine.

515
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,519
And recently
he's convinced that

516
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,187
his long-deceased family
is still alive.

517
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,927
And, of course, his family
cannot really be alive...

518
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,011
because you see,
the Jabberwocky

519
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,262
killed his family on
the Horunvendush Day...

520
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,639
and I killed the Jabberwocky
on the Frabjous Day...

521
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,015
and I'd like your permission
to borrow the Chronosphere.

522
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,279
- It is imperative that...
- Ah.

523
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,740
The Chronosphere.

524
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,458
That wasn't a minute.

525
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,869
You want to borrow it.

526
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,621
Loan it.

527
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,299
Purloin it.

528
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,468
Yes.

529
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,592
You ask...

530
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,721
to disintegrate history.

531
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,637
The Chronosphere
powers the Grand Clock.

532
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,975
But I need it.

533
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,869
Without it, the Hatter
may never get better.

534
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,436
- And I have to...
- Wilkins!

535
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,143
Wilkins!

536
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,778
Stupid door.

537
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,233
Did you call, sir?

538
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,320
Wilkins, please
remove this, uh...

539
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,452
yellow-haired
kindergartener, here.

540
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,991
Immediately, sir!

541
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,830
No interlopers!

542
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,491
Thank you for your you, sir.

543
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,500
Come along, come along.

544
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,911
My what?

545
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,090
For your Time.

546
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,467
Young lady...

547
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,338
you cannot change the past.

548
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,753
Though I dare say,

549
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,713
you might learn
something from it.

550
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,346
Come on, you!

551
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,267
This next generation.

552
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,685
Now, back the way
you came, miss.

553
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,524
All the way to the end.

554
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,698
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

555
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,947
- Oh. Uh...
- Wilkins!

556
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,197
Yes, sir!

557
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,112
She's here!
My <i>liebchen</i> is here!

558
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,291
Coming, sir!

559
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,623
Hurry! Quick!

560
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,080
All right. Here we go.
Ding, ding!

561
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,506
Seconds out! Seconds out!

562
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,925
Oh. Ah!

563
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,228
Get back.

564
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,723
Stay in line. Stay in line!

565
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,309
Your Highness.

566
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,484
Your Majesty!

567
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,520
Majesty!

568
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,395
My lord is expecting you
in the parlour.

569
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,404
Shall I announce you?

570
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,738
Oh, no mind!
I'll announce myself.

571
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,997
Tick Tock! Where are you?

572
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,166
Tick Tock! Where are you?

573
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,578
Tick Tock!

574
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,757
Coming, my love!

575
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,928
Present!

576
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,304
Of course.

577
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,262
My darling...

578
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:34,557
may I say that your head is
looking very, very big today.

579
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,478
Hmm.

580
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,612
Oh.

581
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:45,155
I present you with a gift
made entirely out of love.

582
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,116
And also a little bit of metal
and wood, of course.

583
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,916
I know how you
love the tiny things. Hmm?

584
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,885
Oh.

585
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,929
Hmm.

586
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,553
Ooh! Ahh!

587
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,723
I'll treasure it forever.

588
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,019
Oh. Good!

589
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,942
Hmm?

590
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,029
Oh, dear.

591
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,046
The Chronosphere.

592
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,594
What troubles you, my dear?

593
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,297
You know what it is
that I desire.

594
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,097
But, my love, I have done
so much for you already.

595
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,970
Yes, yes,
that's all very well.

596
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,601
But don't you see?

597
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,224
That...

598
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,691
with my big brain...

599
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,404
and your...

600
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,652
little Chronosphere...

601
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,444
I could get even
with my sister.

602
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:17,209
And we could rule the past,
the present, and the future.

603
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,097
You ask the impossible,
my dear.

604
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,843
I cannot give you
the Chronosphere.

605
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,886
You would if you loved me.

606
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,057
No one loves me.

607
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,600
No one fears me.

608
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,777
But I do love you.

609
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:45,948
Hmm? Kiss?

610
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,146
Oh, no.

611
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,408
Oh...

612
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,794
The Grand Clock!

613
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,681
Wilkins!

614
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,262
Right behind you, sir!

615
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,846
- Tick Tock!
- Hmm?

616
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,492
Seconds into Minutes.

617
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,427
Tick Tock!

618
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,013
Don't abandon me
when I'm sulking!

619
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,167
What's the matter with you?

620
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,048
The Chronosphere.

621
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,886
Alice.

622
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,189
No!

623
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,357
Stop her!

624
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,694
Stop her, you imbeciles!

625
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,490
Which idiot labelled that?

626
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,911
You did, my lord.

627
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,084
Thank you for
admitting your mistake.

628
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,753
Idiot!

629
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,960
How do I work this?

630
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,387
Halt! Stop!

631
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,060
Stop, you little mouse!

632
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,020
No. No!

633
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,924
How do I look?
Tell me. I can take it.

634
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,136
He's a mere shell of a man.

635
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,760
It's like a ship.

636
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:06,898
Dead ahead.

637
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,608
Come, quadruped. Fetch!

638
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,314
Hatter!

639
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,994
Don't worry, Hatter.

640
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,412
I'll save you and your family.

641
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,434
<i>Alice?</i>

642
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,477
The Alice?

643
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,187
Slayer of my Jabberbabywocky?

644
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,060
Oh.

645
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,734
The very reason
why I have been

646
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,111
banished from my kingdom?

647
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,364
That Alice?

648
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,830
Idiot!

649
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:08,287
I want her head!

650
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,670
Are you all right, sir?

651
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,543
It has begun.

652
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,011
Without the Chronosphere...

653
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,632
the Grand Clock
will break down.

654
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,470
Time myself will stop...

655
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,352
and all in Underland
will perish.

656
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,013
Did you say perish?

657
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,816
Wilkins, you must keep
the Grand Clock ticking.

658
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,638
Me? I said that
out loud, didn't I?

659
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,857
I mean, of course, sir.

660
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:43,076
And I must find
the kindergartner.

661
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,538
Oh, my goodness!

662
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,369
What's happening?

663
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,702
She must have
the Chronosphere.

664
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:00,843
Take care, dear Alice.
All our hopes fly with you.

665
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,727
Horunvendush Day!

666
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,744
Aha!

667
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,496
You!

668
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,912
Give me what is mine!

669
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,417
Give it back...

670
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,132
or there will be
none of me left.

671
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,595
Come back!

672
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,475
You cannot win
in a race against Time.

673
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,767
I am inevitable!

674
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,996
Hatter?

675
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,333
Hatter?

676
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,085
Oh!

677
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:56,503
It's you!

678
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,335
You're you again!

679
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,167
Well, if I'm not,
I wish I was.

680
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,624
- Have we met?
- Yes!

681
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,835
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

682
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,013
It's funny...

683
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,463
I feel like I should know you.

684
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,655
Well, we have met once,
when I was younger.

685
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,307
I'm afraid I don't recall.

686
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,250
That's because
it hasn't happened yet.

687
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,367
- Oh, when will it happen?
- Years from now.

688
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,645
When you're older.

689
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,725
I'll meet you when
you're younger and I'm older?

690
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,694
I realise it doesn't make
much sense.

691
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,605
Makes perfect sense to me.

692
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:26,780
I'm Tarrant.

693
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,361
I know. I'm Alice.

694
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,360
Alice, you seem to have
time all mixed up.

695
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,032
Oh, he's not mixed up at all.

696
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,361
Actually he's quite
angry with me.

697
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,037
You're bonkers,
aren't you? Huh.

698
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,411
That's what I've been told.

699
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,041
All the best ones are.

700
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,628
Listen, I know
it sounds strange,

701
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,461
but I need to
find your family.

702
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,549
Oh, well, you're in luck.
Right this way.

703
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,558
Wonderful!

704
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,556
- Indeed.
- Hmm.

705
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,402
Congratulations, dear Mirana,
on your coming of age.

706
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,409
And now...

707
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,913
the heir.

708
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,156
The crown for
the Princess Iracebeth.

709
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,791
Ignorant peasants.

710
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,925
Hmm.

711
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,969
Quiet!

712
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,768
What are you doing, you idiot?

713
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,943
Put it on my head!

714
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,949
You're making me look stupid.

715
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,411
Get on with it!

716
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,117
You incompetent imbecile!

717
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,258
Silence!

718
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,603
The next person who laughs
will never laugh again!

719
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,805
Oh.

720
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,308
Iracebeth, please!

721
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,148
However would you stop people
from laughing?

722
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,453
Uh, put a bag on her head.

723
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,948
Put a bag on your head!

724
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,612
Put a bag on
all of your heads!

725
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,323
Yes! We'll sew up your lips...

726
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,204
carve your tongues,

727
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,327
cut off your ears,
off with you!

728
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,242
Just off, off, off
with their...

729
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,252
Off with their...

730
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,714
Iracebeth, enough!

731
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,343
Iracebeth...

732
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,584
I had always hoped...

733
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,740
that you would one day show

734
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,534
the necessary qualities
to become the queen...

735
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,673
you were born to be.

736
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,634
I realise now
that day will never come.

737
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,061
People of Witzend...

738
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,639
upon my death...

739
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,690
my crown will pass...

740
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,728
to the Princess Mirana.

741
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,234
Huh?

742
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,032
Father, no.

743
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,370
But that's not fair!

744
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,664
I'm the eldest!

745
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,040
You are unfit to rule,
Iracebeth.

746
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,160
I hate you.

747
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:33,668
I hate you all!

748
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,762
Oh!

749
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,101
And I shall not
ever forget you,

750
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,599
you sniggering Hightopps!

751
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:49,233
No, I shall wreak
a terrible revenge!

752
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,403
Vile.

753
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,234
- Slow.
- Racie.

754
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,903
Oh, don't "Racie" me!

755
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,780
You started it.

756
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,407
Why don't you
tell them the truth?

757
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,463
I didn't think so.

758
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,291
No one loves me.

759
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,468
No one loves me!

760
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,799
- Racie.
- Iracebeth!

761
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,313
If you are to be a hatter
worthy of the Hightopp name...

762
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:32,860
you must be sane,
sober, disciplined.

763
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,401
Everything you now are not!

764
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,822
Oh.

765
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,988
All I did was laugh, Father.

766
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,412
Couldn't help it.

767
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,829
Her head is rather voluminous.

768
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,616
You cost the princess
her crown!

769
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,459
Do you know
what this means to us?

770
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,240
Why am I never
good enough for you?

771
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,749
Why are you always such
a disappointment to me?

772
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,174
There. You've said it.

773
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,468
You've said it, Father.

774
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,639
Well, if I'm such
a disappointment...

775
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,570
I don't suppose you'll be
sorry if I leave home.

776
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,651
No.

777
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,152
Tarrant!

778
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,981
My hat please, Mom.

779
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,659
Tarrant.

780
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,157
- Zanik.
- No.

781
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,326
Please. Tell him to stay.

782
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,874
Zanik, please.

783
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,877
Tarrant.

784
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,625
Tarrant?

785
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,052
Hatter!

786
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,629
Hatter. Wait.

787
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,016
I am no hatter.

788
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,054
Of course you are.
You're the Hatter.

789
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,014
Or you will be
at least when I knew you.

790
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,937
You should meet
my friend Thackery.

791
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,185
He's nearly as mad as you.

792
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:53,478
Won't you join us
for some tea?

793
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,569
Hatter, please.

794
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,272
You must go back
to your family.

795
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,855
What do you know of my family?

796
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,114
They're in danger.

797
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,568
You have to warn them about
Horunvendush Day.

798
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,858
No idea
what you're talking about.

799
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,199
But if my father sent you to
change my mind, you won't!

800
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,163
If you don't go now
and reconcile,

801
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,165
you'll be sorry.
I know you will.

802
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,914
Maybe later.

803
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,171
I lost my father.

804
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,675
And I miss him every day.

805
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,390
If you walk away now,

806
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,389
you will lose
your father, too.

807
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,557
It's forever for me.

808
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,897
But it doesn't have to be
forever for you.

809
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,641
You can still get him back,

810
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,442
and then you'll really
be you again.

811
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,728
And a hatter just like him.

812
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:44,533
The last thing I want
is to end up like my father.

813
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:51,751
Tarrant, wait!

814
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,333
Your family will be lost

815
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,706
and you will have done
nothing to stop it!

816
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,629
Fine. I'll warn them myself.

817
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,106
Mr Hightopp.

818
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,368
If I could just have
a moment of your time...

819
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,420
there's something
terribly important

820
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,444
you should know about.

821
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,943
Mr Hightopp.

822
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,783
Our apologies.

823
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,616
You know of
my sister's misfortune.

824
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,080
Uh, no apologies necessary,
Your Highness.

825
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:36,585
All of Witzend laments the day
of your sister's accident.

826
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,922
Fell Day,
as the clock struck 6.

827
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,029
I shall never forget
that snowy night

828
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,653
when she hit her head
in the town square.

829
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,969
She and I had...

830
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,806
That moment
changed everything.

831
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,013
But if that moment
never happened...

832
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,811
there'd be
no Horunvendush Day.

833
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,980
Hatter would be saved!

834
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,314
Excuse me.

835
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,824
Who was that strange girl?

836
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,550
Oh, dear.

837
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,144
Don't worry, men.
We can do this!

838
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,855
Just not with him.

839
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,693
Cheer up, Tarrant.

840
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,530
We'll have fun now that
you're living here.

841
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,995
It's tea time!

842
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,281
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little bat</i>

843
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,206
<i>How I wonder where you're at</i>

844
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,584
<i>Up above the...</i>

845
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,549
- Ugh.
- Oh.

846
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,724
Ow.

847
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,559
Hmm?

848
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:16,938
Ah...

849
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:22,902
Who's he?

850
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,065
Greetings, Underlings.

851
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,446
I am Time.

852
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,732
The infinite and immortal.

853
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,280
The personification
of time itself.

854
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,365
I know you may
find this concept

855
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,412
a little bit hard to digest...

856
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,061
but please keep
your bewilderment brief

857
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,120
and to the point.

858
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,454
Your Majesty.

859
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:41,826
Nice to meet you, sir.

860
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,960
Hmm.

861
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:49,384
I seek a thief
of meagre intellect.

862
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,555
Her hair...

863
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:51,848
Yes?

864
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,057
Yellowish.

865
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
Her name...

866
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,435
Alice.

867
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,270
And what is
your business with her?

868
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,930
She took something from me.

869
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,275
I will not say what it was.
It's not important.

870
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,696
It is a trifle.

871
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,233
I don't see why you are
making such a fuss.

872
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,365
It is as nothing.

873
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,612
I must have it back.

874
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,743
But not that I'm concerned.

875
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,538
- Uh, uh, uh...
- As soon as possible.

876
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,872
Either way, I'm fine
with the outcome. Hmm?

877
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,499
Give it to me.
Who knows about it?

878
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,289
Hmm.

879
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:28,923
Hmm.

880
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,344
Hmm?

881
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,964
Well, you are in luck,
oh, timely one.

882
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,590
Because just today...

883
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,968
I invited Alice to tea.

884
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,140
- Wait. What's an Alice?
- Shush!

885
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,477
Why don't you have a seat...

886
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,358
and we can wait together.

887
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,477
There's no room at the table.

888
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,938
- Shh.
- No room. No room.

889
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,284
Plenty of room.

890
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,655
Plenty of room.

891
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,824
- Tea for our guest.
- Ha! Tea time!

892
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,081
We're having
such a lovely Time here.

893
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,796
Oh. Would ya like a scone?

894
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,791
Scone.

895
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,634
- No.
- So...

896
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,595
if you are really Time itself,

897
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,638
yourself, or whatever
suchness you claim...

898
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,101
Scone. Scone.

899
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,589
...perhaps you can
answer me this.

900
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,688
I have always wondered
when "soon" is.

901
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:29,606
If you vex me,
it will be an eternity.

902
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,318
No!
It's not fair! It's not fair!

903
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,668
He
Really reminds me of someone.

904
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,130
I can't think who.

905
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,498
I think he looks a little bit
like you, Brother.

906
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,551
Nonsense! He's hideous.

907
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,212
He looks more like you.

908
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,259
Come back!

909
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,350
Hey, Tarrant.

910
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,182
Tarrant. Watch this.

911
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,969
Now you see me. Now you...

912
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,638
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment. Don't!

913
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,191
Where'd the cat go?

914
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,486
- Ow.
- Gotcha!

915
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,985
Hmm. Have at you.

916
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,070
Contrariwise, have at you.

917
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,746
Huh?

918
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,410
It's nearly 6.

919
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,253
Hello.

920
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,467
You have a very nice head.

921
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,386
Thank you.

922
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,593
And a nice head
deserves a very nice hat.

923
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,219
That's what my father says.

924
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,601
He makes the best hats
in Witzend.

925
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,799
Would you like him
to make you one?

926
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,150
Come on. He can make any hat.

927
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,357
A bonnet or boater,
dunce hat, fez,

928
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,158
a cloche, coif, snood,
barboosh, or pugree.

929
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,327
You're eating all the tarts.

930
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,872
- You can have the crusts.
- I don't want the crusts.

931
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,355
If you can't get along...

932
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,099
there'll be no more tarts
for either of you.

933
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,329
Now, out of my kitchen.

934
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,135
Scat!

935
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,636
Is it true that
you heal all wounds?

936
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,801
Time is on my side.

937
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,641
And why is it
you wait for no man?

938
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,855
I just can't find the Time.

939
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,486
Chessur.

940
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,267
Where have you been?
You're late.

941
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,732
Actually, I'm right on Time.

942
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,198
I've got Time on my hand.

943
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,203
Do you silly nitwits...

944
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,617
really think that
I have not heard

945
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,997
these cheap barbs before?

946
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,504
Your attempts
at mockery fall flat.

947
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,998
Look. Time is flying.

948
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,177
Enough!

949
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:01,719
No more wasting me.

950
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,256
I'm having the time
of my life?

951
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,192
Father, look.

952
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,475
A customer
with a lovely head...

953
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,272
- right here.
- Mmm...

954
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,482
What is the hat of your
heart's desire, madam?

955
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,775
Something...

956
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,241
feathery?

957
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,614
Something...

958
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,997
button-y?

959
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,081
Good afternoon, miss.

960
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,745
Good afternoon, sir.

961
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,036
The function of a hat is to

962
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,918
follow the proper dictum
of society. Hmm?

963
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,462
Not to be fun.

964
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,636
Father...

965
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,549
I have something fun.

966
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,261
What is it?

967
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,726
It's a hat.

968
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,790
Oh, Tarrant,
you've got it on backwards.

969
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,397
- Stop. You'll ruin it.
- Now, let me finish.

970
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,483
Oh.

971
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,903
Oh, dear.

972
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,154
Oh, well.

973
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,066
Tomorrow...

974
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,824
I'll show you precisely how to
make a proper hat. Hmm?

975
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,919
Tarrant?

976
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,126
You're too hard on him, Zanik.

977
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,249
Hatting is a serious business.

978
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,169
I can't have
his frivolous ideas

979
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,095
keep him from
his true potential.

980
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:29,935
Now.

981
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,097
Yes.

982
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,479
Yes, I think
this hat will suit you...

983
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,317
perfectly.

984
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,590
Thank you ever so much,
Mr Hightopp.

985
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,400
Although, I really
must be on my way.

986
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,397
Have a lovely evening.

987
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,282
Where is she?

988
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,697
What are you doing?

989
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,613
Nothing.

990
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,612
When is she coming?

991
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,833
Uh...

992
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,207
Well...

993
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,665
I never actually said
she was coming...

994
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,169
old bean.

995
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,501
I merely said
I had invited her.

996
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,173
Very good. Very clever.

997
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,100
Well played, sir.

998
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,604
Well played.

999
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,807
Thank you.

1000
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,640
You were asking me before
when "soon" is?

1001
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,309
Let me try to explain
when is now, all right?

1002
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,403
Now is...

1003
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,069
exactly 1 minute
till tea time.

1004
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:13,199
And until the young Alice
joins you for tea...

1005
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:17,241
it will always remain 1 minute
till tea time...

1006
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,201
for you and your...

1007
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,713
dunderheads.

1008
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,667
- Hmm?
- Watch it.

1009
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,715
Enjoy the present.

1010
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,333
I've seen him in
his true light now, haven't I?

1011
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,757
Time to go.

1012
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,534
I must get
the Chronosphere back.

1013
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,514
She cannot be far away.

1014
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,394
What a curious chap.

1015
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,517
What a gentleman.

1016
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,855
Bye bye.

1017
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,181
I can't believe
he just said that.

1018
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,317
Can you?

1019
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,781
Hmm.

1020
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,695
I can't believe
he just said that.

1021
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,249
What?

1022
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,243
Can't bloody move.

1023
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,954
Wait! What's he done?

1024
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,954
The blighter's stuck us all
at 1 minute to tea time.

1025
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,467
Tea time forever!

1026
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,971
Here you are, little ants.

1027
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,605
A nice new home.

1028
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,490
What did I tell you two?

1029
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,783
No more tarts.

1030
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,160
I didn't eat any tarts.

1031
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,776
Why are these crusts
under your bed?

1032
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,590
She put them there.

1033
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,133
Did you, Mirana?

1034
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,298
You did. Tell her!

1035
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,629
Tell the truth, Mirana.

1036
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,598
Did you eat the tarts
and put the crusts there?

1037
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:04,983
No.

1038
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,813
But you did! You're lying!

1039
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,691
The tarts are under your bed.

1040
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,944
Don't blame your sister.

1041
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,281
No, it's not fair!
It's not fair!

1042
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,385
The stroke of 6!

1043
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,521
The clock.

1044
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:46,852
She'll hit her head!

1045
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
No!

1046
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,467
My head. Ow.

1047
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,754
Stupid roses.

1048
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,308
Oh, the princess.

1049
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,676
Oh, no.

1050
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,813
Is your head all right, miss?

1051
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,774
Careful. It's swelling up.

1052
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:35,908
Oh, no.

1053
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,282
Iracebeth?

1054
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,442
Iracebeth!

1055
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,621
Where is she?

1056
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,580
Oh, my darling!

1057
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,884
- Daddy, my head hurts.
- Arms around my neck.

1058
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,455
Mirana!

1059
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,128
Did you see that?

1060
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,464
Yes. That's a nasty fall.

1061
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,718
You cannot change the past.

1062
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:05,976
<i>Though I dare say,</i>

1063
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,384
<i>you might learn
something from it.</i>

1064
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,777
<i>The first hat I ever made.</i>

1065
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,948
<i>I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.</i>

1066
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,451
He kept it.

1067
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,742
<i>It's impossible for it
to be here, and yet...</i>

1068
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,785
<i>here it is.</i>

1069
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,295
<i>So if this hat survived...</i>

1070
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,456
<i>then my family must have too.</i>

1071
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,630
Higgens. Uh...

1072
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,090
Highbottom.

1073
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,846
Not here yet.

1074
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,631
<i>No Hightopps.</i>

1075
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,636
They're alive.

1076
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,304
They're alive!

1077
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,269
Your foolishness...

1078
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,070
astounds me.

1079
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:02,867
You have no conception
of how reckless...

1080
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,615
you have been.

1081
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,201
The dangers that
you have caused.

1082
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,345
What are we going to do?

1083
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,173
Quick! Where's the manual?
Who's got the manual?

1084
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,365
I need that Chronosphere now.

1085
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,117
It must go back
to the Grand Clock.

1086
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:50,790
But Horunvendush Day.

1087
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,201
I'll only use it
one more time.

1088
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,523
I must find out
what happened to

1089
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,083
the Hightopps
so I can rescue them.

1090
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,294
You will rescue no one.

1091
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,217
Wherever you go,
I will find you.

1092
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,094
The Grand Clock must not stop.

1093
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,216
You cannot escape Time.

1094
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,889
I'm sorry.

1095
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,059
But I must save Hatter.

1096
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,901
Alice! Alice!

1097
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,237
Come back with
my Chronosphere...

1098
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,211
<i>It's the Kingsleigh girl.</i>

1099
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,010
<i>The girl's gone mad.
Take her away.</i>

1100
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,114
<i>Strap her down, lads.</i>

1101
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,830
Alice?

1102
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,585
Alice?

1103
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,966
Alice?

1104
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:48,475
Where am I?

1105
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,843
You're in an institution.

1106
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,431
How long have I been here?

1107
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,606
Not long.

1108
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,941
You were found in an
upstairs room at the Ascots'.

1109
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,694
Hamish had you brought here.

1110
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,405
You were behaving
so strangely.

1111
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,450
They say you were trying to
get under the furniture.

1112
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,622
Talking about the atmosphere?

1113
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:19,965
The Chronosphere!

1114
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,213
Hatter!

1115
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,504
Yes indeed, Miss Kingsleigh.

1116
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,300
I've got to go back.

1117
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:25,804
Now, let's see.

1118
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,180
Excitable...

1119
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,014
emotional, prone to fantasy.

1120
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,864
Textbook case
of female hysteria.

1121
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,762
Untreatable, some say.

1122
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,392
I beg to differ.

1123
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,481
But there's nothing
wrong with me.

1124
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,189
Lie back, Alice.

1125
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,323
Lie back.

1126
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,313
Dr Bennet,
is it really necessary?

1127
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,383
- Surely there must be some...
- Mr Harris.

1128
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,111
I can't be here!

1129
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,090
Mr Harris, if you could see
to Mrs Kingsleigh.

1130
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,447
I've got to go back!

1131
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,000
We have work to do.

1132
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,667
Never fear. We'll have
Alice fixed in no time.

1133
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,135
Where did I...

1134
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,971
Dr Bennet,
I really must object.

1135
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:20,942
Alice.

1136
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,647
Run!

1137
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:26,907
No!

1138
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,072
Don't let her get away! Hurry!

1139
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,792
Oh. Oh!

1140
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,586
If 3 years at sea
taught me anything...

1141
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,188
it's how to tie
a bloody good knot.

1142
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,750
Hey!

1143
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,499
That's my cab!

1144
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:22,747
You can't take that!

1145
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,037
Sorry!

1146
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,338
I plead insanity.

1147
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,723
Hold on, Hightopps.

1148
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,960
Hightopps!

1149
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:58,308
No!

1150
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,540
Revenge is mine.

1151
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,046
She took them.

1152
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,975
Next time.

1153
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,739
Hatter!

1154
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,419
Hatter!

1155
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,000
Your family, they're alive!

1156
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,227
He's barely ticking.

1157
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,150
We fear you are too late.

1158
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,781
Hatter!

1159
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,946
He's fading away.

1160
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:44,116
I can't bear
to see him like this.

1161
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:48,958
Come, Mally.
Say your goodbyes, Alice.

1162
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,628
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1163
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,796
Please wake up, Hatter.
Please.

1164
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,255
Wake up.

1165
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,303
Please wake up.

1166
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,479
I know what this means now.

1167
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,649
You made it for your father
when you were young.

1168
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,978
A token of your love which you
thought he threw away.

1169
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,442
But he kept it
all those years.

1170
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:20,948
He kept it.

1171
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,733
And now he needs your help.

1172
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,121
I'm so sorry.

1173
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,702
I thought it was impossible.

1174
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,667
I should have believed you.

1175
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,516
You believe me?

1176
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,942
I'll always believe in you.

1177
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,870
It's you, isn't it?

1178
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,826
I'd know you anywhere.

1179
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,801
You're Alice.

1180
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,389
Hatter.

1181
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,381
I missed you so much.

1182
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,175
So have I, dear.

1183
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:35,223
But if my family's
still alive...

1184
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,312
why have they not come home?

1185
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,256
Because they are
being held captive...

1186
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,611
by the only person
cruel enough

1187
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:41,938
to keep them locked up...

1188
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,572
all these years.

1189
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,043
Bloody Big Head.

1190
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,297
I'm going to find
that Red Queen

1191
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:07,221
and bring my family home.

1192
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,354
Hello!

1193
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,643
What do you think, pets?

1194
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,863
Oh, dig, dig, dig.
Work, work, work.

1195
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,403
Earthquake.

1196
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,131
Where the devil have you been?

1197
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,259
Where's Alice?

1198
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:46,718
Where's my Chronosphere?

1199
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,015
Hmm?

1200
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,757
She jumped into
a looking glass.

1201
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:52,971
She's gone.

1202
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,682
- What? You let her get away?
- No.

1203
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,348
I must find her.

1204
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,442
Where is she?

1205
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,816
How should I know
where she is?

1206
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,817
Because she is your enemy.

1207
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,941
She muttered...

1208
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:07,022
an utterance about...

1209
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,660
Hightopps.

1210
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,617
Hightopps.

1211
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,992
She said she was
going to rescue them.

1212
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,535
What could this mean?

1213
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:19,409
I know exactly
what that means.

1214
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:20,505
Hmm?

1215
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,676
Guards!

1216
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,802
Seize him.

1217
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,463
You see,
from now on, dearest...

1218
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,222
I'm in charge.

1219
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,055
I've fallen off!

1220
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,916
Alice.

1221
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,036
Mirana.

1222
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,338
Oh. Oh!

1223
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,931
My family's there. I know it!

1224
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:25,730
Good heavens!

1225
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,356
Which way is up?

1226
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,091
Oh, there's a lot of stairs.

1227
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:30,981
Is this where we...

1228
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,368
Split up.

1229
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,068
We'll split up together.

1230
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,366
It is a very large castle.

1231
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,576
Perhaps if
we don't split up...

1232
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,164
Oh, dear.

1233
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:41,329
I'm out of breath already.

1234
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,118
Mrs Hightopp?

1235
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,085
Hightopps? Hightopps?

1236
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,507
Zoinks!

1237
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:53,345
Ooh.

1238
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,576
This one's locked.

1239
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,635
This one, too.

1240
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,016
This is the last room.

1241
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,685
They must be this way.

1242
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,895
I just know it.

1243
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,359
Father? Mother?

1244
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,782
Anyone?

1245
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,010
They're not here?

1246
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,551
They're not here.

1247
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,309
They're not here.

1248
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:47,558
But I was certain
that they were here.

1249
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,268
I could feel it.

1250
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,742
I'm so sorry.

1251
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,873
Father!

1252
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:24,897
Mother!

1253
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:26,977
Everyone, it's you!

1254
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,734
Teeny-tiny you, but still you.

1255
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,882
Hello, Alice.

1256
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,210
Ahh!

1257
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,833
Get it!

1258
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,754
No!

1259
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,560
Thank you ever so much.

1260
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,350
You have just delivered to me

1261
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:11,059
the most powerful device
in the entire universe.

1262
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,862
Along with
your dearest friends.

1263
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:19,901
And my dearest enemy.

1264
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,541
Racie!

1265
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,626
Shut up!

1266
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:29,731
I knew we should have
stayed together.

1267
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:30,995
Now look at us.

1268
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,581
Stuck in a giant
vegetable jail.

1269
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,928
What happened to you?

1270
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,015
Wait! Your Majesty, stop!

1271
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,852
You cannot change the past.
Believe me, I have tried.

1272
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,979
Oh, Alice,
you always were an irksome,

1273
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,061
slurvish, interrupting thing.

1274
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,614
When I get back...

1275
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,315
I shall have the heads
of all your friends.

1276
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,825
And then I shall have
your head. Ta-ta.

1277
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:06,662
Come on.

1278
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,702
Don't let her see herself.

1279
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,750
Or else she will
destroy everything!

1280
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,305
I now recall
why I don't like her.

1281
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,154
"How to Keep
the Clock Going Yourself."

1282
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,783
Of course!

1283
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:43,279
Seconds, Minutes...

1284
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,411
Proceed to 347!

1285
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,994
It's time...

1286
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,294
for the Hour!

1287
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:11,897
It's Time.

1288
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,856
Oh, this is all my fault.

1289
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,517
I stole the Chronosphere.

1290
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,521
I think you may
have to steal it again.

1291
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,248
She ate my schnozzle.

1292
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:36,832
"And my fingers..."

1293
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,417
"...and my elbow!"

1294
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,753
Thank you.

1295
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,671
I think you look
rather fetching

1296
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:43,763
without your schnozzle.

1297
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,596
Absolutely radishing.

1298
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,548
Stop it.

1299
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,217
What are we going to do?

1300
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,726
Yeah, what's the plan?

1301
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,899
It's up to you now, Alice.

1302
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,815
Take Time to his castle.

1303
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,071
Hatter and I will retrieve
the Chronosphere...

1304
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,386
and restore order
to the universe.

1305
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,410
Do you understand?

1306
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,152
- Yes, of course!
- Got it.

1307
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,575
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

1308
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,133
Where are we?

1309
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,587
You know where we are.

1310
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,722
Why are
these crusts under your bed?

1311
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:32,478
She put them there.

1312
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,638
Did you, Mirana?

1313
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:38,227
Did you, Mirana?

1314
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:39,944
You did.

1315
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:41,522
Tell her!

1316
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:42,988
Tell the truth, Mirana.

1317
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,482
Did you eat the tarts
and put the crusts there?

1318
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,580
- No.
- No.

1319
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,533
- Racie, no!
- You're a liar!

1320
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,543
Liar! You're lying!

1321
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,393
This cannot be good.

1322
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:34,530
We've got to go now!

1323
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,957
She has broken the past.

1324
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:43,917
Only putting back
the Chronosphere

1325
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,499
can save us now!

1326
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,033
It's catching up.

1327
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,077
Ooh.

1328
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,004
Uh, Alice?

1329
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,960
Hold on, everyone.

1330
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:09,420
I don't wanna hold on!

1331
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,474
The Chronosphere!

1332
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,010
She brought it back! Oh!

1333
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:40,455
Run, Alice!

1334
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,332
They might actually
pull this off.

1335
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,578
Follow me. This way.

1336
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,005
I've got you, wee man.

1337
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,178
Oh...

1338
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,825
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

1339
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,259
Gotta save the Grand Clock.

1340
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:03,932
I won't leave you.

1341
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,030
Sir, sir! Hold on, sir!
She's here!

1342
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,736
The girl who tricked you

1343
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,488
and made you look
a complete idiot!

1344
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,538
Alice!

1345
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,592
Hatter!

1346
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,599
Oh.

1347
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,525
Goodbye, Brother.

1348
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:50,976
Brother, goodbye.

1349
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:55,318
I have cherished every moment
with all of you.

1350
01:30:58,662 --> 01:30:59,993
On guard!

1351
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:02,533
Time's up.

1352
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:06,867
She's not going to make it!

1353
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,210
She needs more time, sir!

1354
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:14,216
I have not ticked
my last tock yet!

1355
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:24,728
It appears...

1356
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,307
that my invincible machine...

1357
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:28,892
No!

1358
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,436
is in fact...

1359
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:33,647
vincible.

1360
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:56,480
My goodness.

1361
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:10,323
Did I miss anything?

1362
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,328
Are you all right?

1363
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,289
Yes.

1364
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,801
Wilkins.

1365
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:19,927
Wilkins!

1366
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,131
- Wilkins!
- Yes, sir.

1367
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,171
Oh! There you are.

1368
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,013
Stop standing around.

1369
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:27,849
There is much to do, hmm?

1370
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:31,019
You don't need
a butler, do you, miss?

1371
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:32,898
Wilkins!

1372
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,184
They did it! They did it!

1373
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,650
Hooray, Alice!
I always liked that girl.

1374
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,034
Get off me!

1375
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,368
Ugh.

1376
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:11,764
Why does this always
happen to me?

1377
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:24,565
Why does no one love me?

1378
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,743
I love you, Racie.

1379
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,120
No, you don't!

1380
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,702
This is all your fault.

1381
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,048
I know.

1382
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:43,340
I ate
the tarts and I lied about it.

1383
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,738
I should have just
told the truth,

1384
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,174
and none of this
would have ever happened.

1385
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:49,422
I'm so sorry.

1386
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:54,928
If it's not too late...

1387
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,685
please forgive me.

1388
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,030
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

1389
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,119
Really, it was.

1390
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:14,875
Mmm...

1391
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,283
Your Majesty...

1392
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:20,003
I do beg pardon
for any intrusion.

1393
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:25,504
My family find themselves...

1394
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,385
in somewhat
awkward circumstances.

1395
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:31,808
Of course.

1396
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:36,428
I always liked tiny things.

1397
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,648
Thank you.

1398
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,068
Not too much now. Be careful.

1399
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:02,166
Outstanding, my boy.
Well done.

1400
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,465
Oh, my family.

1401
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:09,010
My dear family.

1402
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:10,712
Mother.

1403
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,258
You, Father.

1404
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,436
You kept my blue hat.

1405
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,100
I make hats, Father.

1406
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,148
I'm a hatter.

1407
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:30,148
I always knew
you were, my boy.

1408
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,796
All is well.

1409
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:48,969
Yes?

1410
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,086
I know you tried to warn me.

1411
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,380
But I didn't listen.

1412
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,590
I'm sorry.

1413
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,097
I used to think
Time was a thief...

1414
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,729
stealing everything I loved.

1415
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:08,020
But I see now that
you give before you take.

1416
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,313
And every day is a gift.

1417
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:13,734
Every hour, every minute,
every second.

1418
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,249
Ah.

1419
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,457
The fallen soldier.

1420
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,242
I suppose
you want me to fix it.

1421
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:25,412
No.

1422
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:26,830
I want you to have it.

1423
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,420
He used to say the only thing
worth doing...

1424
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:35,759
was what we do for others.

1425
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,430
I think
he would have liked you.

1426
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,307
Hmm?

1427
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:47,141
It is said that Time
is a friend to no man.

1428
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,904
But I will
remember you always.

1429
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:54,951
And please...

1430
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,033
do not come back.

1431
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,295
Alice.

1432
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:06,535
Oh, Alice.

1433
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:08,458
You simply must come
and meet my family.

1434
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,044
After all,
you are the very person

1435
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,500
who saved them, aren't you?

1436
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:15,799
We're going to have
so much fun together.

1437
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:23,313
Oh.

1438
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,308
But, of course, you have
a family of your own...

1439
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:29,938
don't you?

1440
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:34,356
Very important thing,
a family.

1441
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,483
You only get the one.

1442
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,491
Oh, Hatter.

1443
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,531
I fear I may
never see you again.

1444
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,081
My dear Alice.

1445
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:55,338
In the gardens of memory...

1446
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:00,468
in the palace of dreams...

1447
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,640
that is where you
and I will meet.

1448
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,934
But a dream is not reality.

1449
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:16,485
Who's to say which is which?

1450
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:42,139
You did it, Alice.

1451
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,308
An impossible thing.

1452
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,559
Not as impossible as saying
goodbye to you, my friends.

1453
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:54,727
Goodbye, Hatter.

1454
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,415
Goodbye, Alice.

1455
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,092
Now, please.

1456
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,587
The deed to
your husband's ship.

1457
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:19,927
Just sign here...

1458
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,431
and the house is yours.

1459
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,108
Mr Harcourt...

1460
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:33,687
time is money.

1461
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,569
I'm afraid
he most certainly is not.

1462
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:39,658
Alice!

1463
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,117
Time is many things, Hamish,
but he isn't money.

1464
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,495
Nor is he our enemy, Mother.

1465
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,456
Where did you come from?

1466
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,330
I walked right through
the walls.

1467
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,040
Poof!

1468
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,341
I may not be able
to change the past,

1469
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:00,543
but I can learn from it.

1470
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:03,546
Sign the papers, Mother.

1471
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:05,472
You want me to sign them?

1472
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,265
But what about the <i>Wonder?</i>

1473
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,810
It's just a ship.
There's always another.

1474
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,650
But you are my mother,
and I only have one.

1475
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,408
So you've decided
to be a clerk?

1476
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,283
I knew that you would.

1477
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,573
Headstrong or not.

1478
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:39,790
You're not a nice man, Hamish.

1479
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,336
I'm glad my daughter
didn't marry you.

1480
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:48,132
Mrs Kingsleigh.

1481
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,679
Mrs Kingsleigh!
No, you can't!

1482
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,560
You can't! You can't!

1483
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,935
Alice can do
whatever Alice chooses.

1484
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:58,855
And so can I.

1485
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:01,698
Good day.

1486
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,070
Mother!

1487
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,547
Higher.

1488
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,883
Higher.

1489
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:34,891
Perfect! Thank you, gentlemen.

1490
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:39,270
We'll run the Ascots
out of business in a year.

1491
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:40,560
Mother!

1492
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,400
A full cargo aboard, Captain.

1493
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:48,613
Shall we commence with

1494
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,344
Kingsleigh and Kingsleigh's
maiden voyage?

1495
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:53,365
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr Harcourt.

1496
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,749
Or, indeed, woman.

1497
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,244
Captain aboard.

1498
01:42:58,422 --> 01:42:59,537
Full sail.

1499
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,491
<i>I know that I'm running
out of time</i>

1500
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:32,991
<i>I want it all
Mmm, mmm</i>

1501
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:35,448
<i>And I'm wishing they'd stop
trying to turn me off</i>

1502
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:38,876
<i>I want it on
Mmm, mmm</i>

1503
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:41,875
<i>And I'm walking on a wire
Trying to go higher</i>

1504
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:45,208
<i>Feels like I'm surrounded
by clowns and liars</i>

1505
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,167
<i>Even when I give it all away</i>

1506
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:50,221
<i>I want it all
Mmm, mmm</i>

1507
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,468
