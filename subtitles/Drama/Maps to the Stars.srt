1
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm Agatha Weiss. I asked for a limousine.

2
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,700
A great.

3
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
There were more.

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,700
Been here before?

5
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,700
I have to collect yourself first.

6
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,300
This is 45 per hour, minimum 2 hours.

7
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300
Tenez, 200 dollars.

8
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,600
You have a map of the stars homes?

9
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,700
It is waste of money, except to see a cheesy TV.

10
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Where are you from?

11
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,300
Jupiter.

12
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
Florida.

13
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,500
You are in LA for...?

14
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
I just see family.

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
You drive stars?

16
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
I had Al Gore once.

17
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,900
Surely the most famous.

18
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,500
J'ai aussi eu Tatum O'Neal pour son reality-show.

19
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,900
Chuck Lorre.

20
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,000
He created a Half Men.

21
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,900
A lot of producers, filmmakers.

22
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,000
Juliette Lewis.

23
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,400
She is a Scientologist.

24
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,800
I think convert. It's good for my career.

25
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you an actor?

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Actor, writer.

27
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,900
I know Carrie Fisher.

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Really?

29
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,900
- But how?
- Met on Twitter.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
We are very friendly.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,600
I help for his new novel.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,500
It could become an HBO film.

33
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
What is this place?

34
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,900
I thought it was on the map.

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
There was a big house.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,300
The childhood home of Benjie Weiss.

37
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
How do you know?

38
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,800
J'étais sa baby-sitter.

39
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,300
The evil babysitter, it was me.

40
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Strange!

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,400
My agent wants me to play in Babysitter 2.

42
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
It is still not clear but

43
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Jakob Leitner, my personal trainer, got me an audition.

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,000
It is very influential. We were together in Beverly.

45
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
Fingers crossed.

46
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Cheers!

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm not hoping for you to come.

48
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,700
Why is that?

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,100
You're so caught.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Not for you.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
J'ai adoré Bad Babysitter.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,000
We made $ 780 million worldwide.

53
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,800
People tend to forget.

54
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,300
You do not have iPad?

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Arnold, Trouve's an iPad. A mini.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,600
We'll cram shit in 3D.

57
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,700
We have jackets in satin.

58
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:35,000
With "I was a naughty babysitter" in gold letters.

59
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,200
How did you get AIDS?

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,000
I do not have AIDS, it is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,100
You know what...

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
I'll make a movie about your life.

63
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Ryan Gosling will play my role. And I yours.

64
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,500
We will go together at the Oscars.

65
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,800
- Non-Hodgkins?
- Désolé.

66
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:14,200
- What is this disease, damn!
- Something to blood, I think.

67
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,100
This is the "no" that annoys me. You did or you did not.

68
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
You were serious?

69
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:22,100
We could show Ryan. He will like.

70
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,900
We could show Ryan?

71
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,400
You arrive only to wipe your ass.

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,300
It would be very moving.

73
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,400
I even have a title: A Life of shit.

74
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,100
No pie in the sky!

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Dixit le grand euthanasiste!

76
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,100
Rabbi of life and death.

77
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,000
Le Grand say. Le Grand zen archer.

78
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I found your nickname: the Holocaust Museum!

79
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Stop, Benjie.

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Stop?

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
I have a better idea.

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Show me your pussy!

83
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,000
I know you have one.

84
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,800
Kind of Jew motherfucker!

85
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,000
- They offer how much?
- Five million.

86
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Plus 10%.

87
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,300
That request Genie?

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Eight.

89
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,200
20% of revenues.

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,800
What do you think?

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
We have them by the balls.

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Super.

93
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:31,500
When is the hearing?

94
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,700
This is not an audition.

95
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
That is true.

96
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
And that's when the urine test?

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,700
We see them Friday at 10 o'clock.

98
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
They want to make sure you're clean.

99
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,600
But the agreement depends on the match?

100
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:54,100
- They protect their franchise.
- It's me, the franchise.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,300
Tu veux manger, Stafford?

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,600
I listened to a tape of the Dalai Lama.

103
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,600
Forget his politics. This guy is a pro.

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,700
Free Tibet! But Tibet is overpriced.

105
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,000
I even kept the receipt from Amazon.

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Buddhists say a prayer...

107
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,900
- Genie will be there?
- She does not prefer.

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,900
I want her to come.

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,900
"Do eaters, what they eat and eating

110
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,000
"Are completely without ego."

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
I go into my room.

112
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Name, mum...

113
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,200
Name, mum...

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Do not do me wrong...

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
Do not enter my room...

116
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
quand je dors.

117
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,900
Do not enter my room when I sleep.

118
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,400
I will not let you do.

119
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Kind of bitch!

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Tu me fais mal.

121
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,400
But how?

122
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Did I hurt you?

123
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,500
I was your girl

124
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,700
and yet, you have hurt me.

125
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Why, Mom?

126
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,700
Your parents beat you? It's not an excuse.

127
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
Stop forgive Havana.

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,700
I do not care what they did. They would have killed you.

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I'll get you killed...

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,700
How dare you do that to a child?

131
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,200
How could you do this to me, your daughter?

132
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,000
I want to be free, Clarice.

133
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,300
Clarice, mom, free me!

134
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,800
I want to be free.

135
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to win back the stolen years.

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,300
Please...

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,900
I now rely on a special item.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,500
All that is stored in the thighs.

139
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,200
Regains years, Havana.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Regains the years stolen from the little girl.

141
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,400
Rebecca, stop. You're a patient here.

142
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,800
I want to help you, not...

143
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,500
You do not think I fired?

144
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,200
I think you do not want to.

145
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,500
You need help.

146
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,800
Will not you help me?

147
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,300
Not like that...

148
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,200
We should think about what we do.

149
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,100
Granted on all flesh

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,000
On the front of my friends

151
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,100
On each hand reaching

152
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
I write your name

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Miss Havana?

154
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,700
Miss Genie is there.

155
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,900
How are you, darling?

156
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:40,200
It's going... I had a very hard session with Stafford.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,600
You're so brave!

158
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,700
I do not feel brave.

159
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
I need a slave.

160
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,700
Et ta fameuse adage?

161
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,500
I had to fire her.

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
- But why?
- She stole me.

163
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,900
My God... Incredible!

164
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,700
She stole money from me, a ring and Vicodin.

165
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,400
My God!

166
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,200
And you caught in the act?

167
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,100
- You called the police?
- I have threatened to do so.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500
And she's in the hospital?

169
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,700
With all the cameos slaves.

170
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,400
They have their special wing.

171
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll call Carrie.

172
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,900
No. Love her all you want but do not fuck with that.

173
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,100
Ça fierce brown.

174
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,700
I have to see her at a party. It will give me names.

175
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
Well...

176
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Et pour Stolen Waters?

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,700
They are all at Sundance.

178
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,500
Everyone except me!

179
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,700
It was the best reading of my life.

180
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm totally amazed!

181
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,000
I know.

182
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,200
The only thing that worries might be

183
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,900
to cast a star in a supporting role.

184
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,800
But everyone does!

185
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,400
It's a film, rather minor, your mother has turned

186
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:08,600
il ya 30 ans.

187
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,400
It could be great.

188
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,400
It's a reinvention.

189
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,200
It's an art film.

190
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,500
Who do you think has had the idea of ??watching my mother

191
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,700
Stolen Waters si elle vivait?

192
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,000
That's me!

193
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,600
I gave the idea to Damien there 4 years.

194
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:24,300
I know.

195
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,400
I deserve the role and being credited as a producer.

196
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:30,600
Worth an Oscar for Supporting Actress,

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,300
this is a second chance...

198
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,000
and it is Damien Javitz.

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
It raises the actors!

200
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,300
And I was great.

201
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,100
Sterl always does?

202
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Il m'est redevable.

203
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,800
I introduced him to Harvey, who produced.

204
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:52,100
I've talked to Harvey,

205
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:54,800
who will talk to Damien. But you know...

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,000
Harvey sera toujours Harvey

207
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
Sterl and can talk...

208
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
You know we did everything to.

209
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,200
But ultimately, it's an art film.

210
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:08,100
You'd be great in this role. But in case you've forgotten,

211
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:10,900
your mother is dead but a cult actress.

212
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,000
Et Damien Javitz

213
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,500
is not PT Anderson.

214
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,900
- There are so many movies...
- Really?

215
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,100
- Des blockbusters.
- Où ça?

216
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,200
Où ça, Genie?

217
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,100
The other day, Jacob said,

218
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:26,200
as I know a lot of celebrities,

219
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,500
I should become an agent.

220
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:32,100
You know what it feels like to tell you that?

221
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,600
All I'm doing

222
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,500
in my life and in my analysis,

223
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,500
it is for this role.

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ça ne va pas?

225
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,900
I have cramps.

226
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,700
- Ça va bien?
- Non, ça va mal.

227
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,000
The mother-daughter incest, it's too 80s.

228
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm not Anne Sexton.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,300
The shock will subside.

230
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,100
What there was, Havana?

231
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:20,600
You thought it would be the sixth sense? The dead speak?

232
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,100
You want to know what the dead?

233
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,700
You know what the Hell?

234
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,400
A drug-free world!

235
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
But what is happening?

236
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,200
Le pire porn cliché, Vana,

237
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:36,200
this fantasy child rape! Screws, whore!

238
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
Or die.

239
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,200
It's not a little pathetic to want to be me on the screen?

240
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,100
You hate me,

241
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,700
but you're desperate to be me!

242
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,900
You want this role, but you will not get it.

243
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
You do not even have the talent.

244
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,200
I had and I was young and beautiful.

245
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,900
You? With your tits hanging and your old worn hole?

246
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,700
It stinks even more than me!

247
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
Who is this?

248
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
This is non-Hodgkins.

249
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,300
What are you doing here?

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,400
On my school notebooks

251
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,800
On my desk and trees

252
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,100
Snow on the sand

253
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,200
I write your name

254
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm going to make this film...

255
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
You are there for that?

256
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,400
Arnold said that t'a?

257
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,400
Granted on all flesh

258
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,500
On the front of my friends

259
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,200
On each hand reaching

260
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
I write your name

261
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
On my school notebooks

262
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,400
On my desk and trees

263
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:22,300
Snow on the sand

264
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,000
I write your name

265
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Granted on all flesh

266
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,900
On the front of my friends

267
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,500
On each hand reaching

268
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,700
I write your name

269
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Freedom

270
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
See you at school with Bad Babysitters.

271
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm stuck?

272
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,800
Not at all. You're the first.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Your holidays are hectic.

274
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,900
Rather productive.

275
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,700
It has not been easy

276
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,200
for any of us.

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
But he learned a lot.

278
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,400
Absolutely.

279
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
I myself went through this drug trip.

280
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,900
Not at your age, of course, but...

281
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,400
We all did stupid things, right?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,900
It has happened to you young.

283
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,100
Benjie has matured a lot.

284
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,800
A lot.

285
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,600
In Praise the Heavy, I was getting 300,000 a week.

286
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I was 9 years old.

287
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,900
It is not amazing?

288
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
The crazy money.

289
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
For all.

290
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,400
It was well worth.

291
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
You have many fans.

292
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,700
I was beyond...

293
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:48,300
Mother Teresa péterait sinkers before such dough.

294
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
She has already lost it.

295
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,800
She died. You can not fart higher!

296
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,400
We have a warrant. Cristina knows.

297
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,500
And you too.

298
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,200
We must protect the franchise.

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
We played it tight...

300
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Arnold, your team was great.

301
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,000
Nothing in the tabloids.

302
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,200
An adult into rehab, it can boost a career.

303
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,800
A kid is different.

304
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,500
We understand, Jeb.

305
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Although Drew has benefited.

306
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,700
Friends,

307
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,800
we're on your side. It must be understood.

308
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
We would not be here without a dose of confidence.

309
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
- There are already a budget?
- 58.

310
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,100
But it is confidential.

311
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:41,700
We lost it. But we did not count on it.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
Emma Watson is signed for the young mother.

313
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:45,800
We will have fun though.

314
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,000
One must know how Benjie was detoxified.

315
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
Benjie went into a private home.

316
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,200
That the partner of my husband.

317
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Your mother is really great.

318
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
She knows bumping without a trace.

319
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,700
Whore.

320
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,700
One ever again humiliate me like this.

321
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:32,900
Never.

322
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,700
It's over, baby.

323
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,100
On les a.

324
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Damien finds me too old?

325
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Et le casting? Sarah Horowitz?

326
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,600
Havana, the character is simply younger.

327
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100
This is Sarah Horowitz who gave me my first role.

328
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
He must have seen me in this horror on TNT.

329
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
Do not work for money.

330
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,700
We can not all be as malignant as you.

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Tu stuck me soutenir, Sterl?

332
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,900
You will speak to Damien?

333
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,400
You know I do.

334
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Il pense à Azita Wachtel.

335
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,500
She was nominated for an Oscar and she is Canadian.

336
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,200
You know the reputation of this Wachtel?

337
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,400
It would leave producers piss him in the ass.

338
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,700
It's good to know.

339
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,700
You know him well, Damien...

340
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,900
This is the third time I called in vain.

341
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:37,200
Your reading was great.

342
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
The tea in the dit?

343
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,400
He said it was "very strong."

344
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
He really said?

345
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Yes.

346
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,600
I must have this role. It would be awesome together.

347
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,900
I thought it already was.

348
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Diandra?

349
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,500
But it is very old!

350
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,600
She is 23 years old! 16 on IMDb.

351
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:04,300
- How do you know she is 23 years old?
- Large pierced lips.

352
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,100
Please take 23 years for that?

353
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,600
It is tattooed on his ass.

354
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,000
She is post-menopausal!

355
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,400
Cool, girls, right?

356
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
- Rhett, you told him?
- You will not believe it.

357
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,500
It's too weird. I will not tell you.

358
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,200
It's starting to like me.

359
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:22,700
It's a crazy...

360
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,900
She posted 6,000 messages on my Facebook in 2 months.

361
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:28,200
You're going to marry?

362
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:31,000
- Fuck it, Rhett.
- Lick it for its rules.

363
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,400
- Do not be vulgar.
- He does not like that.

364
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,800
It can not... because you're menopausal.

365
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Ta gueule!

366
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
Calm down!

367
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,900
We discover a technician sold him my shit

368
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,400
pour 3000 dollars.

369
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,400
Disais Tu, ta merde?

370
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,800
Your entendu as well. Ma merde.

371
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:54,800
It is a high-end shit.

372
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,900
It is made from rice Nobu.

373
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,400
Directly to your trailer?

374
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,800
When the guy is emptying...

375
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,000
What does she do?

376
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,400
It stores it... just in case.

377
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,200
- Where is she the money?
- A brown box...

378
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
Benjie, you're disgusting!

379
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,400
I offer daily specials when I get the shits...

380
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,000
- Liquidation of stock.
- Everything must go.

381
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
One of...

382
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,800
Who is this?

383
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,100
- Starla Gent. Chanteuse country.
- Elle a gagné The Voice?

384
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:35,000
She made second. It's a fucking bitch.

385
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,200
And a great actress!

386
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,300
Javitz gave him your role.

387
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:41,900
Ta gueule!

388
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,200
I wonder if Blake Shelton pissed in the ass.

389
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,100
To Sam, elle you plait?

390
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,200
You can kiss it, you know.

391
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:55,800
She wants to play in your film. And she has good Vicodin.

392
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
It's been almost 90 days.

393
00:23:57,941 --> 00:23:59,800
- What?
- That I'm sober, asshole.

394
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
My God, what a stench!

395
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,700
This bitch the TV was in the toilet.

396
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
What's her name?

397
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,400
As if a corpse had farted.

398
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's not Sterl Carruth?

399
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Oui, avec Havana Segrand.

400
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,000
We have the same agent.

401
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
How old is she?

402
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:23,400
Totally menopause.

403
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,500
Beyond.

404
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Almost dead. Older than my grandmother.

405
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,000
No, it's a GMB, Grandmother fuckable.

406
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300
- They fuck together?
- Genre fucking compassion.

407
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,500
As nurses who violate the old to the hospital?

408
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,500
His mother did not die in a fire?

409
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,000
Comme Jack Cassidy.

410
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,300
Who is it?

411
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,000
Swinger deviation. The father of David Cassidy.

412
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,500
- And who is it?
- The brother of Shawn Cassidy.

413
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,600
You know that his mother was a very cool actress.

414
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,300
Clarice Taggart?

415
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,100
A & E did a documentary on it. It was very cool.

416
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,600
She was young.

417
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,300
What's this?

418
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Hi, Damien, what's happening?

419
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Yes, I know.

420
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,100
I am ready to wear two earrings.

421
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,900
Master

422
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm with my kids and I tell them a story.

423
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:38,100
Can I call you?

424
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,500
Yes, I remember you. Right away.

425
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Cite mon nom quand tu parles.

426
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,800
You're so crazy.

427
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
Suck me and say something about you.

428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Je t'aime discussion.

429
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,100
You were a little girl so pretty... But you were lying.

430
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:14,500
How could you become this monster who lies?

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,600
What's going on?

432
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,700
Explain to me.

433
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm sorry...

434
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I was not comfortable.

435
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm not terrible, as dyke.

436
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,500
You should take a Klonopin.

437
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
I know a man

438
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:06,600
who lives by the sword of Damocles we call AIDS.

439
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,500
"When my time comes," me-he said,

440
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,200
"I'll be ready.

441
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,900
"My bags are packed, the threshold of the door."

442
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,500
I love it.

443
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,200
I really like.

444
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
There is a moment in our lives and our therapy

445
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:25,800
when our eyes linger on luggage near the door.

446
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,400
After crying.

447
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,100
After suffering.

448
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:32,200
After dried up fountains of memory

449
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:35,600
and bloodied our hands on the remains of our parents.

450
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,100
I thought Garry Marshall would be there,

451
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,600
it was a meeting, not a hearing.

452
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:43,800
They gave me the wrong route. I had to walk two terminals.

453
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,300
Upon arrival, I stank.

454
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:48,600
And the casting director did not even calculates me.

455
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:51,300
She passes me by without saying hello.

456
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
And she told me that Garry perhaps even expected me.

457
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,100
This is Garry Marshall, not Bertolucci. His films are not even more money.

458
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,600
And I know Garry well.

459
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,800
She said they will shoot me.

460
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:05,900
And me. "Sorry, but I need makeup"

461
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:08,200
And she said: "Well, you do it or not?"

462
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:09,600
Like this!

463
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,900
And I can not go, Jacob!

464
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,800
I'm so tired and it's so pathetic...

465
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
This is Carrie?

466
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,400
In addition, Jacob more.

467
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
Salut, Carrie!

468
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,100
How are you?

469
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,700
When I get back in touch with myself, I'll tell you.

470
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,200
It was crazy.

471
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Tu as fini le tournage?

472
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,700
We return to Prague tomorrow to redo some scenes.

473
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:37,100
You make the Javitz?

474
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:39,600
I hope. Did you hear something?

475
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:41,700
Genie told me that you have prepared yourself.

476
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:45,400
It would be so great that you play your own mother.

477
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,500
Every girl should be so lucky, right?

478
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
You know Damien?

479
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
We just had dinner together in Tangier.

480
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,900
If you see him, tell him to get involved.

481
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,100
Genie m'a parlé of Adagio.

482
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,000
- You've had a long time?
- Three years.

483
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
Still Looking an assistant?

484
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,600
Yes. You became my agency hiring.

485
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,000
Do me a favour.

486
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,400
Ça va sembler this bizarre,

487
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:15,800
but I want you to see a girl he met on the Internet.

488
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,100
I'm so nervous.

489
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,800
It's okay. Want some tea?

490
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,300
Thank you. Yes.

491
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,100
Your home is so beautiful.

492
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,000
The walls are so thick and the wind organ...

493
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,300
They come from a monastery in Dharamsala.

494
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,400
I met the Dalai Lama, this is a very cool guy.

495
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,300
He laughs a lot.

496
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,900
It's like a guy with whom you would want to hang out,

497
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:49,800
but it's impossible because it is the Dalai Lama.

498
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Thank you for tea.

499
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,100
Maria is in the hospital. My housekeeper.

500
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,400
One of his daughters is sick. It must have 40 kids.

501
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,500
So you know why you're here.

502
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,600
Thanks to Carrie.

503
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
You have known about the Net?

504
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,100
She was looking for someone on Twitter, for a novel.

505
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,200
About a girl who had been burned.

506
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:17,900
I answered and it was seen at a Star Wars convention.

507
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
It must have been strange for you.

508
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,100
She is so great and so funny.

509
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:28,800
We're a little crazy, we each finished the other's sentences.

510
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,500
You came to see her?

511
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,600
I just wanted to see Hollywood.

512
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,700
She invited me to the Four Seasons for breakfast incl.

513
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,900
Il y avait Zooey Deschanel.

514
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:42,800
And Sally Draper, the girl from Mad Men. It was awesome.

515
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
You have a family?

516
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,300
Florida. That's where I'm from.

517
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,800
Agatha...

518
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,700
We can talk about burns?

519
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I worked in a planetarium.

520
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
I was 12.

521
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,200
There was a short-circuit

522
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:08,000
and I remained inside...

523
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,600
like a bitch.

524
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not a glamorous job.

525
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,600
I've never known glamor.

526
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,300
Basically, the job would be

527
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,500
to shop and arrange the small stuff.

528
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,400
Miss Segrand, I'll be the most loyal, most skilled

529
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:33,500
and the best imaginable personal assistant.

530
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,100
You have a car?

531
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
You know how to drive?

532
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,300
I have a license in Florida.

533
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,400
I can rent a car. Genre...

534
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,100
une Mustang?

535
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
Carrie est marrante.

536
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
She knew we had to be.

537
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,000
You know how my mother died?

538
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,400
In a fire.

539
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I think you're beautiful.

540
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,100
And you know who you look like?

541
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Inside?

542
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
Havana Segrand.

543
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,000
- There is a race.
- What is it?

544
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,600
Un tour d'Hollywood. Appel cash. Holly Crest Hotel.

545
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,100
On my school notebooks On my desk and trees

546
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:07,800
On the sands of snow I write your name

547
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,600
On any given flesh On the front of my friends

548
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,700
On each outstretched hand I write your name

549
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,000
Freedom

550
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,500
You have survived a fire?

551
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
I never knew what had happened.

552
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,200
I think I was drunk and I fell asleep.

553
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,900
What will you do in Hollywood?

554
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,100
Your money will fly away if you ride in a limo...

555
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:41,400
In fact, I have a job.

556
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Ah oui? Où?

557
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
You connais Havana Segrand?

558
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,800
Reputation, yes.

559
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,300
I am his personal assistant.

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
Carrie Fisher is the connection?

561
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Eh bien oui...

562
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,300
Havana lent me a car.

563
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,500
You want to have dinner together?

564
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Pas ce week-end.

565
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,700
Is dois...

566
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,800
scénar my work.

567
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:16,200
I have a great movie idea. One could write a whole.

568
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,300
The theme of incest. But it's a bit overrated.

569
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:21,200
Sexual abuse: the new religion!

570
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:24,800
In fact, my parents were brother and sister? It's a secret.

571
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
It could be like that... confession.

572
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,500
Sounds a bit jaded, but also indie film.

573
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:34,300
I would like to play. With you, if you want.

574
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,200
It would be pretentious

575
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,000
if we keep the mythological side.

576
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,600
Écoute, Agatha...

577
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,500
I think you're crazy.

578
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
Yes. So what?

579
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,900
I mean...

580
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
What I'm saying is...

581
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,800
I already dating someone.

582
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
I wish you success.

583
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,100
I do not want your money.

584
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Kiss my ass.

585
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,000
It was like a dream, but damn, it seemed so real!

586
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Continue.

587
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,700
A daughter, whom I had met in the hospital.

588
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:57,300
He was sent to an iPad, but they said she was dead.

589
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
She came in my room at home.

590
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
It was fucking me quite a fright.

591
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,000
I may be dreaming.

592
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,900
Do I get mad?

593
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Do not.

594
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,900
The time has come to confront you with some things.

595
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Ma s?ur?

596
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Yes.

597
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,900
She always wanted to get married.

598
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,800
It was his play.

599
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,900
It was the ceremony.

600
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,000
It's strange, is not it?

601
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,500
You think I'm crazy, like it?

602
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,900
Do not.

603
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
More...

604
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,700
must be able to resist.

605
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,200
Mom and Dad had gone to a party.

606
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,900
I must have been six or seven years.

607
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,200
That night, when everything happened,

608
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,900
we did the wedding ceremony.

609
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,000
She gave me the so-called vitamins.

610
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,000
And I woke up in the hospital, I had a stomach wash.

611
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,200
Firefighters had taken me and I've never reviewed.

612
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
You asked your parents?

613
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,600
They never talk about it.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
This daughter of the hospital...

615
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,300
Harriet, what should I do?

616
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,200
What should I do if it comes back?

617
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,800
You call me.

618
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,700
I'm afraid when I see it.

619
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:02,200
It looks real. I do not want to be hospitalized.

620
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,500
My career is already pretty crappy.

621
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,400
You have experienced trials as a child.

622
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Do I have a split personality?

623
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,500
I do not see it.

624
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,100
What does she want me, bitch?

625
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,700
When you went out of your hiding and you have expressed your fear,

626
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,700
Mom did not appreciate.

627
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:24,200
But what may be called, there is treatment.

628
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:27,300
She wants me to fail. I will not yield.

629
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,000
This is my little Vana.

630
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Rends-lui hommage.

631
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,500
The "divinity of Imago" as Jung called.

632
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,300
For us, it is the "magical child".

633
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,500
And that child will not fail.

634
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Lie down.

635
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,900
I hired a girl.

636
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,300
This is crazy.

637
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,200
Why is it crazy?

638
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,300
It is disfigured.

639
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,900
Following a fire, it has serious burns on his face.

640
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Where does it come from?

641
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,700
The Floride.

642
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
This is crazy.

643
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,100
She showed up at my door.

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,600
I feel that in this engaging, I found myself.

645
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,800
People do not come into our lives by chance. We are convened.

646
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Two women associated with fire.

647
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,800
I bet those visions will disappear.

648
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,800
You really think so?

649
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,900
You welcome mom home.

650
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,200
You dis him: "Maman,

651
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,500
"Between, you do not scare me.

652
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,000
"I'm invested.

653
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,200
"The soup is served.

654
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,200
"This is my home, Mom.

655
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:44,400
"I built upon my affliction and my hopes.

656
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,900
"And you can not hurt me.

657
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,300
"I am a magic child. So between.

658
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,400
"My home is your home."

659
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,100
Now take a deep breath.

660
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,700
Breathe!

661
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
And if she comes here?

662
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
She will not come.

663
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,800
What is she doing here?

664
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
Tourism, perhaps.

665
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,000
It's not funny.

666
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,800
We have always responded differently, you and me.

667
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,500
It needs to get fired.

668
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Then what?

669
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,100
If it works for Havana, we know where she is.

670
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,300
And it saves time.

671
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,100
And if she saw Benjie?

672
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
It's the tabloids that worry me.

673
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,000
I have my class do.

674
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,600
On my school notebooks

675
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,800
On my desk and trees

676
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,600
Snow on the sand

677
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:39,700
I write your name

678
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,400
On any given flesh On the front of my friends

679
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,700
Son?

680
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,300
One second.

681
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,400
Between.

682
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,900
I saw the light.

683
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,000
I can not sleep.

684
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,100
Me neither.

685
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Tu lisais?

686
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,300
A little, scénar.

687
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,800
It's hard, without a partner.

688
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,400
Mom gives me the answer.

689
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,600
But I like to know the replicas first.

690
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
That's what makes you a pro.

691
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,100
I would like to talk to you.

692
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,800
I take nothing.

693
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,700
Not even Seroquel. I have a good sponsor.

694
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:38,500
It is clean and sober for twenty years.

695
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,900
Il a eu Robert Downey Jr, Demi Lovato...

696
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:42,900
Do not.

697
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,800
Is your? s heart.

698
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
She may be back...

699
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,600
à Los Angeles.

700
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,300
She called?

701
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,900
Not yet.

702
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,100
I thought she was in jail.

703
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:08,500
At the hospital...

704
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,600
far from here.

705
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,400
But it is free, white

706
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,200
and 18 years old. We had to release it.

707
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,200
I negotiate a removal...

708
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,300
An expulsion?

709
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,400
Too bad you did not get a hast at birth.

710
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,000
You have brought a judge to motherhood.

711
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,900
Did you may have tried.

712
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,900
We tried lots of things.

713
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,400
We mostly tried to do our best.

714
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,800
It's in your book.

715
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,100
It's your big thing.

716
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,200
"Do your best."

717
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,200
It's supposed to be positive.

718
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
I do not know anything about this girl.

719
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
If I ever knew who she was...

720
00:43:58,441 --> 00:44:00,400
I do not know if it is unsafe.

721
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,600
I knew this day would come.

722
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,500
I thought she would be low profile.

723
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,400
It was stupid.

724
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,800
But I want you to tell me if she tries to see you.

725
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,900
I'll tell you, if she goes.

726
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,200
We like to share, remember...

727
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,500
Some sleep, son.

728
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,800
And by the power of a word I start my life

729
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,700
I was born to know you

730
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,300
To name you

731
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,500
Freedom

732
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Havana, ma chérie...

733
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,600
I do not know if you read it,

734
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,700
but they announce that Damien chose Azita.

735
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,000
This is hardly a surprise, but...

736
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,900
I am furious about the method used.

737
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,000
It makes me lose face.

738
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,400
But that's my problem, not yours.

739
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,500
I'm so sorry, darling.

740
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,100
Damien called me.

741
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,800
It's hard to say this on your answering machine...

742
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:30,900
I do not want you may learn by the other.

743
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,500
I think you have nothing to regret.

744
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,100
And I always thought.

745
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,100
I know that was important to you.

746
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:46,900
But we need you to put it behind you.

747
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:49,200
Then, forward!

748
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,400
I send you six scenarios.

749
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:56,700
There are plenty of awesome projects on the horizon.

750
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
Remind me when thou dost.

751
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:00,600
I embrace you.

752
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,900
The year will be tremendous!

753
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,300
I made a hole so we can see everything.

754
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,300
View all?

755
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,700
Money back guarantee.

756
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,700
I want to see her back zin.

757
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,200
Cut!

758
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,800
Mr zin will harvest all the laughs.

759
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:02,800
It only appears in four scenes.

760
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:05,400
And he steals all! Little shit.

761
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,800
Appeals Genie.

762
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:10,700
I want it to turn this little shit.

763
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,100
What are you doing here?

764
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,300
I wanted to talk to you. It can wait.

765
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,100
Encore et sa le studio parano the drogue?

766
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,100
Do not. Study the Ni ni sa parry.

767
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:28,700
On t'attend, Benjie!

768
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,800
Fuck you put it!

769
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,000
I want to eat.

770
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:38,200
My blood sugar drops when I turn back with zin shit.

771
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,700
You can put a burrito in the microwave? Just two minutes.

772
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Ça va?

773
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,400
Very well.

774
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,400
I thought you worked your scenario.

775
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,000
I would. I have bills to pay.

776
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,600
Comment va le show-biz?

777
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Ça va.

778
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,600
I got a call to Blue Matrix.

779
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
Tu regardes?

780
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,700
I do not like soaps SF.

781
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,800
C'est genre Battlestar Galactica,

782
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:35,200
more post-11-Septembre.

783
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,600
I do not believe it! I spent 18,000 dollars. Let's go!

784
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,400
Havana is Jerome.

785
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:42,400
Health.

786
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,100
It is a driver.

787
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,800
Brilliant.

788
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,000
He comes to audition for Battlestar Galactica.

789
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,800
In fact, Blue Matrix.

790
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,300
I am one of your fans.

791
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,000
Thank you.

792
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,300
Good luck!

793
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,100
My God!

794
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
Azita!

795
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,800
Sydney told me you were here.

796
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,100
I was going to call you. Congratulations!

797
00:49:19,141 --> 00:49:21,200
Thank you. It excites me.

798
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,600
You'll be sublime.

799
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,600
And you'll love work with Damien.

800
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:27,300
It's so awesome.

801
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,300
I feel so good. And your mother was exceptional.

802
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:34,400
It'll be a fun challenge for me.

803
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,300
It will not be an imitation.

804
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,400
You know who will play mother?

805
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
Mom.

806
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,200
Hathaway.

807
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,000
How are you?

808
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,400
You adorerais Anne.

809
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:49,300
You know her? She's great.

810
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,100
Get on your character.

811
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,900
For a split second...

812
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,200
I thought accepting the role. Crazy, right?

813
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:58,700
You aura du...

814
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:00,800
I was at the "therapy at all costs."

815
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
As cute!

816
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,100
Your name is...?

817
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
This is Micah. Say hello to Havana.

818
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,700
Micah... tu es trop chou.

819
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,600
This is my timid.

820
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,500
It will break the hearts? c.

821
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,300
- Glad to have seen you.
- Me too.

822
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
In 10 minutes?

823
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,600
Merci, A.

824
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,300
Been output.

825
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,300
I love your new slave.

826
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,600
It's a horrible sentence, right?

827
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,600
You have a lot in common.

828
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:23,000
This horrible type first.

829
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,000
"I'm invested, Mom.

830
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,800
"The soup is served.

831
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,400
"I am a magic child. So between.

832
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,200
"My home is your home."

833
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:36,000
What do you want?

834
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
This bravado...

835
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:41,100
It's silly. Sorry.

836
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,000
It is only...

837
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,700
I feel nervous about your touch.

838
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,500
It's funny, but I have lost the habit of people.

839
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,300
I do not want to hear that.

840
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,600
These "incidents" of which you speak in talk shows,

841
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,500
these are false memories.

842
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,300
Liar!

843
00:51:57,341 --> 00:51:58,700
Since the first day.

844
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,300
It's your stepfather who brought you these things. I should have seen it.

845
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,400
His first wife had told me he was like that.

846
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,200
You had to blame me for not having you protected.

847
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,200
Do not approach me.

848
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
You want it for that night.

849
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,100
"This is my home, Mom.

850
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,800
"I built on my pain and my hopes

851
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,600
"And you can not hurt me."

852
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,100
"Sorry.

853
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,400
"I was not comfortable.

854
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,300
"I'm not terrible, as dyke."

855
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
Are you okay?

856
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,100
I have the flu.

857
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,300
I need cigarettes.

858
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,200
American Spirit.

859
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
Go get me some medicine.

860
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:21,200
Ambien, Vicodin, Xanax,

861
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:24,000
Zoloft... and Astragalus

862
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,700
and goldenseal.

863
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,100
Et du thé Yogi.

864
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,100
Agatha...

865
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,700
You know Stafford Weiss? The therapist?

866
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,000
Do not.

867
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,400
Of course not.

868
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,800
Why? I repeat what I said a fucking corpse.

869
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,300
I need Tampax.

870
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,700
Et du Cozy Shack.

871
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,600
It is sold in trays, such as tapioca.

872
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,000
A Gate riz.

873
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,800
And truffles of the Maison du Chocolat.

874
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:00,900
You'll find it all at Neiman.

875
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,400
Come into the garden. I have to move some plants.

876
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,900
They are there since the earthquake.

877
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,600
I want to move here.

878
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:22,400
Do not worry about the tiles, we will remake them.

879
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:24,100
They have the heavy air.

880
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,900
Do not make me look like the bad mother. You are strong.

881
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:31,600
You already have gloves. Put all your weight into the effort.

882
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,700
Do it rotate like that. Do it rotate.

883
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,500
The door was open.

884
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
What the hell?

885
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,400
- It's not even past the JT?
- What?

886
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,700
The boy died of Azita Wachtel.

887
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,200
But I just see them!

888
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,500
He was with his father in Ojai and he drowned.

889
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:09,200
My God! But how?

890
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:10,400
In the pool.

891
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,600
She was not there?

892
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,500
I do not know. Nobody yet has the details.

893
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,100
But here's what we'll do. I know, it's horrible.

894
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,200
You could replace it.

895
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,200
But how?

896
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,100
Azita is in the hospital. She lost her head.

897
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,900
Sedated.

898
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,200
- They can run without it.
- It will not resume work.

899
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:34,500
- They turned a lot?
- Just days.

900
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,900
The cast called me three times.

901
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:38,500
Sarah? Thou hast remembered?

902
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,600
Yes. They make an offer.

903
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,900
Damien called?

904
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,300
No, but he must be devastated.

905
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,300
They did not make any offer without the approval of Damien.

906
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:54,400
Azita should. She is expected to resume shooting.

907
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,300
Go to the funeral and resume the movie.

908
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:01,100
I know it's limit, but do you want the part?

909
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,000
I need to talk to Damien.

910
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,400
Bon. But it just happened.

911
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:07,700
I could not reach anyone.

912
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,700
It must be said that if cated, we will win everything.

913
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,600
Unless they have someone else.

914
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,100
I'll call you when I know.

915
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,400
I send flowers?

916
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,900
You're not supposed to know.

917
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:26,900
Keeps flowers for Damien when we sign.

918
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,500
Come on, sing!

919
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,500
That's the little Micah! For the miracle!

920
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,900
About this Micah?

921
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,900
Fire and water. It is fire and him water.

922
00:56:57,941 --> 00:56:59,200
Adieu!

923
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,300
Adieu, Micah!

924
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,900
Water and fire. Say it.

925
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,300
Excuse me.

926
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,800
Looking Jerome Fontana. There is a call for him.

927
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:25,200
It is a Vorbalid?

928
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,400
Try makeup.

929
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,900
What are you doing here?

930
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,500
Havana is in the canteen. I was looking for.

931
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,800
It's supposed to be a burn?

932
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,200
No, it's a birth mark, something like that.

933
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,300
You have 30 minutes. Asks a makeup artist to remake you that.

934
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,800
There was a tarp for the pool,

935
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:16,400
but the engine was being repaired.

936
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,700
He could not swim.

937
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,500
The father heard the phone

938
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,100
and he thought it was Azita. He left a second...

939
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:28,600
It's always the way it happens.

940
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:31,800
I mean, that's what we hear.

941
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
Azita en tu?

942
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,200
Yes, I went to her house.

943
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,000
I told him that you would play the role. It relieved.

944
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,300
Finally, apparently.

945
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,300
I do not feel comfortable...

946
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,100
Go to her house to tell her that! But we're close.

947
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,500
I was going to call you

948
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,000
to speak to you of my decision to take...

949
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,200
Azita, but it was such madness...

950
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,000
I understood, Damien. I have no problem with that.

951
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,900
Moi, si.

952
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,600
I do not like this approach.

953
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,200
I loved your reading.

954
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,600
Tu le sais.

955
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,200
I had reservations about the relationship with your mother.

956
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,500
But the film that I shoot

957
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,900
is so different from the original script.

958
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:33,200
In fact, it looks like there at all.

959
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,600
What is reproached.

960
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:39,300
The script is amazing.

961
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,700
Thank you.

962
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,500
I want you strong paths, despite the circumstances.

963
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Nothing happens by chance.

964
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,800
That's what I think.

965
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,800
I'm glad you're here.

966
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,200
Victoria Rabbit. Star Channel. Are you ready?

967
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,500
The interview was 16 hours.

968
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,800
Genie did you not say?

969
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,300
Can you give us 15 minutes?

970
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,900
But we have been waiting for...

971
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:33,000
Why not talk to my co-star Jim Carrey Jr?

972
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,300
Here it is!

973
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,800
Hey, Mr. turd will zin, you want to be on TV?

974
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
Yeah.

975
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,100
Your ass back here.

976
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,900
Hello. Me is Roy.

977
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,600
Hé, Benjie!

978
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,900
Putain! Tire-toi!

979
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:22,500
All is well. I came to ask forgiveness.

980
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,900
How did you get in?

981
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,800
I work for someone who is shooting here. Havana Segrand.

982
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,700
You want me wrong, Agatha?

983
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,600
I mean you no harm.

984
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,800
Tu es mon petit frère.

985
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,100
If you try, I'll kill you. Do you understand?

986
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,800
Tu as faim? Un burrito?

987
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,300
I leave immediately.

988
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Havana Segrand...

989
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,000
This is not bullshit?

990
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,700
It's really good. We have the same agent.

991
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,400
How thou art come to work for it?

992
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,900
Through a friend. Carrie Fisher.

993
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,900
For a disfigured schizo,

994
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,100
you're doing pretty well here.

995
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,100
They know you're there.

996
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Comment?

997
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,300
Dad knows and sees all, if you forgot.

998
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,200
Watch out, though.

999
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:35,600
The old stuck you a restraining order.

1000
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,000
Do not tell him that you saw me.

1001
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,400
I'm not addicted to "tour page"

1002
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:50,200
so if you are looking a revelation that makes your life...

1003
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:53,300
It's been years that I write.

1004
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,700
To explain.

1005
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,300
Benjie is Jeb Berg.

1006
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I take a nap.

1007
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,900
It is there.

1008
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:13,700
I'm with my nieces Connecticut...

1009
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:17,100
We at Universal. Just leave them in the train!

1010
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,500
You're so mean!

1011
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,300
I kiss later. You want a Cobalt?

1012
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,400
Non. Le sucre me rend folle.

1013
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,400
Very funny!

1014
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,700
So mom and dad sent you in crazy?

1015
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,900
The judges, anyway.

1016
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
You look fit.

1017
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,400
I was in major burns and after my transplant, Florida.

1018
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,600
The homeland of Scarf ace, Tony Montana. Super.

1019
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,000
It was you who brought it?

1020
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,800
It is the mother of Havana.

1021
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,100
It was you who set the fire?

1022
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,600
It's tough.

1023
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,000
No shit... Is that you?

1024
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,700
I did not want to hurt you.

1025
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,900
You know, for them? Who we are? They say?

1026
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:26,400
Pills, vitamins?

1027
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
Probably sleeping pills.

1028
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,700
So you gave me pills and you damn fire to the house?

1029
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,000
I have a little hard to believe that you would not hurt me.

1030
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,300
I was seeing things.

1031
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,700
- Like what?
- Children.

1032
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,500
What were you doing when you saw them?

1033
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,100
I told them:

1034
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,800
"With this ring, you are consecrated to me."

1035
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,900
I remember. It was our game.

1036
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,800
It worked every time.

1037
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,200
I said and they disappeared.

1038
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,400
You should go now.

1039
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,700
Il ya un scénario.

1040
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,100
You are part of a beautiful mythological scenario.

1041
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,100
Oh, mon Dieu!

1042
01:05:22,141 --> 01:05:25,800
Ma s?ur psychopathe va me pitcher un scénario!

1043
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,800
Agatha, va-t'en.

1044
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,600
And rebuke this DVD.

1045
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,000
Do not worry, I'm not a pyromaniac.

1046
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,400
They cut the pilot.

1047
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,400
Your program works, Milton.

1048
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,000
No fighting in bed

1049
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:54,500
The bed is for sleeping, making love,

1050
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:56,200
but not to compete.

1051
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,600
Thank you.

1052
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,000
On it you can mardi.

1053
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,500
Is she here?

1054
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,700
Salut, Agatha.

1055
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,900
My books. Thou hast read?

1056
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:42,700
Yes.

1057
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,500
Secrets kill.

1058
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,800
A classic.

1059
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,800
How did you find me?

1060
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,000
No examination, please.

1061
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,100
- Benjie...
- Told me where you been?

1062
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,200
How would he know? You went to see Benjie?

1063
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,300
What a bad idea!

1064
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,500
It was dangerous.

1065
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,500
But the question remains:

1066
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,400
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

1067
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,800
I am recovering.

1068
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,900
I wanted to make amends.

1069
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Nobody escapes the 12 steps...

1070
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,700
Why did not you come?

1071
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,500
It is a matter of victim.

1072
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,600
Like: "I never promised you a rose garden."

1073
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,800
You know why.

1074
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,900
I do not reward a murderous behavior.

1075
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,700
I have changed.

1076
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,500
I wanted to tell you how...

1077
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,100
I'm sorry for what I did.

1078
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:46,900
I wanted to tell you both. I wrote.

1079
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,000
Apology accepted.

1080
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,400
You need money?

1081
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,700
No, I have a job.

1082
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,800
I work for Segrand Havana. She told me about you.

1083
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,000
Want. Here 10,000 dollars.

1084
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:03,900
I want you to take a plane.

1085
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:05,500
Our lives are rich.

1086
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:08,100
We have built on your ashes.

1087
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,900
Resigns in Segrand.

1088
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,700
Pope.

1089
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,800
It t'en Prie.

1090
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,200
Do not even try to see Benjie or Cristina. Do you understand?

1091
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,900
You did not think I'd let you ref outre my life away?

1092
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,600
Take your skin cream,

1093
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,000
your meds and your bags cardboard and put them by the door.

1094
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,700
And working your program.

1095
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,900
Bon.

1096
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,200
It's over, Benjie. At Friday.

1097
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,700
D'accord. Merci, Rusty.

1098
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,400
What are you doing here?

1099
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
What are you doing in my pool?

1100
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,300
Who are you?

1101
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,400
Micah.

1102
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,900
It's a little drowned.

1103
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,800
I do not want to see.

1104
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,700
I will not do anything.

1105
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,400
His father thought he could keep him from drowning.

1106
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,900
Fathers think like that.

1107
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:42,600
I will do nothing.

1108
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,200
Go play with someone else.

1109
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,700
I'm alive, asshole.

1110
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,000
I'm alive and I'm not crazy.

1111
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,900
I know a man

1112
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:11,100
who lives by the sword of Damocles we call AIDS.

1113
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,100
"When my time comes," me-he said,

1114
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,900
"I'll be ready.

1115
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,700
"My bags are packed, the threshold of the door."

1116
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I love it. I really like.

1117
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,600
Freedom.

1118
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,400
Say: "You have to stop."

1119
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,000
"You're a woman. I want to help you."

1120
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,100
"You do not think I started these fires, is not it?"

1121
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:07,900
Say: "It was not your intention you need help, that's all. ".

1122
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,400
Will not you help me?

1123
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,300
Do not remove my socks.

1124
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:24,600
I have scars on my legs, stomach and back.

1125
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,600
On my school notebooks

1126
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:39,900
On my desk and trees

1127
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:42,800
On the sands of snow I write your name

1128
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,200
On any given flesh On the front of my friends

1129
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:49,200
On any outstretched hand I write your name

1130
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,400
Your mother, of course, was Clarice Taggart,

1131
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:25,700
the wonderful actress

1132
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:28,200
died in a fire in the 70s.

1133
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:29,300
Christmas 76.

1134
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,700
You talked about his addiction

1135
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,600
and revealed, with great courage, I must say,

1136
01:13:36,641 --> 01:13:39,300
she had abused you physically.

1137
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:40,700
And sexually, yes.

1138
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:44,700
What is rare. Usually, it is the father or stepfather.

1139
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:46,700
And we'll talk about, but first,

1140
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,900
I have a burning question:

1141
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,800
What's it like

1142
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:57,300
the tourner dans le remake the Stolen Waters,

1143
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,200
and play precisely the role of your mother?

1144
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,900
It's scary.

1145
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,500
It is all that will become his mother said,

1146
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,800
but there is a bit extreme.

1147
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,600
She was even named...

1148
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:14,000
For an Oscar, yes. But she had only a Golden Globe.

1149
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:16,900
I feel both

1150
01:14:16,941 --> 01:14:18,500
as possible.

1151
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:21,800
And we are fortunate to have Damien Javitz.

1152
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:23,900
Agatha, can you come here?

1153
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,400
Who did rather strange films. Really strange.

1154
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,500
Do not be shy. Vicodin totally constipated me.

1155
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:39,100
I want you to go get me a laxative: Happy Moment.

1156
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,700
They should call Unhappy Moment.

1157
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,900
I'm going to need you tonight. Maria is taken.

1158
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:50,200
One of his 1000 brats has nabbed cholera...

1159
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,000
What should I do?

1160
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,400
Stuff in the kitchen.

1161
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,700
Fill glasses. Maybe use a little table.

1162
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,000
It will amuse you. Lots of interesting people.

1163
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,800
Ça served you.

1164
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,200
Fuck! It will take me an enema.

1165
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,600
Wait a minute.

1166
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:11,100
I wanted to ask you a question.

1167
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,700
You see men?

1168
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,500
Sometimes.

1169
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,200
You see somebody right now?

1170
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,700
I see that yes!

1171
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,600
Just a little.

1172
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,300
What does he do?

1173
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,800
He is an actor.

1174
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:33,600
These are the worst! Must play their mirror every morning.

1175
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:36,000
Not mine.

1176
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,400
He is also a screenwriter.

1177
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,500
You are very attractive. No false modesty.

1178
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,200
You kiss?

1179
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,300
You can tell me!

1180
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,500
How far did you go?

1181
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,700
Just about everything.

1182
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:54,100
Tu as des orgasm?

1183
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,700
Go for it!

1184
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,200
It is server?

1185
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,500
He drives a limousine. You saw him.

1186
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,600
He's cute.

1187
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,700
Drivers are tombeurs.

1188
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,800
I need yoghurt and cigarettes.

1189
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:16,300
And called the plumber. The water is cold.

1190
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,700
Bordel, ça pue ici!

1191
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,300
Hey, pilot fish.

1192
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:33,400
- You go out late for a schoolboy.
- Two days off.

1193
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:35,100
Prends un Shirley Temple.

1194
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,200
You're kidding, I hope.

1195
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,000
Do not call me Shirley.

1196
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Benjie White, Gretchen Voss.

1197
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,800
Want to have fun. Do you have something?

1198
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:48,700
- Producers emmerdent you?
- They try.

1199
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,800
But one thing at a time.

1200
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,300
You surely... Kayla?

1201
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Her bum.

1202
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,400
It's already done. After the union sold him my shit.

1203
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,200
- She has had his song.
- She was where?

1204
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,000
- It's a long story.
- Long and hard.

1205
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
To Sam?

1206
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,200
We'll soon find out,

1207
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,000
at least I hope so.

1208
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,100
She had a crush on you and you've thrown.

1209
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,200
Mais non.

1210
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,200
I know you have the cam.

1211
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,200
I do not want to lose your sobriety you.

1212
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,100
You're going to turn the result of Babysitters?

1213
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,200
Yes, they made me an offer I could not refuse mother.

1214
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,100
It made so much money!

1215
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,700
Je t'ai vue dans Thrill Kill. Cool.

1216
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,900
A horror comedy. Critics have understood.

1217
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,900
If you want, I have some GHB. It smashes.

1218
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,100
Je t'aime, toi.

1219
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,600
Well, Sam is on the way. Contract fulfilled.

1220
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,400
The Terminator.

1221
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,700
In yours.

1222
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,300
I bought it on eBay.

1223
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:12,000
It seems he has served at Columbine massacre.

1224
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,900
It is loaded, man.

1225
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,100
Je vais le redirected.

1226
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,300
Not kidding.

1227
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,700
Benji!

1228
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,300
He is sick.

1229
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,500
If America knew!

1230
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,000
Rhett, the joke ends. The clodhopper.

1231
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,300
It does an hour it started.

1232
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,400
The clodhopper told the yuppie...

1233
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,500
- What's a yuppie?
- Are you serious?

1234
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:46,800
I know what it is. But not what it means.

1235
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:49,100
The clodhopper say yuppie:

1236
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,700
"I know a place to go,

1237
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:54,600
"on y danse, on s'y bat, on y boit,

1238
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:56,400
"et on y baise!"

1239
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,000
This joke is safe sex?

1240
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,000
On s'en branle. On monte à cru.

1241
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,200
Come on, give it to me.

1242
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,200
I asked if that joke was guaranteed safe sex.

1243
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,400
I hope not.

1244
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,500
Then I'll kill you.

1245
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,700
It starts to do well.

1246
01:19:13,741 --> 01:19:14,700
Le yuppie dit:

1247
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,800
"Great. Is there going to be other people?"

1248
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,400
Then the clodhopper said

1249
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,600
"No. Who else? Just you and me."

1250
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,600
Fucker!

1251
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,000
Tu I'as tué!

1252
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,600
- Damn!
- It is crazy.

1253
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,900
- Get out!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1254
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,200
I removed all the bullets.

1255
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,400
You killed my dog. Fucking stupid.

1256
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:51,800
I enculé of barje,

1257
01:19:51,841 --> 01:19:54,100
tu as tué mon chien. Barre-toi!

1258
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,600
I come in?

1259
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,000
Bad idea.

1260
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,800
I did not stay long.

1261
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,500
I wanted to make amends.

1262
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,700
I saw this house in magazines.

1263
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,500
In Architectural Digest. With the profile of dad.

1264
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,300
I feel a bit exhibited,

1265
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,200
but Stafford likes to personalize everything,

1266
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,700
so that we know how and where we live.

1267
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,300
You want something?

1268
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,300
No, Merci.

1269
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,100
Theoretically, I stopped.

1270
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,900
I thought you'd come earlier.

1271
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,400
It'll be seven years.

1272
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,500
That's how long it took me to do my makeup.

1273
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,400
Agatha, I did not go to see you...

1274
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,600
I would have done the same.

1275
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,700
I was scared.

1276
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,800
Because of what you did.

1277
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:35,200
Explains nothing.

1278
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,600
I dreamed so much of the old house.

1279
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,400
This is the first place I visited on my return.

1280
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,900
- Nobody does nothing built.
- The land is ours forever.

1281
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:50,200
I redo the same dream for ages.

1282
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,200
Benjie and I were married there,

1283
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:57,100
under a white canopy. I realized when I knew for you and Dad.

1284
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,400
You were in Europe.

1285
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,100
I found the key to the safe. All photos.

1286
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,300
We did not know we were brother and sister?

1287
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,400
They had been separated since childhood.

1288
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,600
It was a monstrous thing.

1289
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,800
We met on campus.

1290
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,400
We did not know.

1291
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,100
We did not know.

1292
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,600
What are you doing here?

1293
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,600
Stafford, it's nothing.

1294
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,000
I told you to leave.

1295
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,400
You do not own to.

1296
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,400
It was a monstrous thing.

1297
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,900
I found your diaries.

1298
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,000
Love is stronger than death.

1299
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,500
Dirty bitch!

1300
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,700
Stop it!

1301
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:07,300
Papa, do not...

1302
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,000
You lie mal INFORMATION.

1303
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,000
You must go.

1304
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,600
Do not hit!

1305
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,500
Do not hit!

1306
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,500
Papa...

1307
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,800
Leave me alone!

1308
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,000
Ma Bague.

1309
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,300
Elle a pris mon alliance.

1310
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,400
Ma Bague!

1311
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,800
Inspection pee. You are caught in the act!

1312
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,900
You know you deserve a scolding sacred.

1313
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What does that mean?

1314
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,800
You know what I mean...

1315
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,800
Will my two zin!

1316
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,700
Who's the star here?

1317
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,000
You can tell me, Roy?

1318
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,800
It's you!

1319
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,400
It is not your enemy.

1320
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,600
You...

1321
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,500
Love is stronger than death.

1322
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,100
Tu es un méchant baby-sitter, Benjamin.

1323
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:10,500
Die!

1324
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,800
You're a naughty babysitter.

1325
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,300
Fuck!

1326
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,700
Holy shit!

1327
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,600
It must be a bit groggy.

1328
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,300
My baby.

1329
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,400
I'm sorry, Mom.

1330
01:26:13,441 --> 01:26:14,700
But why?

1331
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,600
Benjie, why did you do that?

1332
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,300
It was only a little boy.

1333
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,600
I saw the girl...

1334
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,800
That, baby? Agatha?

1335
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,300
Agatha came to see you?

1336
01:26:30,341 --> 01:26:32,600
The little girl. She tricked me.

1337
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,800
What little girl?

1338
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,500
The hospital. One who died

1339
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:40,300
and that I keep seeing.

1340
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,100
My baby...

1341
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,300
He must go home.

1342
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,300
He must leave California.

1343
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,600
Jonas has to speak to the prosecutor.

1344
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,500
He's only 13!

1345
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,600
The violence of the attack is going to play against him, Cristina.

1346
01:27:05,641 --> 01:27:08,300
He has robbed someone with a gun.

1347
01:27:08,341 --> 01:27:10,100
He hurt one boy!

1348
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,100
Justice has become very hard for minors.

1349
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,500
They'll put him in jail?

1350
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,500
They will not put him in jail.

1351
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,900
The kid has nothing.

1352
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,500
God thank you!

1353
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,000
They stopped the series.

1354
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,700
Will there be another casting?

1355
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,300
But it is a very small role.

1356
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,400
Benjie. I speak of the role of Benjie. Everything is over.

1357
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Damn it!

1358
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,500
Now the whole world will know.

1359
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,100
The world will know that we have committed crimes.

1360
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,800
You do not want me to have appealed to you?

1361
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,000
No, I'm happy.

1362
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,500
My God. I feel bad.

1363
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,600
I think I have bronchitis.

1364
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,100
Your voice is more exciting.

1365
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:13,300
Thank you.

1366
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,700
And your love story?

1367
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
It can go. It works.

1368
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,200
That's all you have to say?

1369
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,000
I do not understand.

1370
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,600
Well, that stuff burns...

1371
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,900
This is not a little unhealthy?

1372
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,700
The fuck?

1373
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,400
No. Not really.

1374
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,300
She takes off her gloves?

1375
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,700
Your friends do not find it a bit unhealthy?

1376
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,300
Do your friends know her?

1377
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,700
I started a...

1378
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,000
a script on it.

1379
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,300
It's research.

1380
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,000
While research is at a certain level.

1381
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,400
And I, you would be willing to fuck me for "research"?

1382
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,000
I do not know.

1383
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,600
How would we do?

1384
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,300
You get to see me?

1385
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,400
Look at what I do.

1386
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,800
How we kiss?

1387
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,400
From behind?

1388
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,800
If you want.

1389
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,800
I want it.

1390
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,000
It last long?

1391
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Yes.

1392
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,400
I am more beautiful than she?

1393
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,300
Yes.

1394
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,700
And my skin? Is she is more beautiful?

1395
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,500
Yes.

1396
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,900
And my holes? Are they are better, my holes?

1397
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,900
You want to fuck my holes?

1398
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,400
Yes.

1399
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,600
I must go.

1400
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,400
And please, do not go down. Put yourself behind the wheel.

1401
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,100
What has happened?

1402
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,300
I took the bus.

1403
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,100
And the car?

1404
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,900
It is broken.

1405
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,100
What happened to you yesterday?

1406
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,500
I was sick.

1407
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:39,400
I was sick this week.

1408
01:31:39,441 --> 01:31:43,100
But I get up at 5:00 and I work 14 hours a day.

1409
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:44,200
Tu Vas mal?

1410
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,800
I think I have the flu.

1411
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,000
Tu bizarrement Agis. Et tu es sale.

1412
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,900
Sorry.

1413
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:57,800
And that's too much to ask of sending a text message?

1414
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,500
Sorry.

1415
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:02,400
Stop repeating that!

1416
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,400
You liabilities...

1417
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,500
Maybe it's time to return to Florida.

1418
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,800
Back to Kansas, Dorothy! That's perfect.

1419
01:32:11,841 --> 01:32:13,900
But you could move your ass.

1420
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,500
Because it gives me the creeps.

1421
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,600
Your then. Your then. Your comprends?

1422
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,600
Go home take a bath.

1423
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,800
I'm sorry.

1424
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,300
Oh, mon Dieu!

1425
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,300
But you're bleeding!

1426
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,300
Tu ne mets pas of Tampax?

1427
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:35,500
You are psychotic?

1428
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,100
I'm sorry.

1429
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:39,300
I do not believe it...

1430
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:43,200
My assistant was bleeding on my couch to 12,000 dollars!

1431
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:45,400
Get out of my life

1432
01:32:45,441 --> 01:32:46,900
filthy degenerate!

1433
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:48,100
I'll pay you.

1434
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:49,800
Goes to the kitchen

1435
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,200
look for Perrier and rubs.

1436
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:53,900
Google goes on to the stain.

1437
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:57,500
I picked you in the street. I did not see you paid for it.

1438
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,800
For you to have your period on my couch!

1439
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,000
Do you think Carrie Fisher...

1440
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:06,700
Nicole Kidman ou Halle Berry

1441
01:33:06,741 --> 01:33:08,600
employ dirty critters?

1442
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:10,000
Wacky and misshapen?

1443
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:04,900
Salut, Agatha!

1444
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,200
J'ai was the hosto

1445
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:12,400
and told a carer

1446
01:34:12,441 --> 01:34:14,300
I would give him 10,000 dollars.

1447
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,400
Asshole fan!

1448
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,400
How did you find me?

1449
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,800
You told me work for it.

1450
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,500
And I've been here.

1451
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,000
Où est Havana?

1452
01:34:36,041 --> 01:34:37,700
She went to Canyon Ranch.

1453
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,800
Damien gave him two days of rest.

1454
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,100
I am lost, Agatha.

1455
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,500
I can not go anywhere.

1456
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,100
Benjie, I want you to hear me.

1457
01:34:59,141 --> 01:35:01,600
Everything is over, you know?

1458
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,900
It is that of Cristina.

1459
01:35:04,941 --> 01:35:07,300
Go get that from Dad. Can you?

1460
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:09,300
You can pick her up?

1461
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,900
We'll keep it a secret as much as possible.

1462
01:35:14,941 --> 01:35:17,300
Nothing should spoil my class.

1463
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,900
At worst, I go to Oprah.

1464
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,200
I confess genre Lance Armstrong.

1465
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,200
It could generate a lot of money.

1466
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,800
Monday on GMA it is launched to try.

1467
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,200
Cristina!

1468
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,100
Pope?

1469
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,000
I've never taken much!

1470
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,200
It was so brave of you

1471
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:32,600
back there.

1472
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,600
I just slid her finger.

1473
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,300
As if he wanted me to take.

1474
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,800
We should start...

1475
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,300
I spent thirteen summers. It's not so bad.

1476
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,600
Invalid if wrong.

1477
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,200
With this ring...

1478
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,900
You are devoted to me...

1479
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,600
I am devoted to you...

1480
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,500
As my husband...

1481
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,400
As your husband...

1482
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,500
With this ring...

1483
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,000
You are consecrated to me as my wife...

1484
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:08,900
I am devoted to you as your wife.

1485
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,200
Set me as a seal upon your heart? c.

1486
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,600
You may kiss the bride.

1487
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
On absence without desire

1488
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,600
On the bare loneliness

1489
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,000
On the steps of death I write your name

1490
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,700
Health back

1491
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,400
Risk missing

1492
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,800
On hope without memory I write your name

1493
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,700
And by the power of a word...

1494
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,200
I renew my life...

1495
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,600
I was born to know you, to appoint you...
