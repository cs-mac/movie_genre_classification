00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,417
Sorry, we were cut off.

2
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,208
That's right, Rolling Stones.

3
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,917
You said the Harper Twins
were snowed in.

4
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,500
We can take their place.

5
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,583
My name? Brian. Mr. Jones.

6
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,083
The Stones' manager.

7
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,708
7.30 sound check? Great.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll see you then.

9
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,917

10
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,667

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

24
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,708
Hold him up! Pull him up!

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,833
Brian!
Brian!

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Pull him up, for God's sake!
I'm coming!

27
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,125
Help him up, Frank!
Brian!

28
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,708
Brian!

29
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,500
Brian!

30
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,333
Brian, come on!

31
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,333
Oh, my God, Brian!

32
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,208
Come on, Brian! Brian!

33
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,167
Please help me.

34
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,250
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,500
Brian!

36
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,292
Oh, my God, Brian!

37
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,500
Brian!

38
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,375
Brian!

39
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,500
Studio A.

40
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,917
Is Tom there?

41
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,333
Tom Keylock? He went out.
I'll tell him when he gets-

42
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,417
What?
D Oh-oh-oh-oh d

43
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,792
Brian?
D Whoo d

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,417
Shit. Really?

45
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,833
Mick? Keith?
Come to the phone. It's urgent.

46
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,167
Brian! No!
Someone, please!

47
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,167
<i>This is the BBC World Service.</i>

48

<i>In the early hours of this morning,</i>

49

<i>Mr. Jones' brand of rock 'n' roll,

<i>of the so-called British

60
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,792
Called Tom.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's on his way down here.

62
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,500
Everything will be all right.

63
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,375
Come on, Frank.

64
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,125
What, you're telling me your missus don't
want you doing building work for Brian Jones?

65
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,208
The thing is, Tom,

66
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,667
she'd just like me
to find a job on a site in London.

67
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,667
I mean, we spent
all that fucking time away at Keith's-

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,417
Oi!

69
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,958
Watch the ash on Keith's upholstery.

70
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,333
No, I reckon you should chuck
your bit on the side, mate.

71
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
What's her name?
Joan? Put it in the past.

72
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,875
New job, new horizons.

73
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,208
Anyway, working for Brian's not
the same as working for Keith.

74
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:25,083
You're gonna need a clear head.

75
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,917
I mean, Keith was never there
half the time, was he?

76
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,708
Are you really
The Rolling Stones' manager?

77
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,708
Road manager, love. I don't shove
bits of paper round a desk.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,417
I look after them. My boys.

79
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,000
Will Keith Richards
mind us being in his house?

80
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,542
Now, why would he give me the keys

81
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,833
if he had a problem with me showing a
beautiful woman round his beautiful house?

82
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,917
Frank?

83
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,917
Why don't you take Joan here
on the tour?

84
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:54,458
Yeah, come on. I'll show you the room
I'm building for Keith's guitars, eh?

85
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, you chuck her.

86
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:01,417
I'm elbowing that Janet. Can't understand
half the words she uses, for a start.

87
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,750
Frank tells me you're a nurse.
I like intelligent birds.

88
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,417
Do you want me
to show you Keith's bedroom?

89
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
I thought the others
might have got there first.

90
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,375
Oh, no. Frank wouldn't
do a thing like that.

91
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,250
Trust me, Frank,
there's plenty more fish in the sea.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Actually, I think it's quite nice here.
What with the fire and all that.

93
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,083
Don't you?

94
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,875
You should think of me
as your protector, Janet.

95
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,708
You can always rely on me.

96
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,250
If the missus finds out,
I'll be hung out like a kipper.

97
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,625
But like I said,
new job, new horizons.

98
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,000
Brian wants a lot of work
done on this place.

99
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,917
He only bought it
a couple of months ago.

100
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,500
So the money's
got to be good, then?

101
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,750
You just get your feet
under the table, mate.

102
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,333
D Mm-hm, mm-hm d

103
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,292
d You better come on d

104
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,917
d In my kitchen d

105
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:32,583
d It's going to be raining outdoors dd

106
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,625
Tom, my man!
I forgot you were coming.

107
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,625
Brian, meet a mate of mine.

108
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,292
Frank Thorogood.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
One of the best builders around.

110
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,833
Nice place.
I told you, Frank did Keith's gaff up.

111
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,125
Anyone who's good enough for Keith
is good enough for me.

112
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,792
Oh, I found that camera you lost.
Oh, great.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,125
Don't you two worry about it,
your secret's safe with me.

114
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,125
So, what do you mean, secrets?

115
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:12,083
It stands to reason, don't it? You
two love-birds alone with a camera.

116
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,208
Did your glasses get all steamed up
looking at the pictures, lover?

117
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:18,292
Cool it, Anna. He's just
trying to mess with our minds.

118
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,292
Isn't that right, Tom?

119
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,083
I won't charge for the processing.

120
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,708
Fuck it, Tom! There's other girls
apart from her on that film.

121
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,417
Blimey! Oh, dear!

122
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,292
Well, they all look the same to me,
so maybe she won't notice.

123
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,000
Brian, you lying bastard!
You said you were at the studios.

124
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm going back to London!

125
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,583
You know, maybe you'd do better off
without her around for a bit, eh?

126
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,500
Be a bit of peace and quiet,
knock off a few tunes.

127
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't knock off tunes, Tom.

128
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,875
<i>Parts of it go back
to the Domesday Book, 900 years.</i>

129
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
A.A. Milne owned it for a long time.

130
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:29,250
Christopher Robin,
Winnie-the-Pooh. All written here.

131
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
They ran wild in this garden.

132
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,292
So, what do you want doing, then?

133
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,417
Well, I want some lights in the pool

134
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,875
and some beams in the kitchen
so it matches the rest of the house.

135
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,375
There's tons to be done.

136
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,375
I'm having ideas all the time.

137
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,750
Come on, Heffalump.

138
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,833
Fetch!

139
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,667
And the drainage is up the spout.

140
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,125
Well, I can take a look at that.

141
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,792
Oh, I got drunk one night. They're
not as expensive as you might think.

142
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,292
What sort of budget,
then, for the work?

143
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,292
The office can deal with the details.

144
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,208
So, what did Tom tell you about me?

145
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,083
I bet he said I was paranoid.

146
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:20,792
Right?

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,333
<i>No.</i>

148
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,208
Eh, Tom?

149
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,708
I ain't sure about this.

150
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,917
Course you are. You did it
at Keith's gaff. You know the score.

151
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,708
Patience is the name of the game.

152
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:44,125
You keep Brian happy
and you're in the gravy.

153
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,500
You'll be staying above the garage, weeknights.
Check it out. It's got a bog and everything.

154
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,708
I'll keep the interfering bitch
away for a few days.

155
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,417
Give you time
to settle in with the boys.

156
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,583
<i>Enjoy, my son! Welcome to
The House at Pooh Corner.</i>

157
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,792
<i>Hello, I'm Julian

158
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
<i>Oh, it's Mr. Horne!</i>

159
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,708
<i>Oh, how bona to vada your eke!</i>

160
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,917
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

161
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,708
Brian.

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
Photographer.

163
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,208
Why can't people leave me alone?

164
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,292
What, you want me to get rid of him?

165
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,917
Oi! What do you think
you're doing, eh?

166
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,792
Sling your hook!

167
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,500
You come round here again,
I'll break your neck!

168
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,792
Well, he's gone.
Do you mind if I use your blower?

169
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,708
<i>He was the strangest man.</i>

170
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,292
Joe?

171
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,708
It's Frank.

172
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,708
I need a cab to Chichester.

173
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:37,500
Where am I?
You can't go. I mean, Anna's gone.

174
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,625
Well, I'll need to go over there to get
my boys together for the morning.

175
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,917
Sod them all!
I'm not staying here on my own.

176
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,333
You can cook?

177
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,750
I'll call you back.

178
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,125
Got any eggs?

179
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,292
So you were at Keith's?
Yeah, that's right.

180
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,875
He's a cool guy.

181
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,500
I didn't see that much of him,
to be honest with you.

182
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,500
Always travelling
with that girlfriend of his.

183
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,667
Anita.
Yeah, that's the one.

184
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,083
People think I'm a druggie,
but I'm not anymore.

185
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,500
Now I'm just a boozer.

186
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,125
I've had convictions,
you know, Frank.

187
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:39,375
Yeah, I read about it in the paper.
Yeah.

188
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,708
The lying English press.

189
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,417
They print
the law's version of all that shit.

190
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,792
They even started
trying to plant the dope on me.

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's all behind me now.

192
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,292
Fuck them.

193
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,083
Well, I guess they were
right about one thing.

194
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,292
<i>I was always my own worst enemy.</i>

195
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,583
When your brother gets home, you are to go straight
to your room and do your homework. Is that clear?

196
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,208
Yes, Mum.

197
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,875
And close the door, Barbara.

198
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,917
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

199
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,250
Is it Mary?

200
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,708
Is something wrong?

201
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,000
No, she's a perfectly healthy
14-year-old,

202
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,583
<i>aside from the fact
that she's three months pregnant</i>

203
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,583
<i>and she claims that you're the father.</i>

204
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,000
Brian.

205
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,083
You should be locked away
for this, you bastard!

206
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,500
Couldn't she see a doctor?

207
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,917
I mean, aren't there clinics now?

208
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,917
Oh, you want to become
a murderer, do you?

209
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,583
As well as a molester?

210
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,667
You make me sick.

211
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,958
Look at this filth! This evil filth!

212
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,875
D Every time
I'm walking down the street d

213
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,792
d Some pretty mama
Start breaking down d

214
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,708
d Please stop breaking down dd

215
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:30,083
<i>All I had was my music.
And then I got the guys together.</i>

216
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,625
Which one of you smart alecs
changed the bloody locks?

217
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,917
Now chuck the keys down right now!

218
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,375
You and your hairy friends
owe three months' rent!

219
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,375
They're out.
No, they're not. I can hear them!

220
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,458
Oh, physically they're here
but astrologically speaking-

221
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,583
Don't give me that codswallop!

222
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:48,125
Look, when they stop playing
I'll send them over with the dosh.

223
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,417
You mind you do.

224
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,500
Keep playing, lads.
We could be here till Christmas.

225
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,375
You're gonna be big, big, big.

226
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,417
And forget these perky clubs.

227
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,083
I helped Epstein break the Beatles in
the US and I can do the same for you.

228
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,958
You need a proper producer,
a manager, and I'm your man.

229
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,167
As spokesperson for the band,

230
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:26,792
I can safely say
we don't want to be the Beatles.

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,458
When I brought the guys together,
it was for the blues, man.

232
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,292
Lennon and McCartney
write pop songs.

233
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,208
And so should you,
but red-hot and dangerous.

234
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,208
Lose the suits, burn the house down.

235
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:44,083
Come on, guys. If the Beatles
are Christ, you're the Antichrist.

236
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:02,500
<i>Andrew was right, we did
become big. Everywhere.</i>

237
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:09,292
It's just the U.S. Of A that's
the problem. They won't let me in.

238
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,167
Not that I care. It's them, my band.

239
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,167
Mick's organised
yet another American tour

240
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
and because of the convictions,
the lawyers say I'm a...

241
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,000
liability.

242
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,792
So you're stuck here, then.
Till the suits sort it out.

243
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,875
Meantime, I think
I'll get legally stoned.

244
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,833
Cheers, Frank.
Cheers, Mr. Jones.

245
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,167
Brian.

246
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,792
Hi, Keith. Yeah, listen, I think I've got
something. Let me just play it to you.

247
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,583
Keith's not here right now.
Call back later.

248
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,417
Nita, is that you?

249
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,792
Anita?

250
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,083
Follow me.

251
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,083
Thank you.

252
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,583
I was watching you on-stage.

253
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,292
You were laughing at the riots.

254
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,125
I'm a bad person.

255
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,500
Then I must be too.

256
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,125
I'm Anita.

257
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,583
I'm Brian.

258
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,250
Everybody knows who you are.

259
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,167
You're not unhappy I kidnapped you?

260
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,000
Feel free to kidnap me any time.

261
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:34,792
Mick and Keith might not like it

262
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,208
but I'm going to love it.

263
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,792
Anita?
Hm?

264
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,583
<i>Merci.</i>

265
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,292
<i>Livrer sur le D</i>

266

00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,792
Lysergic acid diethylamide.

268
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,042
LSD.

269
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,000
But should you have it?

270
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,417
See the serpent's tongue?

271
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>Fais attention. Ne lui

272

He thinks you might not like
what you find beyond the door.

273
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:17,250
But I like the gatekeeper.

274
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:36,750

Volker. This is my new friend Brian.

285
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,208
It's exciting that
Anita has agreed to act in my film.

286
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,083
To act?

287
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,875
Of course. I would be honoured if
you would consider writing the music.

288
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,375
In my new film
she performs a murder.

289
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,625
Music to murder to? Interesting.

Frank?

306
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:50,583
I need some female company.
You'll have to drive me up to London.

307
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,792
I can't drive.

308
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,208
Why not? Course you can drive.

309
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,958
I've only got the one eye.

310
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:04,167
Which one is it?
That's for you to find out, isn't it?

311
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,083
Lost it for king and country.

312
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,167
You're no use as a driver.

313
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,292
I'm not a driver.

314
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm a fucking builder.

315
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,375
Brian?

316
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,583
All right. All right, then, cheers.

317
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:37,208
See you tomorrow, yeah?

318
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,292
D Wouldn't it be nice
To get on with me neighbours? D

319
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:33,000
d But they make it very clear
They've got no room for ravers d

320
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,417
d They stop me from grooving
They bang on me wall d

321
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:44,042
d They're doing me crust in
It's no good at all d

322
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:47,583

d Close my eyes and drift away dd

329
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,625
Frank?

330
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,000
What?
Want to take a gander at this?

331
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,917
Coming.

332
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:47,792
Boys.

333
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:52,292
D Can't stop breaking down d

334
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:59,292
Pour your own.
Cheers.

335
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,792
Can you move it over there?

336
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,083
D I can't walk the streets
Consolidate my mind d

337
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,875
d Some no-good woman
Keeps on breaking down d

338
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,292
It's a brick wall.

339
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,000
It just doesn't feel right.

340
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,542
D Please stop breaking down dd

341
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,500
Where over there?

342
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:39,417
D You Saturday-night women
You love to ape and clown d

343
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,917
d You won't do nothing but tear
A good man's reputation down d

344
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,417
d Stop breaking down dd

345
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,125
d The stuff I got'll bust
Your brains out, baby dd

346
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,333
Hi, Brian.
Great!

347
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,792
Fantastic.

348
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,917
Um, tell Frank
it was in the right place before.

349
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,208
Fucking ponce.

350
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,792
Just ignore the ponce.

351
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,417
We can keep this going all summer
and not even break a sweat.

352
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,417
But he flaunts that bird in our faces!

353
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:28,500
Just remember to keep your hands
off, otherwise it'll all be over.

354
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,833
When are we gonna
get paid proper, Frank?

355
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,375
I'm sorting it out.

356
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,708
Yeah. Yeah, all right, Frank.
Look, I'll fix it.

357
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,500
Look, I gotta get some money
to Brian's builders.

358
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,792
Can we talk about this, Tom?

359
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,708
Hello? Can I ask you to hold?

360
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,792
Brian's constantly overspending.

361
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,875
The clothes. The travelling.

362
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,000
Just the lifestyle.

363
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,167
Way above the other four.

364
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,667
And then there's the lawyers' fees,
and it's not just the drug bust.

365
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,833
There are five women all claiming
to be the mothers of his children.

366
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:37,000
The others are gonna have to approve any
more large sums being spent on his house.

367
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,208
Yeah, well, I need cash now.

368
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:44,417
These boys don't get paid, then what
we've spent so far goes down the toilet.

369
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,125
This is the last payment
without approval.

370
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,000
Brian has no incomings.

371
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,083
He's not touring. He's not writing any songs.
He's not even at the recording sessions anymore.

372
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,333
But it's still his band, though, isn't it?
Is it, Tom?

373
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:08,292
Well, he thinks so, mate.
He thinks so.

374
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,375
Boys, boys, this song is great.

375
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:19,375
Just needs a little more work.
Later, man. We're going down the pub.

376
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,917
No, it'll just take half an hour.
We'll see you in the pub, Brian.

377
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,583
See you down there, mate.

378
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,292
I hope you've got some money, then.

379
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,708
I can't do you both
at the same fucking time, can I?

380
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,667
Here we are!
Hey, Tom!

381
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,875
This is nothing,
just the down payment.

382
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,500
So get those down your throats
and this in your pockets.

383
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,417
That's it. Cheers, Tom.

384
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,167
Great.
What you doing?

385
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,917
Tom, I'm the one
who should be paying them.

386
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,500
You're right, Frank.
That's a good point.

387
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,792
Everyone should know their place.

388
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,417
You know, you should've called me
earlier. I'd have come down like a shot.

389
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,708
Pity Brian's not around. Could've had
a word with him about taking the piss.

390
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,750
Yeah, well, we got more done today with
him out of the house than all last week.

391
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,292
What's up here, Tom?

392
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,667
Yeah, you have
a look around, darling.

393
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,292
I thought you was dumping her.

394
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,333
I am. This is it.
You know, the big E.

395
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:38,000
Bring her down here, give her a bit
of excitement, then, "Boof!" Finito.

396
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,292
Well, come on. Tea break's over.

397
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,000
So is Frank taking Brian Jones
for a bit of a ride, then?

398
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,208
What you on about?

399
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:49,583
It's just that that's what Joan said
Frank was doing at Keith Richards'.

400
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:51,792
"Skimming off,"
is that the expression?

401
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,583
No.

402
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:57,375
Frank's as good as gold.
Nah, she's just-

403
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,417
She's just pissed off because he's
giving her the elbow, that's all.

404
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,792
Mm, yes.

405
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,292
A woman scorned
can be a vengeful creature.

406
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,792
Yeah.

407
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,708
Come on.

408
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,708
Who's been sleeping in my bed?

409
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,292
Thank you, Frank.
That's all right.

410
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,000
So are you like Tom,
got these birds on the side?

411
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,917
I got a girl, yeah.
I bet you have, you dirty dog.

412
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,833
What's Tom's woman like?

413
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,583
Janet? Leggy, posh.

414
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,917
Mm, nice. So have you had her?

415
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,667
You must be joking.

416
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,792
Come on, Frank.

417
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,417
Haven't you ever heard of free love?

418
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,292
She's beautiful, isn't she?

419
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,917
Yeah, very.

420
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,583
If you want her, you can have her.

421
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,917
You can.

422
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,208
But Anna only goes with real men,
don't you, honey?

423
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,083
I know.

424
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,792
Why don't you show her your stuff,

425
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,875
some press-ups?

426
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,042
How about starting with 50?

427
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:21,917
You must be able to do 50.
Even I can do 50.

428
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,375
I'm sure she'll show you
some form of appreciation.

429
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,500
Fifty, eh?

430
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:50,083
One, two, three, four,

431
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,708
five, six-

432
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,625
I knew you was having me on.

433
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,583
The next 50 will be harder.

434
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,375
I wonder what she'll do then.

435
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,583
All right.

436
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,125
One, two...

437
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,375
There. Fifty.

438
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:02,292
I'm into brain not brawn.

439
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,375
Come on, let's go up.

440
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:18,292
Come on, Frank!
We're still mates, aren't we?

441
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean, love the beam, man.

442
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:33,083
D Beautiful miracle
Pardon my lyrical rhapsody d

443
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:35,708
d But can't you see d

444
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,667
d You've captured me d

445
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,125
d Being so glamorous d

446
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,417
d Can't you be amorous
Just with me? D

447
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:46,000
d Make it soon d

448
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,958
d Take a look at the moon d

449
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,875
What's it like
at this Brian Jones', then?

450
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,500
All right. Swimming pool and all that.

451
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,250
All right for some.
D -around the cornerd

452
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,625
d When I'm around you d

453
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,000
d Let's go cuddle in a corner d

454
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,208
d Any cosy little corner d

455
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,417
d Love is just around the corner d

456
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,500
d And I'm around you dd

457
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,667
Hello?
Frank, it's me. I need you here.

458
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,208
The cover's blown off the cesspit

459
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,583
and if it keeps on raining,
we're going to be engulfed in poo.

460
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,583
Brian, how did you get my number?
Don't get all paranoid on me, Frank.

461
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,625
Only one of us is allowed to be
paranoid. That's the arrangement.

462
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,292
I'm sorry. Look, just get in a cab
and I'll pay for it. Thank you, Frank.

463
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,042
All right, I'm gonna have a bath.

464
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,708
Anna!
I'm in the bath!

465
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:10,292
Anna? Frank's arrived.

466
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,208
There's no cover on it.
I know.

467
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:22,125
It's only there.

468
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,417
Shall we put it back on?

469
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,292
Thanks, Frank.
Couldn't have done it without you.

470
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,792
Let's go up to the house. Anna can fix
us some grub and a nice stiff drink.

471
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,875
Carrot juice?

472
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,583
Anyone?

473
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,083
Mm?

474
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,667
Morning.

475
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,708
Thanks.
Good party?

476
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,250
Far-out.

477
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:13,208
Missed you last night at the studio.
Had the groove down.

478
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,875
Could've been really something.
Like old times.

479
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,750
Get those guitars weaving again
is what we need.

480
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,583
Are you gonna put down
some tracks today?

481
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,125
Can't right now.

482
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,458
Brian, you can't like them
recording without you.

483
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,625
I'm not exactly in love
with the music we're playing now.

484
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:40,208
Keith can lay down my stuff.

485
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,500
It's really not that difficult.

486
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:47,417
Brian, you've forgotten
I go to Munich today. The film.

487
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,917
Can't you push it back a bit?

488
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,000
I'd like to, but it's a film.

489
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,833
So you could go to the studio.

490
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,583
Don't tell me what to do!

491
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:16,292
I can do whatever I bloody well like!

492
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:30,292
Brian? Brian!

493
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,417
Brian.

494
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,292
Brian!

495
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,875
It's not just his funeral, Keith.

496
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,500
It's ours as well.

497
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,708
Keith, he's right, you know.
It's just another wasted session.

498
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,125
Cat just needs a break, that's all.

499
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,083
Stop!

500
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,875
<i>Und schnitt. Dank e.</i>

501
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:33,667
<i>Sclussklappe.</i>

502
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,333
Okay.

503
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,875
Anita,

504
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,792
<i>jetzt wieder...</i>

505
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,500
<i>Sind Sie fertig, oder?</i>

506
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:49,167
Brian? Where have you been?

507
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:52,000
Volker keeps asking.
You got the rushes, yes?

508
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,792
Yeah. Yeah, don't worry, Anita.

509
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,292
I've been working night and day.

510
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:20,375
<i>Hab immer noch das Drehbuch.</i>

511
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,458
Why are we on holiday

512
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:26,417
if you have to be finished
with the music in two weeks?

513
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,125
I want to be proud you,
Brian, and you just keep-

514
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:33,125
I need more time.

515
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:35,958
What's wrong?
You're a wreck!

516
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:41,417
I'm going home. I'm telling Volker
to get someone else to do the music.

517
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:49,083
Don't leave me.
Get out! Look at yourself!

518
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:51,583
You can't handle the drugs!

519
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,792
We take drugs. We do.
You, me, Keith-

520
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,167
I can handle them, Brian! Keith
can handle them! You, you just-

521
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,625
You just fade away!

522
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,458
You drink too much,
you take too many fucking drugs!

523
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,792
You can't even get it up
without hitting me!

524
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,125
That's what you like.
Not all the time.

525
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,500
You're not leaving.

526
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,792
You're fucking pathetic.

527
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,167
That was wonderful, Brian. Thank you.

528
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:16,375
Jesus.

529
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,708
Frank! Frank!

530
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,250
Sorry, Brian. Didn't I tell you
I was emptying the pool?

531
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,792
Don't worry about that.
It's the sound, Frank.

532
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,708
Watch that step there.
Come on, I'll show you.

533
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,875
I'm just gonna lower it down.

534
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:57,292
Right, Frank, start the tape.

535
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:04,000
Wait, grab this.
Now, why don't you to take this?

536
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,458
Give it a shake.

537
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,125
That's it. Come on, get into it.

538
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,917
Use your hand like this. Like this.

539
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,500
Into the microphone.

540
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,500
Come on! Get into it!

541
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,917
That's it. Feel the music.

542
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,333
Come on, Frank, come on!

543
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:43,792
That's it!

544
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:19,083
All right, lads. Knock off.

545
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,500
Nice one, Frank!
What, 3.30?

546
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,125
You coming to the boozer?
Later maybe.

547
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:41,500
Shit.

548
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,542
Definitely a six, Frank.

549
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,833
What do you think?
Someone's in trouble.

550
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:10,917
You did restock, didn't you?
Course I bloody did.

551
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:15,000
You know, you play quite well
for a bloke with one eye.

552
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:17,458
Have you ever heard of the
blues legend Blind Willie Johnson?

553
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:21,208
No.
He was a very cool guy.

554
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,708
So your partial blindness
makes you partially cool, Frank.

555
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,917
Thank you, Brian.
I'll go and get the booze, eh?

556
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:39,333
What are you doing in my room?

557
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,708
Do you know what'd happen to Brian
if the cops found this here?

558
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:54,167
It's only grass, Frank.

559
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,917
The black bombers are his prescription.
I need to hide them from him.

560
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,917
You don't care about him, do you?

561
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:04,000
Prison would kill that boy.
What are you now, his babysitter?

562
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:08,917
I'll keep these from now on, eh?

563
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:14,583
And this. If I told Brian about this,
he'd chuck you on the spot.

564
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,583
Maybe he'd chuck you, Frank.

565
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,583
He's got you now.

566
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:25,250
You need to keep in with him to get
your bread. I know what you're doing.

567
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,000
I'm not the hanger-on.

568
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,875
Hello?

569
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,500
Mick and Keith?
They want to come down tomorrow?

570
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:44,000
Yeah, Brian will be here.

571
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:47,167
Thank you. Bye.

572
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,917
Do you want to tell him?

573
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:07,208
If Mick and Keith are coming down tomorrow,
I'll get some more booze in, eh, Brian?

574
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,042
I'll leave you to it, then.

575
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:39,083
D Paper sun d

576
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,375
d On the run dd

577
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,375
Loved your movie, Anita.

578
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:31,250
Brian's music was amazing. But I'm
not so sure about my performance.

579
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,500
You were wonderful, darling.

580
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:39,417
What do you see?
Clouds look like big fucking rats.

581
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:43,083
Need their arses blown off.

582
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,708
Somebody give me a gun.

583
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:57,583
We're changing. It's like we're part
of some experiment.

584
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,542
Like something amazing's
going to come from it.

585
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:03,500
I'm going somewhere, that's for sure.

586
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,375
I'm going to hell, Brian.

587
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,917
Race you.

588
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,417
Don't you feel her power?

589
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,167
You want to fuck her!

590
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,000
Oh, shut up!
Man-

591
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,708
Fucking hell, Brian.

592
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:42,500
And you want to fuck him.

593
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:48,083
I know that. I've seen the way
you've been looking at each other.

594
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:51,083
I'm telling you, I don't care.

595
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,375
I honestly don't care.

596
00:54:55,625 --> 00:55:00,375
Brian, this is stupid, man.
Keith! I love you, man.

597
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,583
I want you to have a good time.

598
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:09,000
This is our party.
This is just part of the experiment.

599
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:12,292
We can do whatever we want.

600
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,500
I don't want him, damn it.

601
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,917
If you want to fuck Keith-

602
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,417
What are you doing?

603
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,708
Don't be so bourgeois.

604
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,875
Besides, I'm ordering you.

605
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:48,083
Gysin, where's the dealer?
The Eggman?

606
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,458
In bed, asleep?

607
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:06,708
Gysin, can you get me some coke?

608
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,708
No.

609
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,292
LSD, MDT,

610
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,583
hashish,

611
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,875
psilocybin.

612
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,875
I suppose that'll have to do.

613
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,792
Why don't you go
and look for Anita, Brian?

614
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,417
Anita can take care of herself.

615
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,167
Tom, get the car!

616
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,333
Brian?

617
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:49,167
What's going on?

618
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:52,167
This is just part of the experiment.

619
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:58,333
What are you doing?
You know what I'm doing.

620
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:02,292
I don't want to! I don't want to.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

621
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,792
Get off. Get off!

622
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,417
Aaahh! Please!

623
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,792
You experiment with Keith?
You made me! No!

624
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:18,125
Experiment with me!

625
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:24,333
Stop!

626
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,208
Stop!

627
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,083
Hello?

628
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:45,125
<i>Look, I've been ringing and
fucking ringing. What's going on?</i>

629
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,792
Nothing. It's- It's all coming together.

630
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,083
<i>You want to talk to Brian?
No, I don't want to talk to Brian.</i>

631
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,208
Your missus has been calling my missus.
You've not been home for three weeks.

632
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:57,292
<i>What's happening, Frank?
Nothing!</i>

633
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,583
I just had a lot of work
on my plate, that's all.

634
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,750
Yeah, well, just so you know,

635
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:06,167
I'll be back to take care of things
after everything goes khaki, all right?

636
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,708
He missed a bit.

637
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,500
Where's the arsehole?

638
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,375
Tom?

639
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,792
Get us out of here.
Fuck.

640
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:39,625
She kept fucking him.

641
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,500
I don't know about anything, but
Joan's gonna take you to the airport.

642
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,125
Come on, Anita. Come on, come on.

643
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,583
Come on, Tom!
Just put your foot down.

644
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:09,042
Don't touch the car!

645
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:26,875
What do you mean, we've checked
out? "We" is standing right here!

646
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,500
Where are the others?
Gone.

647
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:32,417
Gone? What, disappeared?

648
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,792
Just like that?

649
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:39,500
Did they leave a message?
No, sir, just this.

650
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,583
What's this?

651
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,542
I'm not paying the fucking bill.

652
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,833
D With your pencil in your hand d

653
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,917
d You see somebody naked d

654
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:57,583
d And you say, "Who is that man?" d

655
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,375
d You try so hard d

656
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,417
d But you don't understand d

657
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:10,125
d Just what you'll say
When you get home d

658
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,500
d 'Cause you know
Something is happening d

659
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:19,292
d But you don't know what it is d

660
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,208
d Do you d

661
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,917
d Mr. Jones? D

662
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:36,083
d Your raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?" d

663
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:42,708
d Somebody points to you
And says, "It's his" d

664
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:47,000
d You say, "What's mine?" d

665
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:50,125
d And somebody else says
"Where what is?" d

666
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:53,458
d And you say, "Oh, my God!
Am I here alone?" d

667
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:56,667
Hi, guys. Great to see you. Come in.

668
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:01,208
D 'Cause you know
Something is happening here d

669
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:05,000
d But you don't know what it is d

670
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:10,125
d Do you, Mr. Jones? Dd

671
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:18,417
So. You fellas don't make it
down here very often.

672
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,542
Looks like a nice one.

673
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,208
Hey.

674
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,625
You got some live Hendrix. Cool.

675
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:30,333
Yeah. He sent one over.

676
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,708
Look, Brian, we've got this tour.

677
01:03:33,917 --> 01:03:38,625
Even if the lawyers can get you into
the States, you're never at the studio.

678
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:41,792
We need a guitarist
who knows the new material.

679
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:43,000
Mm.

680
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:45,917
And we- I mean, you're not...

681
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,000
You're out, cock.

682
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,792
You're fired.

683
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:02,375
What we thought,
what the management figured out,

684
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:09,208
you'll get 100 grand now, and 20
for every year the band keeps going.

685
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,208
Sure.

686
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,875
Come and see us
at the studio, you know?

687
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:22,708
So long, mate.

688
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:34,292
You'll get your act together, man.

689
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:01,125
D I'm gonna tell you
How it's gonna be d

690
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,500
d You're gonna give your love to me d

691
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,417

694
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:21,875
d My love is bigger than a Cadillac d

695
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,792
d I'll try to show it
When you drive me back d

696
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:30,333
d Your love for me
Has got to be real d

697
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,625
d Want you to know just how I feel d

698
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,792
d Love is real, not fade away d

699
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,000

700
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:44,417

701
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,583

702
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:07,375

703
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,792
d Love is love

704
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,417

705
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,875
d Love is love
Don't fade away dd

706
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:38,708
Brian, what happened?
Nita?

707
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:49,583
You've got my pills, haven't you?
Anna told me.

708
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,208
I need one.

709
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:56,667
I don't think you need
anything else, Brian.

710
01:06:56,917 --> 01:07:00,125
Frank, they're my prescription.
I need them.

711
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:03,500
I don't think you need-
I need them.

712
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,583
Do you want any, Frank?
No.

713
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:17,875
Frank?

714
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,417
Come on.

715
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:40,833
Can't you do something, Frank?
What?

716
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,125
He needs your help. I thought
you were supposed to be in control.

717
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:47,792
Now, then, Keylock's here.

718
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,417
Oi, Brian! Oi, oi, oi! Come on.

719
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,875
What are you doing, mate?

720
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,875
Just clearing out the crap.

721
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,792
Yeah, well, you don't want
to destroy this stuff, eh?

722
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,875
It could be worth a fortune.

723
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:18,333
Sure.

724
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,875
When are you getting
your new band set up, eh?

725
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:24,917
You know, there was
a call from Hendrix at the office.

726
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:29,708
He's a cool cat.

727
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,917
We've been talking
about getting it together.

728
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:37,417
He called?
I'll take over.

729
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:40,792
I can handle that.

730
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,292
Get that down you.

731
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:56,292
I'm out of the band, Tom.
I know, son.

732
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,792
But it's for the best.

733
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:05,875
Oi.

734
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,333
You don't need that.

735
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,792
What the fuck happened?

736
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,792
I don't know. He got hold
of something, went fucking crazy.

737
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,083
It's been like a madhouse down here.

738
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:34,292
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.
Maybe I should get Janet down.

739
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,458
Thought you'd given her the big E.

740
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,625
I'm just thinking
that we might need a nurse,

741
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,625
what with Brian going all loose.

742
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:47,375
Shame she wasn't here this morning.
Oi!

743
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:52,125
Hey, Frank, you stick to this kind
in the future, all right?

744
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:58,792
When you gonna get
your hair cut, Frank?

745
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:29,500
It's only been a few days.

746
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,208
It's just the drugs
are leaving your system, you know.

747
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,000
I still feel terrible.

748
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,292
D Good morning
The world is bright d

749
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:54,042
d And you sit tight
And you'll be right... dd

750
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,042
<i>And here's more sensational news.</i>

751
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,667
<i>After months of speculation,</i>

752
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:02,667
<i>Brian Jones, founder member of The Rolling
Stones, said he is to quit the group.</i>

753
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,875
<i>In an official statement today
he said-</i>

754
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:09,417
<i>I no longer see eye to eye with the
others over the disks we are cutting.</i>

755
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,708
<i>We no longer communicate musically.</i>

756
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:14,917
<i>The Stones' music
is not to my taste anymore.</i>

757
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:19,083
<i>I have a desire to play my own brand
of music rather than that of others,</i>

758
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:22,250
<i>no matter how much
I appreciate the musical concept.</i>

759
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,708
<i>The only solution
is to go our separate ways,</i>

760
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:28,083
<i>but we shall still remain friends.
I love those fellows.</i>

761
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,167
What do you think?

762
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,833
You look beautiful.

763
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:42,833
I am Sir Brian, king of the castle.

764
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,917
Sir Brian was meant
to write his music in paradise,

765
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:48,833
not a building site.

766
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,125
So you gonna get rid of them, then?

767
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,208
I've got to fire someone
I didn't even hire in the first place.

768
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah. It'll be just you and me.

769
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:01,208
Just us? Never.

770
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,708
D The man I love d

771
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,792
d I took from my best friend d

772
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,542
d Some joker got lucky d

773
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,167
d And stole him back again dd

774
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,958
Brian?

775
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:39,208
Brian!
Fucking ponce has locked us out!

776
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:41,917
What do you reckon I'd get for this?

777
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:45,583
You wouldn't know too much about money,
would you? Or we'd have seen some.

778
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:50,208
What about those guitars in there?
Must be worth a bit.

779
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:55,208
They wouldn't notice if you nicked
one. If you had the balls, that is.

780
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:01,333
You're just a fucking brickie.
What do you know about anything?

781
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,000
I'm coming!

782
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,625
<i>Hello?</i>

783
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,625
Tom? It's Frank.

784
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,958
<i>Frank, I'm just on my way out
so call me later, yeah?</i>

785
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,500
No, it's getting messy down here now.
The boys want paying.

786
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get down there,
maybe I won't, all right?

787
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:23,417
Well, maybe you should.

788
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:25,917
Tom, I'm owed.

789
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:34,875
All right. Go down the Stones' office this afternoon
and whatever Brian owes you will be waiting for you.

790
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,750
Thanks, Tom.

791
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,583
It's been touted as a free concert

792
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:53,917
but really it's a way of introducing
the new boy who's replacing Brian.

793
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:57,125
Yeah, Mick Taylor.
He's quite gorgeous, actually.

794
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:01,208
Look, I'm gonna have to go. Yeah.

795
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:04,625
Hiya. Is Tom Keylock around at all?

796
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:08,042
You're Mr. Thorogood?
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:14:08,292 --> 01:14:12,000
He left this for you.
Good.

798
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,875
I ain't having that.
There ain't enough money there.

799
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,167
And there's a mistake. It says "full
and final payment for all services. "

800
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,625
There's no mistake.

801
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,917
Mr. Jones isn't happy with your work.

802
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,083
And quite frankly,

803
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:35,708
The Rolling Stones are no longer
willing to finance your shenanigans.

804
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:38,125
Until Mr. Jones
opens a separate account,

805
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,375
that's all you're getting from us.

806
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:43,417
Good day, Mr. Thorogood.

807
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,583
You ain't firing me.
There's 8 grand still owing.

808
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:11,667
You ain't getting away with it.

809
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,417
All good things
come to an end, Frank.

810
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:18,625
Don't worry, you'll get your money.
That's why you have to go.

811
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:20,917
It's built up too much.

812
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,625
I don't want the work completed.

813
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:26,625
For chrissakes,
don't you want the fucking job done?

814
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:30,417
I've done all this work.
I could still finish it.

815
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,583
I need space. I need peace.

816
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:36,417
I've got my own work to do now.

817
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,583
I thought it was agreed.

818
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:47,833
Oh, so that's it, then?

819
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:52,125
Look, you're good company,
you're fun to wind up.

820
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,667
But you're...

821
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,792
a fucking terrible builder.

822
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:59,667
Yeah.

823
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,625
Well, I ain't going nowhere
till I get my money.

824
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:15,708
Well, I'm going...

825
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,083
swimming.

826
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:22,000
Get the door, would you?
And what's for supper, Frank?

827
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:27,875
Tom?

828
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:34,625
The door was open.
Are you okay, Frank?

829
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:55,000
Things will work out, Frank. Let's
just try and have a lovely evening.

830
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,208
Yeah.

831
01:16:57,417 --> 01:17:00,042
Let's have a lovely evening, eh?

832
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:39,417
We're not hungry.

833
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:43,583
All right, Anna.
You might change your mind, eh?

834
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,208
Ungrateful cow.

835
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:51,208
No fucking manners.

836
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,042
So, what now?

837
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,875
I go back home,
see what work's around.

838
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:01,125
Had enough of this gaff anyway.
Mm.

839
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:04,083
Stonesville. A very strange place.

840
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,792
Yeah.

841
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:10,292
This is nice.
Can't quite place the seasoning.

842
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,917
Parsley.

843
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,708
Have you spoken to Tom?
I called him today.

844
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,292
He ain't coming down here.

845
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,292
Told me he don't want
nothing more to do with you.

846
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:28,000
He let me down today and all.

847
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:30,208
That's Tom all over, isn't it?

848
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:33,833
That's his trouble, just not reliable.

849
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:37,708
Come on.

850
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:40,917
I want to get smashed tonight.
Last night and all.

851
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,583
I'm not really a vodka drinker.
Come on.

852
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,833
Put a little lemonade with it, eh?

853
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:52,208
Cheers.

854
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:00,208
Strong?
Mm-hm!

855
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:24,292
Oh. Oh, Tom.

856
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:27,083
I knew you'd come.

857
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,083
Frank! Stop it!

858
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,292
Frank, get off!

859
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:13,708
A touch more Jane than Tarzan,
I'm afraid, Frank.

860
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,708
So says the ponce with a girl's barnet.

861
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:18,417
Ha-ha, very droll.

862
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:30,292
Come on. Don't tell me you wouldn't
like to look like me, be like me.

863
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:34,875
What, look like you? You're a freak.
There's only one freak in this pool.

864
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,708
Piss off, you poof.
Ho-ho!

865
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,667
That's stupid. You're acting like kids.

866
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:49,042
You've both had enough.
Come on, Brian.

867
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,583
Well, you sure can pick them.

868
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:56,625
Oh? Well, who should I pick,
Frank? You?

869
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,958
Do you want to replace Anna?

870
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:07,167
Why don't you piss off, eh?
I'm not a poof like you.

871
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:11,792
Come on, Frank.
You swing both ways, don't you?

872
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:16,417
Maybe you, me and Anna
should have a threesome.

873
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:27,292
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

874
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,833
I think you should get out.

875
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:33,208
Honestly, I'm fine. Could you grab
my inhaler? It's in the music room.

876
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,917
Okay. I'll be right back.

877
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,875
Ha-ha-ha!
Like it underwater, do you?

878
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:21,292
Fuck off, you arsehole!
Arsehole? Who you calling arsehole?

879
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,208
Arsehole!

880
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:29,000
Where do you think you're going, eh?

881
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,792
Quite strong for a ponce, ain't you?

882
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:47,292
It's a fucking joke! Never serious.
I'll get you!

883
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,292
Don't you laugh at me,
Brian-sodding-Jones.

884
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:20,625
Mate.

885
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,917
Tom?

886
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,125
Tom?

887
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,792
There.

888
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,708
I need a towel.

889
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,083
Brian, I-

890
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:23,917
Brian?

891
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,583
Brian?

892
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:31,792
Brian!

893
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,417
Oh, fuck! Brian!

894
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:37,500
Brian!

895
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,292
Brian!

896
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Frank! Frank!

897
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:44,042
Frank!

898
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:49,875
<i>Ja, men det var jättelänge sen.</i>

899
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:54,125
Anna? Will you
come down here, please, now?

900
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:57,792
Get off the phone. This is a private-
Now, please. It's Brian.

901
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,667
Get off the phone.
This is a private call.

902
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:01,875
I can't swim, Anna.

903
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,292
Brian?

904
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,750
Oh, my God!

905
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:53,292
Damn it, get help!

906
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,417
D Well, I followed him d

907
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:02,292
d To the station d

908
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:09,417
d With a suitcase in my hand dd

909
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,542
Oh, my God!

910
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:15,542
Tell us again what happened,
in your own words.

911
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,542
I told you. I saw Brian.

912
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:21,000
He was lying facedown at the bottom
of the deep end of the pool.

913
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:23,458
<i>Janet and I jumped in
and after a struggle, we got him out.</i>

914
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:28,000
<i>And that's your sworn statement,
is it, Mr. Thorogood?</i>

915
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,667
D Well, it's hard to tell d

916
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:37,500
d It's hard to tell d

917
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:44,417
d When all your love is in vain dd

918
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:51,125
Cops held you a while.

919
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:55,083
Yeah, well, they just hammered me
with the same questions.

920
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:57,500
"What was he drinking?"
"Was he on drugs?"

921
01:28:57,667 --> 01:29:00,542
Yeah, well, pop star dies like that,
drug squad got a result, haven't they?

922
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,542
Did my name come up?

923
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:05,083
Nah.

924
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,167
Janet?

925
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:09,708
Said she was a friend of mine.

926
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,500
Well, sometimes you've got to lie,
haven't you? For everyone's sake.

927
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,625
Tom-
You were supposed to look after him.

928
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:19,375
What the fucking hell happened here?

929
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:23,083
It's been building for months,
hasn't it?

930
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:25,792
You've let yourself go.
Look at the state of you.

931
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:38,125
What are you doing?
Brian's stuff, isn't it?

932
01:29:38,292 --> 01:29:40,292
I don't want kids ransacking the place

933
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,583
and I don't want Plod finding any
drugs he might've hidden in his clobber.

934
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:47,875
I look after my boy.

935
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:52,083
He was trouble to me alive
and he's trouble to me dead.

936
01:29:56,792 --> 01:30:00,625
You're well out of it, sacked.
Now look what I've got to do.

937
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:04,708
I gotta get a statement, I gotta get that
Swedish bint on a plane out of here.

938
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,792
<i>Supposed to be with the lads. They're
recording Top of the Pops today.</i>

939
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:14,792
And then there's you.

940
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:20,000
I'll cover your arse
because it's my arse too.

941
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:24,375
Your stupid games
could've ruined both of us, Frank.

942
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:27,125
I don't want to know the truth!

943
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:32,125
We both know it was
your fucking fault either way.

944
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:36,208
Come on, you give me a hand.

945
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:44,292
D And all my love d

946
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:52,417
d Is in vain dd

947
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:08,542
d Oh, oh, yeah dd

948
01:31:30,417 --> 01:31:33,000
Without Brian Jones
they're finished as a rock band.

949
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:36,292
I mean, in the next 12 months.
You mark my words.

950
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,708
No, they'll do all right without Brian.

951
01:31:44,042 --> 01:31:45,875
We all will.

952
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,125
Tom, my man.

953
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:13,083
Look at them all.

954
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,292
Isn't it fabulous?

955
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,875
Thanks for making a martyr of me.

956
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:23,083
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be alive

957
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,375
and no one would care.

958
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,125
You know that isn't true.

959
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:34,667
It was you screwing
with Frank's head what did it.

960
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:41,125
Because you had nothing better
to do. Because you didn't have her.

961
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,792
Nita.

962
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:53,917
<i>Just had to go and
screw it up, didn't you?</i>

963
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,500
Your problem is,
you were never happy.

964
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,708
Even Frank was happy.

965
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,542
You're wrong, you know, Tom.

966
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:08,167
I was happy
somewhere in the middle there.

967
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:12,167
But the thing with happiness was...

968
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,458
it was boring.
