1
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,562
<i>I remember looking out at the two of you.</i>

2
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:46,402
Her playing on the dock, you watching.

3
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:57,851
I was thinking how lucky you were
to have a mom like her,

4
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:05,659
and how lucky she was
to have a boy like you.

5
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,733
That's what he stole from you, Simon.

6
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,766
That's what I can never forgive.

7
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,906
<i>The thing you have to remember
about my mother</i>

8
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,314
<i>was that she was extremely trusting.</i>

9
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,147
<i>It's the only way she could have
found herself in that situation.</i>

10
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,184
And that was the first thing

11
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,128
that must have been obvious
to the security agents.

12
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,163
She was completely innocent.

13
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,874
- You speak Hebrew?
- No.

14
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,947
You'll be staying in Tel Aviv?

15
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:02,715
We're going to the Holy Land.

16
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,213
Who's "we"?

17
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,750
My fiancé and I.

18
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,581
Why isn't he traveling with you?

19
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,958
He had to stay for business.

20
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,062
You're pregnant?

21
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,302
People always ask
how two kids could be so different.

22
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:29,205
Your mother showed her talent
from the time she could walk,

23
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:34,280
even before.

24
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:40,114
She was always singing to herself,
around the house, in the yard.

25
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,193
When she picked up a violin, it was like
she already knew where to put her fingers.

26
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:02,708
Your uncle, on the other hand,
never figured out what his talent was,

27
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,243
except trouble and mischief.

28
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,808
<i>My parents said the most ridiculous thing.
But, like, you never have proof,</i>

29
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:46,114
<i>and you just want some sort of proof.</i>

30
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:47,484
<i>That's exactly what it was like, you know.</i>

31
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>And then it just turned out to be
really funny, so I wanted to show you guys.</i>

32
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,323
<i>I mean, he thought that his life is, like,
really dramatic...</i>

33
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,023
<i>I thought you were on crack
when you showed us that.</i>

34
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,624
<i>It's, like, why would you
waste your time videotaping...</i>

35
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,861
Simon, you want to get that?

36
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,459
<i>Why would Simon...</i>

37
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:14,880
- Hi.
- That'll be $24.

38
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,714
Well, can't you just put it on the tab
like you usually do?

39
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,616
Sorry. Not anymore.

40
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:27,960
- Is it less spicy than usual?
- Why didn't he want to put it on the tab?

41
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,056
- Go figure.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

42
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:35,796
Well, don't.

43
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,306
Check the green one there.

44
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,211
See if it's dead. Good.

45
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,480
You know, if we're having problems,
you should let me know.

46
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:58,754
- Who said anything about having problems?
- With money.

47
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:03,230
With money?
What are you going to do about it?

48
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,129
- Help.
- How are you gonna help?

49
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
Are you gonna sell your old video games?

50
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,304
You know, I could get a loan or something.

51
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,115
Innocence is a hard thing to describe.
It's like a scent,

52
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,210
a thing which some people carry.

53
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,917
And from the moment they found the bomb,

54
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,756
the security officials knew
that my mother had nothing to do with it.

55
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,794
My father was the wanted man.

56
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:40,357
And when I heard the story
in the classroom last week,

57
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:43,666
read to us in French, it all came back.

58
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:48,340
I was raised to hate my father
for what he did to our family.

59
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,775
He was a monster.

60
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,972
But who exactly was this monster?

61
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,580
What would make him do that?

62
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,719
You have anybody meeting you in Tel Aviv?

63
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,813
Yes. His family.

64
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,948
- Whose family?
- My fiancé's.

65
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:08,792
- Where does his family live?
- Over there.

66
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,295
- In which city?
- In Bethlehem.

67
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,532
- So they live in Bethlehem?
- I think so.

68
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:24,378
Although this occurred many years ago,

69
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,316
the story is often used to illustrate the

70
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:35,612
effectiveness of the Israeli
security measures.

71
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:43,588
She was stopped, as are all passengers
traveling on the airline,

72
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,464
for an interview by an agent.

73
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:55,470
Aspects of her story seemed suspicious
to this agent,

74
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,039
including the fact that her fiancé,

75
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:05,886
the father of her unborn child,
was not traveling with her.

76
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:13,219
According to the behavioral profiles
of Israeli security,

77
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:19,361
pregnant women seldom traveled alone...

78
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,675
- Is this all the money you're carrying?
- Yes.

79
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,310
- How long you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

80
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:44,347
- With this much money?
- His family's meeting me there.

81
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,256
And taking you to Bethlehem?

82
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:51,358
Where you will get married
to the man you're not traveling with?

83
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,868
He had business. He's meeting me there.

84
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,655
I just need another minute.

85
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:20,562
- I can feel the baby kicking.
- No, you can't.

86
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,126
Yes, I can.

87
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,867
There, it kicked again.

88
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,006
I like your imagination.

89
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,351
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

90
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,525
Why can't you come with me?

91
00:09:56,497 --> 00:10:00,126
- I told you, the ticket isn't changeable.
- Well, you changed yours.

92
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,465
My boss paid to change mine.

93
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,532
- He won't do it again.
- Why not?

94
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,337
It's a business decision.

95
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,536
- Yeah, but can't you explain?
- I've tried.

96
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:17,378
I've tried.

97
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,582
I don't want you to worry.

98
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:30,061
They're going to treat you like a queen.
They'll take you to the hotel.

99
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,126
I'll be there in two days.

100
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,397
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,453
I made them myself.

102
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:58,189
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

103
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,319
She did all the drawings.

104
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
And here's a picture of her working on them.

105
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,999
Mary, Joseph, the Three Wise Kings.

106
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:18,468
I still have them in a drawer somewhere.
Have I ever shown them to you?

107
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,071
- No.
- Your uncle helped me.

108
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:26,047
Tom was always good with his hands.

109
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,059
That's beautiful.

110
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,106
Do you put it up every year?

111
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:56,238
Yeah.

112
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:26,940
Is this your son?

113
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,687
We, too, believe that Jesus was a prophet.

114
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:38,619
I think the Jews believe that, as well.

115
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,728
- What do the Jews believe?
- That he was a prophet.

116
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,287
But not the Messiah,

117
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:49,361
- which is why they killed him.
- Excuse me.

118
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,200
This is private property.

119
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,238
- The road?
- You're not on the road.

120
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:30,004
<i>I often think about what must have been
going through my father's head</i>

121
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,341
<i>as he talked my mother into his plan.</i>

122
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,308
Did he have any feelings for her?

123
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:38,944
Was it difficult for him to go through with?

124
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,119
Or was it possible that

125
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,354
the only way he could talk himself
into doing it was because he loved her?

126
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:53,325
And what about me,
the unborn child resting in her belly?

127
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,467
Did I ever cross his mind?

128
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,404
When I heard the story
in this classroom last week,

129
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,410
all these images came flooding back to me.

130
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:09,276
And we'll get married there.
Would you like that?

131
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,513
- This is like a dream.
- What is?

132
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,153
These look so beautiful on you.

133
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,160
When I first told you I was pregnant,
you said you wanted nothing to do with it.

134
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:33,998
- I was so confused.
- You said I was on my own.

135
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:42,816
You are the greatest blessing in my life.
I didn't realize that.

136
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:49,082
- And now you do?
- Yes. Now I do. I do. I do.

137
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:56,328
- I will love you for always.
- For always?

138
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,490
- For always.
- Forever. It's not "for always."

139
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,525
Forever.

140
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:17,048
- Why didn't you say anything?
- About what?

141
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:20,144
When she said that stuff about
the Jews killing Jesus.

142
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:24,621
- Why should I?
- So you just ask her to leave?

143
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,224
Yeah, I asked her to leave, Simon.
She was crazy.

144
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,662
Look, women like that,
they don't come to this part of town, okay?

145
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:32,994
They don't walk around at night
by themselves.

146
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,764
What if she moved down the street, Tom?
What if she was out taking a stroll?

147
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,270
Well, then she's gonna learn
that you don't go around

148
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,136
spouting that sort of crap.

149
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,603
How's she gonna learn anything?

150
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:51,382
You never engaged in a conversation
or defended a position.

151
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,979
Defended a position?
I asked her to get off my property.

152
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:06,359
So, look, Simon mentioned getting a loan.

153
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:09,631
- Against what?
- Against the house.

154
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:14,372
Tom, he doesn't have access
to your dad's house until he turns 25.

155
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,670
- You know that.
- Yeah, I know.

156
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:19,873
- Aren't you supposed to look after it?
- Look after it?

157
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:21,574
His stuff, his affairs.

158
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,042
You're the...

159
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,675
- Executor.
- Yes.

160
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:29,880
So you can't do anything to change that?
You can't help us out?

161
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,482
It's locked in stone. He made sure of that.

162
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:40,289
Look, if you need cash,
you can always sell your sister's violin.

163
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,000
She left that to Simon.
That's worth a lot of money.

164
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,129
Right.

165
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,937
You made some choices, Tom.

166
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:51,536
Taking over your sister's house in the city,

167
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,443
letting Simon grow up there,

168
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,945
I guess you must have thought
it was good to get away from your dad.

169
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:00,452
But that cost you.

170
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,282
Fuck it.

171
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,625
That's good.
It's a good idea to start the act with that.

172
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:18,433
And be careful with the ladder.
No more accidents, okay?

173
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:25,940
- So, have you heard this story before?
- No.

174
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:29,409
It just occurred to you to write it this way?

175
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,346
Well, you told us to translate
as it came most naturally.

176
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:42,124
And it came to you naturally
to imagine yourself as their son?

177
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:45,289
Well, it just... It seemed cool.

178
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:50,092
You know, that's why I needed
a few minutes more to rewrite it.

179
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:53,634
- From his point of view.
- Like he was my age.

180
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:58,644
Like he was me talking about his parents.

181
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:07,120
I want you to work on this.

182
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,281
I want you to present it next week
to the class.

183
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:13,520
I want everyone to believe it's true,
that you're this couple's child.

184
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:14,819
Why?

185
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:18,364
As an exercise.

186
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,157
An exercise in what?

187
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:32,972
- I'm not sure if my French is that good.
- Then do it in English.

188
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:36,642
- But you teach French.
- And Drama.

189
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,982
- I'm not in Drama.
- Well, you are now.

190
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,832
Your uncle's an angry man.

191
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:02,040
Some people think he's stupid,
but that's not true.

192
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:08,376
When someone carries that sort of anger
around all the time, they can seem stupid.

193
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,347
That's the thing about anger.

194
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,616
It sucks up a lot of intelligence.

195
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,121
- Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
- You can't park here, man.

196
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,753
So write me a ticket!

197
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,229
I don't write the tickets.
You already got a ticket.

198
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,758
- It's $55 to get me to stop.
- Otherwise?

199
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,532
Otherwise, I'm gonna tow
your fucking car away.

200
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,885
- Lady, I promise, I'm very good at this.
- Fuck!

201
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,476
I'm going to pick it up,
we're gonna get out of here,

202
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:47,714
everything's gonna be good. It's easy...

203
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,653
Nothing, nothing,
nothing can happen to this car.

204
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:52,089
Lady, I promise.
Nothing's going to happen, okay?

205
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,525
Why don't you take a break? I promise.

206
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:55,619
Yeah?

207
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:04,700
I was driving it normally.
He said it was gonna be fine.

208
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,899
What do you want me to do?
It's not my fault. The car just died.

209
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,185
Well, I didn't do anything. It's not my fault.

210
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,323
He's a fucking tow truck driver.
I didn't ask for his credentials.

211
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,906
Hop in the truck. I'll be two seconds.

212
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,541
We good, man?

213
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,166
- May I open your bag?
- Sure.

214
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,568
It's heavy.

215
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,551
<i>Please do not leave your bags unattended.</i>

216
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,385
What they found at the bottom
of my mother's bag

217
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,449
were concealed plastic explosives
and a detonator.

218
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,788
And if the bomb had gone off in mid-air,
as my father intended,

219
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,427
all 400 people on board that flight
would have perished.

220
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,707
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

221
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:55,878
<i>Simon is my best friend,
and I was really confused, too,</i>

222
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,008
<i>when he was standing
in front of the classroom and he was talking,</i>

223
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,382
<i>and I didn't know anything about it.
But then...</i>

224
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:04,550
<i>You have to wake up and stop living
in your ignorant little box. Seriously.</i>

225
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,458
<i>I am not living in an ignorant, little box.</i>

226
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,356
<i>If he didn't want to tell me about
something like this,</i>

227
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,988
<i>then there must have been a good reason.</i>

228
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,226
<i>And if he doesn't want to talk to us about it,</i>

229
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,324
<i>then there's a good reason for that, too.</i>

230
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,062
<i>So I think we should all
just leave him alone because...</i>

231
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:20,197
A lot of you are wondering
why I haven't told you about this before.

232
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:25,041
The reason is, well, I've...
I only found out a few months ago myself.

233
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,381
I was asking my grandpa
a whole lot of questions before he died,

234
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,518
and I kept this on my cell as a reminder.

235
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:37,115
and I kept this on my cell as a reminder.

236
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,457
<i>You have to believe me, Simon.</i>

237
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:46,461
<i>Your father was a killer.</i>

238
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:50,835
<i>If the bomb had gone off in mid-air,
as my father intended,</i>

239
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:54,499
it would have been the most devastating
terrorist attack of its time

240
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:58,033
and my father would have gone down
in history as a mass-murderer.

241
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:03,542
Except he wouldn't have gone down
as my father.

242
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,844
I would have disappeared
in my mother's womb,

243
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,047
along with all the other passengers
on board that flight.

244
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,417
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

245
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,188
How's that?

246
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:19,528
Have you told anyone else about this?

247
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,969
- That I'm making it up? No.
- Why not?

248
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:28,573
If my friends found out it wasn't true,
it wouldn't be the same.

249
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,141
What wouldn't be the same?

250
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,911
The feeling I get when I'm performing.

251
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:42,247
I mean, some parts of it
could almost be true,

252
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,282
- but in a different way.
- In what way?

253
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,794
Things about my family.

254
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,357
Stuff... Stuff I haven't thought about
for a while.

255
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:05,641
So, your father planted a bomb
on your mother?

256
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,672
No.

257
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,617
Well, sort of.

258
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:23,261
- You live with your uncle?
- Yeah.

259
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,628
Does he know about this project?

260
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:34,199
- Are you going to tell him?
- I don't think he'd get it.

261
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,435
He wasn't really raised to be tolerant
about this sort of thing,

262
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,174
and his dad, my grandfather, he was...
He was a bit of a hard-ass.

263
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,753
- That could change.
- He died last spring.

264
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,549
Your uncle.

265
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,147
He might be more open-minded
than you think.

266
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,919
I wouldn't bet on that.

267
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:59,596
Well, there is a way to find out.

268
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:22,044
I came to apologize for yesterday.

269
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,488
That was wrong of me,
to embarrass a father in front of his son.

270
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,893
Okay.

271
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,863
Is he here? Your boy?

272
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,569
He's in his bedroom doing his homework.

273
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,737
I wanted to explain
something I said yesterday.

274
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,009
It will only take a minute of your time.

275
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,253
All right. Why don't you come in?

276
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,715
So why did you come to this part of the city?

277
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,922
I was just driving around
and I saw your decorations.

278
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,064
You were just driving around on your own?

279
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,757
I do that sometimes.

280
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:47,905
When I saw this public display of your faith,
it touched me.

281
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,404
Why?

282
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:56,148
I feel people staring at me all the time,

283
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:03,179
wondering why I would make
such a visible statement of my belief.

284
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,424
Where I come from, it's completely natural.

285
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,490
Here, it threatens.

286
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:15,228
And that surprises you?

287
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,462
Yes.

288
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,562
Like a woman in a bikini
wouldn't threaten you people?

289
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,708
Us people?

290
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,648
Maybe people really should
stick to their own kind.

291
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,311
- That's how you were raised?
- Yeah, I was.

292
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:40,688
- And you're okay with that?
- Yeah, I'm just fine with it.

293
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,339
- Who is this?
- It's my sister.

294
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,124
She's a musician?

295
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,428
Yeah, she was. She died a few years ago.

296
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:21,328
I'm sorry. How did she die?

297
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:23,964
Car accident.

298
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:25,662
Alone?

299
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:29,898
- Excuse me?
- Was she alone in the car?

300
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,674
No. The driver died, too.

301
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:37,548
Was he a friend?

302
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:43,945
Look, you said there was something
you wanted to explain about yesterday.

303
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:48,716
- It was about your son.
- Well, he's not my son. He's my nephew.

304
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,056
I raised him after my sister died.

305
00:28:55,902 --> 00:29:00,532
I'm sorry I used the word "Jew"
yesterday. That's not what I meant.

306
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,167
The problem is not with the Jews and Christ.

307
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,870
It's with the Zionists.

308
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,272
Thank you. Thank you for making that clear.

309
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,685
Are you making fun of me?

310
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:17,747
Listen, your issues with Jews or Zionists
or whoever you happen to hate,

311
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:22,224
they have nothing to do with my life
or Simon's.

312
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:26,231
- That's how you were raised.
- Yes. That's exactly how I was raised.

313
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:35,005
<i>What must have been going through
my mother's mind as she sat in that room?</i>

314
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:39,739
<i>And at that point, she couldn't have been
aware of the monstrosity of the betrayal,</i>

315
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,782
or what has come to be perceived
as a monstrosity.

316
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:48,878
You know, when he first found out
what had happened,

317
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:53,153
that she was pregnant with me,
he didn't want anything to do with it.

318
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:56,662
He tried to convince her to abort me.

319
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,029
My mother must have been crushed by this.

320
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,528
But then, a few weeks later,
he showed up to declare his love for her.

321
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,504
I want you to come with me.

322
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:18,716
Rachel, I told you before.
I'll be there in a few days,

323
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:22,118
- and my family will meet you there.
- They'll be upset.

324
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:27,052
- Why?
- I'm pregnant.

325
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:28,355
No, no. No.

326
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:37,664
A child is cause for great celebration
and joy.

327
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,534
They'll love you even more.

328
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:49,047
<i>I can feel sorry for him,
but I can't feel any amount of respect or...</i>

329
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,174
<i>- Yeah.
...try to humanize anything he did.</i>

330
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:54,652
<i>I can only say, "Wow!
That kind of sucks that he was raised</i>

331
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,780
<i>"and he grew up
and he thought that he had to do this</i>

332
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:57,846
<i>- "to be enlightened."
- Exactly. It's been</i>

333
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:01,951
<i>- implanted in his mind since the beginning.
- Or whatever he was thinking.</i>

334
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,120
<i>So that's the only way he knows to live.</i>

335
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,359
<i>So many things have been implanted
into all of our minds.</i>

336
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,958
<i>You know? Like, where did I buy this?</i>

337
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:14,735
<i>It's implanted in my mind to, like,
go get a good deal at, like, Nike and...</i>

338
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:17,503
<i>Exactly, which is our culture,
yeah, and that's...</i>

339
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:19,511
<i>I'm not trying to defend myself.</i>

340
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:23,345
<i>I'm saying that
that stuff is ingrained in our brain,</i>

341
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:27,147
<i>just like, you know,
blowing up stuff is ingrained in their brain.</i>

342
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,087
<i>- Exactly, but when it hurts other people...
- And it does hurt other people.</i>

343
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:31,646
<i>...I mean, but to a far higher degree.</i>

344
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:32,919
<i>Is that something that our culture does?</i>

345
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:37,396
<i>Yeah. So, to a far less degree,
we're harming someone, I suppose.</i>

346
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:38,761
<i>No. Because we're doing it in...</i>

347
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,096
<i>Why are we talking about capitalism
versus terrorism?</i>

348
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,000
<i>- I don't know.
- Well, it's just like...</i>

349
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,202
<i>I'm just saying that our minds are ingrained
with different values</i>

350
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:56,045
<i>that also may be wrong values,
even though you don't even realize it.</i>

351
00:31:56,116 --> 00:32:00,815
<i>Right, but it's not blowing up 400 people
when I go and buy a hoodie.</i>

352
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,582
<i>No, it's all for personal gain.</i>

353
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,284
<i>We buy Nike because we think
we're gonna look cool.</i>

354
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,416
<i>He wanted to blow up the plane</i>

355
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,961
<i>'cause he thought he was going to get
40 virgins in the afterlife.</i>

356
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,053
<i>Exactly!</i>

357
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,827
<i>Simon's trying to humanize him.
That's fine, he's his father.</i>

358
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,733
<i>Like, I would, too,
if I was making up a story about my father.</i>

359
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:20,364
<i>I would try and humanize him. Like,
I would try... That's all part of the game.</i>

360
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,069
<i>We're all victims of our circumstances,
then that's the norm.</i>

361
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:28,012
<i>So there's nothing out of the ordinary
about how the father was raised.</i>

362
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,639
<i>We're all innocent to some degree.</i>

363
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:34,449
<i>Is it any worse for us to be
so over-indulgent and to let people die</i>

364
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,522
<i>because they have no money
than, like, actually killing them ourselves?</i>

365
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:38,423
<i>because they have no money
than, like, actually killing them ourselves?</i>

366
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,061
<i>Does that mean
that we should have no opinion</i>

367
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:47,623
<i>- on terrorists killing innocent people?
- I'm just saying are we that much better?</i>

368
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:51,565
<i>Of course, we're much better!
Of course we are.</i>

369
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:56,335
<i>Hey, guys. You've got to check this out.
You know how my mom's a prof?</i>

370
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:59,708
<i>She's got this chat room
and they're talking all about Simon's story.</i>

371
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,576
What do you mean?

372
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,082
<i>They're talking about what happened
with your dad and everything.</i>

373
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,640
How'd they find out?

374
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,082
<i>Well, I told it to my mom.</i>

375
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,282
<i>- You showed it to your mom?
- Why not?</i>

376
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:14,054
<i>It's not like you're trying
to keep it a big secret anymore.</i>

377
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:17,153
<i>I mean, why wouldn't you want people
to find out?</i>

378
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,963
<i>Why is that so shocking,
so surprising to you that you feel</i>

379
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:25,402
<i>that you have a sense of entitlement
in this story?</i>

380
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:30,068
<i>I was on that plane. I was on that plane.
I don't call it a sense of entitlement.</i>

381
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,839
<i>It happens to be that...
If it is evil, whatever it was,</i>

382
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:37,849
<i>whatever Simon's father's intentions were,</i>

383
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:44,345
<i>I could feel on my own skin
once I learned about it.</i>

384
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:50,886
<i>I'm not sure that it was a trauma at the time.
I think we're just living it in our minds</i>

385
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,228
<i>the way Simon is trying to live it in his mind.</i>

386
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,267
<i>Yes. I think that the trauma happens later on,</i>

387
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:58,566
<i>that it grows on you as time goes by,
almost like a cancer.</i>

388
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,434
<i>Whether it's real or fictional,</i>

389
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:04,136
<i>as soon as we imagine it, then it becomes
something that we have to deal with.</i>

390
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,146
<i>I don't understand what's so seductive
about being a victim.</i>

391
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,375
<i>We embrace the sense of being a victim</i>

392
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,819
<i>almost to the extent that it blinds us
to the pain of others.</i>

393
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:18,221
<i>It's like a suit of clothes
that's so comfortable today.</i>

394
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,657
<i>His father basically ruined my life.</i>

395
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:23,560
<i>I mean, I've been pretty much...</i>

396
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,394
<i>Since, you know... And...</i>

397
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,361
<i>Since it happened, I've been pretty much...</i>

398
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:35,204
<i>My eating is completely out of control.
Has been. I've gained about 100 pounds.</i>

399
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:40,804
<i>And I just can't...
I can't seem to get it together</i>

400
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,872
<i>to just basically do anything.</i>

401
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:48,819
<i>So when I do work, I have to travel by plane,
it basically goes like this.</i>

402
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:53,518
<i>Like, one second after another second,
it's like, "Is it going to explode?</i>

403
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,754
<i>"Is it going to explode?
Is it going to explode?"</i>

404
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,093
<i>Second after second after second.</i>

405
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,155
<i>"Is it going to explode?
Is it going to explode?"</i>

406
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,724
<i>The next second, "Is it going to explode?"</i>

407
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:06,728
<i>- It's like that. I mean, you know...
- I've known David for 25 years,</i>

408
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:12,369
<i>and he's just a different man. Like, he's just
not the same person that he used to be.</i>

409
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:15,846
<i>It's not like I was such a great person
to begin with,</i>

410
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:21,080
<i>but I think that I am the guy
who was blown to smithereens.</i>

411
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:22,917
<i>- What?
- Okay? In a terrorist attack.</i>

412
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:28,723
<i>And I've come back from the dead
to rage against the fucking assholes</i>

413
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:34,097
<i>who believe that killing someone
for an idea is something that's viable!</i>

414
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:38,627
<i>The idea that somebody
would put their pregnant wife on a plane...</i>

415
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:43,506
<i>...would choose, because I'm Jewish
or because the plane was going to Israel,</i>

416
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:46,704
<i>to kill everyone on the flight,
I mean, that's the most sickening,</i>

417
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,441
<i>disgusting, despicable thing
I've ever heard of in my life.</i>

418
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:52,144
<i>But you weren't, in fact,
blown to smithereens.</i>

419
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:55,483
<i>- I don't understand why you say...
- Did you hear what I said?</i>

420
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:58,683
<i>"I am the guy
who came back from the dead!"</i>

421
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,693
<i>I am speaking for them.</i>

422
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:06,092
The school's position is that you
encouraged him to take it as far as he could.

423
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,034
- As a drama exercise.
- But he wasn't in the Drama Club.

424
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,333
You weren't teaching him drama.

425
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:16,068
This monologue was presented
in your French class. Is that correct?

426
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,638
I don't understand, Sabine.

427
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,408
You convinced this boy
to present it as the truth.

428
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,973
As a way of developing it.

429
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:28,509
I just did not understand it would go
as far as it did.

430
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,988
He never told me
he was going to post it on the Net.

431
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,852
I don't know how we'd proceed with this,
Sabine.

432
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,455
You're saying that it's wrongful dismissal,

433
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:45,198
and yet everything the school
is claiming you did, you did.

434
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,933
Well, whether or not you knew
he was going to post it

435
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:51,408
and that it would get such a reaction
is not really the issue.

436
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:55,206
No, I just don't want to waste your money.

437
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,918
Why did you choose to read
that particular article to the students,

438
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:12,294
about the man
wanting to blow up the plane?

439
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:18,167
It's a challenging piece to translate.
It happened the month I came here.

440
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:22,001
Why?

441
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,135
My parents were killed in Beirut.

442
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,577
We couldn't stay there.

443
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:29,911
No. I meant why is it so challenging?

444
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:48,692
No. I have to go.

445
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:57,838
Yeah. This is a tow-away zone,
employee parking.

446
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,037
You'll have to pay his release fee.

447
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,077
Is this your car?

448
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:15,088
- Yes.
- Okay. It's $55.

449
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:20,065
- What for?
- To get me to stop.

450
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,601
And if I don't want you to stop?

451
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:28,867
- What do you mean?
- If I want you to keep doing your job.

452
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:31,910
- Yeah, my job's to tow your car away.
- Yeah.

453
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,048
- I understand.
- You understand? You're sure?

454
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,117
I'm serious. I'm going to tow it away.

455
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:49,049
- Hey!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. This is your car, right?

456
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,526
- Yes.
- Yeah? All right. Hold on. Hold on.

457
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:00,401
You change your mind, give me a call.

458
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,983
- Can I see?
- Yeah.

459
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,759
- Can I put it up now?
- Yeah.

460
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:01,925
Thank you.

461
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,535
- Should we make one of Daddy?
- Yeah.

462
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:19,911
- Yeah?
- It's me. I'm behind you in the taxi.

463
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,880
- Why?
- Where are you taking my car?

464
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,682
- I'm taking it to a lot.
- Is it far away?

465
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:27,781
No. It's a few minutes from here.

466
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,583
Is there one further away?

467
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:32,417
Yeah. I can go south to Lakeshore.

468
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,518
Well, I want you to take it
to the one furthest away.

469
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:38,828
- Any reason?
- I need time.

470
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:40,689
Time for what?

471
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:45,504
To think. Please. Just keep driving.

472
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,505
Whatever you want.
But it's going to cost you.

473
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:50,440
That's okay. I'll pay whatever it costs.

474
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,995
- Do you know this guy?
- No.

475
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:18,061
- So, what's this about?
- Just keep driving.

476
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:26,510
My mother would have had no idea

477
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,377
of the political situation
she was entering into.

478
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:34,416
She would have no idea that Bethlehem
at that time was under Israeli control.

479
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:39,586
My father was giving her no sense
of the violence that had marked that region,

480
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,923
the history of persecution.

481
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:50,826
My father wanted nothing more than justice,
any sort of justice for his rage,

482
00:42:52,872 --> 00:42:58,606
and he was prepared to sacrifice
the two of us for this noble cause.

483
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,112
<i>You know,
most people have seen this action</i>

484
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,979
as the most horrifying and cynical thing

485
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,952
that a father and husband could inflict
on a family.

486
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:14,223
And I've come to understand
that it is not the fact.

487
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,692
My father was giving us a gift.

488
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:20,459
<i>- Wow!
- Simon, if you want to think that's a gift,</i>

489
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:23,195
<i>you go right ahead,
but I think that's cowardly.</i>

490
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,170
<i>He has a point. He does have a point.
I believe that he has a point.</i>

491
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:30,368
<i>If he had given you that gift,
you wouldn't be here to say it was a gift.</i>

492
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:32,877
<i>What? Hannah, you don't think people
can die for a cause?</i>

493
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:35,505
<i>People can die for a cause, that's fine,
but don't sacrifice other people.</i>

494
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:37,606
<i>You do not believe that
there is such a thing as a martyr.</i>

495
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:39,480
<i>How would the wife have been a martyr?</i>

496
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:41,747
<i>She didn't know what she was dying...
What she was going to die for.</i>

497
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:43,880
<i>He was doing it
because he believed in something.</i>

498
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:45,981
<i>Yeah, but he didn't die. He wasn't...</i>

499
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:51,052
<i>He was doing something to better the world!
He was doing something to better the world!</i>

500
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,791
<i>And, you know,
he has a point when he does that.</i>

501
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:58,531
<i>I understand your need to, sort of, think
of your father as someone giving a gift,</i>

502
00:43:58,604 --> 00:44:02,335
<i>but I really can't see how
there's any kind of justification</i>

503
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,705
<i>in that much murder
and that much destruction.</i>

504
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,905
<i>And who's on that plane?
Probably people like us.</i>

505
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,108
<i>It's not gonna be people
who are making big political decisions.</i>

506
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:12,844
<i>Hundreds of other lives...</i>

507
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:16,786
<i>I'm Daniel, and I heard about
your chat room through a colleague of mine</i>

508
00:44:16,856 --> 00:44:18,551
<i>whose daughter goes to your school.</i>

509
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:22,720
<i>Now, why did Simon's father
not board the plane himself?</i>

510
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:25,286
<i>You've acknowledged the possibility
that the man is a coward.</i>

511
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:28,856
<i>You've acknowledged the possibility
that the man is a monster.</i>

512
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:33,667
<i>Is it possible that this man just
and quite simply</i>

513
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,970
<i>wanted to view the consequences
of his actions?</i>

514
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:42,106
<i>You cannot underestimate the deep,
earthly satisfaction</i>

515
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,582
<i>of viewing work you've done
while you are still alive.</i>

516
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:47,909
<i>It was a heinous crime!</i>

517
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:52,547
<i>The truth is that I don't think that
whatever happened to Simon's parents,</i>

518
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:56,755
<i>it's not about concepts and an ideology
and who's a martyr.</i>

519
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:00,356
<i>This is about that this happened
to his mother.</i>

520
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:02,628
<i>So why don't you all just shut up?
'Cause why don't you just imagine</i>

521
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,727
<i>what it would be like to be his mother?</i>

522
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:07,398
<i>You're pregnant and you think
that you have this wonderful husband</i>

523
00:45:07,473 --> 00:45:11,210
<i>who loves you and then he's planning
on killing you and 400 other people.</i>

524
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:15,974
His parents were killed in a car accident,
Sabine, eight years ago.

525
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,846
They crashed into an oncoming vehicle.

526
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:23,514
Well, this would have happened
long before that, before he was born.

527
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:27,421
Would have. So he is lying.

528
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:30,587
He's making it up for the play he's writing.

529
00:45:30,663 --> 00:45:35,123
Look, I know all about his parents.
I know all the details about the accident.

530
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:38,728
What are you? Are you an inspector?
You read the police reports?

531
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:44,707
Well, that's what he's exploring
with this monologue.

532
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:46,711
And you want me to approve it?

533
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:50,215
I want you to be aware of what we are doing.

534
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:51,476
Why?

535
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:56,279
Because I would like to present it
at the Drama Festival.

536
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,380
No. Absolutely not. No.

537
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:02,990
You know, I have no problem with him
writing whatever he wants,

538
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:04,620
as long as it doesn't promote hatred

539
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:08,155
and as long as everyone knows
that it is fiction,

540
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,031
<i>that he's making it up.</i>

541
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:15,071
- I put this into my pocket by accident.
- By accident?

542
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,571
You know, I thought the idea
was to test my uncle's tolerance,

543
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:20,305
not to steal things.

544
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:22,506
Listen, I talked to the principal.

545
00:46:23,983 --> 00:46:26,713
<i>He wants people to know
that you're making this up.</i>

546
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:29,448
<i>Why? That's what makes it so interesting.</i>

547
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:32,719
It's the only way he'll let you
present it at the Drama Festival.

548
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,056
So let's wait until then.

549
00:46:36,428 --> 00:46:38,487
I don't think that's a good idea.

550
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:42,159
I do.

551
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,338
Keep it.

552
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:09,153
- Yeah?
- Hi. It's me again.

553
00:47:09,228 --> 00:47:12,163
- I was wondering, have you had lunch?
- Excuse me?

554
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:15,223
- I was wondering if you had lunch.
- No.

555
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:19,032
- Well, what if I invite you out?
- For what?

556
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:21,334
For lunch.

557
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,501
- Lady...
- Sabine. My name is Sabine.

558
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:28,138
- Yeah, look...
- Is there a place you would like to go?

559
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:32,344
- Look, I'm a busy guy.
- Yeah? What makes you so busy?

560
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:37,186
- Lady, I got a lunch right here.
- So keep it for tomorrow.

561
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:42,455
- Hold on. Sir, have you had lunch?
- No.

562
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:45,759
- Are you hungry?
- I could eat.

563
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:03,811
He seems to be enjoying it.

564
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,248
Yeah, he does.

565
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:14,425
Does your wife pack your lunch every day?

566
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:19,192
- No. I make it myself.
- You're not married?

567
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:24,259
No. I got into the habit
when I had to make lunch for my kid.

568
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,697
You were married?

569
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:32,405
No. No, no, no. My nephew, my sister's kid.

570
00:48:33,512 --> 00:48:35,343
I raised him after she died.

571
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,153
- Is the father around?
- No. They died together.

572
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:44,622
It was an accident.

573
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,361
How old were you?

574
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:53,125
How old was I? I was 22.

575
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:55,524
Thank you.

576
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,970
That's a lot of responsibility,
raising a child at that age.

577
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:07,740
- Yeah, I guess so.
- She must have trusted you.

578
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:24,388
And now you put up decorations
as a way of remembering her.

579
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:34,972
I'm sorry. It was a very stupid thing to do.

580
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:43,247
- Who are you?
- Simon's teacher, French and Drama.

581
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,017
- You're the one that was fired?
- That's right.

582
00:49:48,087 --> 00:49:50,954
I was coming out of my lawyer's office
when we met.

583
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:56,089
Do they know about that?

584
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,322
Do they know that you came to my house
and stole that?

585
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:00,797
No. I'm sorry.

586
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:05,101
- Does Simon know?
- That it was me?

587
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,070
Of course.

588
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,766
We planned it together.

589
00:50:13,479 --> 00:50:18,712
He doesn't think you're very open-minded.
I wanted to prove that you were.

590
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:23,417
It was important for the play
he wanted to write.

591
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:26,051
- Lady...
- I thought it would do him good and...

592
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:30,323
You're fucked up. You're fucked up.
You did that.

593
00:50:31,964 --> 00:50:36,492
You got him to post that stuff about his dad
being a terrorist. You did that?

594
00:50:36,568 --> 00:50:38,968
I had absolutely no idea
he would go that far.

595
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:42,007
- Well, he took it that far.
- Yes, I know.

596
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:45,532
And I'm very sorry about it,
but it was not my intention.

597
00:50:46,812 --> 00:50:47,836
Please.

598
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:51,705
Do you know what you've done to that kid?

599
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,879
- I wouldn't have let him...
- Do you know?

600
00:50:57,122 --> 00:51:01,491
Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus.

601
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:10,763
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

602
00:51:10,836 --> 00:51:12,827
She loved Christmas.

603
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:16,302
Didn't she, Tommy?

604
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:20,436
Didn't she what?

605
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:24,780
I was just telling Simon
how much your mom loved Christmas.

606
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:29,881
- According to who, Dad?
- Don't you remember?

607
00:51:30,923 --> 00:51:32,356
No.

608
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:36,458
What I remember, Dad,
is Christmas wasn't such a great time

609
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:39,326
'cause it meant we had to
spend more time with you.

610
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:43,429
Actually, we all kind of hated Christmas.

611
00:51:43,502 --> 00:51:45,663
Don't you believe him.

612
00:51:46,738 --> 00:51:50,139
They're in the drawer of my desk,
the roll-top desk.

613
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,973
Beautiful drawings.

614
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:05,152
You have to believe me, Simon.

615
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:12,857
<i>I've been thinking
about the virgins and heaven,</i>

616
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:16,059
<i>and I'm wondering, Simon,
whether it's possible to...</i>

617
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:20,462
<i>To delay divine reward.</i>

618
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:26,103
<i>I mean, that way we can kill people
and witness our actions,</i>

619
00:52:26,178 --> 00:52:29,238
<i>feel the satisfaction
that I was talking about before,</i>

620
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,341
<i>and then get martyred after,</i>

621
00:52:33,952 --> 00:52:35,647
<i>get the virgins after.</i>

622
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:40,653
<i>I mean, what do you think,
can we get a rain check for martyrdom?</i>

623
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:44,059
<i>What did your father think? Did he qualify?</i>

624
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,299
I can't answer your question.

625
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:53,031
I have... I have no idea if my father
ever intended to kill himself

626
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:55,869
or if the virgins even appealed to him.

627
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,704
He loved my mother.

628
00:52:57,776 --> 00:53:01,143
And I'm sure if he got to know
the other people on that plane,

629
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:04,808
he might have liked them, too.
But that's not the point.

630
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:11,012
I think that this idea we get, that if you get
to know someone, if you humanize them,

631
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:15,651
it stops you from pulling the trigger
or setting off the bomb or whatever...

632
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:21,799
Well, you know, that's just a myth we're
taught, something we get from the movies.

633
00:53:22,134 --> 00:53:27,766
When the reality might be that that's
what actually inspires an extreme action

634
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:34,040
that is actually being done to someone
that you like, or in this case, with my dad,

635
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,004
people that you love.

636
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,815
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

637
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:41,853
<i>- I just want you to step into this world.
- Why?</i>

638
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,981
<i>And show these people that there are people
like you that have suffered and survived.</i>

639
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:49,960
<i>Not like these bullshitters who don't know
what the fuck they're talking about!</i>

640
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:52,053
<i>Don't say such words to me.</i>

641
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,463
<i>Come on, Bubbe. Just for me.</i>

642
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:58,731
<i>Show the world that there are people
like you that have survived.</i>

643
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:01,568
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.</i>

644
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,339
<i>- No. I'll do it myself, darling.
- You want to get up by yourself? Go ahead.</i>

645
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:11,109
<i>Who cares about them?
I don't care about them.</i>

646
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:13,174
<i>Just go a little closer.</i>

647
00:54:16,655 --> 00:54:20,284
<i>- Come on.
- I'll do it. What?</i>

648
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:22,525
<i>Show them.</i>

649
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:28,892
<i>Yeah, I'll show them. Yeah.</i>

650
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:37,000
<i>There, you see? 46224.</i>

651
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,902
<i>That's pretty emotional stuff.</i>

652
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:44,411
<i>Simon, you should be proud of your father.</i>

653
00:54:44,483 --> 00:54:48,510
<i>Your father was a hero.
Your father stood for the truth, Simon.</i>

654
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,248
<i>I'm a victim, too.</i>

655
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,552
<i>I'm a victim of years of propaganda,</i>

656
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,617
<i>years of lies.</i>

657
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:03,426
<i>Here's my tattoo. You like that?</i>

658
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:06,027
<i>See that? You read that?</i>

659
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:09,171
<i>That's what I have written on my body.</i>

660
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:13,545
<i>If you had contemplated somebody
other than yourself for five stinking minutes,</i>

661
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:15,172
<i>face the idea that...</i>

662
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

663
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:26,081
- Who's he?
- Some guy.

664
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:29,850
- What, is he trying to pick you up?
- Right.

665
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:37,768
Where do you keep
your mom's violin, Simon?

666
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,159
It's...

667
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:42,906
It's at the top of the cupboard on the back.

668
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:45,865
Yeah.

669
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:48,971
Why?

670
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:54,647
When was the last time you took it out?

671
00:55:55,153 --> 00:55:59,021
When we went to see Grandpa
at the hospital last spring.

672
00:55:59,091 --> 00:56:01,457
Right. The confession that never happened.

673
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:05,155
- Well, maybe there's nothing to confess.
- I wouldn't bet on that.

674
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:09,893
Do you know something that I don't?

675
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:16,402
Would my dad have done that?

676
00:56:16,742 --> 00:56:19,176
Crashed the car on purpose?

677
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:25,716
I wish I could answer that, Simon. I can't.

678
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:29,277
I didn't get to know him that well.

679
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:40,027
Look, I was talking to Nick
about the loan idea. It won't work,

680
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:42,296
not until you're 25.

681
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:59,446
You know the story about this mark here?

682
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:03,110
You know it's how your parents met?

683
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:10,227
See, your mom, she went into
this repair place to get some work done.

684
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,855
And this guy, your dad,

685
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,729
he had this old...

686
00:57:18,737 --> 00:57:21,797
- What do you call this part right here?
- It's a scroll.

687
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:24,107
A scroll.

688
00:57:25,577 --> 00:57:30,207
He had this old scroll that he had saved,
and he told her he could put it on.

689
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,107
Hers was new.

690
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:41,952
I don't know the rest of the details.

691
00:57:42,894 --> 00:57:45,294
I found the invoices for the job,

692
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:49,033
the drawings,
and my dad sketched it all out.

693
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:53,368
Excuse me.

694
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:03,540
I guess he wanted her to know
how it would work.

695
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:06,750
That's very detailed.

696
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:10,419
He must have liked to plan everything out.

697
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:20,357
Are you asking me if you can sell it?

698
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:30,073
Listen to me.

699
00:58:30,141 --> 00:58:33,338
When they died,
I moved down here to look after you.

700
00:58:34,613 --> 00:58:36,808
I wanted to keep you here.

701
00:58:37,115 --> 00:58:38,673
I wanted to keep you in this house.

702
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,981
It was also a chance
to get away from your father.

703
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:46,486
Things are expensive here, Simon.
You should know that.

704
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:49,624
We're still carrying the mortgage
on this place.

705
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,685
You're going to be needing money
for university.

706
00:58:51,763 --> 00:58:53,822
What do you want me to do?

707
00:59:05,443 --> 00:59:07,240
Can I think about it?

708
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,644
Yeah, you can think about it.

709
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:17,182
I know it means a lot. I understand that.

710
00:59:22,394 --> 00:59:25,454
There's something
that I don't understand, Tom.

711
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:28,663
Why would my dad
want to put a new scroll on?

712
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:32,965
I mean, it doesn't really increase
the value of the violin.

713
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:37,168
You could cut it right off
and it would be just as valuable, right?

714
00:59:38,343 --> 00:59:39,810
I don't know.

715
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:50,579
There's something that my father did that
might explain his character a little better.

716
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,988
When he met my mom,
he was repairing violins.

717
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:55,720
That was his job.

718
00:59:56,595 --> 00:59:58,995
She came in with this instrument.

719
01:00:00,498 --> 01:00:03,399
Well, it's... It's a long story.

720
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:07,167
But the last time I was saying

721
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,000
that it wouldn't have mattered if my father

722
01:00:10,075 --> 01:00:11,872
had seen the other people
on board that flight.

723
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:16,471
It wouldn't have changed his mind
if he'd recognized their humanity.

724
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:19,343
And I realized

725
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:21,416
that you never know when

726
01:00:21,486 --> 01:00:24,853
or how something might affect you.

727
01:00:24,923 --> 01:00:26,788
I mean, most of the times
when we find ourselves

728
01:00:26,858 --> 01:00:28,985
most affected by something

729
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:32,291
is when we think it might be taken away.

730
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:35,797
And that's when you need to act.

731
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:39,300
Well, Simon,
I feel like I'm losing you right now,

732
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:40,838
because if you think
that it's easier to project

733
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:42,805
your feelings onto a thing
rather than a person,

734
01:00:42,874 --> 01:00:46,275
then I'm wondering what your response is
to what you're looking at right now.

735
01:00:46,344 --> 01:00:50,781
Because right now I'm just a thing
on whatever it is that you're watching me on.

736
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,942
But you're looking at my face
and you're looking into my eyes

737
01:00:53,018 --> 01:00:55,111
and you're listening to my voice.

738
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:58,246
So whatever it is that you're reacting to,
this thing wouldn't be here if my parents

739
01:00:58,323 --> 01:01:01,952
had been on the plane that day
and your father's bomb had gone off.

740
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:04,785
<i>That's a stretch, Hannah.</i>

741
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:13,037
<i>I guess I've had a lot of people
responding who were on that plane.</i>

742
01:01:14,372 --> 01:01:18,809
<i>Maybe there's part of you that wishes
your parents could be part of that club.</i>

743
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,937
<i>This community of people
who are remembering</i>

744
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,504
<i>a catastrophe that never happened.</i>

745
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,811
<i>Look, I guess the assumption here
is that our lives are precious.</i>

746
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:33,218
<i>But we know that's not feasible.
I mean, it's just not how nature works.</i>

747
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:36,283
<i>If every life was precious,</i>

748
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:38,693
<i>the world would not be able to sustain itself.</i>

749
01:01:38,763 --> 01:01:42,563
<i>We'd go forth and multiply ourselves
into extinction.</i>

750
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:46,060
<i>So it's just common sense.</i>

751
01:01:47,272 --> 01:01:51,504
<i>So... So how... How do we prevent this?</i>

752
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:54,470
<i>There's disease, famine.</i>

753
01:01:54,546 --> 01:01:58,346
<i>We generate wars, we plan genocides,</i>

754
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,386
<i>but occasionally someone's got to
take the matter into their own hands</i>

755
01:02:03,455 --> 01:02:06,049
<i>and wipe out a bunch of other lives.</i>

756
01:02:07,325 --> 01:02:08,622
<i>When the police, they showed me the tape</i>

757
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:10,888
of him saying those things,
that was not Simon.

758
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:12,691
- No.
- That was someone else.

759
01:02:12,764 --> 01:02:14,891
- He was pretending.
- Why?

760
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:18,993
Maybe he was trying to work something out.

761
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,300
Thank you. That was delicious.

762
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:23,769
What kind of bologna was that?

763
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:29,237
- It wasn't bologna.
- But something like that.

764
01:02:30,348 --> 01:02:32,339
Yeah, it was something like that.

765
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:34,612
My shift is ending now.

766
01:02:34,686 --> 01:02:36,813
That'll be $75.

767
01:02:37,322 --> 01:02:38,653
Excuse me.

768
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:39,950
Any reason why you didn't tell us you were

769
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:42,652
finishing your shift
before you took my lunch?

770
01:02:42,727 --> 01:02:44,456
I didn't take it.

771
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:48,523
- It was offered.
- What about deducting my meal?

772
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,960
- Why would I do that?
- Why would you do that? Courtesy.

773
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:54,635
Courtesy.

774
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:01,471
It was courteous of this woman
to invite you out.

775
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,138
It was certainly courteous of her
to offer me your lunch.

776
01:03:06,251 --> 01:03:10,654
I'm not sure how courteous it is
to now demand a payment.

777
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:13,418
You know what? Don't fuck with me.

778
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:15,823
Why not? You're fucking with me.

779
01:03:17,162 --> 01:03:20,529
I assumed, given the circumstance,
that it was a gift.

780
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:24,867
Now you're asking to have it back.
Since I can't give it back,

781
01:03:24,936 --> 01:03:26,767
- you're extorting me for money.
- Right.

782
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:28,863
Money I earned doing my job.

783
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,307
- No. Do not give him the money.
- Really, it's okay. It's not a problem.

784
01:03:32,377 --> 01:03:34,971
- Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
- No. What do you propose?

785
01:03:35,046 --> 01:03:38,413
That I give your lunch back?

786
01:03:41,386 --> 01:03:44,514
- Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Get the fuck out of here!

787
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:47,786
Get the fuck out of here! Get in the car
and get the fuck out of here!

788
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:50,419
- Don't touch me again.
- I'll touch you again. Get in the fucking car.

789
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:52,588
Get in the fucking car.

790
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,972
Thanks.

791
01:04:57,896 --> 01:05:00,831
- Get in your fucking car!
- Big tough guy!

792
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:59,686
How long have you had this violin?

793
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:01,622
Since I was 14.

794
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,528
My father gave it to me.

795
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:08,192
It's quite a gift.

796
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:15,137
He must have known that you were special.

797
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,200
What do you mean?

798
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:24,608
A great musician.

799
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:29,580
That's what makes me special?

800
01:06:30,755 --> 01:06:31,779
No.

801
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:38,857
You're special for what is in you.

802
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:42,565
That's where the music comes from.

803
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:04,017
<i>Why did you let that go so far, Simon?</i>

804
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:07,285
<i>You made people remember that day
when they almost lost their lives,</i>

805
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:10,657
<i>and you told people that it was your dad
who tried to do it.</i>

806
01:07:10,728 --> 01:07:14,926
<i>So whether they were sad for you
or mad at you or whatever,</i>

807
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:18,867
<i>why would you make people feel
all those things if it wasn't even true?</i>

808
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,170
I'm unloading your car.

809
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,238
You haven't finished your food.

810
01:07:58,976 --> 01:08:00,841
I don't want the food.

811
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,774
You were asking about Simon,

812
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:08,710
what it was that he was trying to work out.

813
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:12,581
Lady, we're all trying
to work things out. Okay?

814
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:16,824
Sabine. You can call me Sabine.

815
01:08:18,663 --> 01:08:19,755
Lady,

816
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,131
you force yourself into my house,

817
01:08:25,203 --> 01:08:29,196
you plan to have me tow your car.
So now I know who you are, and it's over.

818
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:34,711
You don't know who I am.

819
01:08:35,012 --> 01:08:37,674
Yes, I do. Listen to me.

820
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:42,750
I was never into plays or drama in school.

821
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:47,553
I don't understand this pretending stuff.
I don't like this pretending stuff.

822
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:51,193
You're playing games with people.

823
01:08:51,762 --> 01:08:53,787
That's not what I'm doing.

824
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:56,431
That's exactly what you're doing.

825
01:08:59,837 --> 01:09:02,829
Simon's parents were killed
in a car accident.

826
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:05,642
- I told you that.
- The driver of the truck said

827
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,803
they crashed into him on purpose,

828
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:12,475
that Sami drove into the head-on collision.

829
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:27,287
How do you know his name?

830
01:09:28,099 --> 01:09:30,590
Sami had a condition with his eyes.

831
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:34,065
He wasn't supposed to drive at night.

832
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:35,764
How do you know?

833
01:09:38,576 --> 01:09:40,373
I was married to him

834
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:46,006
for five years until he met your sister

835
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,944
at his store.

836
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:57,156
He was the one who repaired her violin.

837
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,833
The good news is that it's authentic.

838
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:12,670
The bad news is that... Sorry.

839
01:10:14,612 --> 01:10:19,845
The bad news is that
this whole piece of the violin is new.

840
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:22,618
<i>Does it affect the sound?</i>

841
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:25,588
<i>No, no, no. The scroll is purely decorative.</i>

842
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:30,894
Many instruments at this time
had a graft. Here.

843
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:40,628
The old violins had a shorter neck

844
01:10:40,705 --> 01:10:43,902
<i>and the angle of the fingerboard
was different,</i>

845
01:10:43,975 --> 01:10:47,035
<i>and then when the new style
was introduced,</i>

846
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:51,276
a cut was made here.

847
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:57,218
This way the scroll could be kept
while the neck was being worked on.

848
01:11:00,124 --> 01:11:01,523
Can you...

849
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:08,662
I've made some drawings

850
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:12,066
on how I can reconstruct this.

851
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:14,635
With what?

852
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,997
I... Okay.

853
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:31,720
<i>I... I brought this with me from Paris.</i>

854
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:36,284
<i>It was attached to an old violin</i>

855
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,521
<i>that was destroyed during the war.</i>

856
01:11:39,196 --> 01:11:41,994
- The same make?
- No, it's part of the same workshop.

857
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:44,728
This would make the scroll identical.

858
01:11:47,204 --> 01:11:50,196
I can attach this to your violin.

859
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,704
Here.

860
01:11:55,012 --> 01:11:56,809
Look at the drawing.

861
01:11:58,716 --> 01:11:59,705
See?

862
01:12:01,218 --> 01:12:03,209
It would be like this.

863
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:06,685
But in the end, it would be smooth.

864
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,892
You feel it? Smooth.

865
01:12:53,037 --> 01:12:55,437
Your mother plays like a goddess.

866
01:12:59,143 --> 01:13:01,771
How long have you been standing there?

867
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:05,639
He wants us in for dinner.

868
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:11,011
Hi.

869
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:19,786
Don't make a scene, okay?

870
01:13:20,498 --> 01:13:21,863
About what?

871
01:13:22,099 --> 01:13:25,091
He says anything during grace or anything...

872
01:13:27,138 --> 01:13:30,073
I'm a guest. I expect to be treated like one.

873
01:13:41,285 --> 01:13:43,219
- You said they were all animals.
- No, no, no, no, no.

874
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:44,811
The people who took over the airplanes,

875
01:13:44,889 --> 01:13:48,120
the people who crashed them
into the two towers, they were animals.

876
01:13:48,192 --> 01:13:50,023
You said all of us.

877
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:53,119
- Was that what I said?
- Yes.

878
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:56,525
Tom, is that what I just said?

879
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:03,630
Tom, I'm asking you a question.
Is that what I told your brother-in-law?

880
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:05,607
I don't know. I don't know, Dad.

881
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:06,938
You don't know.

882
01:14:07,011 --> 01:14:08,774
You're sitting across the table from me
and you don't know.

883
01:14:08,846 --> 01:14:11,747
Is there a problem with your hearing, Tom?

884
01:14:12,216 --> 01:14:15,379
I'll tell you why I wouldn't have said
anything like that.

885
01:14:15,453 --> 01:14:17,512
Why I know I couldn't have said
anything like that,

886
01:14:17,588 --> 01:14:20,819
because, contrary to what you may think,

887
01:14:21,826 --> 01:14:23,691
I'm a civilized man.

888
01:14:24,261 --> 01:14:28,061
And civilized people don't believe
in doing things like that.

889
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:31,900
- You always change the story.
- What story?

890
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:33,732
You are a snaky man.

891
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:39,970
Did he mean sneaky, Rachel?
Is that what your husband is calling me?

892
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:45,205
Your husband wants to know what's wrong
with raising my grandson with his culture,

893
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:48,376
and I was explaining that what's wrong is

894
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:52,550
that his culture's brought nothing
but hatred and violence into this world.

895
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:55,615
You say this after the Crusades?

896
01:14:56,227 --> 01:14:59,025
- After you sent children to fight?
- What's he talking about?

897
01:14:59,096 --> 01:15:01,963
- The Crusade of Children.
- Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yeah.

898
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:04,262
You're an educated man, aren't you, Sami?

899
01:15:04,335 --> 01:15:07,862
What do you make of this educated man,
Tom? Does he impress you?

900
01:15:09,106 --> 01:15:13,236
<i>She was drinking a lot.
She always did in those situations.</i>

901
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:15,602
What situations?

902
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:18,711
When Dad and him were together.

903
01:15:19,617 --> 01:15:22,279
- Sami?
- Yes.

904
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,220
You don't use his name.

905
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:28,220
I didn't get to know him that well.

906
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:31,022
He lived with your sister for 10 years.

907
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,255
I wasn't around very much back then.

908
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:38,425
Where were you?

909
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:44,601
Listen.

910
01:15:51,582 --> 01:15:55,040
I wish I did get to know him better, Sami.

911
01:15:56,387 --> 01:15:58,617
I could tell Simon who he was.

912
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:02,383
He needs to know that.
I want him to know that.

913
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:05,885
Instead he got my father,

914
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:09,129
the same shit I was raised with.

915
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:14,128
Except your sister made sure
he wasn't raised with that,

916
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:18,773
that you looked after him,
that you raised Simon.

917
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:24,949
My son doesn't answer
because he agrees with me.

918
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:28,550
He doesn't want to seem impolite
because that's not the way he was raised.

919
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:31,053
The first thing you need to know
is that this family knows its place,

920
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:33,351
and its place isn't to tell me what I said
or didn't say.

921
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:36,689
Their place isn't to sit at my table
and ask me to explain myself.

922
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,821
Because the way my children were raised,
this would be considered rude.

923
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,327
Do you understand that?

924
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:50,033
Maybe it's normal for you to act this way,

925
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:53,740
to be heated, hot-blooded, impassioned,

926
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:58,472
rude across the family table,
but in my house this is not acceptable.

927
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:01,645
- When Rachel's mother was alive...
- Hey, Simon.

928
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:03,243
...she had a rule...

929
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,619
- Want to go out for a ride in my truck?
...whenever anyone got angry at this table

930
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,988
or anywhere...

931
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,551
- Okay.
...she would nod.

932
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:24,234
<i>- You don't talk...
- Tom.</i>

933
01:17:24,308 --> 01:17:27,072
<i>Tom, come back. Please come back now.</i>

934
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:29,544
After she spent the whole week
making this meal,

935
01:17:29,613 --> 01:17:30,944
do you like to see her drinking?

936
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:32,175
- You have no idea...
- No! No!

937
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:34,740
...what you're talking about.
- You make her do this.

938
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,115
She is miserable here.

939
01:17:36,186 --> 01:17:37,983
<i>You make her miserable here!</i>

940
01:17:38,055 --> 01:17:41,991
<i>Come, please come. Tom, can you hear me?</i>

941
01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:43,458
...who's civilized!
- Tom, can you hear me?

942
01:17:43,527 --> 01:17:45,154
Please, just come back!

943
01:17:46,697 --> 01:17:49,564
<i>Tom, just come back.
Please, just come back.</i>

944
01:17:49,633 --> 01:17:51,191
<i>...you don't talk!</i>

945
01:18:03,414 --> 01:18:04,972
<i>I pretended I couldn't hear,</i>

946
01:18:06,216 --> 01:18:08,411
that the connection was bad.

947
01:18:09,153 --> 01:18:11,144
And she kept calling.

948
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,686
And I didn't pick up.

949
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,323
Why not?

950
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:21,756
Because someone
was finally giving it to him.

951
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:25,598
No one had ever stood up to him
like that, confronted him like that.

952
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:28,661
I wanted him to explode for me.

953
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,474
That's what I wanted Sami to do.

954
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:41,015
- Explode?
- Yes.

955
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:47,618
- How long did it last?
- I don't know.

956
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:52,423
He must have seen
that she was too drunk to drive.

957
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:59,591
I know... I know it's not my fault.

958
01:19:01,038 --> 01:19:03,063
But it is your fault.

959
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:07,067
You didn't answer her call for help.

960
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:09,635
If you had driven back,
you could have taken them home.

961
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:12,045
Sami wouldn't have had to drive.

962
01:19:16,854 --> 01:19:21,120
You have lived with this far too long
to deny your responsibility.

963
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,830
When I got back it was done.
They were gone.

964
01:19:31,668 --> 01:19:35,001
I walked in, my father's screaming
that he did it on purpose.

965
01:19:35,072 --> 01:19:36,164
Okay?

966
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,369
That he killed himself and Rachel.

967
01:19:38,442 --> 01:19:42,401
That he called from the car and said
he was going to kill himself and Rachel.

968
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:44,777
- Why?
- 'Cause he was a monster.

969
01:19:46,016 --> 01:19:50,510
That's what my dad always thought,
and now there's no one to disprove him.

970
01:19:53,557 --> 01:19:54,649
Okay?

971
01:19:56,226 --> 01:19:59,923
But Sami was not a monster.

972
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:02,624
No.

973
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,629
Not him.

974
01:21:24,281 --> 01:21:27,182
How long have you known
that Simon was their child?

975
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:30,079
The moment I was transferred to the school.

976
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:33,187
The moment I saw his last name.

977
01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:40,726
It became my secret.

978
01:21:45,135 --> 01:21:46,727
Does Simon know?

979
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:49,663
No.

980
01:21:56,647 --> 01:21:58,376
I watched him grow.

981
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:04,412
I always saw him as Sami's child.

982
01:22:04,788 --> 01:22:07,757
Not the way he looks. His manner.

983
01:22:11,428 --> 01:22:17,492
These things became
much more complicated as Simon grew.

984
01:22:18,902 --> 01:22:22,565
And that's when you decided
to visit his house.

985
01:22:23,407 --> 01:22:25,136
I used to drive by.

986
01:22:26,476 --> 01:22:31,379
I would watch him inside,
playing with Simon, cooking.

987
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:33,382
He was a great cook.

988
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:43,884
I watched him put up
the Christmas decorations.

989
01:22:44,528 --> 01:22:47,258
That was very generous of him,

990
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:51,367
coming from the upbringing he had.

991
01:22:58,742 --> 01:23:02,200
I'm sorry. I should have never done that,

992
01:23:02,879 --> 01:23:04,870
come to the house.

993
01:23:06,183 --> 01:23:08,208
What were you expecting to find?

994
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,847
I don't know.

995
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:15,288
I don't.

996
01:23:30,841 --> 01:23:32,399
Thanks, man.

997
01:26:25,582 --> 01:26:27,846
<i>You can sell the violin now, Tom.</i>

998
01:26:28,818 --> 01:26:30,752
<i>You have my permission.</i>

999
01:26:34,724 --> 01:26:37,887
<i>Remember when I asked you
about cutting the scroll off?</i>

1000
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:42,857
<i>Well, it's something that I had to do.</i>

1001
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:46,267
<i>It's kind of hard to describe why.</i>

1002
01:26:47,904 --> 01:26:51,305
<i>I don't think it'll affect the value very much</i>

1003
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:55,040
<i>since it doesn't change the sound.</i>

1004
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:59,180
<i>I hope it'll pay for all the things
that we'll need.</i>

1005
01:27:59,676 --> 01:28:01,871
I'm going to the Holy Land.

1006
01:28:02,512 --> 01:28:04,275
It's all the Holy Land.

1007
01:28:13,123 --> 01:28:15,250
<i>I can feel the baby kicking.</i>

1008
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:44,146
Grandpa, I really need to know
what happened that night.

1009
01:28:45,055 --> 01:28:47,148
He was going to kill her.

1010
01:28:49,192 --> 01:28:52,889
- He called and said...
- He could have called to apologize

1011
01:28:52,962 --> 01:28:56,796
or to find out if I was back.
Or it could have been my mother.

1012
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:06,158
Would you like to come in?

1013
01:30:07,871 --> 01:30:09,304
For coffee?

1014
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:15,772
Must be strange
to see those wedding photographs.

1015
01:30:16,446 --> 01:30:18,539
He never said he wasn't married.

1016
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:21,809
It's part of the reason
my dad was so suspicious of him.

1017
01:30:22,485 --> 01:30:26,888
- If he could do that to me...
- That sort of idea, yeah.

1018
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:31,187
Except your father did not know me.

1019
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:35,260
If he did, maybe he would understand
what Sami was running away from.

1020
01:30:35,465 --> 01:30:37,433
What do you mean?

1021
01:30:38,468 --> 01:30:42,302
- I have strange ways.
- Yes, you do.

1022
01:30:43,973 --> 01:30:46,373
You thought I was crazy. You thought...

1023
01:30:46,443 --> 01:30:51,312
You told Simon that people dressed like me
don't come to your part of town.

1024
01:30:52,682 --> 01:30:56,345
- You had him record the conversation?
- He told me about it.

1025
01:30:58,121 --> 01:31:01,682
You were testing me to see if I'd explode.

1026
01:31:02,492 --> 01:31:03,652
Yeah?

1027
01:31:04,694 --> 01:31:07,993
- And you refused to let that happen.
- Yeah. Not in front of Simon.

1028
01:31:08,731 --> 01:31:12,292
And if Simon wasn't there,
would you have beaten me?

1029
01:31:12,368 --> 01:31:15,963
- Like you attacked that man today?
- He was going to vomit on us.

1030
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:22,571
What if I did that now?

1031
01:31:23,613 --> 01:31:25,740
Hey. Stop it.

1032
01:31:30,587 --> 01:31:33,021
Do you think I would do that?

1033
01:31:33,089 --> 01:31:37,458
- Vomit on my own rug to prove a point?
- I'm not sure.

1034
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:41,025
You must think I'm capable of anything.

1035
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:45,096
Isn't it best to stay away
from people like me?

1036
01:31:48,972 --> 01:31:50,132
Maybe.

1037
01:31:51,207 --> 01:31:54,370
Except people like me are everywhere,

1038
01:31:55,144 --> 01:31:57,908
people who are capable of anything,

1039
01:31:58,414 --> 01:32:02,851
capable of seeking justice, seeking revenge.

1040
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:07,784
- For what?
- I lost my entire family in Lebanon.

1041
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:13,319
One day I came back home from school
and they were wiped out, just like that.

1042
01:32:18,301 --> 01:32:20,166
Sami was my salvation.

1043
01:32:22,338 --> 01:32:26,365
He provided me
with something I could believe in.

1044
01:32:29,913 --> 01:32:32,507
I don't know what you expect from us.

1045
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:38,852
I would like to be a part of Simon's life.

1046
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:43,049
Why?

1047
01:32:44,227 --> 01:32:45,819
He's all I have.

1048
01:32:48,765 --> 01:32:51,825
I was never upset at my husband
for leaving me.

1049
01:32:52,936 --> 01:32:54,699
I can't explain why.

1050
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:58,606
Your sister was from such a different world,

1051
01:32:58,675 --> 01:33:00,666
and she gave him a child.

1052
01:33:01,978 --> 01:33:03,741
Sami wanted a child.

1053
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:17,723
You're going to have to pay for the ticket.
The tow was free.

1054
01:33:34,043 --> 01:33:35,271
<i>Grandpa.</i>

1055
01:33:36,012 --> 01:33:39,311
<i>I really need to know
what happened that night.</i>

1056
01:33:39,716 --> 01:33:41,911
<i>He was going to kill her.</i>

1057
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,683
<i>- He called and said...
- He could have called to apologize</i>

1058
01:33:47,757 --> 01:33:51,420
<i>or to find out if I was back.
It could have been my mother calling.</i>

1059
01:33:55,665 --> 01:33:58,429
<i>You have to believe me, Simon.</i>

1060
01:34:00,203 --> 01:34:02,364
<i>Your father was a killer.</i>

1061
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:07,859
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

1062
01:35:11,741 --> 01:35:14,733
I didn't think it was appropriate.

1063
01:35:16,412 --> 01:35:18,073
Yeah, good call.

1064
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,111
He looked happy.

1065
01:35:24,454 --> 01:35:25,648
He was.

1066
01:35:26,756 --> 01:35:28,246
We were happy.

1067
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,059
And then what happened?

1068
01:35:33,996 --> 01:35:35,793
Then he met your mom.

1069
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,824
You let him go.

1070
01:35:39,335 --> 01:35:40,359
No.

1071
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:43,467
I never let him go.
