1
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:05,601
Oh, my God.
I love this chicken.

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:07,186
Oh, you know
what they say,

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:10,689
best things in life
are free.

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,658
Okay, you're right.
I eat your food a lot.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,609
Now, how about this?

6
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,410
You can raid my fridge
anytime you want.

7
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:17,196
Oh, that's
very kind of you.

8
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:20,365
Next time I have a hankering to
wash down a D-cell battery

9
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,034
with a jar of
old pickle juice,

10
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:24,453
I'll come a-knockin'.

11
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:26,622
Hey, Raj, you didn't
send your RSVP in.

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,541
I'm suppose to ask you if you're
bringing someone to the wedding.

13
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:31,343
I'll let you know.

14
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,678
Well, can you make it soon?

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,713
There's a battle royale going on
over the seating charts.

16
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:38,416
In one corner, Bernadette's mom,
in the other three, mine.

17
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:41,270
Yeah, I hate
wedding receptions.

18
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,688
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,106
would take a cue
from Bilbo Baggins.

20
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:47,276
Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

21
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:50,112
Mm, you liked
Professor Geyser's wedding.

22
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,681
They had a
make-your-own-sundae bar.

23
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:55,067
Oh, that was
a night to remember.

24
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:59,571
Do you know, on one trip,
I just had a bowl of nuts.

25
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,324
Anyway, you got to let me know
if you have a plus one.

26
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:04,626
Because if not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor

27
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:07,079
who sucked the fat
out of her neck.

28
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,134
All right, uh, fine.

29
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,136
I'm coming and
I'm bringing somebody.

30
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,587
Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

31
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:16,454
Who you bringing?

32
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:17,556
Who are you bringing?!

33
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,843
He's bringing me;
who are you bringing?

34
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:24,629
Wow, what a bunch of
Nosey O'Donnells.

35
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,164
Come on, who is it?

36
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,016
I'm not telling.

37
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:31,069
I'm from Asia,
I'm mysterious, deal with it.

38
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,823
Howard aren't having
a make-your-own-sundae bar?

39
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,658
I don't think so.

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,693
Well, you should.

41
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,745
50% of marriages end in divorce,

42
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:43,565
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.

53
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,910
Hello, Mummy, Daddy.
How are you?

54
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,995
Pretty good.
Can't complain.

55
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,564
Oh, I'm sure you can.

56
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,233
Just give it a minute.

57
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,651
Listen, uh,

58
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,870
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

59
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,423
I wasn't ready until now, but...

60
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,990
I think it's time.

61
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,542
It's finally happening.

62
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:35,145
You're coming out of
the closet, aren't you?

63
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,049
We love you, and we accept
your alternate lifestyle.

64
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,369
Just... keep it to yourself.

65
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,088
No, I'm not gay.

66
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:48,191
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

67
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,326
What's that?

68
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,027
It means I like women

69
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:53,280
as well as
their skin-care products.

70
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,998
Well, if you're
not coming out,

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,934
why did you call us during
the cricket semifinals?

72
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,071
I'm tired of trying
to meet someone,

73
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:04,791
and I think I'd like you
to help me find a...

74
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,660
a wife.

75
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,678
And just to clarify...

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,447
a female wife?

77
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,799
Yes!

78
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,802
Matchmaking--
very smart move, son.

79
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,954
Much better than
marrying for love.

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,362
We married for love.

81
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:29,032
And it's been
wonderful!

82
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,555
Quantum physics
makes me so happy.

83
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:36,907
Yeah, I'm glad.

84
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,593
It's like looking
at the universe naked.

85
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,252
Hi. Guys got a minute?

86
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,504
Sure. What's up?

87
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,072
Well, I was thinking about
Sheldon's little joke

88
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:55,208
the other night about me
eating all your food.

89
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,377
Oh! That was no joke.
But...

90
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,379
I understand your confusion,

91
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,465
as I am our group's
resident cutup.

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,201
I'm sorry,

93
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,102
you are our resident cutup?

94
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:08,438
Yes.

95
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,423
Oh, prove it.

96
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,475
Knock-knock.

97
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,143
- Who's there?
- Interrupting physicist.

98
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,062
Interrupting phys...
Muon!

99
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:21,434
Anyway, I got a little residual
check from my commercial,

100
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:23,587
and I thought, hey,
how about I get the guys

101
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,939
a little thank you
to pay them back?

102
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:26,773
So, Sheldon...

103
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,575
ta-da!

104
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:31,277
A vintage mint-in-box

105
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,280
1975 Mego <i>Star Trek</i>
Transporter

106
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,749
with real transporter action.

107
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,617
Hot darn!

108
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:40,253
Where did you get that?

109
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:41,721
From Stuart,
at the comic book store.

110
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:44,808
You went to the
comic book store by yourself?

111
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,476
Yeah. It was fun.

112
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,813
I walked in, and two different
guys got asthma attacks.

113
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,799
Felt pretty good.

114
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,318
This calls for an
expression of gratitude.

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,071
Ooh, am I about to get
a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

116
00:04:58,073 --> 00:05:00,407
No, not this time.
Then they wouldn't be special.

117
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,808
Thanks, Penny.

118
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,161
You're welcome.

119
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,163
Don't worry,
I didn't forget about you.

120
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,481
Oh...

121
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,700
Leonard, I got you...

122
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,602
a label-maker!

123
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,661
Wow...

124
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,046
No, it's great.

125
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,999
- Also mint-in-box.
- Mm.

126
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,351
And I got you
a transporter, too!

127
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:29,886
Awesome!

128
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,642
Look, it was actually
designed for

129
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:37,176
my vintage Mr. Spock
action figure.

130
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:39,429
Oh, that's great! Let's open
them up and put him in there.

131
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,481
- Open it?!
- Oh, good Lord, no!

132
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,700
Why? They're just toys.

133
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:45,869
- They're collectibles.
- They're mint-in-box.

134
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:47,621
Come on. Can't we open
one up and take a look?

135
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,856
No, don't!

136
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,993
Once you open the box,
it loses its value.

137
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,329
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the
same lecture about my virginity.

138
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,333
Gotta tell you,
it was a lot more fun

139
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,519
taking it out
and playing with it.

140
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,874
Are you sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

141
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:08,842
Oh, yes.

142
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:10,010
In my culture, it's expected

143
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:12,012
to have a chaperone
to oversee a first date.

144
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,598
Plus, I want to make a good
impression, and no offense,

145
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,351
but with you guys here,
I look like I'm six-two.

146
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,856
The nuns always chaperoned
the dances at my high school.

147
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:26,993
They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

148
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,528
Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

149
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,531
Except they leave room
for a cow.

150
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:35,085
Listen, I love your charming
racist humor, but any chance

151
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,454
you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

152
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:39,673
Yesterday, you made fun of me
for eating lox.

153
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41,675
It's different, your people
don't worship lox.

154
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:44,728
Clearly, you've never been
to brunch with my cousins.

155
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,631
So, arranged marriages--
the parents just decide

156
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,432
and then you have
to get married?

157
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,351
No, no, I get a say in it.

158
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,553
But I'm sure whoever shows up
will be better company

159
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:54,888
than the threesome
I've been having

160
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,440
with Aunt Jemima
and Mrs. Butterworth.

161
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,061
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

162
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:01,945
Ah, yes.

163
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:02,979
You must be Lakshmi.

164
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,263
Uh, nice to meet you.

165
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,732
Nice to meet you, too.

166
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,101
Oh! These are my friends.

167
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,786
- This is Bernadette.
- Hello.

168
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,655
- And this is Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

169
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:14,207
- You, too.
- Please, have a seat.

170
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,910
I'm thinking double wedding.

171
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:24,334
<i>Dr. Cooper.</i>

172
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:29,272
<i>Dr. Cooper?</i>

173
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,507
Is someone there?

174
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,109
<i>Down here.</i>
<i>On your desk.</i>

175
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:38,798
Spock?

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,668
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

177
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,804
Fascinating.

178
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:48,158
The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

179
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,994
<i>It is not the only</i>
<i>logical explanation.</i>

180
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,563
<i>For example,</i>
<i>you could be hallucinating</i>

181
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:58,068
<i>after being hit on the head</i>
<i>by, say, a coconut.</i>

182
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,821
Was I hit on the head
by a coconut?

183
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,792
<i>I am not going to</i>
<i>dignify that with a response.</i>

184
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:08,244
<i>Now to the matter at hand.</i>

185
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,814
<i>You need to play</i>
<i>with the transporter toy.</i>

186
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,265
But it's mint-in-box.

187
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,416
<i>Yes.</i>

188
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:15,502
<i>And to open it</i>
<i>would destroy its value.</i>

189
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:18,455
<i>But remember, like me,</i>

190
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,523
<i>you also have a human half.</i>

191
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:24,510
Well, I'm not going to
dignify that with a response.

192
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,930
<i>Consider this.</i>

193
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,798
<i>What is the purpose of a toy?</i>

194
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
To be played with.

195
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:33,203
<i>Therefore, to not</i>
<i>play with it would be...?</i>

196
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,704
Illogical.

197
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:38,357
Damn it, Spock, you're right.

198
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,627
I'll do it.

199
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,195
<i>Sheldon, wait.</i>

200
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:44,748
<i>You have to wake up first.</i>

201
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,866
Oh, of course.

202
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:50,186
Set phasers to dumb, right?

203
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,872
Goodie, goodie, goodie!

204
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,676
This is wrong, this is wrong.

205
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,229
I'm so excited,
but this is wrong.

206
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:03,850
I'm going to do it.

207
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,602
I'm doing it.

208
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,654
I did it.

209
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:15,078
That's what I always thought
1975 smelled like.

210
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:21,501
One to beam down,
Mr. Scott.

211
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,336
Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

212
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,871
Energize.

213
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,360
Energize.

214
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:41,971
No. No.

215
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,973
Don't be broken.

216
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:46,609
Oh, please, don't be broken.

217
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:51,564
What did you make me do?!

218
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,868
Okay, okay, think.

219
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,493
It's only logical.

220
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,190
My goodness,

221
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,807
that was delicious.

222
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:17,610
Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

223
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,161
Impressive.

224
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:21,615
What goes into
making something like that?

225
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,333
Well, you start
out by trying to

226
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:26,386
make chocolate soufflé,
and when it falls, you panic,

227
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,289
quickly change the name,
and voila, lava cake.

228
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,593
I bet our parents are dying to
know how things are going here.

229
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,545
Well, let's see.

230
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,715
Yep, three missed calls.

231
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:40,517
Four missed calls,
two text messages

232
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,585
and a failed video chat.
I win!

233
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,857
So, what are
we going to tell them?

234
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,693
I'd like to tell them
things are going well.

235
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:50,861
Me, too.

236
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,529
But before we get
their hopes up,

237
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,981
we should probably make sure
we're on the same page.

238
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:56,900
Okay.

239
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:59,286
What page are you on?

240
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,570
I'm on the one

241
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,739
where I'm under
a lot of pressure

242
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,275
from my parents to get married
and settle down

243
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:06,910
and have a family,

244
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:10,063
and I'm going to do it
so they don't find out I'm gay.

245
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,134
Say again?

246
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,468
I'm gay.

247
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,238
Like... dude-on-dude,

248
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,874
but with women?

249
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:23,343
I know a fake marriage
isn't an honest way to live,

250
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,795
but you of all people
should know how difficult it is

251
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,297
to come out in our culture.

252
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,133
Why me of all people?!

253
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:32,586
Well, there's a rumor
back in New Delhi that you're--

254
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,087
how shall we say--

255
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,740
comfortable in a sari.

256
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,825
I'm not gay!

257
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,327
Really? The chocolate lava cake,

258
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,996
the little soaps
in the bathroom, and I'm sorry,

259
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:45,699
but you're wearing
more perfume than I am.

260
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:50,170
That's Unbreakable
by Khloe and Lamar.

261
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,872
And for your information,
it's unisex.

262
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,591
Fill in the blank.

263
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,326
I love the nightlife...

264
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:57,777
I like to boogie.

265
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,828
Got you.

266
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,465
With women! I like
to boogie with women!

267
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,401
That's disappointing.

268
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:07,103
You were exactly the kind
of phony-baloney husband

269
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,672
I was looking for.

270
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,340
Thank you.

271
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:14,311
And once again, my
baloney likes girls.

272
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:16,679
W-W-Wait!

273
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,898
You don't want to put a
bite of that in your mouth

274
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,334
without trying my
homemade Chantilly cream.

275
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,005
Yeah, okay,
that time I heard it.

276
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,637
Oh, dear.

277
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,140
Two suns and no sunscreen.

278
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,213
<i>Hello again, Sheldon.</i>

279
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,085
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

280
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,153
I am very disappointed in you.

281
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,756
You broke your toy
<i>and switched it with Leonard's.</i>

282
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:02,125
<i>You should be</i>
<i>ashamed of yourself.</i>

283
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:04,861
You're the one who told
me to play with it.

284
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:07,163
<i>If I told you to jump off</i>
<i>the bridge of the</i> Enterprise,

285
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:08,631
<i>would you do it?</i>

286
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,534
Oh, if I got on the bridge
of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

287
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:14,120
I would never, ever leave.

288
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:18,274
<i>Trust me, it gets old</i>
<i>after a while.</i>

289
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,778
<i>You must right</i>
<i>your wrongs, Sheldon.</i>

290
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,746
Why? I got away with it.

291
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:27,267
Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it,

292
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,052
so he won't know it's broken.

293
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:31,388
And I have a toy
that isn't broken.

294
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,722
Everybody's happy.

295
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,474
<i>Well, I am unhappy.</i>

296
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,410
I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

297
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:41,981
<i>I come from a factory</i>
<i>in Taiwan.</i>

298
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,451
<i>Now, do the right thing.</i>

299
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,119
You know what you are?

300
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,272
Well, you're
a green-blooded buzz kill.

301
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,774
Perhaps it's time
you beam on out of here.

302
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:52,709
Fine.

303
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,861
<i>I will just use</i>
<i>the transporter.</i>

304
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:56,129
Oh, right.

305
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:58,565
<i>You broke it.</i>

306
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,750
Very well.

307
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,837
Cooper to <i>Enterprise,</i>
one to beam up.

308
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,972
Energize.

309
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:20,120
Tiny Spock, help.

310
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,326
Ready for lunch?

311
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,777
Yeah, one sec.

312
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,996
Oh, good.
Ma would've killed me

313
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:33,366
if she found out
I broke my retainer.

314
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,252
Hey, uh...

315
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:38,654
can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

316
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,540
Yeah, sure.
How are things going?

317
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,342
We hit a couple
of bumps.

318
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,510
She lives
over in Manhattan Beach,

319
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:45,628
so it takes, like, an hour
to get there.

320
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,064
And she's a lesbian.

321
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,217
What do you mean,
"she's a lesbian"?

322
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,470
Well, you know how
whenever you and I would try

323
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,838
to hit on women in bars
and they'd blow us off

324
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,024
and then we'd tell each other
they were probably gay?

325
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,025
It's like that.

326
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,011
Except this time, it's true.

327
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,347
Then why did she even
go out with you?

328
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:05,648
She was looking

329
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,034
for a husband so she can
appear to be straight.

330
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,285
And, you know,

331
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,905
it sounded crazy
to me at first...

332
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:15,024
but I'm actually
thinking about doing it.

333
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:18,545
Okay, so the reason
that might sound crazy...

334
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,914
is 'cause it's <i>crazy!</i>

335
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,916
Look, Howard,
you're in a relationship.

336
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,418
You know you have
to make compromises.

337
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,138
Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy

338
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,757
or whose turn
it is to do the laundry,

339
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,675
Bernadette's or my mom's.

340
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:37,814
It's a great deal.

341
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,549
We both get our parents
off our backs,

342
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,152
I don't have to come home to an
empty apartment every night.

343
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,821
Plus, once I'm married, I
can finally eat carbs again

344
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,574
and let myself go.

345
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,892
Why don't you
tell your parents

346
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:52,278
you want to try
to find someone else?

347
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,331
Maybe one who hasn't slept with
more woman than you.

348
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,951
Because this one
wants to marry me.

349
00:15:57,953 --> 00:16:00,903
I might never find
another one who does.

350
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:03,089
So you're seriously thinking
about marrying someone

351
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,091
you're never gonna
have sex with?

352
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:06,543
I can't believe your attitude.

353
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,629
I thought you were in favor
of gay people getting married.

354
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,883
Yes, to other gay people!

355
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:18,071
Do you hear how
homophobic you sound?

356
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:01,297
Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

357
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,153
Nothing!

358
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:08,655
What?

359
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,857
Nothing. I said nothing.

360
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,858
That was weird.

361
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,193
Really? I don't
even notice anymore.

362
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:18,147
I cannot believe you guys
aren't gonna play with these.

363
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,149
Well, I told you, you don't.
It's mint-in-box.

364
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,986
I don't know.
I just think it's a waste.

365
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,993
Relax. I'm just
looking at the box.

366
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,679
Perhaps you should
look with your eyes

367
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:35,998
and not your muscular
Nebraska man hands.

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,001
What is your problem?!

369
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:42,171
My problem is that I don't want
you to break Leonard's toy.

370
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:44,057
Which you probably
did by shaking it!

371
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,893
She shook it,
we all saw her.

372
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:48,194
Leonard, I bought you this

373
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,229
'cause I wanted you
to have fun with it.

374
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,198
I don't want it
to sit in this box.

375
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,817
You know,
you're right.

376
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:55,952
I mean,
it's from you,

377
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:58,204
I'm never
gonna sell it.

378
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,689
- I'm opening it.
- Yes!

379
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,803
- It's broken.
- What?

380
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:15,922
Oh, nice job, man hands!

381
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,341
I didn't break it.

382
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:21,427
I guess Stuart
sold it to me like this.

383
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,013
Yes. Yes, he did.

384
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:27,483
That is a perfectly satisfying
and plausible explana...

385
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,202
Let's all be mad at Stuart!

386
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,071
You know, I paid
a lot for this.

387
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,889
Let's take it
over there and show him.

388
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,375
Absolutely.

389
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,078
Wait!

390
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,750
It was me.

391
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,086
I opened your toy...

392
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:51,040
discovered it was broken
and didn't tell you.

393
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,626
Why would you
open mine?

394
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:55,845
I didn't. That was a lie.

395
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,598
I opened my own toy...

396
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,135
and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

397
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:04,604
You should talk
to Stuart.

398
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:06,706
I can't, because that was a lie.

399
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,309
Yours was broken
in an earthquake--

400
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,729
and that's a lie.

401
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:16,432
What is the truth?

402
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,202
My Mr. Spock doll
came to me in a dream

403
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:20,953
and forced me to open it.

404
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:25,041
And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

405
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,109
Later, he encouraged me
to do the right thing,

406
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,444
and I defied him.

407
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:31,748
And then I was attacked
by a Gorn.

408
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:37,670
Okay, that I believe.

409
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:40,122
Leonard, Penny, I just,
I want you both to know

410
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,458
that I regret my actions
towards the two of you.

411
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,460
That's a lie.

412
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:47,013
So, is that one mine?

413
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,014
Yes.

414
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:50,099
Well, hand it over
so I can open it.

415
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,734
Okay.

416
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:54,470
And, Leonard, even though
I don't have one anymore,

417
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,806
I hope you have fun
playing with it.

418
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,659
And that's a lie, right?
It's a big, fat whopper.

419
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:02,995
I hope it breaks.

420
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,079
This is a treat.

421
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,946
What brings
you guys by?

422
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,299
Raj, Howie told me what's
going on with you and Lakshmi.

423
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,834
You told her?

424
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:23,270
I told everybody.

425
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,173
We believe there's
someone out there

426
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,675
who will love
you for you.

427
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:29,543
Actually, we kind of
agreed to disagree

428
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,595
on that one,
but we both think

429
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,830
you shouldn't
marry this woman.

430
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,833
So, while I'm waiting for
this mysterious perfect match

431
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,187
who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

432
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,523
Not necessarily.
I think

433
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:46,443
we found someone
for you to cuddle with.

434
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,446
Oh, my goodness.

435
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,683
Aren't you the cutest
little Yorkie ever!

436
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,686
You got him for me?

437
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,074
Her. We thought you two
would hit it off.

438
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:01,525
I think we already have.

439
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,360
Thank you guys so much.

440
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:07,416
Let's go see
if you fit in my man purse.

441
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,054
Heterosexual, my ass.

442
