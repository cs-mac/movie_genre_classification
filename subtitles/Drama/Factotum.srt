1
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:33,156
Mr. Chinaski! Hey!

2
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,784
Come on over here!

3
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,921
- You've got a drivers license, don't you?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:42,601
I got a driver out sick today.

5
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:44,801
We've got some rush orders
we need to get out right away.

6
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,602
I need you to make these deliveries.

7
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,032
Hi, Chi...!

8
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:41,834
Feeling bad?

9
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,420
I've felt better.

10
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:52,751
I've probably slept longer
than you've lived.

11
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,225
Chinaski, you're fired.

12
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,468
Do you have a room?

13
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:03,730
- It's $150 a week.
- All right.

14
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:08,301
- Are you employed?
- Self employed.

15
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,271
- May I ask what you do?
- I'm a writer.

16
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,233
Have you written books?

17
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,220
Well, I'm not ready for a novel... yet.

18
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,599
OK.

19
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,500
Now most guys think
they know how to drive.

20
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,601
But the fact is,
very few people know how to drive.

21
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,418
They just steer.

22
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:36,848
Every day I see 2-3 people simply run
through red lights like they didn't exist.

23
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,720
The lives people live
are driving them crazy,

24
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:42,521
and their insanity comes out
in the way they drive.

25
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:48,392
I'm not here to tell you how to live.
I'm here to teach you how to drive.

26
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,854
Now when is the only time
a man can lose control of his cab

27
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:52,955
and he won't be able to help it?

28
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,840
When I get a hard on?

29
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,785
Mendoza, if you can't drive with a hard on
we can't use you.

30
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:03,122
Some of our best men drive with
hard ons all day long. All night too.

31
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,876
Now come on: when is the only time a man
can one lose control of his cab

32
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:07,277
and he won't be able to help it?

33
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:09,712
Yes, Chinaski?

34
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,842
A man might lose control
over his cab when he sneezed.

35
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:18,520
That is correct.

36
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,181
Alright. When you sneeze,
what do you do?

37
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:32,032
- Are you Henry Chinaski?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,876
Follow me.

39
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,098
Sit down.

40
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:45,862
We ran a check on you, Chinaski.

41
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:52,010
You have 18 drunk and disorderly arrests
and one for drunk driving.

42
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,311
You lied to us.

43
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,766
Yeah, there were two for drunk driving.

44
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:59,067
You falsified your application.
You're disqualified.

45
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,390
Could you call me a cab?

46
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:15,811
As we live we all get caught
and torn by various traps.

47
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,755
Writing can trap you.

48
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:23,893
Some writers tend to write what has
pleased their readers in the past.

49
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:27,480
They hear accolades and believe them.

50
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:32,843
There is only one final judge
of writing and that is the writer.

51
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:38,325
When he is swayed by the critics,
the editors, the publishers, the readers,

52
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:39,926
then he's finished.

53
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:44,570
And of course when he's
swayed with his fame and his fortune,

54
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:48,383
you can float him
down the river with the turds.

55
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:52,736
- A writer?
- Yes.

56
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:56,364
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not.

57
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,784
Why do you want to work
in a pickle factory?

58
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:04,580
- It reminds me of my grandmother.
- It does?

59
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:10,136
She used to serve me pickles
whenever I visited her.

60
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:16,158
- What do you write?
- Mostly short stories.

61
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,762
- I'm half way through a novel.
- What's it about?

62
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,825
Everything.

63
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:27,426
You mean for instance
it's about cancer?

64
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,529
Yes.

65
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,649
How about my wife?

66
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:36,328
She's in there too.

67
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:03,707
I wrote 3 or 4 short stories a week.
I kept things in the mail.

68
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:08,029
I imagined how the editors at
The New Yorker must be reacting.

69
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:11,558
Hey, here's another one
of those things from that nut!

70
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:19,073
I sent most of them to John Martin.
His magazine, Black Sparrow, I admired.

71
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:52,221
Chinaski?
You want to step in here for a minute?

72
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,189
Mr. Gentry is a writer too.

73
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,139
I told him that you were a writer and
he wanted to meet you.

74
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,740
You don't mind, do you?

75
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,693
I don't mind.

76
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,623
Mr. Gentry is a friend of mine.

77
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,994
Do you mind if I leave?

78
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,289
OK.

79
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,863
That scene in the office
stayed with me.

80
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:23,064
Those cigars, the fine clothes...

81
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,498
I thought of good steaks.

82
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:31,520
Long rides up winding driveways
that led to beautiful homes.

83
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:35,357
Ease. Trips to Europe.

84
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,477
Fine women.

85
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:49,286
Chinaski, what are you doing?
Get back, get back to work.

86
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,815
- Your shift's not over.
- I'm going out to get a drink.

87
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,801
- No, no. You can't get a drink.
- What?

88
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:55,402
Come on, get back to work.
Over here.

89
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:57,103
All right, all right.

90
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:02,807
Get off me!

91
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,372
No!

92
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,696
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

93
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,165
I don't need this!

94
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,029
And then I met Jan.

95
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:40,708
I bought her a drink and
she gave me her phone number.

96
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:44,546
Three days later
I moved into her apartment.

97
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:07,366
Jan had a 500-dollar car.

98
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,545
The big trick with that car
was how to turn on the headlights.

99
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,874
Of course we had
the advantage of broken springs.

100
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:45,368
Jan was an excellent fuck.

101
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:51,273
She had a tight pussy. And she took
it like it was a knife that was killing her.

102
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,759
Hey, I want to know
what time it is!

103
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,954
You said you'd fix the clock.

104
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:59,835
All right, let's see...

105
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:17,806
We set the clock
by the TV at midnight last night.

106
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:22,444
We know that it gains
35 minutes every hour.

107
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,507
It says 7:30 p.m. right now.

108
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:29,808
But we know that's not right
because it's not dark enough yet - okay.

109
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,787
That's 7 1/2 hours.

110
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:37,190
Seven times 35 minutes...

111
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,236
That's 245 minutes.

112
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:45,899
One half of 35 is...

113
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,078
17 1/2.

114
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,330
It gives us...

115
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:59,002
252 1/2 minutes.

116
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:05,758
OK, that's... four hours and
42 1/2 minutes we owe them.

117
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:10,471
So we set the clock back to 5:47.
That's it.

118
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,274
It's 5:47.

119
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:17,561
It's dinner time
and we don't have anything to eat.

120
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:25,276
Let's open another jug of wine.
Should I make some pancakes?

121
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,997
I don't know if I can get
another one of them down.

122
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,398
Oh, come on.

123
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,875
Okay, put the pancakes on.

124
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,864
We're still out of butter.

125
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:45,010
- Well, fry them dry again.
- They'll be crisp. Real crisp.

126
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,047
It's okay, baby.

127
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,149
What was that?

128
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,071
What is that?

129
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,645
Is anyone in there?

130
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,641
Everybody out!

131
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,404
It's just the fire department.

132
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,309
I finally got hired at
a Bicycle Supply Warehouse.

133
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,646
I had to demean myself
to get that one.

134
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:26,192
I told them that I liked
to think of my job as a second home.

135
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,678
You play the horses?

136
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:30,981
Yeah.

137
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,584
Mind if I look at your paper?

138
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:38,570
Sure.

139
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:53,425
- My Boy Bobby ought to take the eight.
- I know. They don't even have him on top.

140
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,728
- All the better.
- What do you think he'll pay?

141
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,814
About 9 to 2.

142
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,879
- What time does the last race go off?
- 5:30.

143
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:10,399
- We get off at 5:00.
- We'd never make it.

144
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:14,386
We can try.
The racetrack's not too far.

145
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,866
- Want to come along?
- Sure.

146
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,627
Keep your eye on the clock.
We'll cut out at five to five.

147
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:40,860
See, I told you we'd make it!

148
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,192
$200 on My Boy Bobby to win.

149
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,157
My Boy Bobby's in the front.
He's in the lead!

150
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,702
We've hooked ourselves a winner!

151
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:21,923
Unless some big-ass closer
comes out of the back of the pack.

152
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:26,067
Come on! Come on, Bobby!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

153
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,588
Yes! Yes!

154
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:30,389
We really should have bet
another $200 on that horse.

155
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:33,342
- Oh, you're right.
- Come on, let's go get a drink.

156
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:44,053
The next day at work
some of the other employees asked us

157
00:22:44,054 --> 00:22:46,154
if we would place bets for them.

158
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:49,991
Hank, we have to take their bets.

159
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,060
Manny, those guys
don't have any money.

160
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,664
All they've got is the coffee
and chewing gum money

161
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,065
that their wives give them.

162
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:01,259
We don't have time to waste
at the 2-dollar windows.

163
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:05,630
We're not going to bet their money,
we're going to keep their money.

164
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:09,808
- Suppose they win?
- They won't win.

165
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,838
They always pick
the wrong horse.

166
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,439
They have a way of
always picking the wrong horse.

167
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:19,034
Suppose they bet our horse?

168
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:22,070
Then we know
we've got the wrong horse.

169
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:30,336
I think she's going to do it.
I think she's going to do it.

170
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:34,197
Come on Spitfire! Let's go!
Go, Spitfire! Let's go!

171
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes! Way to go!

172
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,581
- You married, Manny?
- No way. No.

173
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,708
- Women?
- Sometimes.

174
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:17,245
- It never lasts.
- What's the problem?

175
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:21,866
A woman is like a full-time job.
You have to chose your profession.

176
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:24,670
Yeah, I suppose there is
an emotional drain.

177
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:29,215
Physical too.
They want to fuck night and day.

178
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:34,152
Well. Get one you like to fuck.

179
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:39,115
Yeah, but if you drink or gamble they
think it's a put down of their love.

180
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,635
Get one who
likes to drink, gamble and fuck.

181
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:44,797
Who wants a woman like that?

182
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:54,037
I bought some expensive clothes
and a good pair of shoes.

183
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:58,775
The owner of the bike supply warehouse
didn't look so powerful anymore.

184
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,778
Manny and I took
a little longer with our lunches

185
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:04,634
and came back smoking good cigars.

186
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:08,635
The new life didn't sit well with Jan.

187
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:14,456
She was used to her four fucks a day
and also used to seeing me poor and humble.

188
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,177
Mr. Horseplayer!

189
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,855
Mr. Big Horseplayer!

190
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:35,934
You know when I first met you, I liked
the way you walked across the room.

191
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:37,890
You didn't just
walk across the room.

192
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:39,791
You walked like you were
walking through walls.

193
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:42,591
Like you owned the place.
Like nothing mattered.

194
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:47,102
Now you've got a few bucks in your
pocket, you're not the same anymore.

195
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:50,355
You act like you're
a dental student or a plumber.

196
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:53,575
Don't give me any shit
about plumbers, Jan.

197
00:25:55,694 --> 00:26:00,481
- You haven't made love to me in two weeks.
- Love takes many forms.

198
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,293
- Mine has been more subtle.
- You haven't fucked me in two weeks.

199
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:09,423
Have some patience. In six months
we'll be vacationing in Rome, in Paris.

200
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,420
Look at you!
Pouring yourself that good whiskey

201
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:15,221
and letting me sit here,
drinking this rat-gut wine.

202
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:20,374
- Mr. Big-Time Horseplayer!
- I give you soul.

203
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:25,212
I give you wisdom and I give you light
and music and some laughter!

204
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:29,132
By the way,
I am the world's greatest horseplayer.

205
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,684
Horseshit!

206
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:34,313
No, horseplayer!

207
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:43,320
I understood too well that great
lovers were always men of leisure.

208
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:48,042
I fucked better as a bum
than as a puncher of time clocks.

209
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:09,427
You know I tried to make a woman out of you,
but you're nothing but a goddamn whore!

210
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,814
If anybody here doesn't like
what I just did, then say something!

211
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:42,775
Sit down, Chinaski.
You knew we were going to let you go.

212
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:45,372
Yeah, bosses are never hard to fathom.

213
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,673
You haven't been pulling your weight around
here for over a month and you know it.

214
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,793
You know a guy busts his damn ass
and you don't even appreciate it.

215
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:53,894
You haven't been
busting your ass, Chinaski!

216
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:57,296
I've given you my time.
Which is all I've got to give.

217
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:01,425
All any man has.
For a pitiful $6 an hour.

218
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:05,571
You remember, you begged for this job.
You said your job was your second home.

219
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:08,211
I give you my time, so you can live
in your big house.

220
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:12,712
Anybody's lost anything on this deal,
on this arrangement, I've been the loser.

221
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,082
- You understand?
- All right, Chinaski.

222
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,683
- All right?
- Yeah, just go.

223
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:18,902
Now Listen, Mantz.

224
00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:21,603
I don't want any trouble
about my unemployment payments.

225
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,757
You guys are always trying to cheat
the working man out of his rights.

226
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:27,458
So don't give me any trouble
or I'll be back to see you.

227
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:31,486
You'll get your unemployment.
Now get the hell out of here!

228
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:39,460
I didn't see Manny again, and I missed
the trips to the track with him.

229
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:43,231
But I had my winnings
and the bookie money.

230
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,809
I just sat around and Jan liked that.

231
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,720
After two weeks
I was on unemployment.

232
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:54,015
And we relaxed and fucked
and toured the bars.

233
00:28:54,224 --> 00:28:57,337
And every week I'd go
down to the unemployment,

234
00:28:57,438 --> 00:29:00,438
stand in line
and get my nice little check.

235
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,925
Hank?

236
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:06,428
I love you.

237
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,874
Here's a ten-dollar try
on the four with one and two.

238
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:48,023
The racetrack crowd
is the world brought down to size.

239
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:51,193
Life grinding against
death and losing.

240
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,738
Nobody wins finally,
we're only seeking a reprieve.

241
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:58,508
A moment out of the glare.

242
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:04,223
- Sir, you're in our seats.
- These seats aren't reserved.

243
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:06,624
There are no reserved seats
in this section.

244
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:09,919
I know there are no reserved seats
in this section.

245
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,920
But it's a common courtesy.

246
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:15,340
You see, some people
get here early.

247
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:19,394
Poor people, like you and me,
who can't afford reserved seats.

248
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:23,956
And they lay down newspapers
to indicate that these seats are saved.

249
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:27,527
Because if the poor aren't going to be
decent with one another.

250
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:29,228
nobody else is going to be.

251
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,055
I'm not poor.

252
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:36,042
If you can't be a gentleman,
at least don't be a hog.

253
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,787
Jan, sit down.

254
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:40,973
I'll stand.

255
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,716
Come on four.

256
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:02,201
Let's get a drink.

257
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,047
That man in our seats,
he's got nerve.

258
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:39,342
- I don't like the guy.
- He sure got your goat.

259
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,687
He was just a little guy.
What was I supposed to do with him?

260
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,783
Oh bullshit. If he'd been big
you wouldn't have done anything either.

261
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,676
What do you do for a living?

262
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:08,698
Real estate.

263
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,799
I make 500,000 a year.

264
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:17,385
Then why don't you
get yourself a reserved seat?

265
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,529
That's my prerogative.

266
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,849
- You know, you have the nicest blue eyes.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,619
You got a cigarette?

268
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:36,088
Pardon me Sir,
but you're in my seat.

269
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,689
Oh yeah? And what are you
going to do about it?

270
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,860
Pardon me.

271
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,021
Come on, baby.

272
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,221
How do you feel?

273
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,191
I feel bad.

274
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,578
I want to be alone.

275
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,075
You don't have enough love.
It's warped you.

276
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,058
People don't need love.

277
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,659
What they need is success
of some form or another.

278
00:35:55,068 --> 00:35:57,313
It can be love
but it doesn't have to be.

279
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,887
The Bible says:
'Love thy neighbor.'

280
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:09,349
That could also mean:
Leave him alone.

281
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:48,368
One half is yours.

282
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:54,056
- It's another woman, isn't it?
- No.

283
00:36:56,241 --> 00:37:00,312
- You don't love me anymore.
- Stop that shit, would you?

284
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:05,250
You're tired of fucking me,
aren't you?

285
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,425
Hank, stay with me.

286
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,952
Here, take it.

287
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,333
You'll manage.

288
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:00,918
Hank...

289
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:40,478
Even at my lowest times I can feel
the words bubbling inside of me.

290
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,180
And I had to get
the words down,

291
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:46,926
or be overcome
by something worse than death.

292
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:51,556
Words, not as precious things
but as necessary things.

293
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,826
Yet, when I begin to doubt
my ability to work the word,

294
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:02,515
I simply read another writer and then
I know I have nothing to worry about.

295
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:08,729
My contest is only with myself,
to do it right.

296
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:11,539
With power and force.

297
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,073
And delight and gamble.

298
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:50,126
Yes, I'll have a scotch, please.

299
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,850
Bartender, I'll have another one.

300
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,123
And get the little lady
whatever she's having.

301
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:39,587
That drink was my last.
I'm broke.

302
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,593
Are you serious?

303
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,816
- Do you have a place to stay?
- No.

304
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:57,712
And you haven't got any money,
or anything to drink?

305
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:00,799
No.

306
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:08,146
Two Evan Williams, a six-pack of beer,
two packs of cigarettes,

307
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:14,076
some chips,
some mixed nuts, some Alka-Seltzer,

308
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,188
and a good cigar.

309
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:21,033
- Cash or credit card?
- Charge it to Pierre.

310
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,719
I'll have to phone.

311
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,182
- Where are we going?
- My place.

312
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:37,048
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

313
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:11,521
- Do you like this kind of music?
- Yes.

314
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,960
Swell.

315
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,692
What?

316
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,446
You're great.
You think you're hot shit.

317
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,640
- No.
- Yes.

318
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:35,176
I can tell by the way you act.

319
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,104
I like you though.

320
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,390
I liked you right away.

321
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:43,669
Hike up your skirt.

322
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,606
- You like legs?
- Yes.

323
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,988
Hey, you're not
some maniac, are you?

324
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:56,989
There's a guy
who's been picking up girls.

325
00:42:56,997 --> 00:43:00,327
Cuts crossword puzzles
into their bodies with a pen knife.

326
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:03,528
No.

327
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:09,833
I write, but I'm not him.

328
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:18,092
Then there are guys who fuck you
and chop you into little pieces.

329
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:22,879
They find your ass
in a drainpipe in the ocean.

330
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:26,574
And your tit in a trash can downtown.

331
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,878
I stopped doing that, years ago.

332
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:19,516
Stay back from the door.

333
00:44:19,517 --> 00:44:22,117
He's got a camera that
let's him see who's at the door.

334
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:26,262
Let him just see me. And when
the buzzer sounds you follow me in.

335
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:38,371
- Sweetie, so good to see you!
- Pierre, hi!

336
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:43,963
How are you?

337
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:50,893
- Who's that guy?
- I want you to meet a friend of mine.

338
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:54,563
Pierre, this is Henry Chinaski.

339
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:59,025
- Good to know you, Pierre.
- Come on in.

340
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:02,730
Thank you. You're so good, Pierre.

341
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:03,731
############<18

342
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:11,328
Hi girls.
Hey, this is Henry Chinaski.

343
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:14,481
- Henry, this is Grace and this is Jerry.
- Ladies.

344
00:45:14,482 --> 00:45:15,982
- Hi there.
- How ya doin'?

345
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:21,460
Help yourself.

346
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,914
- So, what do you do?
- He's a writer.

347
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:37,110
I need somebody to do a libretto
for an opera I wrote.

348
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,747
It's called
The Emperor of San Francisco.

349
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:47,402
Did you know there was one who claimed
he was the Emperor of San Francisco?

350
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:52,615
- No, I didn't.
- It's a real story. It's very interesting.

351
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:55,969
You look like you've been around.

352
00:45:58,177 --> 00:45:59,856
You look like you've got class.

353
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:07,355
Would you like to hear
some music from my opera?

354
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:16,179
Yes, I'd like that very much,
if it's OK with you?

355
00:46:18,364 --> 00:46:19,474
Great.

356
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:19,321
He's a tight son of a bitch.

357
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,600
He likes to take care of the girls in
the bars who have no place to sleep.

358
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,137
But all he gives them
is food and a bed.

359
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,356
Never any money.

360
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:34,552
And they only have drinks
when he's drinking.

361
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,564
Jerry got to him one night, though.

362
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:42,125
He was horny.

363
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:46,345
He was chasing her around the table.

364
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:48,347
She said 'no'.

365
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:51,968
'Not unless you give me
a thousand bucks a month for life! '

366
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:58,290
He signed a piece of paper.

367
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:01,443
To give her $1000 a month.

368
00:48:03,152 --> 00:48:06,231
Even after he dies
his family will have to pay her.

369
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:13,004
Jerry is his main girl, though.

370
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,418
What about you?

371
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:23,830
Not for a long time.

372
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,437
I like you.

373
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:36,050
You do?

374
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:41,074
You watch, watch watch.

375
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:44,875
Tomorrow, if he comes out
with that sailor's cap on,

376
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:47,646
With that captain's cap?

377
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:51,047
That means we're
going out on his yacht.

378
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:54,617
Doctors made him get a yacht.

379
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:57,961
Is it a long one?

380
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,339
Sure.

381
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,641
We're going out on the yacht.

382
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,510
- We're going back.
- What for?

383
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:51,075
Grace is having one of those moments.
She won't speak to me.

384
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:53,876
She just stands there,
staring at the water.

385
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,004
I'm afraid she'll jump off the boat.
She can't swim.

386
00:50:57,612 --> 00:51:02,158
- Just give her 50 bucks!
- No. We're going back.

387
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,165
This happens every time
we try to go out.

388
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:17,163
Grace goes into one of her moods
and stands there staring at the ocean.

389
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:19,424
She's never going to jump overboard.

390
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:22,361
She hates water!

391
00:51:27,362 --> 00:51:30,262
Pierre died shortly after that.

392
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:35,839
Laura and I split up
and I never saw any of them again.

393
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:54,914
- Hi, mom.
- Is that you?

394
00:51:55,423 --> 00:51:56,633
Yeah.

395
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,878
I just need a place to sleep
for a couple of days.

396
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:03,857
Your bedroom is always waiting.

397
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:07,660
Your father's home.

398
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,210
Thanks, mom.

399
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:20,556
Hey, dad.

400
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:44,861
Thanks.

401
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,203
You got a job?

402
00:52:55,812 --> 00:52:56,805
No.

403
00:52:57,913 --> 00:53:00,358
Any man who wants work can find work.

404
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:04,463
Suppose you're right.

405
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:08,182
I can hardly believe you're my son.

406
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:12,177
You don't have any ambition.
You don't have any get-up-and-go.

407
00:53:13,186 --> 00:53:15,473
How the hell are you
going to make it in this world?

408
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,924
Still think you're a writer?

409
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:28,818
I'm still writing.

410
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:39,619
If you stay here I'll charge you
room and board plus laundry.

411
00:53:39,827 --> 00:53:44,232
When you get a job, what's yours we take
out of your wages till you're paid up.

412
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:50,054
You're drunk!

413
00:53:51,263 --> 00:53:52,275
Yes.

414
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:55,376
Where do you get the money to drink?
You don't have any money!

415
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,428
- I'll get a job.
- How?

416
00:53:59,137 --> 00:54:01,583
You know you act as if
I had murdered someone.

417
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:02,984
It's just as bad!

418
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:10,506
Are you finished?

419
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,611
Thanks for the food, mom.

420
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:20,182
- You're not hungry?
- No. I'm good, thank you.

421
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:46,939
Hey Robert, what do you say you and I
go out and have a few cocktails?

422
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:50,793
You mean you want to go drinking in the
middle of the week without a job?

423
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,563
Well that's when you
need a drink the most.

424
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:57,457
I'm warning you!

425
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:02,995
- I also need a piece of ass.
- What's he saying?

426
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:08,158
I said,
I also need a piece of ass.

427
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,098
Now you see the cartons.
We have three different types of cartons.

428
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:45,099
Each one printed differently.
This is for our Super Durable Brake Shoe.

429
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,869
This for our Super Brake Shoe.

430
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,107
And those are for our Standard Brake Shoe.
You run out, there's more cartons over here.

431
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:52,008
And these are the brake shoes.

432
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,260
They all look the same.
How do I tell them apart?

433
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:58,671
You don't. They're all the same.
You just divide them into thirds.

434
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,425
When you finish with this,
you come downstairs

435
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,926
and we'll find something else
for you to do. Okay?

436
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:06,895
- When do I start?
- You start now.

437
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:15,823
And absolutely no smoking.
Not up here.

438
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:17,924
You have to smoke,
you come downstairs, okay?

439
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:19,025
Got you.

440
00:56:53,505 --> 00:56:56,966
A poem is a city
filled with streets and sewers.

441
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:01,771
Filled with saints, heroes,
beggars, madmen.

442
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:05,015
Filled with banality and booze.

443
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:09,103
Filled with rain and thunder
and periods of drought.

444
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:11,988
A poem is a city at war.

445
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:15,367
It's a barbershop
filled with cynical drunks.

446
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,802
A poem is a city.

447
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:22,048
A poem is a nation.
A poem is the world.

448
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:28,078
I decided to look for Jan.

449
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:32,257
I toured the bars in our old
neighborhood looking for her.

450
00:57:32,465 --> 00:57:35,377
Whitey Jackson,
the bartender at the Pink Mule,

451
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:40,398
told me that she was working as
a chambermaid in a downtown hotel.

452
00:57:59,365 --> 00:58:01,093
Hank!

453
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:06,130
Jan.

454
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:09,558
Jesus! I thought
I'd never see you again!

455
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:11,936
Well, here I am.

456
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:19,217
Well come on.
Let me look at you.

457
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:23,053
You're thin.
You've lost weight.

458
00:58:23,122 --> 00:58:26,282
Well.
You're looking good.

459
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:29,201
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

460
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,604
- There's no one else?
- Nobody.

461
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:34,541
You know I can't stand people.

462
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,445
Well, it's good to see you working.

463
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:45,225
Come on.

464
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:06,218
- I'm embarrassed.
- I love you, you idiot.

465
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:09,063
We've fucked 800 times, so relax.

466
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:14,960
- Still like my legs?
- Hell yes.

467
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:18,780
Have you finished with your work?

468
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:23,126
All but Mr. Clark's room.
Mr. Clark doesn't care. He leaves me tips.

469
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:28,330
I'm not doing anything.
He just leaves me tips.

470
00:59:33,243 --> 00:59:35,654
- Jan?
- Yeah?

471
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:42,002
I love you, baby.

472
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:45,821
Bastard.

473
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:49,551
When I came home one night,
she had moved in with me.

474
01:00:05,472 --> 01:00:08,159
I decided to clean up the apartment.

475
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:12,438
I thought
I must be turning into a fag.

476
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,341
Where is she?

477
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,862
Where's the bitch
who cleaned the place, huh?

478
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,349
If I find her,
I'm going to kill her. I swear.

479
01:00:56,411 --> 01:00:58,456
You're going to pay for this, Chinaski.

480
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,640
She was continually using our
arguments to justify herself.

481
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:22,677
It was just a cover
for her own guilt.

482
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:26,363
She'd go off
with anyone she met in a bar.

483
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,325
And the lower and the dirtier he was
the better she liked it.

484
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:38,658
She left and I got drunk
for three days and three nights.

485
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:43,279
When I sobered up
I knew my job was gone.

486
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:54,331
Hello? I was told
you might be looking for reporters.

487
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,301
Please fill this out.

488
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:30,173
Bastard!

489
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:39,758
Apply this ointment
to the invaded parts

490
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:42,859
and wait 20-30 minutes
before washing it off.

491
01:02:42,866 --> 01:02:47,329
Under no circumstances leave it on
longer than 30 minutes.

492
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:48,898
Thank you.

493
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,529
Hell! 30 minutes?

494
01:03:15,037 --> 01:03:18,917
I'll leave it on all night
and kill every one of these fuckers.

495
01:03:44,932 --> 01:03:46,460
Shit!

496
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:50,546
Hank?

497
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:53,690
- You fucking whore!
- What?

498
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:57,768
- Look what you've done to me!
- God, what is it?

499
01:03:57,777 --> 01:04:00,363
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

500
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:03,302
I haven't fucked anybody else!
I got it from you.

501
01:04:03,303 --> 01:04:04,503
You're a carrier.

502
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:07,204
- A disease ridden slut!
- What?

503
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:09,921
Crabs, baby!
You gave me the crabs.

504
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:11,274
I don't have crabs.

505
01:04:11,275 --> 01:04:13,575
- Geraldine must have them.
- What?

506
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,895
I was staying with Geraldine,
sitting on her toilet.

507
01:04:15,903 --> 01:04:19,473
Oh, don't give me that shit!
You got it off a toilet seat?

508
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:23,176
- Give me a goddamn drink.
- Okay.

509
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:30,366
Yes, what do you want?

510
01:04:31,474 --> 01:04:32,684
Yes?

511
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,829
Yes?

512
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:38,257
As a reporter?

513
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:41,577
Not as a reporter?

514
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:44,863
What, today?

515
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,266
Okay. Thanks.

516
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:52,469
Who was that?

517
01:04:53,578 --> 01:04:57,023
- I got a job.
- I'll fix you up.

518
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,653
I can't wear pants.

519
01:05:04,588 --> 01:05:07,409
- I'll wrap you up in gauze.
- You think that's going to work?

520
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,610
Um-hm. I do.

521
01:05:09,327 --> 01:05:12,481
All right.
Easy does it.

522
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:18,860
- Put it right around...
- Easy.

523
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:25,357
- Anybody ever tell you how funny you are?
- No.

524
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:27,294
That's understandable.

525
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,730
Now, for a little tape.

526
01:05:34,324 --> 01:05:37,754
- Now, put your other leg up, lover.
- Never mind the romance.

527
01:05:40,662 --> 01:05:43,633
Around your big fat thighs.

528
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:49,712
- Not as big as your big fat ass.
- No, no, be nice now.

529
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:53,777
Now for the balls.

530
01:05:53,778 --> 01:05:56,878
Your little red balls.
You're just in time for Christmas.

531
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,889
Wait a minute.
What are you going to do to my balls?

532
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,090
- We'll wrap them.
- Isn't that dangerous?

533
01:06:01,597 --> 01:06:03,018
It'll affect my tap-dancing.

534
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:08,748
Wrap that around like that and tie it.
Wrap them real nice.

535
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:13,193
- They'll slip out.
- In a cocoon. Real nice.

536
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:21,025
- That's better. A little bit of tape.
- Feels like hell.

537
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:25,371
- Hey, don't tape my balls to my asshole.
- That's the best place for them, baby.

538
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:26,372
Yeah.

539
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:30,326
You're as good as new.

540
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:32,746
Now! Get up, walk around.

541
01:06:50,602 --> 01:06:51,955
This is all right!

542
01:06:54,606 --> 01:06:56,292
I feel like a eunuch,

543
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,437
but this is all right.

544
01:07:01,445 --> 01:07:04,224
- Want some soft boiled eggs?
- Sure, baby.

545
01:07:10,353 --> 01:07:12,739
Call for help if you
need to move the lift.

546
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:17,418
Remember, we're very proud of this guy.
It's called 'Vision of Peace'.

547
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,731
Why was I chosen to do this?

548
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,734
Why couldn't I
be inside writing editorials

549
01:07:53,743 --> 01:07:56,413
about municipal corruption?

550
01:07:57,121 --> 01:07:59,500
Give the readers
my vision of peace.

551
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:05,212
Questions like these
demanded deeper consideration.

552
01:08:35,915 --> 01:08:40,178
Superintendent Barnes.
Can I buy you a beer?

553
01:08:41,086 --> 01:08:43,351
You are fired, Mr. Chinaski.

554
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:46,552
Please return your uniform
and clean out your locker.

555
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:48,895
Yes, sir.

556
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,620
- Is that you, Hank?
- Yeah, baby.

557
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,007
I got canned.

558
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,193
Caught me drinking on the job.

559
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,879
What about your check?

560
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,016
Funny, they didn't mention it.

561
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,095
You worked almost a full day.
They owe you wages.

562
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:28,873
Yes, they do.

563
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:35,053
We'll go get it,
as soon as the office opens.

564
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:36,989
Okay.

565
01:09:57,473 --> 01:10:00,295
Let's hit the market for
some stewed meat and vegetables

566
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,196
and then let's get a couple of bottles
of really good French wine.

567
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,875
Jan, they told me
the check wasn't ready yet.

568
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:09,176
What? They can't...
It's the law.

569
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:12,713
I don't know.
They said it would be ready tomorrow.

570
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:16,458
Oh Christ, I've walked
all this way in high heels.

571
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:19,120
- You look great, baby.
- Yeah.

572
01:11:21,942 --> 01:11:27,113
It pays to be a tough son of a bitch.
The world belongs to people with balls.

573
01:11:27,222 --> 01:11:29,016
Just get the check, daddy.

574
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:41,194
I'm Henry Chinaski.

575
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,831
- Yes?
- Yes, I was here yesterday.

576
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,126
- Yes?
- Right.

577
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:52,330
And you told me
my check would be ready today.

578
01:11:54,538 --> 01:11:57,067
- Oh.
- That's right.

579
01:12:03,764 --> 01:12:06,817
I'm sorry, Mr. Chinaski.
Your check isn't here yet.

580
01:12:07,768 --> 01:12:09,545
But you said it would be.

581
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:15,224
I'm sorry, Sir. Sometimes it takes a little
longer for a payroll check to process.

582
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:16,961
Look, I want my check!

583
01:12:20,262 --> 01:12:21,715
I'm sorry, sir.

584
01:12:23,324 --> 01:12:25,042
You're not sorry.

585
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:28,764
You don't know what sorrow is. I do.

586
01:12:30,672 --> 01:12:33,718
Now, I want to talk to
your boss's boss. Now!

587
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:42,516
Mr. Handler?

588
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:47,347
A Mr. Chinaski would like to see you
about a termination payroll check.

589
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:51,250
Right.

590
01:12:57,396 --> 01:12:58,940
Room 309.

591
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:01,434
Thank you.

592
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:06,013
Me and my old lady have walked
down here now, two days running,

593
01:13:06,622 --> 01:13:09,701
just to be told
that you don't have my check.

594
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:14,222
Now, you and I know
that that's pure crap.

595
01:13:16,873 --> 01:13:20,502
Now all I want to do
is get my check and get drunk.

596
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,698
Now that might not sound noble.

597
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:29,402
But it's my choice.

598
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:34,265
You got a smoke?

599
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:52,215
Thank you.

600
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:04,409
Miss Simms?

601
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:08,763
There's a check due
a Mr. Henry Chinaski.

602
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:14,534
Yes. Henry Chinaski.
I want it down in five minutes.

603
01:14:16,694 --> 01:14:18,163
Thank you.

604
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:28,230
Listen, John, I've got two years of
journalism school at L.A. City College.

605
01:14:29,523 --> 01:14:34,694
- You couldn't use a reporter, could you?
- Sorry, we're overstaffed now.

606
01:14:36,203 --> 01:14:37,422
I see.

607
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:40,017
Your check will be downstairs.

608
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,654
Thank you.

609
01:15:05,622 --> 01:15:09,160
You might as well not have any goddamn ears.
You never listen to me anymore.

610
01:15:09,327 --> 01:15:14,506
Well, that's because you keep saying the
same damn thing over and over again.

611
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:17,918
Okay, let's have a drink
and talk about it.

612
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:24,148
You've had your ass up in the air
ever since we got back together.

613
01:16:01,232 --> 01:16:02,509
Shit.

614
01:16:05,277 --> 01:16:07,347
Come on, let's face the obvious:

615
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:14,369
I don't need you
and you don't need me.

616
01:16:20,332 --> 01:16:23,211
Yeah. I know.

617
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:54,331
A week later Jan moved out of my place
and shacked up with some rich guy.

618
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,002
After that I couldn't pay the rent.

619
01:17:11,379 --> 01:17:14,884
- The landlord threw you out?
- Yeah.

620
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,120
Did you get the job?

621
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:22,657
- No. They didn't want me.
- How come?

622
01:17:23,565 --> 01:17:26,619
Well, I don't have an address.

623
01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:31,708
Hank, I hate it when he fucks me.

624
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:36,687
Sure, babe. Take care.

625
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,359
This is for you.
It got too small for him.

626
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,090
See you around, Hank.

627
01:17:58,631 --> 01:17:59,867
You'll manage.

628
01:18:28,067 --> 01:18:31,520
Amazing, how grimly
we hold onto our misery.

629
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:35,466
The energy we burn fueling our anger.

630
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:43,031
Amazing, how one moment
we can be snarling like a beast,

631
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:47,401
then a few moments later
forgetting what or why.

632
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:52,505
Not hours of this,
or days or months or years of this,

633
01:18:52,714 --> 01:18:57,151
but decades,
lifetimes completely used up

634
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,005
given over to
the pettiest rancor and hatred.

635
01:19:01,772 --> 01:19:06,202
Finally there is nothing here
for death to take away.

636
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,833
All right. Sit down
and we'll see if anything comes in.

637
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:56,898
You look a little down in the mouth.
You all right?

638
01:19:57,907 --> 01:19:59,502
I lost a woman.

639
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:06,123
Yeah, well, you'll have others.
And you'll lose them too.

640
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:08,793
Where do they go?

641
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:15,506
Try this.
Ain't no women on skid row.

642
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:16,807
Thanks.

643
01:20:18,217 --> 01:20:21,930
Don't let him see us drinking.
That's the one thing he don't like.

644
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:25,283
Keep it low.

645
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:38,252
- Wine gnats.
- Sons of bitches are hooked.

646
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,406
They know what's good.

647
01:20:42,914 --> 01:20:45,026
They drink to forget their women.

648
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:47,954
They just drink.

649
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:50,757
Oh, shit.

650
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:53,058
- Oh, here he comes.
- All right, all right!

651
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:55,811
Get out! Get out! Get the hell
out of here, you fucking winos!

652
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:57,112
- Let's go! Move it!
- All right.

653
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,964
Get out of here before I call the cops!
Both of you!

654
01:21:02,475 --> 01:21:06,253
Let's go! Both of you!
Out of here! Right now! Keep moving!

655
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,874
Get out of here! I'll call the cops,
you goddamn degenerates!

656
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,075
And don't come back!

657
01:21:14,644 --> 01:21:17,889
What? This isn't a bar!

658
01:21:22,193 --> 01:21:23,245
Sun's up.

659
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:28,615
Yeah, the sun's up good.

660
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:39,716
Well...

661
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:44,514
I got to get going.

662
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:53,147
See you.

663
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,461
So, what do I do with Chinaski's mail?

664
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:21,014
Oh, he's gone.
Just give it to me.

665
01:22:22,122 --> 01:22:23,350
Have a nice day.

666
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:02,993
Dear Mr. Chinaski.

667
01:23:03,202 --> 01:23:06,980
We are returning these four stories,
but we are keeping My Beerdrunk Soul

668
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:10,667
is Sadder Than All the Dead
Christmas Trees of the World.

669
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:13,189
We have been watching
your work for a long time

670
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,690
and we are most happy
to accept this story.

671
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:20,718
Sincerely, John Martin,
Black Sparrow Press.

672
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:48,727
If you are going to try,
go all the way.

673
01:23:49,536 --> 01:23:51,872
Otherwise don't even start.

674
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:57,376
This could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, jobs.

675
01:23:57,585 --> 01:23:59,312
And maybe your mind.

676
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:03,599
It could mean
not eating for three or four days.

677
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:06,660
It could mean
freezing on a park bench.

678
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:09,704
It could mean jail.
It could mean derision.

679
01:24:09,771 --> 01:24:12,875
It could mean mockery, isolation.

680
01:24:16,102 --> 01:24:21,440
Isolation is the gift. All the others
are a test of your endurance.

681
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:23,905
Of how much you really
want to do it.

682
01:24:24,006 --> 01:24:28,406
And you'll do it, despite rejection
and the worst odds.

683
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:32,092
And it will be better than
anything else you can imagine.

684
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,199
If you're going to try,
go all the way.

685
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:44,611
There is no other feeling like that.
You will be alone with the gods.

686
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,014
And the nights will flame with fire.

687
01:24:47,923 --> 01:24:51,301
You will ride life
straight to perfect laughter.

688
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:55,356
It's the only good fight there is.

689
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,001
.
