2
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,590
I want you to come quick.

3
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,830
Don't go!

4
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,340
<i>- Iris!</i>

5
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,210
Iris, w-wait for me!

6
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,510
Just keep tight hold of me,
and it'll be all right!

7
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,950
You won't keep still!

8
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>I can't keep still!</i>

9
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,950
I can't catch up
with you!

10
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,080
<i>Speed up!</i>

11
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,460
<i>Oh!</i>

12
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,930
<i>Whoo!</i>

13
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,080
Iris, you've got bicycle oil
on your ankle.

14
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,140
- I don't care, John.
- Oh.

15
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,580
<i>- Those of you,
our guests</i>

16
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,880
on whose magnificent
generosity we depend...

17
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,050
we really are most
frightfully grateful...

18
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,890
will need no introduction

19
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,950
to one of our most
distinguished graduates

20
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,000
and an honorary fellow,
Dame Iris Murdoch.

21
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,470
She's a noted philosopher

22
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,170
as well as author
of some 26 novels,

23
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,400
and we are honored
to have her with us today,

24
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,640
as well as the distinguished
Wharton professor of literature,

25
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,480
who has the great good fortune
of being married to her.

26
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,450
I need to say no more about her
for good wine needs no bush.

27
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,920
But she will not
mind comparison

28
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,160
with, say, a really fine
vintage Claret.

29
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,920
Dame Iris will speak to you

30
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,200
about the importance
of education.

31
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,580
Education doesn't
make you happy,

32
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,380
and nor does freedom.

33
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,050
We don't become happy just
because we're free, if we are,

34
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,360
or because we've been educated,
if we have,

35
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,330
but because education
may be the means

36
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,990
by which we realize
we are happy.

37
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,200
<i>It opens our eyes,
our ears...</i>

38
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,330
tells us where delights
are lurking...

39
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,810
convinces us that there
is only one freedom

40
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,810
of any importance whatsoever...
that of the mind...

41
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,320
<i>and gives us the assurance,</i>

42
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,910
the confidence,
to walk the path our mind...

43
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,250
our educated mind... offers.

44
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,050
<i>I shall tell him
all my love</i>

45
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,790
<i>All my soul's adoration</i>

46
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,700
<i>And I think he will hear me</i>

47
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,330
<i>And will not say me nay</i>

48
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,210
<i>It is this
that gives my soul</i>

49
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>All its joyous elation</i>

50
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,310
<i>As I hear
the sweet lark sing</i>

51
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,790
<i>In the clear air
of the day</i>

52
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,090
<i>- Yes, of course,
there's something fishy</i>

53
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,860
about describing
people's feelings.

54
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,100
You try hard to be accurate,
but as soon as you

55
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,300
start to define such and such a
feeling, language lets you down.

56
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,430
<i>It's really a machine
for making falsehoods.</i>

57
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,910
<i>When we really speak the truth,
words are insufficient.</i>

58
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,210
Almost everything except
things like "pass the gravy"

59
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,510
is a lie of a sort.

60
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,180
And that being the case,
I shall shut up.

61
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,220
Oh, and... pass the gravy.

62
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,580
<i>But love,
which is unsatisfying...</i>

63
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,930
<i>and real love... extreme
love... once it's recognized...</i>

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,160
has the stamp
of the indubitable...

65
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,900
<i>Ah, John. I may call
you John, mayn't I?
Meet Miss Murdoch.</i>

66
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,670
<i>Iris, my dear, John Bayley,
one of the more promising</i>

67
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,170
<i>young lecturers
in the English school.</i>

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,010
Though I caught him out
over old-English grammar,

69
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,770
<i>his weaker side, I fear,</i>

70
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,680
<i>a minor question of
Anglo-Saxon syntax.</i>

71
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,310
Wine.

72
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,090
I mean, went down
the wrong way.

73
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,690
Yes, I like that.

74
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,620
There is a right way down,
of course.

75
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,030
Amazing how most of us find it
without even thinking about it.

76
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, I-I r-rarely think.

77
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,900
If you think about it,
you'll never find it.

78
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,600
Best thing to do is hang on
and trust the body.

79
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,070
I do.

80
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,130
<i>- Human beings
love each other...</i>

81
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,700
<i>in sex, in friendship,
and when they're in love.</i>

82
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,550
<i>And they cherish
other beings...</i>

83
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,610
humans, animals, plants,
even stones.

84
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,350
The quest for happiness
and the promotion of happiness

85
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,550
is in all of this

86
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,500
and the power
of our imagination.

87
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,990
I'm writing a n-novel.

88
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,330
I don't suppose you have
the time or the inclination

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,340
to even r-r-read
a n-novel.

90
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,310
I've written one.
It's going to be published.

91
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,900
And I'm writing another.

92
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,600
Oh. C-C-Can I...
can I read it?

93
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,980
No one has read it.
None of my friends.

94
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,210
What's it about?

95
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,380
About?

96
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,580
It has something
for everyone.

97
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,020
A b-bit like Shakespeare.

98
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,180
Perhaps, yes.

99
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,490
Please don't talk
to anyone about it.

100
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,930
N-n-n-no.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Of c-course not.

102
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,460
I-I-I w-won't
t-tell a soul.

103
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,800
<i>Every human soul has seen,</i>

104
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,070
<i>perhaps even before
their birth,</i>

105
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,850
<i>pure forms such as justice,
temperance, beauty,</i>

106
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,610
and all the great
moral qualities

107
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,450
which we hold in honor.

108
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,550
We are moved towards
what is good

109
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,530
by the faint memory
of these forms,

110
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,500
simple and calm and blessed,

111
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,930
which we saw once
in a pure, clear light

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,270
being pure ourselves.

113
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,340
Whole grain.

114
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,780
Do we have whole grain
or something other?

115
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,250
What is "whole"?

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,050
Is it something in itself
or does it have parts?

117
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
<i>Oh, spaghetti.</i>

118
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,280
<i>If you have a whole,
you have a whole.</i>

119
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,720
Ooh, sausages.
You and me is a whole.

120
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,250
If you toddle off, there's a
hole in the whole, or if I do.

121
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,890
But a whole can't be broken.
It just forms another whole.

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,260
- Baked beans.
- Baked beans!

123
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,800
Do you want premium points?

124
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,100
Do we deserve them?

125
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,530
<i>Do you want bags?</i>

126
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,500
Bags, yes. You know,
it's all around us...

127
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,770
people like you
and me talking nonsense.

128
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,770
I know.

129
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,310
Bag for life?

130
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,370
For life?

131
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,280
That's what it says.

132
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,250
We have to ask...
give you the choice.

133
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,540
Ooh, rather.

134
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,980
You just have to listen...
that's the job.

135
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,150
You call it a job, but it's
like music, what you do.

136
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,660
You live with the angels,
speak their language...

137
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,490
the music of the spheres.

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,430
Nowadays, the only language
anyone really understands
is pictures.

139
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,630
<i>Paint the picture.</i>

140
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,190
See,
now I'm bagged for life.

141
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,300
Love's the only language
everyone understands.

142
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,430
<i>Ooh, love, yes.</i>

143
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,310
I can read it,
but I can't speak it.

144
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,920
Mmm! Ooh.

145
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,460
My coat's
caught on your chair.

146
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,020
Mnh!

147
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,960
And the captain said
to the two weevils,

148
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,870
"Which would you
rather have, Mr. Smith?"

149
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,300
"The bigger one, sir."

150
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,810
<i>"Wrong, Mr. Smith, wrong.</i>

151
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,340
<i>"In the Navy,
you should always choose</i>

152
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,210
the lesser of
the two 'weevils.'"

153
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,370
Patrick O'Brian...
"Between two evils,

154
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,970
always choose the one
you haven't tried before."

155
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,350
Mae West..." Oh, my vest! I tore
my vest again this morning."

156
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,910
You must get
some new vests.

157
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,250
Jolly good.

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,120
You must get
some new vests.

159
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,720
I just said that.

160
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,030
You're always saying that...
that you just said something.
Me too.

161
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,900
<i>Good job. You reminded me
I had two lectures today.</i>

162
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,490
You remembered.

163
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,470
<i>No, but I remembered to
apologize for the one I forgot.</i>

164
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,060
They were very sweet
about it.

165
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,080
Glad not to have to listen
to you, I expect.

166
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,580
<i>Oh, I'm sure.</i>

167
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,340
They'd have been delighted
to have listened to you.

168
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,850
I always have been.

169
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,260
Iris.

170
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,260
John.

171
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,260
Oh!

172
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,660
Thank you.

173
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,900
Janet! Janet!

174
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,030
Oh, my God, Iris!

175
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,470
Am I late?

176
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,410
Don't be silly.

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,380
Oh, no, it's the Hokeycokey.
Everything'll be over.

178
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,270
John, wait.

179
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,320
Oh, dear.

180
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,970
Oops. Sorry.

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,010
Cha-cha-cha.

182
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,010
Cha-cha-cha!

183
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,130
Cha-cha-cha.

184
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,840
Ch... ooh!

185
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,310
Cha-cha-cha.

186
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,020
- Thank you!
- You too!

187
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,520
That was my husband.

188
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,760
Cha-cha-cha.

189
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you with Iris?

190
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,040
H-H-Hoping so.

191
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,800
- You know, we have...
- I-I thought we had.

192
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,310
- Nearly met.
- A-Are you a friend of Iris?

193
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,340
Yes.

194
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,110
She seems
to have a lot of...

195
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,110
<i>Do do do-do do do</i>

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,520
Janet Stone, John Bayley.

197
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,050
How do you do?

198
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,780
H-How do you do?

199
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,820
Shall we?

200
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,020
What are your rooms like?

201
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,030
A-Adequate, thank you.

202
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,120
- I'd like to see them.
- Oh.

203
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,760
Do you... do you have
a lot of friends?

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,700
Is a list of my friends
necessary?

205
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,640
I-I just wondered
if you had many.

206
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,800
There aren't many people that
one wants to know one. Do you...

207
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,970
Whoop!

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,440
Ahhhhhh!

209
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,380
<i>Iris!</i>

210
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,920
Y-You might fall.

211
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,110
W-Would you like some
more c-champagne?

212
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,380
That would be nice.

213
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,360
I-I've had some
s-since Christmas.

214
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,360
It does keep, doesn't it?

215
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,370
I-I s-s-shouldn't
be doing this.

216
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,530
- What?
- H-Having women
in my r-room.

217
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,740
It's...
it's not p-permitted.

218
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,110
I wouldn't say
you "had me" exactly.

219
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,780
Have you danced before?

220
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,580
It was a-all right,
wasn't it?

221
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,050
Oh, I think so.

222
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,420
I-It b-b-broke the ice,
so to speak.

223
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,590
- Ice.
- What?

224
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,130
Oh! Oh, it'll do.

225
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,170
Aren't you particular
about words at your college?

226
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,070
I-I-I'm only here on
a s-s-sufferance, really,

227
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,600
<i>as a-a tutor and guide.</i>

228
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,200
I-I get all the Americans
and Frenchmen to m-mother.

229
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,610
You love words,
don't you?

230
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,370
If one doesn't have words,
how does one think?

231
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,580
S-Shall I do that?

232
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,650
W-what... What is your
n-n-n-novel about?

233
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,280
About?

234
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,590
How to be free.
How to be good.

235
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,100
Ooh!

236
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,570
And how to love.

237
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,040
Well, that's all...
a-all there is, I'd say.

238
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,440
Well, l-language is all
v-very well, you know,

239
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,810
but it's not the only way of
understanding each other.

240
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,570
There's...
t-there's sight and...

241
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,550
and smell and... and...
a-and touch, of course.

242
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,590
I-I l-love your nose.

243
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,560
It's snub.

244
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,140
Snubby.

245
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,340
S-Snubby, snubby.

246
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,470
Snubby, snubby, snubby.

247
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,730
Let me do that to you.
Take off your jacket.

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,850
I-If we were, a-as it were,
m-married,

249
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,830
w-we could d-do this
all the time... perhaps.

250
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,560
We should be doing it
nearly all the time.

251
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,570
Yes, but i-if...

252
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,010
Thank you.

253
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,410
<i>Look.</i>

254
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,120
<i>Ah!</i>

255
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,680
You stopped
with your working.

256
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,460
Yes, well, I don't mind.

257
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,160
How's it coming along?

258
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,500
It's harder to write than
all the others... much.

259
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,060
Have you noticed?

260
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,580
Just that you've seemed...
puzzled every now and again.

261
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,510
That's it, yes.

262
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,480
Puzzled.

263
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,850
Puzz... pu...

264
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,320
Puzzled.
It's a funny word.

265
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,160
All words are like that when
you take them by surprise,
aren't they?

266
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,630
<i>Have you got a title?</i>

267
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,790
A lot of trees
seem near.

268
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,700
We must stop it.

269
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,800
What to do?
What to do?

270
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,310
The window, John.
The window!

271
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,710
We must stop it!

272
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,870
No, see?

273
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,780
<i>It's gone.</i>

274
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,690
We all worry about going mad,
don't we?

275
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,200
<i>How would we know...</i>

276
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:04,260
those of us who live
in our minds anyway?

277
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,670
Other people would tell us.

278
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,010
Would they, John?

279
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
Sorry.

280
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:24,590
<i>I don't want to set
the world on fire</i>

281
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,890
John Bayley.

282
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:36,890
<i>I just want to start
a flame in your heart</i>

283
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:45,570
<i>In my heart
I have but one desire...</i>

284
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,620
I haven't seen her
for ages.

285
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,580
Oh, j-jolly good.
Nice.

286
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,450
Takes all sorts.

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,210
N-Not that I...

288
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,260
<i>We're all... we're all
m- men at St. Anthony's.</i>

289
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,160
Do... do you like women?

290
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,250
I-I mean, do...
do w-w-women like you?

291
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,420
You mean lesbians?

292
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,900
Yes.

293
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,730
Would it bother you
if they did?

294
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,930
<i>Oh, the s-same thing
happens with me...</i>

295
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,630
with h-h-homosexuals,
I mean.

296
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,400
And do you
go to bed with them?

297
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,630
Lord, no.

298
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,510
At the college,
somebody once said to me,

299
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,450
"Old-fashioned lesbians
of the very highest type."

300
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,920
And... and d-do...
do you go to bed with them?

301
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,090
Tsk. Wh...

302
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,970
Dame Iris.

303
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,640
It's this way.

304
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,120
<i>- She's written philosophy
and plays and poetry,</i>

305
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,250
but her novels are her
lasting literary legacy.

306
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,160
Iris Murdoch is acknowledged
as the foremost English novelist

307
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,130
<i>of her generation.</i>

308
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,290
A little excessive,
don't you think?

309
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,330
<i>What do you reckon?
Shall I take that again?</i>

310
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,270
<i>Her novels embrace
the subjects of freedom</i>

311
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,740
<i>and what it means to be good.</i>

312
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,110
Dame Iris?

313
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>...in the successes
and failures of love.</i>

314
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,010
<i>She's written philosophy
and plays and poetry,</i>

315
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,610
<i>but her novels are her
lasting literary legacy.</i>

316
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,280
<i>People, of course,
are very secretive.</i>

317
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,920
<i>And, for many reasons, want to
appear what we call ordinary.</i>

318
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,990
<i>Everybody has thoughts
they want to conceal.</i>

319
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,870
Perhaps even quite simple
aspects of their lives.

320
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,430
People have obsessions
and fears and passions

321
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,500
which they don't admit to.

322
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,110
<i>I think any character is
interesting and has extremes.</i>

323
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,810
It's the novelist's privilege
to see how odd everyone is.

324
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,190
<i>- In your novels,
you yourself are very exact</i>

325
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,950
in your use of language.

326
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,330
But in general terms,
do you think the language

327
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,860
is becoming debased?

328
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,130
Reading and writing

329
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,330
and the preservation
of language and its forms

330
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,710
and the kind of eloquence
and the kind of beauty

331
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,750
that language is capable of

332
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,410
is something terribly
important to human beings

333
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,350
because... this is connected
to thought.

334
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,910
If children are not taught...

335
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,270
W-What did you say?
D-Did you ask...

336
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,270
I was asking about
the importance of language.

337
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,090
<i>- John!</i>

338
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,630
<i>John!</i>

339
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,260
<i>- John? John?
- Iris?</i>

340
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,000
<i>John?</i>

341
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,710
- Oh, you're there.
- What is it?

342
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm back.

343
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,480
M-Much earlier
than I thought.

344
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,310
Yes, I came straight back.
I didn't know why I was there.

345
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,280
You were going to do
an interview.

346
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,010
- What interview?
- I don't know.

347
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,020
So, um...

348
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,950
And see your publisher?

349
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,550
Was it your publisher?

350
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,320
So I came back.

351
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,290
I didn't expect you back
for ages.

352
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,690
- Has she rung?
- I didn't answer.

353
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,460
It was Nora!

354
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,090
Iris, Nora's dead.

355
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,070
Oh, so she is.
Oh, that is sad.

356
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,500
<i>Oh, well, never mind.</i>

357
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,700
Must have been Ed.

358
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,580
What for?
Oh, yes, my book.

359
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,340
<i>Oh, so I came back.</i>

360
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,010
<i>- What is, uh...</i>

361
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,920
the name
of the prime minister?

362
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,260
Oh, me? Are you asking me?

363
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,350
Yes, I am.

364
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,900
I know.

365
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,030
Okay, what is the name
of the prime minister?

366
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,870
I don't know. Ask John.
Surely it doesn't matter.

367
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay, well,
no, not really.

368
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,200
Someone will know.

369
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,440
Who would you like
to see?

370
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,780
<i>I mean,
is there anyone...</i>

371
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,290
I don't know.

372
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,850
<i>Shall I look up some names?
Talk to someone?</i>

373
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
I've got a lot of ideas,
but they won't come together.

374
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,160
It happens all the time...
forgetting names.

375
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,360
So, does it happen
all the time?

376
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,770
<i>I mean, you know, does
she mean writer's block?
I suppose she does, but...</i>

377
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,240
<i>Iris can always write,
doctor. This is...</i>

378
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,740
<i>- Oh, I know.
- Iris is a person...</i>

379
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,780
<i>Yes, yes, but
it doesn't work like...</i>

380
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,240
<i>Surely in
her case... a- a woman
with a f-first-class mind.</i>

381
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>We will
have to be certain.</i>

382
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,210
<i>There'll have to be
tests, scans.</i>

383
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,720
<i>I don't think I can...</i>

384
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,650
<i>I mean, it's a little
beyond my competence.</i>

385
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,090
<i>Iris finds her new book
v- very tiring and difficult.</i>

386
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,520
<i>Basically, I'll
arrange something.</i>

387
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,650
<i>Iris has
a very clear mind.</i>

388
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,320
<i>Mine's a muddle,
but not hers.</i>

389
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,270
<i>She does everything...
always has.</i>

390
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,830
Food, shopping,
tickets for things.

391
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,170
I-I never know
how she m-m-manages

392
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,900
and does her b-books
as well.

393
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,840
Well, they can
get you help.

394
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,810
N-no, no, no, no,
n-nobody would suit.

395
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,580
There's
a very good place...

396
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,480
<i>a specialist nursing home...
Vale House.</i>

397
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>- Not necessary.
- Not yet.</i>

398
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,880
<i>- I'm sorry.
- N-N-Not your fault.</i>

399
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,390
<i>Well, uh... take care.</i>

400
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,720
<i>Goodbye, doctor.
Thank you.</i>

401
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,690
Goodbye.

402
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,260
Iris?

403
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm sure the country
won't go to the dogs.

404
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,760
Not knowing the prime minister's
name's not a capital offense.

405
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,860
<i>Absolutely.</i>

406
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,800
I know the names
that matter.

407
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,500
You'll be all right.

408
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,940
Well, I will be
if you stop worrying.

409
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,740
I've got a book
to finish.

410
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh, Tony Blair...
so there.

411
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,880
Iris, are you
comfortable?

412
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,430
I'm going to start
the scan now.

413
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,520
<i>Just keep
nice and still.</i>

414
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,860
<i>Try to relax.</i>

415
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,960
<i>It'll take
about 15 minutes.</i>

416
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,620
John.

417
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,490
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

418
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,900
Is Iris still...
I'm so sorry I'm late.

419
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,460
I don't know what's
going to happen, Janet.

420
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,300
I've left the car outside.
The engine's running.

421
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,810
- Won't be a mo.
- Right.

422
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,470
- See you out there.
- Yes.

423
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,190
John, I'm frightened.

424
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,630
Everyone's doing
their best.

425
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,730
Janet's got the car.

426
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,000
It'll be...

427
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,610
- It's done.
- You're finished?

428
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,840
I thought
you were c-close.

429
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,250
So far, but it hasn't made
any difference.

430
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,550
Here's to it.

431
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,420
Just try
and keep working.

432
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,520
<i>- You must.
- I will.</i>

433
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,390
And here's
to the next one.

434
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,060
Just keep working,
keep talking,
keep the words coming.

435
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,400
K-Keep at it.

436
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,990
I shall come more like
a deprived animal

437
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,730
if I can't write...
be like a starved dog.

438
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,710
No. Keep at it.
I'll keep you at it.

439
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,610
I feel...

440
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,240
as if I'm sailing
into darkness.

441
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,850
<i>A...sinuituis.</i>

442
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,390
<i>An...i...mal.</i>

443
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,900
Toothbrush.

444
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,770
Uh...

445
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,430
Uh, no.

446
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,840
Yes.

447
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,450
Por...

448
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,280
P... no.

449
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,380
Tennis thing.

450
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,920
God.

451
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,160
Iris is getting t-tired,
I'm afraid.

452
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,320
John.

453
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,890
Can we have the blinds?

454
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,160
Dame Iris,
thank you very much.

455
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,400
Thank you.

456
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,000
Well done.

457
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,600
Dame Iris,
thank you very much indeed.

458
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,640
It was so kind of you
to come, Dame Iris.

459
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,700
Thank you. I like it.
Thank you very much.

460
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,910
Is it any help?

461
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,470
What, to us?
Yes.

462
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,450
It's... implacable.

463
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,610
What does that mean?

464
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,660
It means inexorable.

465
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,350
I know
what the word means...

466
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,050
Um, to me... to us.

467
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,820
You see, words have meant
everything to her.

468
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,490
<i>They will still mean
something... some thought.</i>

469
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,300
It can't just be
dead b-birds dropping.

470
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,860
I know what it means,
and it doesn't surprise me.

471
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,600
It frightens me, but...

472
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,800
and then sometimes,
it doesn't frighten me,

473
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,540
and that's just as bad,

474
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,310
because that's it winning,
isn't it?

475
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,650
N-n-no, no.
No, it's n-not.

476
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,190
It won't win.

477
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,990
<i>It will win.</i>

478
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,460
There.
It will win.

479
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,330
<i>That's very kind.</i>

480
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,960
<i>- Whoo!</i>

481
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,970
<i>Young - Iris!</i>

482
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,840
Iris, wait for me!

483
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,810
Just keep tight hold of me,
and it'll be all right!

484
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,510
You won't keep still!

485
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,110
<i>I can't keep still!</i>

486
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,410
I can't catch up
with you!

487
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,610
<i>Speed up!</i>

488
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,420
<i>Oh!</i>

489
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,580
<i>Whoo!</i>

490
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,660
Oh, good morning.

491
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,500
Oh. No.

492
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,660
Uh... I...

493
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,300
I think it's the...

494
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,740
person who brings
the post, John.

495
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,780
Yes, it is.

496
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,780
Yes.

497
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,310
John? So sorry.

498
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,080
Thank you
very much indeed.

499
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,240
Thank you.

500
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,380
So sorry.

501
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,060
There. There.

502
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,220
Go on.

503
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,590
Go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on.

504
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,230
It's only the postman.

505
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,860
It's only the postman.

506
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,030
Don't repeat everything,
puss.

507
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,570
It's only the postman.

508
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,500
It's for you!
It's your book!

509
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,800
What's that?

510
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,970
Your book!

511
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,710
It's only the postman.

512
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,410
It's your book!

513
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,810
<i>Isn't it
perfectly splendid?</i>

514
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,120
Well, why don't you
look at it?

515
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,380
It's only the postman.

516
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,600
Damn.

517
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,900
Stop nudging up to me
like a water buffalo.

518
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,870
I have a lot to do.
Lots to do, Iris.

519
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,370
See what I've done now?

520
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,810
It's not your fault.
Not your fault.

521
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,000
Sorry. Sorry.

522
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,510
It's only the postman.

523
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,070
Yes, all right!
It's only the postman!

524
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,140
Sorry. So sorry.
There's lots to do.

525
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,240
Which side do I go?

526
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,520
<i>-
Ask me my three main priorities
for government,</i>

527
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,160
<i>and I tell you... education,
education, and education.</i>

528
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,940
John! John! Why does
he keep saying that?

529
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,870
- What does he mean?
- By what?

530
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,810
"Education, education,
education."

531
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,610
H-He means learning.

532
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,770
Everyone g-getting
enough of it.

533
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,180
Why does he
keep saying it?

534
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,810
Politicians have to
keep repeating things

535
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,380
to make themselves heard.

536
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,450
They have to be
like travelers

537
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,820
eating sheep's eyes
with B-Bedouins.

538
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,660
They have to do anything
to make themselves liked.

539
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,720
Why does he want to eat
a sheep's ear?

540
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,640
- Shall I turn it off?
- No.

541
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,800
We could go for a swim tomorrow
if it's n-not raining.

542
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,340
- No.
- Yes. You love water.

543
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,780
When you swim,
you love it.

544
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,340
Swim...
swim is good for you.

545
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,440
When are we leaving?

546
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,850
Not today.

547
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,220
Are we going to London?

548
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,230
No, we're going
for a swim.

549
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,760
When are we leaving?

550
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,200
Not today.

551
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,790
When are we leaving?

552
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,350
Iris...
Iris, wait for me.

553
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,990
<i>You dirty old man.</i>

554
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,430
Hello!

555
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,560
<i>There we go.</i>

556
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,970
<i>No, Iris,
not with your socks on.</i>

557
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,590
<i>Your socks!</i>

558
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,820
Whoa!

559
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,100
Look. Look. Look.

560
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,730
Come along.

561
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,140
Come on, come on,
come along.

562
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,570
Go on.

563
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,780
Ooh.

564
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,320
Oh.

565
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,500
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

566
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,170
Ah!

567
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,250
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

568
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,840
<i>That's it. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.</i>

569
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,890
No, no, don't...
don't pull me in!

570
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,550
You're all right.
I won't let you go.

571
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,020
Let's get you dry.
You're all right.

572
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,890
Come on. Here.
Up your hands.

573
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,830
Up your hands.
Let's get you warm.

574
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,100
That's it.
That's it.

575
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,070
<i>Come on. That's it.</i>

576
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,230
No, Iris. Iris!

577
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,500
Just put your...
like this, up high. Up.

578
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,140
<i>- Let's go now.
- Let's get your head
through.</i>

579
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,010
<i>- As soon as you got
your head in.
- Let's go now!</i>

580
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,410
<i>- Iris, as soon as we've
got your head in!
- No. No.</i>

581
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,710
Iris! As soon as
you've got... Come on.

582
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,180
- Let's go now!
- Come on, put your head down.

583
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,740
<i>Where's my petticoat?</i>

584
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,650
- Here.
- Ah.

585
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,770
Are you sure
he's expecting me?

586
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,810
Maurice.

587
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,510
I brought John.
You said I might.

588
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,210
Did I? And did
you say you would?

589
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,550
Yes.

590
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,750
Well, come in.

591
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,650
- Maurice Charlton.
- J-John Bayley.

592
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,960
<i>Isn't it hot?</i>

593
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,290
Yes, it is.

594
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,930
I've got just the thing
will cool.

595
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,560
I imagine
your friend Maurice

596
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,670
is hoping to have
his wicked will, is he?

597
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,900
<i>Not today is he.</i>

598
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,280
You and I are much the same age,
aren't we, John?

599
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,760
Yeah, I-I think so.

600
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,790
Does it matter?

601
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,850
No.

602
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,360
<i>This is not important,
i- is it?</i>

603
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,920
What Maurice means
is that most of my real...

604
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,990
<i>my other friends
are older than me.</i>

605
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,940
<i>Much older.</i>

606
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,370
Yes, and there's
a very good reason for that,

607
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,700
isn't there?

608
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,300
Is there? What?

609
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,870
She likes people
with a bit of a past.

610
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,810
She uses them...
don't you?

611
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,940
No, I don't.

612
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,990
For your novel.
Don't you, Iris?

613
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,280
- I-I haven't read it.
- Haven't you?

614
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,320
Neither have you, Maurice,
so don't play games.

615
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,920
Nobody has read it.

616
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,090
The gentle lady hasn't yet
bestowed her favor on anyone.

617
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,430
I-Iris doesn't like
to talk about it.

618
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,990
I know that, too, Iris.

619
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,160
That's because it's full
of people she knows...

620
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,800
all these masters of thought
you're so chummy with.

621
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,570
Bound to be.
We all know.

622
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,200
Isn't it, Iris?

623
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,080
No, it isn't, but you can
think what you like.

624
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,020
You know nothing about it.
Nobody knows but me.

625
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,050
And... I'm not telling.

626
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,590
<i>I thought
it was a secret.</i>

627
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,060
<i>I mean, I know Iris
doesn't want it talked about.</i>

628
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,350
Come on, Iris.

629
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,760
I'm sure we'll all
recognize ourselves.

630
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,630
I don't see how you...
anyone... can.

631
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,030
They won't.
T-T-They won't.

632
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,660
I hate that sort of thing.
I won't ever do it.

633
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,670
I don't see the point of
writing a novel that's
autobiography.

634
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,530
There's no fun in that.

635
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,230
T-They won't see
themselves, you know?

636
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,140
D-Don't people

always s-see themselves
differently?

638
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,800
I'm sure they do.

639
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,210
W-Who was it who said,

640
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,870
"You can use anyone
you like in a novel

641
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,010
"as long as you
drop it in somewhere

00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,140
<i>"e-even though...</i>

643

...they might not be"?

644
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,510
Evelyn Waugh.

645
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,850
"And so to bed"...
Samuel Pepys.

646
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,630
So, have you granted your favor
to John?

647
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,360
<i>Told him
who's in the novel?</i>

648
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,960
We h-have other things
to talk about.

649
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,110
<i>No one has read
my novel...</i>

650
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,540
no one but the publisher.

651
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,840
It doesn't matter.

652
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,110
Well, it does matter.
I-I f-feel let down.

653
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,380
Am I not a part,

654
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,110
s-some s-small p-part
of your life?

655
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,720
You were very gallant.

656
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,660
V-Very stupid.

657
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,820
No, John.

658
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,570
Will you come in?

659
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,380
<i>Have you been
e- entertaining?</i>

660
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,500
Yes.

661
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,810
All these people.

662
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,410
And to think
I chose you, well...

663
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,850
obvious lack of...

664
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,360
I mean, I thought that
I fought no competition.

665
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,410
What's this?

666
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,820
A friend made it.

667
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,330
Oh, is she a c-cook,
your friend?

668
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,890
No, he's a philosopher,

669
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,160
but his real interests
are cooking and telephones.

670
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,230
I'd like you
to read this.

671
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,240
I was rather afraid
you might not like it.

672
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,510
T-Thank you.

673
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,480
I value your opinion.

674
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,320
Perhaps it's time
we made love.

675
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,760
Yes?

676
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,390
Yes.
That's what I thought.

677
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,000
Have you got
a French letter?

678
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,670
A rubber thingy.

679
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,710
Oh.
Lord, no.

680
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,900
Well.

681
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,150
We'll just have to be
careful.

682
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,700
I-I don't...
don't exactly...

683
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,340
It will be easier
if you take your trousers off.

684
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,710
Yes.
Yes, of course.

685
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,080
I've never...

686
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,620
I'm a r-rather
late s-starter.

<i>My brother used to have to
t- tie my shoelaces for me</i>

688

689
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,990
I-I-I don't know if...

690
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,790
I do.

691
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,730

697

No, Iris!

No! No, help!

701
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,620
Help!

702
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,320
I'm trying to help you!

703
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:17,830
S-S-S-So sorry.

704
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,140
Please, don't, Iris.

705
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:29,240
You have n-nothing
to be sorry about.

706
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,720
<i>It would be unfair,
and I couldn't bear it.</i>

707
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,590
We should be saying
s-sorry to you...

708
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,390
and n-not just sorry,
but...

709
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,330
S-Shall I read to you?

710
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,340
Shall I?

Yes, my darling,

718
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,800
You wrote books.

719
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,570
Books... I wrote.

720
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,710
You wrote novels...
wonderful novels.

721
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,980
I wrote.

722
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,890
Such things you wrote...

723
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,460
special things...
secret things.

724
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,240
Do you know
many secrets now, Iris?

<i>How, then, can she say things
of such a terrible lucidity?</i>

Which bitterly empty jungle
does that come from?

731
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,300
We don't know.

732
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,360
<i>Not we.
You... you don't know.</i>

D-Don't hide, please.

734
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,870
Is it not
r-remotely possible

735
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:47,220
that what Iris says is
of some c-consequence, yes?

736
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,310
Yes, perhaps.

737
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:54,050
So, perhaps, we ought to
l-learn her language

before the lights
go out.

739

The lights will go out.

Yes, of course,
they will.

741

You all keep telling me...
us... that.

742

Persevere.</i>

746

<i>Iris, your notebook!</i>

00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,990
No, wait!

748
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,870
No, no, no, no.
Come. Come.

749
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,310
That's it. There.

750
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,600
Come on. Come on.

751
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,240
You walk...

752

you read...

753
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,610
paddle in the sea...

754
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,180
...then you'll write.

755
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,920
Be just like
the old days.

756
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,090
John!

757
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,560
Iris... Mama.

758

<i>- Look who's here,

759
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,060
Look who's here.
Hello. Hello.

760
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,040
Hello.

Yes, Iris... sea.

763
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,580
I thought we'd walk
to calm her down a bit.

764
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,820
She has an idea
for a novel.

765
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,860
Hello, Iris.

766
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,890
- Hello, Iris.
- Hello, Iris.

767
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,590
Talk to her,
Janet.

768

Hello, Iris.

769
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,590
Sea's a bit cold
for swimming.

770
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:41,360
Stay as long as you like.
There's plenty of room.

771
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,560
You're not to worry.

772
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,470
Oh, we don't want to be
a nui...

773
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,600
No, you're not.

774
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,440
She's as much of a mom
as anyone.

775
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,070
Give her
a bit of a rest.

776
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,510
Can't rush around
these days, John...
tummy trouble.

777
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,980
- Is she ill?
- She gets tired easily.

778
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,420
She's really not...

779
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,320
what do we do?

780
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,450
We just talk to her,
say things to her

781
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,620
that she can write...
she can, you know?

782
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,880
It's all right,
is it, John?

783
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,080
You know,
it'll get better

784
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,280
as you get to know
each other better.

785
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,660
I-Iris has got
more than one world

786
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,460
going on inside her head...
a secret world.

787
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,620
Until another book
comes out.

788
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,260
I'm the only friend
that knows of her secret world.

789
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,630
Oh, John.

790
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,900
<i>No, no. It's like living
in a fairy story.</i>

791
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,460
I'm the young man in love
with a beautiful maiden

792
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,480
who disappears into
an unknown and mysterious world

793
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,010
every now and again,

794
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,450

00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,200
<i>He's got his clothes on!</i>

799
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,130
<i>He's got his clothes on!</i>

800
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,170
- He's got his clothes on.

801
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,430
<i>He's got his clothes on.</i>

802
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,570
Seems very sensible
to me.

803
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,150
Janet,
are you all right?

804
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,350
I'm absolutely fine, John.
I'm fine.

805
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,290
I thought I'd get her
to sign this.

806
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,850
Anything...
anything is fine.

807
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,660
Just get her to write.

808
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,630
<i>Does she know anything
about her past...</i>

809
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,070
her career, work,
friends?

810
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,840
S-Something
of a c-closed book,

811
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:47,680
but it's there.
I know it.

812
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,220
<i>- Oh, they look
wonderful.</i>

813
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,600
Well done, puss.

814
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,300
Good to see your book
so well received, Iris.

815
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,670
Yes, wasn't it?

816
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,710
You thought you'd never
finish it, didn't you?

817
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,240
I read her the reviews.

818
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,440
I read you the reviews,
Iris.

819
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,780
<i>You hated me doing it
before.</i>

820
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,940
Would you sign your new book
for me, Iris?

821
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,110
Like postcards, do it at once,
or you don't.

822
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,750
Please.

823
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,670
I see an angel.

824
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,840
<i>I think it's you.</i>

825
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,680
<i>- De nos amours</i>

826
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,220
<i>Que reste-t-il...</i>

827
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,910
<i>They're under water now.</i>

828
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,720
There are some drugs,
aren't there, Iris?

829
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:43,060
<i>They don't last long.</i>

830
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,960
<i>When the f-friendly f-fog
disperses,</i>

831
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:49,470
there yawns the precipice
before you, doesn't it, puss?

832
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,070
They're beautiful.

833
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,310
<i>Horrible, isn't it?
Horrible.</i>

834
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,870
Horrible thing,

835
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,750
you there with your toes
at the edge of the precipice.

836
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,750
<i>You can say
anything you like</i>

837
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,620
as long as you m-make it
sound like a j-joke.

838
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,750
Oh, don't, John.
That's cruel.

839
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,310
<i>That's where you're wrong.</i>

840
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,380
It's not cruel, it's nothing,
because it's not understood.

841
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,490
<i>She's in her own world now.</i>

842
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,260
It's perhaps
what she's always wanted.

843
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:27,670
<i>... et dans un nuage
le cher visage</i>

844
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,180
<i>De mon passe</i>

845
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,680
Come on.

846
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,370
Let's go in.

847
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,360
<i>Que reste-t-il
de nos amours</i>

848
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:59,460
<i>Que reste-t-il
de ces beaux jours</i>

849
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:03,340
<i>Une photo, vieille photo</i>

850
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:07,180
<i>De ma jeunesse</i>

851
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,370
<i>Que reste-t-il
des billets doux</i>

852
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,880
When do we go?

853
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,440
<i>Des mois d'avril,
des rendez-vous</i>

854
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,890
<i>Un souvenir
qui me poursuit</i>

855
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,190
<i>Sans cesse</i>

856
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,530
<i>Bonheur fane,
cheveux au vent</i>

857
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,970
<i>Baisers voles,
reves mouvants</i>

858
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,570
<i>Que reste-t-il
de tout cela</i>

859
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,100
<i>Dites-le-moi</i>

860
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:43,550
<i>Un petit village,
un vieux clocher</i>

861
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,920
<i>Un paysage si bien cache</i>

862
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:52,220
<i>Et dans un nuage
le cher visage...</i>

863
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,490
Chin up, John.

864
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,060
Janet.

865
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,830
Yes, puss. Yes.

866
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,350
Going, going.

867
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,250
Now you go.

868
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,820
Soon.
We'll... we'll go soon.

869
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,330
Now. Now.

870
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,740
Who is it?

871
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,700
Who is it?

872
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,400
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

873
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,380
<i>Are you there?</i>

874
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,250
Where this?

875
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,950
<i>Soars, enchanted</i>

876
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,960
<i>I hear
the sweet lark sing...</i>

877
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,630
<i>How much is that doggie
in the window?</i>

878
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,300
<i>The one
with the waggly tail</i>

879
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,400
<i>How much is that doggie
in the window?</i>

880
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:24,240
<i>I do hope that doggie's
for sale</i>

881
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,410
Bravo! Bravo!

882
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,010
Another! Another!

883
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,490
Sing your mother's song!

884

<i>Sing your mother's song.</i>

885
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,620
<i>My soul's adoration</i>

886
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:45,030

890
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:03,980
<i>It is this
that gives my soul</i>

891
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:08,620
<i>All its joyous elation</i>

892
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:13,460
<i>As I hear
the sweet lark sing</i>

893
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:20,400
<i>In the clear air
of the day...</i>

894
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:26,270
<i>Dear thoughts
are in my mind</i>

895
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:31,840
<i>And my soul soars,
enchanted</i>

<i>For a tender
beaming smile</i>

899
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:53,090
<i>To my hope
has been granted</i>

900

<i>And tomorrow

Come, gentlemen.

904
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,710
You shall have to do
better than this.

905
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:52,390
Aren't you a bad cat?

906

Morning.

Good morning.
Oh, thank you.

- I'm like Proteus.

933
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,970
You've got to keep hold

even though he changed into
a lion... and a fish...

I have, of c-course, looked

that I d-don't belong

947

Between the soup

01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,640
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

952
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,430
I caught her
before she got to the checkout.

953

She's been g-gone for hours.

Well, all is well, then.

d-do tell me your name.

957
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:13,320
I'm Maurice, John.

958
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,250
Iris's friend.

959
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,590
I was a witness
at your wedding.

960
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,630
Oh.

961
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:23,390
Well,
I'm late for a meeting.

962
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,020
M-Maurice.
S-So sorry.

963
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,900
So sorry.

964
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,000
W-Were you trying
to get away from me?

965
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:07,770
D-Did you want
to leave me, Iris?

966
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,140
Please.

967
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,730
<i>Young -
I-I f-feel as if I don't
know anything about you!</i>

968
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,640
<i>- When you
know everything about me,
then I'll be dead.</i>

969
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,440
He's a professor
of ancient history.

970
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,780
They have
a m-malign influence
on you, I think.

971
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,440
They all have...
all your friends.

972
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,490
He's a teacher.
A master of thought.

973
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,390
Oh, you two talk, do you?
Y-you master thoughts together?

974
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,260
We make love,
yes, but that's not
the important thing.

975
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,490
Then he goes home
to his wife in London.

976
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,890
Does it frighten you?

977
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,370
I f-feel that I'm just
s-standing in a long line

978
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,990
of suitors
waiting for a kind word.

979
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,370
I always give you
a kind word.

980
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,300
You must accept me
as I am.

981
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,780
And I'm to be kept in my box
o-or not kept at all?

982
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,080
Nothing matters
except loving what is good.

983
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:27,280
Am I good?

984
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,840
Just...

985
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,120
<i>keep tight hold of me,
and it'll be all right.</i>

986
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,260
Who are you with
now, Iris?!

987
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:43,600
<i>Who is it?!</i>

988
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,300
We're lost!

989
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,570
We're lost!
We're lost!

990
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:56,770
We're lost!

991
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:00,310
We're lost! We're lost!
We're lost!

992
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,690
There's no reason for this!

993
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,130
And if there is,
I don't know it!

994
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,320
I hate you, Iris,
you stupid cow!

995
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,760
I bloody loathe you...

996
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,230
every bloody inch of you!

997
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,670
All your friends
are finished with you!

998
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,100
I've got you now!

999
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:25,110
Nobody else has you anymore

1000
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,770
except your fucking best friend,
Dr. Fucking Alzheimer

1001
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,150
with all his fucking gifts!

1002
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,650
I've got you now,
and I don't want you!

1003
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,280
I've never known anything
about you at all,

1004
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,090
and now I don't care!

1005
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,460
Ohh. Ohh.

1006
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,630
<i>- I think
it's time I told you</i>

1007
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,800
about
some of my friends...

1008
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,740
the people in my past,

1009
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,110
of my heart and...
and not.

1010
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,040
Oh, dear.

1011
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:12,520
Ought I to t-take notes?

1012
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,730
There was a friend
who was a student with me.

1013
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,200
No, he can wait.

1014
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:30,170
He was not the first person
I went to bed with.

1015
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,570
That was Harry.

1016
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,410
Then there was Roger,
who wanted to marry me.

1017
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,250
<i>And Oscar, who said
he couldn't live without me.</i>

1018
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,050
<i>And Tom...</i>

1019
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,890
<i>who far too clearly could,
but...</i>

1020
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,520
so, the student friend I had
resisted going to bed with

1021
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,720
joined the army
during the war

1022
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,590
and promptly asked me
to marry him for...

1023
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,360
he was certain
he was going to be killed

1024
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,270
and wanted me to have
the widow's pension.

1025
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:05,730
<i>Yes, I know.
They all said that.</i>

1026
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,180
<i>Anyway...</i>

1027
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:11,270
I didn't want
to marry him...

1028
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,340
but I did go to bed
with him.

1029
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,950
I... I thought that best
before he went off to fight

1030
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,720
because you never know.

1031
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:27,430
Anyway, he w... he was killed,
my student friend,

1032
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:32,490
and we weren't married...

1033
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:36,730
so no pension.

1034
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,410
There.

1035
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,640
I-It wouldn't have been much,
anyway, I know,

1036
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,150
because I had friends killed.

1037
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,650
Their wives got very little...
get v-very little.

1038
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:57,990
Is that all...
I-I mean, roughly?

1039
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,090
What about the f-friends
in your other world?

1040
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,000
You know more about me
than anyone on Earth.

1041
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,410
You are my world.

1042
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,860
Thank you.

1043
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,460
A-After all that,

1044
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,760
I r-rather hoped
it might be time for me
to get my kind word.

1045
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,210
<i>-You don't need to do it
on your own.</i>

1046
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,540
<i>Vale House is very good.</i>

1047
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:47,870
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1048
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,850
You're exhausted,
you know that.

1049
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:52,410
Of course I am!
It's something that we share!

1050
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,950
We're in
a s-state of g-grace.

1051
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,650
I think
we understand each other.

1052
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,690
What do you think?

1053
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,350
I don't know.

1054
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:05,490
There's always help
if you need it.

1055
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,020
Isn't there any help
for her?

1056
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,270
What? Sorry?

1057
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,770
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

1058
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:40,760
<i>Janet's dead, Iris.</i>

1059
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:47,040
They want me to say a few words,
but I can't think of any.

1060
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,340
No, no. No, Janet...

1061
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:51,270
Janet's dead, Iris.

1062
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,750
<i>I m-miss Janet very much.</i>

1063
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,290
I m-miss Janet

1064
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,090
because I used to store up
funny things to tell her

1065
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,190
had happened to us...

1066
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,720
things I could no longer
tell Iris.

1067
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,700
<i>Another friend visited us
in Oxford overnight, recently,</i>

1068
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:24,330
and I found her
cleaning the bath.

1069
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,500
I said, " Oh, please,
T-T-There's no need."

1070
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,310
She said, " Oh, yes, there is.
I want to take a bath."

1071
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,550
<i>I was hoping to be able
to tell Janet that story.</i>

1072
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,890
<i>S-She would have enjoyed it.</i>

1073
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,160
S-She would've laughed...

1074
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:50,960
I mean, I think.

1075
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,930
Anna Karenina...
Tolstoy, you know...

1076
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,170
went on her way
to the station

1077
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,610
to throw herself
under a train...

1078
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,980
sees something funny

1079
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:07,070
which she thinks to tell
Vronsky, her lover, about.

1080
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,450
<i>We all do it.</i>

1081
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,620
<i>I do it with Iris and Janet...
all our friends.</i>

1082
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,520
But then, Anna thought,

1083
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,930
that she wouldn't be seeing
Vronsky again

1084
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,190
because she was
about to kill herself.

1085
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,600
Y-You don't want to hear this.

1086
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,830
Janet didn't kill herself.

1087
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:39,880
But if there's one thing
that would have prevented Anna

1088
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:43,910
from t-throwing herself
under a train,

1089
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,080
that would be it...

1090
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,920
the... the thought
of t-telling something funny

1091
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,330
to t-the man she loves.

1092
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,130
Well, t-the love is over.

1093
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,440
Oh...

1094
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:11,570
Life will...

1095
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,640
soon be over.

1096
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:18,080
<i>That's all.</i>

1097
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,590
Goodbye, Janet.

1098
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,490
No! No! Janet!

1099
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,260
Jan... Janet!
Janet!

1100
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:27,560
It's all right, Iris.

1101
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:28,560
Janet! Janet!

1102
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:31,300
Help! Help! Help me!

1103
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,700
Help me!

1104
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,170
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down.

1105
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,900
<i>Janet!</i>

1106
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:38,910
Wrong! Wrong!

1107
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,770
No, Iris! Stop it, Iris!

1108
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,870
Wrong driving!

1109
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,040
Stop it, Iris!

1110
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,880
No! Not house!

1111
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,710
No! No!

1112
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,610
Them! Them!

1113
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:53,120
Them! Them!

1114
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,120
Iris!

1115
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,090
Puss!

1116
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,530
Puss!
My old mouse!

1117
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,870
My old cat-mouse!
Where are you?!

1118
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:32,730
Oh!

1119
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,770
Ohh!

1120
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,490
I...

1121
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:45,510
love...

1122
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,910
you.

1123
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:53,040
Oh, little mouse!

1124
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,850
I know you do.

1125
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:15,570
I used to be so afraid
of being alone with you.

1126
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,610
Now I can't be without you.

1127
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:30,540
Let's get us home.

1128
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:35,060
And then there will be
tomorrow...

1129
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,590
and the next day...

1130
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,690
and the next...

1131
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,930
and on we go.

1132
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,520
Easy.

1133
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,870
Closer and closest
together.

1134
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:51,600
Oh, your ring.

1135
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,610
It's so worn now.

1136
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,650
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

1137
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,810
From a pawn broker's.

1138
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,510
I like things
that are worn down...

1139
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:06,790
just wear, wear, wear...

1140
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:09,160
until they go.

1141
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,400
<i>- We've, uh,
had a bit of luck.</i>

1142
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,940
<i>The usual thing, I'm afraid...
somebody's died.</i>

1143
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,750
Iris...

1144
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,760
D-D-Do you have a smile
for Dr. Gudgeon?

1145
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,790
No?

1146
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,090
No.

1147
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,490
So...

1148
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,130
the time has come.

1149
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,070
You knew it would,
Professor Bayley.

1150
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,260
Yes.

1151
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,870
She d-didn't have a smile
for you today.

1152
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,380
Yes.

1153
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,470
Well,
we must make a start.

1154
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,910
- What d-do I do?
- Nothing anymore.

1155
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,280
Vale House
is a very friendly place.

1156
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,350
I was surprised...

1157
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:18,590
well, I mean,
this is one of the best...

1158
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:23,190
more difficult to get
into than, well, Eton.

1159
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:05,510
<i>Taxi for Vale House.</i>

1160
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,940
Yes.

1161
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,040
The lady's on the s-stairs,
but I can't get her down.

1162
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,020
<i>Shall I?</i>

1163
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:21,460
Y'all right, my love?

1164
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,960
We're goin'
for a little drive.

1165
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,190
That's all right,
isn't it?

1166
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:30,130
What's your name, then?

1167
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,700
Iris.

1168
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,830
Yes, it's Iris.

1169
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:40,740
All right, then, Iris.

1170
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:43,410
You'll be all right,
my love.

1171
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,970
Come on, upsy-daisy.

1172
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,720
There you go.

1173
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,550
Lovely.

1174
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:24,880
<i>- Human beings
love each other...</i>

1175
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,590
<i>in sex, in friendship,
and when they're in love.</i>

1176
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,690
And they cherish
other beings...

1177
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:39,290
humans, animals, plants,
even stones.

1178
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:43,530
She'll be fine, now,
won't ya, Iris?

1179
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:46,040
You can visit
any time you like.

1180
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:48,370
Come all day
if you want to.

1181
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,210
Stay the night.
That's all right.

1182
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,220
We can make arrangements
for you to do that any time.

1183
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:57,740
It was s-so q-quiet...

1184
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:01,810
when she died.

1185
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,950
Do you know, I-I thought,

1186
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:08,820
"I wouldn't mind doing that
myself"?

1187
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,290
I h-had a joke to tell her.

1188
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:18,790
It wasn't a very good one,
but she'd have laughed.

1189
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:22,330
<i>- We need to believe
in something divine</i>

1190
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,700
without the need for God,

1191
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:30,270
something we might call love
or goodness.

1192
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,980
<i>As the psalm says,</i>

1193
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,710
"Whither shall I go
from thy spirit?

1194
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,880
"Whither shall I flee
from thy presence?

1195
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,930
"If I ascend unto heaven,
thou art there:

1196
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:46,400
<i>"If I make my bed in hell,
behold, thou art there.</i>

1197
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,830
"If I take the wings
of the morning,

1198
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,390
"And dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea;

1199
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:55,500
"Even there shall thy hand
lead me,

1200
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:58,410
and thy right hand
shall hold me."

1201
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:20,800
<i>- Dear thoughts
are in my mind</i>

1202
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:26,710
<i>And my soul soars,
enchanted</i>

1203
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:53,960
<i>And tomorrow he shall hear</i>

1204
01:29:54,040 --> 01:30:01,070
<i>All my fond heart can say</i>
