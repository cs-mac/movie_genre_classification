1
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,282
I am afraid to die...

2
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,786
STATEMENT

3
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,754
If I die in a car accident,

4
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:30,762
in a mugging or any other means;

5
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,264
it will be the work of the same murderers

6
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,632
of my beloved son,
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones.

7
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,856
To my friend:
Chico Buarque de Holanda

8
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,964
I'm Zuzu Angel.

9
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,834
I was born in Curvelo, Minas Gerais.

10
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,807
I was married to an American,
Norman Angel Jones.

11
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,846
We had three children.

12
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:13,485
When we got divorced,
I already lived in Rio de Janeiro,

13
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:16,522
and supported my kids sewing
and designing clothes.

14
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:22,186
Little by little,
I established a brand.

15
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,521
1971 was the apex
of my carreer.

16
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,259
The success of my fashion in NY

17
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,254
widened my perspectives.

18
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,231
I was excited upon my return
to Rio de Janeiro,

19
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,597
all my dreams were
coming true.

20
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:41,436
Good afternoon, girls!

21
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:47,070
I was sure that if I got
a loan at a bank,

22
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,579
I could expand my business,

23
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,946
and launch my clothes worldwide.

24
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:56,110
I scheduled meetings, made contacts...
I dedicated myself to this project.

25
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,919
Zuzu! Congratulations!

26
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:02,586
On the other hand,
I couldn't fool myself:

27
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,597
My life wasn't only fun
and success.

28
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,599
What's your problem?

29
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,635
What else could you hope for?

30
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:14,302
It's been 6 months since
I last heard from Stuart.

31
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:23,982
Come on!

32
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:25,642
Are you OK?

33
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,318
Everybody, shut up!

34
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,668
Júlia, stand up!

35
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,013
Júlia!

36
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,315
Let's go!

37
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,011
Paulo! Hurry up!

38
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,662
Friends, I'm sorry
for being late.

39
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,027
The city is at a standstill.

40
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,161
Police are everywhere.

41
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,326
Don't tell me there's been
another kidnapping!

42
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,996
No! Lamarca's gang!

43
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,663
They robbed my bank agency.

44
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,335
Did they take the money
you promised us?

45
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,038
Don't worry! The insurance will pay.

46
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:32,680
Pelé says he's going to quit
the brazilian football team...

47
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,687
One more bank robbery
in Rio de Janeiro.

48
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,383
Who left the TV on?

49
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:39,716
Mom?

50
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,884
The american paper New York Times...

51
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:45,059
OK! I turned the TV off.

52
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,702
Congratulations on the loan!

53
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,365
Now we can prepare the clothes
for the next season calmly!

54
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,203
- Great, mom!
- Thank God!

55
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,401
Pretty flowers, uh?

56
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,877
I almost forgot:

57
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,709
Hilde called and
her paper wants to interview you.

58
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,717
I didn't know your sister
owned a paper now!

59
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:08,379
No, they want her
to interview you.

60
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,081
I'll schedule later.

61
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,777
Paulo "fell".

62
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,579
Pardon?

63
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:45,419
Pay attention, madam:
Paulo "fell". Try the Army.

64
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,254
What kind of prank is that?
I don't know any Paulo.

65
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,793
You don't understand...

66
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,770
- What do you mean "fell"?
- Was arrested.

67
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,773
Is he alive? Hurt?

68
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,435
I only know he was taken
by the Army.

69
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,445
- But is he OK?
- Nobody knows.

70
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,105
It's Tuti, isn't it? Stuart?

71
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,809
Go to the Army before
it's too late. Hurry!

72
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:13,819
What's up, mom?

73
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:15,821
Who was it?

74
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:20,321
Your brother, he was arrested.

75
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,453
Hey, Stuart!

76
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,793
My mom says I can't go
to your house

77
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,298
And you can't come to mine.

78
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,298
Why?

79
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,460
She doesn't want
a divorcée's son there.

80
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,470
My mother is not divorced!

81
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,803
Then where's your dad?
Does he live at home?

82
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,967
No...

83
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,806
Don't try to fool me, Stuart!
She's divorced!

84
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,473
- So what?
- So she is a slut.

85
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:43,674
Your mother is a slut.

86
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,524
Hey, son, won't you give me
a kiss?

87
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,527
What happened, Tuti?

88
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,193
They've been speaking ill about you.

89
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,197
Because I got divorced?

90
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:06,201
Don't care for what they say!
That bunch of fools.

91
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:08,369
Let me see.

92
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,843
But if you want
to defend your mom,

93
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,506
you have to get stronger.

94
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,549
Just beans won't be enough!

95
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,545
Go and wash up, son!

96
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:03,758
Go!

97
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:04,588
Yes!

98
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,268
Go, go, go!

99
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,924
Flamengo!

100
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,459
Tuti!

101
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,605
It's impossible, mom!
Didn't the person leave a name?

102
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:48,935
No, daughter.

103
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,942
- Couldn't it be a prank?

104
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,477
- No.

105
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,973
Call your sister.
We must leave now.

106
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,339
I'll get Tuti's ID.
Hurry up, daughter.

107
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:27,645
Did the man say
where Tuti was?

108
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:29,977
Was there a gunfight?
Is he hurt?

109
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,643
He said nothing.
Just that he was at the Army.

110
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,652
Didn't he warn anybody else?

111
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,348
They only call the mother, because
she's the only fool who cares.

112
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:41,493
Where are the people that he
defends to free him now?

113
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,495
Hilde! Did Tuti see you in the theater?

114
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,999
Yeah! I mean, I think so.

115
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:51,332
Because from the stage,
we don't see the audience well.

116
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:55,533
But there was this night I was
almost sure he was there.

117
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:02,036
I just hope that Tuti comes
to his senses and leaves Brazil.

118
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,865
Excuse me! I'm looking for my son.

119
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:28,031
Now? It is not a good time.

120
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:30,041
Do you want me to wait
until dawn!

121
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,576
If he's innocent, no problem.

122
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,742
Calm down!

123
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,379
- What's your son's name?
- Paulo.

124
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,543
- Family name?
- Let's go!

125
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,883
We don't do this kind of job,

126
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:45,048
we are tired
and you are very nervous.

127
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,558
And how do you expect me to be?

128
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,059
I'm just trying to help.

129
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:52,586
OK! I apologize.

130
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:57,398
Can I show you a picture?

131
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,595
This is my son.

132
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,567
His name is
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones.

133
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,734
His father is American.

134
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,405
Tell me: Is his name
Paulo or Stuart?

135
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,745
Because if you don't even know his
name, it's going to be harder.

136
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,751
People call him Paulo.

137
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,081
"People", who?

138
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:18,089
His friends!
But his name is Stuart.

139
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,091
Is he Brazilian or American?

140
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,458
- Does he speak English?
- It would help...

141
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:29,634
Frankly, I've never seen this face.

142
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,805
We don't even do this job.

143
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,776
I'm sorry, madam,
but we can't help you out.

144
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:40,436
The van is waiting.

145
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:43,106
I just need to know if he's here,
and if he is well.

146
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:47,141
Come back during "visit hours"!

147
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:55,152
Does your son
have a fake name?

148
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:57,954
Stuart!

149
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,464
- Wait a minute...
- Where is your brother?

150
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:03,501
Over there! He spent
the whole afternoon with Sônia.

151
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,806
Just what I needed!
Does this girl live here now?

152
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,637
- Don't be rude, mom!
- Rude?

153
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,676
I'm going to show him "rude".

154
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:15,680
Stuart!

155
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,144
- Stuart, What's going on?
- What do you mean?

156
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,518
What are you doing
locked in here?

157
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,857
Studying...

158
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:27,692
Right!

159
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,696
Didn't you have anything
better to do?

160
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:40,531
And this picture in the paper?

161
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,171
Students demonstrate in rio

162
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:46,541
We taught the imperialist
pigs a lesson.

163
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,513
Who are the pigs?

164
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,845
- The IMF is one of them.
- USAID...

165
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,852
Rockfeller. But yesterday
they learned something.

166
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,683
What did they learn?

167
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,552
We taught them a lesson.

168
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,183
So I heard on the radio.

169
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,027
Two windows shattered at Sears
and one at a Bank!

170
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:09,864
The gringos must know they won't
get away with exploiting Brazil!

171
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:13,200
The population backed us up.
People are really dissatisfied!

172
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,206
How can you be so na: L: Ve?

173
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:17,208
Ms. Angel, there's no freedom!

174
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,210
Artists are being persecuted.

175
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,872
The fascists beat actors
in 5 plays!

176
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,211
The people will put
an end to this!

177
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:26,877
You are so mistaken.

178
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,546
My seamstresses, for example.

179
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:33,717
They come to work like sardines,
and get on the bus before dawn.

180
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,886
They have neither the time,
nor the wits to back you up.

181
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,759
Do you defend the dictatorship?

182
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,930
Was that what I said?
Was it, Tuti?

183
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:49,103
You know it wasn't.

184
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,244
I said everybody is trying
to survive.

185
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,246
Nobody has time for politics.

186
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:58,078
People will realize, sooner or later,
that capitalism is coming to an end

187
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,242
all over the world.

188
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:02,253
Is that what you study,
Mr. Student?

189
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:06,917
I'm not just a student!
I have an ideology. I'm socialist.

190
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:11,088
You should help him come to his senses
instead of backing up this madness.

191
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:12,255
She agrees with me.

192
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:15,630
We chose not to close our eyes
to injustice in the world.

193
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:25,276
One of them was polite...

194
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:28,643
And the other aggressive.
I know how it works, Zuzu.

195
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,286
One bites, the other licks.
It's their technique in tor...

196
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:36,321
Torture?

197
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:38,656
It's a fact.

198
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:40,988
Shall we sit down?

199
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:48,295
Zuzu, the Army denies that
Stuart or "Paulo"

200
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,301
was arrested.

201
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,304
They say nobody was arrested
in the last three days.

202
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,306
Can't you come up with a writ?

203
00:21:55,374 --> 00:22:00,311
No. The dictatorship abolished writs
in case of political crimes.

204
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:05,316
Now they can keep the prisoner
for 45 days without any notice.

205
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:07,352
Doesn't the fact that
Tuti is American help?

206
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:12,986
Does his father have any contacts
at the embassy?

207
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:16,687
Forget Norman. He went to Minas
to open an orphanage.

208
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:22,663
Fraga, tell me what I need to do.

209
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:24,861
I've always handled things
by myself.

210
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:29,700
Especially, my children.

211
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:41,048
These clothes are remarkable.

212
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:45,352
I tried to do something
typically Brazilian.

213
00:22:45,424 --> 00:22:49,383
If I wore one of these,
Bosco would kill me!

214
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,860
I still make by order.

215
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:55,729
More traditional clothes.

216
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:01,402
If you want, don't even schedule.
Just show up!

217
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:03,908
Thank you!

218
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,742
Bosco is coming soon.

219
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:21,726
If we have your son, I'm sure
he's being well-treated.

220
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,387
I can't thank you enough, General.

221
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,090
It's a war.

222
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,401
A war against revolution.

223
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,407
That's why our prisoners are treated
according to the Geneva Convention.

224
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,443
To the letter!

225
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:50,918
I come here every day
to check on the prisoners.

226
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:54,755
Some time ago, there was this girl
who kept on crying.

227
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:58,421
I asked her why she cried so much.

228
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:02,433
She told me her husband
was killed here,

229
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,128
in my barracks.

230
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:08,940
Can you believe it?
And put both in the same cell.

231
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,947
Everyday, I visited them
and asked if they were OK.

232
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:22,452
But when he went to court,

233
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:27,288
the lad said he was brutally
tortured here.

234
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,795
Can you believe it? I got mad:

235
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:32,454
"What kind of talk is that?

236
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:38,128
I treated you like my children,
and you put me through this?"

237
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:41,639
Later, he admitted the lawyer told him
to say that

238
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:43,503
to get rid of the sentence.

239
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:50,981
May I come in?

240
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:51,845
Yes.

241
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:02,516
Excuse me! Did you see a prisoner
named Paulo around?

242
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:05,355
Say it, son.

243
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:08,829
No! I don't know who is...

244
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,867
Stuart?

245
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,868
No, madam! Never seen.

246
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,207
Thank you.

247
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,512
I knew your son wasn't here.

248
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:28,519
But I wanted you
to see for yourself.

249
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:31,021
And I didn't like what I saw!

250
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,522
Why?

251
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:37,358
Do you think I believe those clean
and pressed sheets?

252
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,557
They seem fake to me, General.

253
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:45,199
Madam, your son must
have left Brazil.

254
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,067
He didn't leave.

255
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,904
I'm responsible for the Army.

256
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:54,575
Have you been to the Navy
or the Air Force?

257
00:25:57,949 --> 00:25:59,211
Ms. Angel,

258
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:02,879
why do you think your son
is here at the Air Base?

259
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:06,913
The Army says he's not there,
but I know he's been arrested.

260
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:11,592
Sorry.

261
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,565
What I meant to say was:

262
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:17,261
Why do you think your son's
been arrested?

263
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:19,604
Come in!

264
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,240
There's one thing I don't get:

265
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:27,074
If I got a call like that,
I'd think it was a prank.

266
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:29,943
But you believed! Why?

267
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:33,083
My son was in the student
movement.

268
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:38,248
But it's been a while since that
was dismantled. And then?

269
00:26:38,323 --> 00:26:40,086
He left home.

270
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,455
Undercover?

271
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:47,257
- Where are they?
- In Captain Mota's office.

272
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,926
You said they mentioned a Paulo,
right?

273
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,593
Yes, sir.

274
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,138
Then you knew he had a nickname!

275
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,604
He once said it to me.

276
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:58,643
Why?

277
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,271
In case something happened.

278
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:05,145
Then he was into risky businesses?

279
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:12,282
Captain, you're better informed
than we are.

280
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:14,291
I'm sure you know Ms. Angel

281
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,123
has reasons to be worried.

282
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:22,326
After Dr. Fraga called, I tried
to get news from Stuart or Paulo.

283
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:26,659
Have you heard about a supermarket
or bank robbery?

284
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:30,140
No.

285
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:33,302
Political kidnapping?

286
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:36,313
It's been two years I don't see
my son very often...

287
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:40,010
But one thing you must know:
Was your son a communist?

288
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,655
You've been very kind.

289
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:47,316
I just don't understand how this

290
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:49,656
is going to help me find my son.

291
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:52,162
Even physical evidence
may help.

292
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,324
Does he have a scar,
a beauty-spot,

293
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,163
gunshot wound...

294
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:58,202
No, no.

295
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:03,003
You mean something else.

296
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:07,340
You want me to say that my son
is subversive or a terrorist.

297
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:08,709
Is he?

298
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,342
Is that what you are, mom?

299
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:17,047
- What?
- The General's wife's seamstress!

300
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:22,685
Let's face it, Tuti.

301
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,854
You win the revolution,

302
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,228
and I make the dresses for
the women of the committee.

303
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:30,393
Come on, mom!

304
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:32,733
Is he, Ms. Angel?

305
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,408
Do you think I'm going to fink
my son?

306
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:42,375
This is circus!

307
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,745
I want to know what you
did to him!

308
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:48,218
- What kind of game is this?
- Calm down, Zuzu!

309
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:51,221
Enough! They know about Stuart,
otherwise he wouldn't be doing this.

310
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:53,052
Do you accuse us?

311
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:57,720
If Stuart committed a crime and
was arrested, let him be judged.

312
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,388
If he is found guilty,

313
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:02,228
I'll bring
him apples during visitation.

314
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,235
But I can't stand your pretending
he does not exist, :

315
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:07,396
Or that he be sentenced without
a trial.

316
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,440
You can't do that!

317
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,609
Boss, this woman is crazy.

318
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:23,420
What did you say, Captain?

319
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:24,455
Crazy.

320
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:28,751
No, she's not crazy.

321
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,454
She's dangerous.

322
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:33,460
Keep an eye on her!

323
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,768
Zuzu, I'll issue petitions
in the Military Courts.

324
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:41,636
They'll have to say
if Stuart is locked or not.

325
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,643
Do you have a minute, Fraga?

326
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:01,485
I'd like some information.
These are hard times, Ms. Zuleika

327
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:06,627
Angel, very hard times.
I know what I've been through,

328
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:09,326
father.

329
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:13,132
My son, Stuart, was arrested.

330
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:16,503
He may be at the Air Base.
Then, I thought...

331
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:21,137
You take care of the prisoners there.

332
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:27,310
My child, unfortunately,
most prisoners are atheists.

333
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:30,183
But my son has a kind heart,
father.

334
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,825
Everywhere I go,
people say he's not there.

335
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:36,485
But he was arrested!

336
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:39,826
- Keep calm!
- How can I be calm, father?

337
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:42,662
I don't know how he is, if he is
being tortured. I don't know!

338
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,168
Ms. Angel, don't worry.

339
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:49,195
Everything they say about the
prisons is communist propaganda.

340
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:55,877
I don't know if your son is at the Air
Base, but I'll try do find it out for you.

341
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:59,179
I appreciate that, father.

342
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,844
One thing I know for sure:

343
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,515
The torture they talk so much
about is untrue.

344
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,184
They are mild electrical shocks.

345
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:11,558
It's a little machine that kills
nobody, my child.

346
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,197
But even being mild,
does the Church agree?

347
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:22,228
Ms. Angel, they chose the path
of violence.

348
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,204
Listen to your words!

349
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:28,541
The shepherd must protect
the herd.

350
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:30,877
Wasn't the law enough?
Now anything goes!

351
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:35,249
The shepherd must protect
the entire herd.

352
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,382
You don't represent
the Brazilian Church,

353
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,255
which was never in favor of torture.

354
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:47,223
You should kneel down, pray,

355
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:52,258
and beg God to forgive you
for thinking the way you do.

356
00:31:55,974 --> 00:32:03,244
In regard to the terms from
document 692 of this court,

357
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:10,584
comma, I state that Stuart Edgar
Angel Jones

358
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:16,616
has never been locked in any
facility of the Army.

359
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:22,258
I state that the civilian
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones

360
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,268
is not and have never been locked
in the Navy.

361
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:30,273
Stuart Elgard Angel Gomes

362
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:33,276
is not locked

363
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:38,646
in the Jurisdiction of the
Air Force, period.

364
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,964
He's my son too, Zuleika.

365
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,626
Why didn't you tell me before
Stuart had disappeared?

366
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:59,295
As if we talked to each other,
Norman!

367
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,339
If you at least called sometimes.

368
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,977
I don't understand what
you're doing here.

369
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:09,639
I thought Tuti could be hiding
in your house,

370
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:11,841
or could have stayed here
on his escape.

371
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,063
Stuart's come here a couple of times.

372
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:18,726
He always brought clothes
to the children.

373
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:23,738
In one of the visits, I told him
he reminded me of my father.

374
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,070
Your father was a priest, Norman.

375
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:28,076
Exactly.

376
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:30,738
Both wanted to change the world.

377
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:37,082
My father battled sin and Stuart,
injustice in the world.

378
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:40,748
I'm sure Tuti didn't come here
to listen to your philosophy!

379
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:41,790
No!

380
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:48,631
He was a son visiting his father.

381
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,462
Last time he left, I thought...

382
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,772
I knew I'd never see him again...

383
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,807
Norman!

384
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,477
So soon!!

385
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:07,608
The last time he said
he'd get married.

386
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,447
- The girl...
- Sônia.

387
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,615
Yeah! He spoke highly of her,
said she was wonderful,

388
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,487
very altruistic.

389
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:20,659
Tuti! Tuti, my son, behave!

390
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:27,492
Don't be naughty!
That's not what I taught you!

391
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:35,173
Great!
You can kiss the bride!

392
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,844
To the newlyweds!

393
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,152
It's all settled then, João!

394
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,812
Don't worry, boss,
we finish tomorrow.

395
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,856
Please, don't forget!
Thank you.

396
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,663
What happened, Tuti?
What happened, son?

397
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:56,858
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, my God!

398
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:02,200
What happened? Say it!

399
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,540
Sônia was arrested.

400
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:11,539
Oh, my God!

401
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:17,879
What can we do?

402
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:22,349
Her father is in the Army.
He'll release her.

403
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:24,393
You don't get to do anything.

404
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:29,531
If you never want me to get
involved,

405
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,567
what are you doing here, Tuti?

406
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,883
That's crazy, Tuti.

407
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:51,886
- Mom, you don't understand...
- Yes, I understand.

408
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:54,889
A bunch of medium class kids from
Rio de Janeiro "decided" that

409
00:35:54,957 --> 00:35:59,894
they'd make a revolution in Brazil,
and my son is one of them.

410
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:03,227
Sorry! I shouldn't have come.
It was a moment of weakness.

411
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:06,894
It'd be good if you all had
more moments of weakness,

412
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:10,905
to understand you have great
feelings, but terrible ideas, kid.

413
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:13,237
It was out of weakness.
I shouldn't have come.

414
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,777
I hope you have more moments
of weakness.

415
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,614
Then I'd see you more often.

416
00:36:22,985 --> 00:36:23,952
I gotta go!

417
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:27,250
The shop will be great.

418
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:28,756
Son...

419
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:30,122
Gotta go, mom.

420
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:34,755
Stuart left, disappeared

421
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:38,927
on the streets and I didn't hear
from him for a long time.

422
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:42,095
One day, I heard Sônia was
released,

423
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,298
and both were living anonymously.

424
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:52,314
Sônia! My son!

425
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:58,145
Tuti! How I miss you!

426
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,623
Let's go up. I've got something
important to say.

427
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:03,625
- What happened?
- Let's go up.

428
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,285
- What is it?
- Is anybody else here?

429
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:06,658
No, I'm alone.

430
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,295
Turn off the light.

431
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,334
Turn it off.

432
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,965
Sônia is leaving Brazil tomorrow.

433
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,667
And so are you!

434
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,636
No, I can't.

435
00:37:23,713 --> 00:37:26,648
Sônia's just been released,
she can't possibly stay.

436
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,810
I'm not running away. I'm going
to spend some time abroad,

437
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,979
- then I'll come back.
- You're playing with fire.

438
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:34,318
It's definite, mom.

439
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,827
We want to stay here today. We had
a problem and have no other place.

440
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:41,830
We've been walking
for 5 hours around town.

441
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:42,830
Can we stay?

442
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,367
You're so rational!

443
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,867
I'm sure you won't miss
each other.

444
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:55,036
Sorry! I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore.

445
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:58,714
I'll fix you something
to eat.

446
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,713
Sit down.

447
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:23,735
What was it, Ms. Angel?

448
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:29,741
What is it, mom?

449
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:34,041
You don't want Sônia to travel
in these awful clothes.

450
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:36,050
I don't believe it, Ms. Angel!

451
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:39,713
Paris demands more from
Zuzu Angel's daughter-in-law.

452
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,757
She's going by way of Paraguay.

453
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,092
Try it out, Sônia.

454
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:54,732
Calm down!
Nobody arrives before 8 o'clock.

455
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:57,739
I'll come at 7. Get some rest.

456
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:58,774
Bye.

457
00:39:00,977 --> 00:39:01,944
Tuti...

458
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:10,452
Are you getting pretty
for the French guys?

459
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:12,454
You fool!

460
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:16,124
A jealous revolutionary?

461
00:39:21,998 --> 00:39:22,965
Soninha,

462
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:27,094
even if everything goes wrong,

463
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:30,263
we'll win. Don't worry!

464
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,773
Even if we don't see
each other again...

465
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:37,779
No! I'll come back. I promise you.

466
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,974
OK! Everything may happen,

467
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:42,980
but I want you to know
I love you,

468
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:48,319
and our dreams are worth
any sacrifice.

469
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:49,983
I love you too.

470
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:53,996
I feel the same way.

471
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,836
I love you. I love you.

472
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,166
But we don't need to suffer today.

473
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,175
Not today!

474
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:40,167
You mean Stuart is now in jail?

475
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,210
If we hope for the best...

476
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,562
- Your son?
- Yes.

477
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,034
I was dispirited on my way back
from Norman's house.

478
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:08,536
Out of despair, I believed Stuart

479
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:11,539
was hidden in his father's.

480
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:14,872
With all my hopes gone, it was clear

481
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:18,539
that something serious
had happened to my son.

482
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:21,583
But I couldn't imagine what
was in store for me in Rio.

483
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:40,628
"Madam,

484
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:44,291
it's very hard for me to say,

485
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:46,334
and I know it'll be even harder
for you.

486
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:58,309
It's not easy for me to be
so straightforward,

487
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,315
knowing that I'll be destroying
your hopes.

488
00:43:01,383 --> 00:43:03,317
Hopes that last in a
distressed mother due

489
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:06,013
to the disappearance
of her beloved child

490
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:11,318
Especially, in this case,

491
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:15,329
where I have an emotional
connection and involvement.

492
00:43:15,397 --> 00:43:19,197
Your son's death touches me too".

493
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:25,703
"Your son's death touches me too".

494
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:13,084
It's he. He's here.

495
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,089
In a green car.

496
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:34,105
Halt, boy!

497
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,780
Be quiet, man! Hands in the air!

498
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:48,418
"When Stuart fell,

499
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,426
he wore blue pants, a light-colored
shirt and a brown coat.

500
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:54,257
Let's go! Step on it!

501
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,289
He was taken in the trunk of
a car to Galeão Air Base.

502
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:03,100
On the night of May, 14th, :

503
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:05,265
I was tortured beside Stuart.

504
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:08,469
Paulo e Alberto, you already
know what I need.

505
00:45:11,347 --> 00:45:12,314
Bring the salt!

506
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:21,652
Oh, bastard, son of a bitch!

507
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,656
It's all a matter of time
and pain.

508
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:35,496
Don't lower the cans! Damn it!

509
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,302
More time, more pain.

510
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,842
Less time, less pain.

511
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:42,475
Don't lower the cans!

512
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:44,136
Where's Lamarca?

513
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,841
Spin the wheel.

514
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:50,344
Paulista, Cid, Cirilo!

515
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:58,025
Where's Lamarca?

516
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:15,873
"In the middle of the night, there
was a lot of noise in the patio.

517
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:20,507
Cars were turned on,

518
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:24,177
there were shouts, questions
and a constant cough

519
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,221
followed by feet pressing
accelerators".

520
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:36,530
"As it was common after tortures,

521
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:40,398
they cut the water supply in the cells
to make people thirstier after the shocks.

522
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:51,038
Stuart was in a cell beside mine.

523
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:53,411
I noticed he was in bad shape.

524
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,387
He wouldn't stop coughing
all night long. I heard it!

525
00:46:59,455 --> 00:47:02,219
He kept on saying three things":

526
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:06,557
"Water', "I'm going crazy",
and "I'm gonna die".

527
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:09,932
Quit being a fag, Paulo!
I'll give you an injection.

528
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:10,921
You won't die so soon.

529
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:21,238
"Almost at sunrise,

530
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,575
they opened the cell
and took Stuart.

531
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:28,275
He didn't move, was probably dead.

532
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:30,611
Somebody said":

533
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:34,956
"More food for the fish
in Marambaia".

534
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:42,463
It's over there, madam!

535
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,763
- Who is it?
- My son.

536
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,598
When is the funeral?

537
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,968
Could you leave me alone, please?

538
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:42,023
- Antônio?
- Yes?

539
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:46,523
You have children, don't you?

540
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:55,032
My son was in high school
less than 10 years ago.

541
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:58,039
Then he got involved into political
demonstrations of students.

542
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,709
He always hated guns and violence.

543
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,673
Then came the dictatorship,

544
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:10,548
censorship, prisoners... This horror!

545
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:13,714
But he didn't give up his ideals.

546
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,026
One day, I got a call
saying he was in jail.

547
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:22,063
I searched for him everywhere
but couldn't find!

548
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:27,061
Now, I get this letter
saying he was tortured,

549
00:49:29,605 --> 00:49:31,573
and that he was killed.

550
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:36,077
Do you know why?

551
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:40,081
Because he didn't want to give
an address.

552
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:43,414
The name and number
of a street.

553
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:49,583
You know which address
I'm talking about, don't you?

554
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:56,920
My son died to save yours!

555
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:05,436
Sir, your mouth...

556
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:15,780
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come
here. I'm confused...

557
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:21,785
Our sons fought together,

558
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:25,126
they must have been friends.

559
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,818
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

560
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:08,492
No! No newspaper in Brazil
will publish this letter.

561
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,174
It's forbidden to write your son's
name.

562
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,811
Even if you wanted to pay
for an obituary,

563
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:19,847
I couldn't publish it.

564
00:51:22,718 --> 00:51:25,186
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you.

565
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:39,166
Elke, how was the fashion show?

566
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:43,671
Girl, it was great. But I'm so tired
and it was a hell of a mess.

567
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,674
I think you should get into
the fashion business, Hilde.

568
00:51:46,742 --> 00:51:48,175
You're so pretty!

569
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:51,679
I want to be an actress.

570
00:51:51,747 --> 00:51:54,181
Actress? To be stuck in a theatre?

571
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:55,511
"Terrorists WANTED..."

572
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,711
"HELP PROTECT YOUR LIFE
AND FAMILY - CALL THE POLICE"

573
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:05,185
- What is it, Elke?
- Your brother is dead! They...

574
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,194
Don't do it!

575
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:10,698
First they kill him,
and then set up a warning?

576
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:14,862
The guy is coming. This is useless.
Let's go, please.

577
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:17,200
- What's going on?
- I came to say I know this one.

578
00:52:17,272 --> 00:52:19,866
- She is kidding.
- No, I'm not!

579
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:24,708
This is Stuart Angel who
was killed by the Air Force.

580
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,213
Let's go!

581
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:29,216
Look! Are you playing us?

582
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:30,876
- Me?
- Yes.

583
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:32,249
No.

584
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:42,230
FIY, the new collection
goes to the USA tomorrow.

585
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:43,889
Is it ready yet?

586
00:52:43,965 --> 00:52:45,762
And gorgeous. They're gonna love it.

587
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:51,568
I'm glad I have you
to hold the fort here.

588
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,734
You can count on me. I'm leaving.

589
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,243
Lúcia.

590
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:58,609
Will you post these letters for me?

591
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:03,250
Each scholar, artist, politic,

592
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,253
each prominent person in this
country will receive my letter.

593
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:07,913
Gosh, it's a lot of people...

594
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:12,756
And this one is for "Presidente"
Médici,

595
00:53:12,828 --> 00:53:15,626
so that he can't pretend he doesn't
know what happened to Tuti.

596
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:24,767
See how it's easy to walk

597
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,967
pretending nothing is going on.

598
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:37,641
Madam, this is happening
in your country!

599
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:40,981
Get it! It's important.

600
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:43,825
Oh, my!

601
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:46,793
Zuzu, quit it. You're gonna
frighten the clients.

602
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:49,296
I won't stop, Lúcia!

603
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,332
They are just like I used to be.

604
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:58,829
I was so na: L: Ve, making dresses
with flowers and birds.

605
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:04,334
Happy fashion in the
"country of the future"...

606
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:11,345
A future without my son,
and others' children!

607
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:17,825
You know what?

608
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:19,827
- Cancel the shipment.
- I beg your pardon!

609
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:21,829
- Cancel the shipment.
- There's a due date.

610
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:23,990
I'll make do, Lúcia.
I do something else.

611
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,999
Please, don't mix fashion
and politics.

612
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:28,035
This militia can do anything.

613
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:31,702
More than they've already done?

614
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,377
I died the day I received
that letter.

615
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,876
Hello? Hi, Hilde.

616
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,209
What?!

617
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:46,050
They arrested Elke.

618
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:53,019
She already talked to Fraga
and he says he'll release her.

619
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:54,527
And what else?

620
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,364
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones!

621
00:54:57,432 --> 00:54:59,366
The Court of the Military Justice

622
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:03,029
summons the accused,
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones,

623
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:07,404
to testify in the trial
taking place in this Court.

624
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:10,404
Last summoning!

625
00:55:15,116 --> 00:55:16,413
Let's begin. You may sit.

626
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:28,725
Once fulfilled all the prerequisites
and legal proceedings,

627
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:31,732
I declare absent from the process,
set in motion by the Union,

628
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,065
for crimes against the national
security,

629
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:39,072
the accused, Stuart Edgar
Angel Jones.

630
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,108
My name's not Stuart anymore.

631
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,780
You're not called Stuart?

632
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:47,114
No.

633
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:49,116
Why?

634
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:52,453
It's safer.

635
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,118
Why? Don't you feel like a Stuart?

636
00:55:58,827 --> 00:55:59,794
What do you mean?

637
00:56:02,163 --> 00:56:06,793
I worry that you become
a person you are not.

638
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,106
You can call yourself Peter, John...
I don't care!

639
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:15,802
I just want you to be yourself.

640
00:56:17,512 --> 00:56:18,979
We are always changing, mom.

641
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:24,148
You know what?

642
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:30,457
I'll still be Stuart for you.

643
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:31,822
Just for you.

644
00:56:37,532 --> 00:56:38,499
Son...

645
00:56:41,036 --> 00:56:42,003
Are you leaving?

646
00:56:46,207 --> 00:56:48,471
Let it be clear, gentlemen.

647
00:56:48,543 --> 00:56:52,138
I don't defend the citizen
Stuart Angel,

648
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:53,510
but his memory.

649
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:04,150
I finish my speech
in a state of fear,

650
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:07,160
and one certainty.

651
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:11,528
I'm sure that I defend a deceased,

652
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:17,527
that the Military attorney knows
he accused a deceased,

653
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:23,040
and that the judges know
they are judging a corpse.

654
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,174
I fear, gentlemen,

655
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:30,513
that this ignominious sham

656
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:34,214
taints the name of this court
forever.

657
00:57:57,112 --> 00:57:59,205
For 4 votes against 1,

658
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,217
this Court finds the accused,
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones, innocent

659
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:06,549
for lack of evidence in the process.

660
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:08,054
It's all a sham!

661
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:10,091
Court dismissed.

662
00:58:11,126 --> 00:58:13,560
You can only arrest if there
is freedom,

663
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,596
you can only judge if there
is freedom.

664
00:58:17,132 --> 00:58:20,260
Only with freedom can you find
someone guilty or innocent!

665
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:23,733
But here, murderers disguise
themselves as judges!

666
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,568
You heed your words,

667
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,234
or will be arrested for contempt
of this court.

668
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:32,905
There was contempt of the law
when you arrested Stuart.

669
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:36,246
There was contempt when
you interrogated him.

670
00:58:36,317 --> 00:58:39,252
Contempt is to torture and kill!

671
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:45,259
Contempt is to deny the sacred right
of a mother to bury her child.

672
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:49,262
And now this sham, in the name
of a rightful government.

673
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:53,460
What kind of Right is that?!
Where are our Rights?!

674
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:02,935
You must be crazy to have
done that in court!

675
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:04,945
But I feel so relieved!

676
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,605
Just like you did to me
in the airport.

677
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:10,117
But there was a price.
They cancelled my citizenship.

678
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:13,120
I don't have a passport anymore.
I'm an outcast now.

679
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:15,281
- Pretty fancy, no?
- That's insane...

680
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:17,290
It's here, Zuzu.

681
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:18,655
What a nice place!

682
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:27,300
And after the German boyfriend,
I found myself a Greek one.

683
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:31,304
- Did you learn Greek too?
- No way!

684
00:59:31,372 --> 00:59:33,135
Is the tongue difficult?

685
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:36,666
His tongue was difficult.

686
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,176
In barracks, they wait.
In barracks, they practice.

687
01:00:13,248 --> 01:00:16,877
It's always like this. It's never-ending.
In barracks, they wait.

688
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,354
They dream of pretty girls,

689
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,897
but have to leave the pretty
ones behind.

690
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:51,377
They shoot their people.
They stomp on their people.

691
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:53,750
It's always been like that,
and you know it.

692
01:02:33,221 --> 01:02:37,317
I think it was the most thrilling
night of my life.

693
01:02:37,392 --> 01:02:39,485
You're awesome, mom.

694
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,824
Do you think the press
will like it?

695
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:46,333
I think so. The journalists
were wild at the show.

696
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:48,869
Senator Church confirmed
tomorrow's meeting.

697
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:53,670
You must persevere
in your task here in the U.S.,

698
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:57,336
your contacts with the press,
politics, judges...

699
01:02:57,412 --> 01:03:00,381
It's key, my daughter.

700
01:03:01,582 --> 01:03:03,880
I wouldn't be able to do it
by myself in Brazil.

701
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:10,517
Sometimes, I feel
I'm in a crusade.

702
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,560
You can always count on me, mom.

703
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:23,536
FASHION GETS A POLITICAL SHADE

704
01:04:02,643 --> 01:04:04,235
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments,

705
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:07,907
we'll be landing on Galeão
international airport in Rio de Janeiro.

706
01:04:07,982 --> 01:04:11,247
Please, return to your seats,
keep them in the upright position,

707
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:13,913
and fasten you seatbelts.

708
01:04:16,324 --> 01:04:18,292
Will you excuse me?

709
01:04:19,494 --> 01:04:23,430
My friends, I'm Zuzu Angel,
Brazilian fashion designer.

710
01:04:23,498 --> 01:04:27,264
I'd like to tell you that in this
wonderful city we're landing,

711
01:04:27,335 --> 01:04:31,601
my son... My beloved Stuart
was arrested, tortured and killed

712
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:33,799
by the dictatorship
that destroys this country.

713
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:36,636
Where's his body?

714
01:04:37,512 --> 01:04:38,479
Gone!

715
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:40,946
I'd like you to know that

716
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:44,280
the paradise we see through
the window,

717
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:47,321
is soiled by awful crimes
like this.

718
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,619
- Ms. Zuleika Angel.
- Yes?

719
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:55,628
Somebody would like to talk to you.

720
01:04:55,696 --> 01:04:57,664
- Why?
- Will you follow me, please?

721
01:05:00,034 --> 01:05:01,626
And my luggage?

722
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,670
We'll take care of that.

723
01:05:04,705 --> 01:05:05,672
Please.

724
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:10,640
I heard you put on quite a show
on the plane.

725
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:12,645
Information gets to you very fast...

726
01:05:12,713 --> 01:05:14,647
And complete.

727
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:18,515
I can tell the color of
your underwear.

728
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:24,688
I just don't know your son.
Never saw him.

729
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:32,659
But you went abroad to accuse me
of murder without evidence.

730
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,668
I have a family.

731
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:40,503
My wife and kids were shocked
when they heard of it.

732
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:45,342
Your kids must be going
to the beach and parties.

733
01:05:45,413 --> 01:05:47,506
Mine was tortured and killed.

734
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:51,348
Says who? A terrorist.

735
01:05:51,419 --> 01:05:54,013
What are the evidences? None!

736
01:05:54,088 --> 01:05:56,682
Stuart's body is the least
I can ask.

737
01:05:56,757 --> 01:05:59,692
- There's no dead body.
- What?

738
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,854
If your son died the way
you believe he did,

739
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:07,697
after such a long time,
there's no more corpse anywhere.

740
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:10,032
But his murderers are free.

741
01:06:10,104 --> 01:06:14,370
Then gather evidence against them.

742
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:16,069
I'll do that.

743
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:20,046
Whoever killed Stuart
will some day pay for it.

744
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:24,050
Ms. Angel, I suggest
you wouldn't turn me

745
01:06:24,118 --> 01:06:28,578
into a personal enemy.

746
01:06:38,466 --> 01:06:39,433
Murderer!

747
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:45,571
And besides,

748
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,736
you should be ashamed
of using your son's name

749
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:52,779
to make more money
in your business.

750
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:02,588
After my fashion show in NY,

751
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:05,455
my life was at a standstill
for two years.

752
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:09,091
The press being censored,

753
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,462
my complaints were known
by no one.

754
01:07:14,168 --> 01:07:18,764
Due to this kind of atmosphere
I kept my daughter, Ana, in the U. S...

755
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,773
Hilde didn't want to go.

756
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:23,639
She was already working
as actress and journalist.

757
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:30,640
In 1973, a new tragedy:

758
01:07:32,186 --> 01:07:35,121
My son's widow, Sônia;

759
01:07:35,189 --> 01:07:37,487
was arrested when she
came back to Brazil undercover.

760
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:42,128
Before being killed,

761
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:45,632
she was shocked, beaten up,

762
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,830
raped with a bat, and her breasts
were torn.

763
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:54,675
Her body was never
given to the family.

764
01:07:56,877 --> 01:08:01,814
I admit I felt let down by so much
violence and impunity.

765
01:08:01,882 --> 01:08:04,476
But I kept working,

766
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:08,181
and creativity gave me strength
to face my pain.

767
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:13,653
On the 31st of December, 1975;

768
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:17,186
a new fact lifted my spirits
to keep on fighting.

769
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,996
Hi, Fraga! Come drink with us!

770
01:08:21,068 --> 01:08:22,035
Happy New Year!

771
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,209
- I'm glad you came, Zuzu.
- Almeida!

772
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:31,878
Let's dance.

773
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:35,511
Almeida, I'm sorry, but Zuzu
has promised me the first dance.

774
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,847
How come? She's just arrived!

775
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:41,183
We settled by the phone.
Excuse us.

776
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:42,517
I'll be back, Almeida.

777
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,718
Zuzu, you look sad,
but still gorgeous.

778
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:53,699
I've been meaning to call you
What for? Settle this dance?

779
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,205
Nice party, isn't it?

780
01:08:59,273 --> 01:09:03,073
It may be, but I'm not
in the mood for parties.

781
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,542
That makes two of us.

782
01:09:06,614 --> 01:09:10,550
What's up?
Problems in the office?

783
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:13,587
It may be a problem,
but also a solution...

784
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:18,217
Gosh! If we're going to talk
so serious about work,

785
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,884
we'd better stop dancing.

786
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,554
- No, Zuzu!
- Fraga!

787
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,758
- It's got to do with you.
- With me?

788
01:09:27,301 --> 01:09:28,268
With Stuart.

789
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:33,603
Last week, somebody came to me.

790
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:37,277
Who came to you, Fraga?

791
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:46,245
An agent of the repression
came to me.

792
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,617
Oh, my God!

793
01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:50,752
It was one of the craziest days
of my life.

794
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,258
Did he threaten you?

795
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:57,593
No. He came to me willing
to tell everything he knows.

796
01:09:57,665 --> 01:09:59,633
But he wants to talk to you.

797
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:02,636
To me?

798
01:10:03,003 --> 01:10:04,937
He said he'd only tell it to you.

799
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:06,597
Why me?

800
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:09,973
He says he knows about Stuart.

801
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:15,641
I should have left before
telling you such nonsense.

802
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:26,952
Why did he decide to talk?

803
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:27,994
Revenge.

804
01:10:29,864 --> 01:10:32,332
He thought he was a "model" agent!

805
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:36,336
Whatever it means...

806
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:41,303
Then, he says he was wrongly
accused

807
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,503
of keeping the money from
an urban guerrilla robbery.

808
01:10:45,379 --> 01:10:47,973
The guy must be in a rage.

809
01:10:48,048 --> 01:10:51,347
You mustn't talk to him at all.

810
01:10:54,054 --> 01:10:56,181
What if he knows what happened?

811
01:10:58,392 --> 01:11:01,657
The testimony of somebody from inside
could put an end to all this sham.

812
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:06,325
Zuzu, to even talk about this
we must pretend we are tourists.

813
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,995
We are afraid of being followed, taped...
We are afraid of everything!

814
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:12,334
Do you want to get deeper
into this?

815
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:15,000
You're a fashion designer,
not an FBI agent.

816
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:17,339
I know I'm not from the FBI, but...

817
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:22,371
It's easy to get into a cave, but
it's even easier to get lost inside.

818
01:11:28,422 --> 01:11:30,390
You're right.

819
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:34,053
Let's forget this conversation.

820
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:47,908
I've never seen your son,
but know what happened to him.

821
01:11:50,778 --> 01:11:52,405
Alberto's letter was a trump card.

822
01:11:53,447 --> 01:11:55,881
You used it, but didn't win
the game.

823
01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,387
Now you're alone,
and have got nothing.

824
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:02,718
This way you won't get far.

825
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,757
Do you agree?

826
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:10,263
You started well.

827
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:12,933
Call me lieutenant and speak low.

828
01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:16,902
What's your strategy?

829
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:20,407
- Strategy?
- Yes,

830
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:22,772
to hurt whom we want to hurt.

831
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:29,411
I want to know if it is worth it
offering you my load.

832
01:12:29,483 --> 01:12:31,451
I want Justice.

833
01:12:34,154 --> 01:12:37,453
Injustice is the worst thing
there is, Ms. Angel.

834
01:12:39,493 --> 01:12:44,760
Funny how two enemies
can help each other,

835
01:12:44,832 --> 01:12:45,799
don't you think?

836
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,467
I don't know...

837
01:12:50,004 --> 01:12:55,442
We'll always be on opposite sides.
You and I.

838
01:12:55,509 --> 01:13:00,105
But still, I can help you
if your strategy is good,

839
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,977
and my rage doesn't go away.

840
01:13:03,183 --> 01:13:04,480
We'll see about that in a month.

841
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:08,454
If I feel the same way
I feel today,

842
01:13:08,522 --> 01:13:10,456
I'll testify.

843
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:13,982
Somehow or the other,
I'll let you know.

844
01:13:15,195 --> 01:13:17,493
How can you guarantee
that you are...

845
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:22,502
Guarantee what?

846
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:27,633
That I'm really an ally,
and not an enemy?

847
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:28,675
Yes.

848
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,509
I can't. Use your intuition.

849
01:15:58,192 --> 01:16:00,319
I've prepared my testimony,
Ms. Angel;

850
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:04,664
but your strategy is weak.

851
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,997
- Is it?
- Yes.

852
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:12,005
These people from the Amnesty
won't do.

853
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:38,691
I must use the restroom.

854
01:17:58,312 --> 01:18:00,280
I left something in the car.

855
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,408
Have you been following me?

856
01:18:03,483 --> 01:18:06,247
Me? I'm retired, Ms. Angel.

857
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,413
Then how did you know about
my meeting with the Amnesty?

858
01:18:08,488 --> 01:18:11,082
I still have some friends.

859
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:13,422
Ms. Angel, you're being followed,

860
01:18:13,493 --> 01:18:15,427
your phones are wired.

861
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:17,463
Don't doubt it.

862
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:21,767
I can't stay here long, Ms. Angel.

863
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:24,770
But you called me.

864
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:27,807
Let me be straight: Amnesty
They can make a lot of noise.

865
01:18:34,514 --> 01:18:38,450
Noise? In this case, the noise
of the enemy is predictable,

866
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:41,112
and won't cause any harm.

867
01:18:41,188 --> 01:18:44,954
An unexpected attack
from a friend would be better.

868
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:46,492
This is good strategy!

869
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:48,821
If you can find a strong ally,

870
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:55,828
my testimony is yours.

871
01:18:57,004 --> 01:19:00,462
The U.S. Secretary of state,
Henry Kissinger,

872
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:04,340
had a busy schedule on his first
day in Rio de Janeiro.

873
01:20:18,618 --> 01:20:20,381
I got it!

874
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:21,887
I handed it to him.

875
01:20:21,955 --> 01:20:24,389
Will he read it?

876
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:28,554
Sometimes, it stays with an assessor that
sends it straight to the Brazilian police.

877
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:31,927
Good! The man I want
will know what happened.

878
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:46,441
They're following us.

879
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,914
Nonsense!

880
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:51,450
Don't pretend to be na: L: Ve, Lúcia.

881
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:08,593
I found out there are
some civilians,

882
01:21:08,668 --> 01:21:12,297
entrepreneurs and bankers
financing the repression.

883
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:18,311
I'm sorry to get you
into my problems, Lúcia.

884
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,945
I think you should spend some
days with me in the mountains.

885
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:28,477
Stay away from Rio, you know, Zuzu?
Lt'd do you good.

886
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:30,656
No, daughter.

887
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:35,320
But I'll only spend three days.

888
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,997
It was sent to you.

889
01:21:40,367 --> 01:21:44,667
OK, daughter.
Don't worry! Lúcia insisted...

890
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:49,305
OK! I'll call as soon as
I come back. OK?

891
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:50,843
Kisses.

892
01:21:54,047 --> 01:21:55,344
"YOU'VE IMPROVED YOUR STRATEG Y.

893

894
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:10,696
Zuzu?

895
01:22:12,566 --> 01:22:14,830
I want to talk to Zuzu Angel.

896
01:22:14,901 --> 01:22:15,993
Who's that?

897
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:20,005
I want to talk to Zuzu Angel.
Is it you?

898
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:21,540
She traveled.

899
01:22:33,587 --> 01:22:34,713
Marina, the truck!

900
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:40,385
Are you saying your name or...

901
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:44,688
- Hi, Hilde.
- Mom,

902
01:22:44,764 --> 01:22:48,029
thank God you didn't travel with
Lúcia! That's crazy, mom!

903
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,033
What happened, daughter?

904
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:52,037
A terrible accident on the road.

905
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:54,369
I've just found out, mom.

906
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:56,033
A truck crashed into Lúcia's car.

907
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:57,406
It can't be!

908
01:22:59,112 --> 01:23:00,374
Lúcia... She...

909
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:04,042
- They took Lúcia to the hospital,
- I gave up in the last minute.

910
01:23:04,117 --> 01:23:06,085
But she passed away.

911
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,054
Do you want me to drop by, mom?

912
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:13,559
No! I'll call you back soon.
I'm shocked.

913
01:23:13,627 --> 01:23:15,094
We'll talk later.

914
01:23:16,796 --> 01:23:17,763
"STATEMENT".

Don't worry, mom!
I'm here with you.

Wanna go for a walk?

I think it'd do you good.

939

Sit here, mom.

940
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:22,004
Why so anguished?

941
01:27:24,043 --> 01:27:26,341
It's part of life.
We make choices, dream;

942

but sometimes reality insists on
being bigger than our dreams.

You know what, Tuti?

944
01:27:40,894 --> 01:27:44,853
Sometimes I think I didn't give
you all the support I could.

You, my son...

946
01:27:50,904 --> 01:27:52,872
You wanted to change the world.

947
01:27:55,742 --> 01:27:58,336
I only wanted to change my life.

948

Nonsense, mom.

949
01:27:59,913 --> 01:28:03,007
I'm afraid you think
I abandoned you.

950
01:28:03,082 --> 01:28:04,379
You? Abandon me?

951
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:10,055
Do you remember that time
on the beach

952
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:16,054
when I left you alone and went
for a swim?

953
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:18,063
No.

954
01:28:20,433 --> 01:28:21,730
When I came back,

955
01:28:22,936 --> 01:28:25,734
you were crying desperately.

956
01:28:29,776 --> 01:28:31,744
I felt so bad.

957
01:28:34,113 --> 01:28:35,876
Don't you remember?

958
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:37,416
No, mom, I don't.

959
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:43,882
But I remember once when
you hugged on the beach,

960
01:28:43,957 --> 01:28:48,758
and I never felt so protected,
and loved.

961
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,098
Could it have been the same day?

962
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,098
Tuti, Tuti...

963
01:29:02,475 --> 01:29:04,102
Now you are going to bed, mom.

964
01:29:05,144 --> 01:29:06,270
Get some rest.

965
01:29:08,481 --> 01:29:09,778
Then, go.

966
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,016
I've been looking for you for days!
You vanished!

967
01:30:51,084 --> 01:30:54,019
I needed to rest,

968
01:30:54,087 --> 01:30:56,180
be alone for awhile.

969
01:30:56,255 --> 01:30:58,519
What's going on?

970
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:01,025
Are you hiding anything from us?

971
01:31:01,094 --> 01:31:05,190
Nothing! I'm not hiding anything.

972
01:31:05,264 --> 01:31:08,062
Ahn? OK.

973
01:32:19,672 --> 01:32:20,969
Let go of the case.

974
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:24,973
We have a lot to talk.

975
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:27,612
Did you at least go home?

976
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,944
No, I came straight.

977
01:32:30,016 --> 01:32:34,146
I had some ideas for the collection,
and felt like coming to the studio.

978
01:32:38,191 --> 01:32:40,318
Chico Buarque sent to me.

979
01:32:53,706 --> 01:32:55,333
What are you looking for?

980
01:32:59,212 --> 01:33:00,179
A letter.

981
01:33:01,714 --> 01:33:04,182
A letter Tuti wrote to me
many years ago.

982
01:33:08,221 --> 01:33:09,518
I'll read it to you.

983
01:33:15,228 --> 01:33:20,188
"Mom, you ask me if I believe
in God.

984
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:24,198
And I ask you: Which God?

985
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:28,674
It's been my mission to show you
God in humans.

986
01:33:28,741 --> 01:33:32,040
For only in humans can He exist.

987
01:33:32,745 --> 01:33:36,340
No matter how poor or
insignificant he may seem to be,

988
01:33:36,415 --> 01:33:38,383
every human has a mission."

989
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:42,721
That's so beautiful, mom!

990
01:33:46,259 --> 01:33:51,697
"Every human being influences
the very nature of the future.

991
01:33:51,764 --> 01:33:54,358
Through our lives,
we create actions

992
01:33:54,433 --> 01:33:57,402
that result in the multiple
reactions".

993
01:33:58,771 --> 01:34:03,708
"All of us have this power!

994
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:09,408
The power to change the course
of History is the power of God.

995
01:34:11,117 --> 01:34:14,712
In face of such divine
responsibility,

996
01:34:14,787 --> 01:34:18,416
I bow in front of the God
inside me.

997
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,587
Stuart Edgar Angel Jones."

998
01:35:40,539 --> 01:35:42,632
Today you make the rules

999
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:45,302
Your word is the law

1000
01:35:45,378 --> 01:35:46,845
There's no argument

1001
01:35:48,881 --> 01:35:53,818
My people speak low nowadays

1002
01:35:53,886 --> 01:35:57,822
And looking at the floor, you know

1003
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:00,825
You invented this state

1004
01:36:00,893 --> 01:36:06,832
You invented all the darkness
But you forgot to invent

1005
01:36:09,902 --> 01:36:13,861
forgiveness

1006
01:36:16,909 --> 01:36:25,840
In spite of you
Tomorrow will be different day

1007
01:36:25,918 --> 01:36:28,182
I ask you

1008
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:34,853
Where you are going to hide
from all the happiness

1009
01:36:34,927 --> 01:36:41,890
How will you forbid the birds
to sing?

1010
01:37:15,468 --> 01:37:18,562
"Zuzu Angel's death, in 1976,
was declared accidental.

1011
01:37:18,637 --> 01:37:21,902
Chico Buarque sent 60 copies of Zuzu's
statement to celebrities and the press.

1012
01:37:21,974 --> 01:37:23,908
No newspaper published it.

1013
01:37:23,976 --> 01:37:27,241
22 years later, the Commission of
Deceased and Missing For Political Reasons

1014
01:37:27,313 --> 01:37:29,247
set up by the Brazilian government,

1015
01:37:29,315 --> 01:37:31,909
through undisputed evidence,
and a witness,

1016
01:37:31,984 --> 01:37:33,576
came to the conclusion she was murdered
:

1017
01:37:33,652 --> 01:37:36,587
Hildegard e Ana Cristina Angel
founded Zuzu Angel Institute

1018
01:37:36,655 --> 01:37:39,624
to honor the memory
of Zuzu and Stuart.

1019
01:37:40,993 --> 01:37:43,461
They could never mourn
their brother's body."
