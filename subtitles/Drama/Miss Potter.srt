1
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,032
<i>There's something delicious about</i>
<i>writing the first words of a story.</i>

2
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,334
<i>You can never quite tell</i>
<i>where they'll take you.</i>

3
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,408
<i>Mine took me here.</i>

4
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,324
<i>Looking back, the city and I
<i>never much liked each other.</i>

5
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>An unmarried woman, after all,</i>
<i>was expected to behave in</i>

6
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,727
<i>very particular ways.</i>

7
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,233
<i>Which did not include traipsing</i>
<i>from publisher to publisher</i>

8
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,132
<i>with a gaggle of friends.</i>

9
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,445
Now, listen to me,
you must not be afraid.

10
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,312
And don't talk too much.

11
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,821
<i>Friends who, sadly, others were</i>
<i>not so keen to meet.</i>

12
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,025
I've been selling my drawings
for greeting cards, place cards,

13
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,537
etcetera for seven years.

14
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,128
Bunnies in jackets
with brass buttons.

15
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,930
How ever do you imagine
such things?

16
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,128
I don't imagine them.

17
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,139
They're quite real.
They're my friends.

18
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,835
Are you based the animal
characters on your friends?

19
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,445
No, the animals are my friends.

20
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,408
Before Peter Rabbit there was
Benjamin Bunny,

21
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,710
and then Sir Isaac the Newt.

22
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,615
I have their drawings as well,
if you'd like to see them.

23
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,018
That won't be necessary.
Unfortunately, Miss Potter.

24
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,616
It is 'Miss' Potter, is it not?
Yes. Of course. Silly of me.

25
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,422
Unfortunately, the market for
children's books...

26
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,621
Yes, of course.
I completely understand.

27
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,131
It was silly of me,
with no experience of these...

28
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,226
F. Warne and Company would like to
publish your little book, Miss Potter.

29
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,532
But best not to get overly hopeful.

30
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,837
I know publishing your book will
not sell a great number of copies,

31
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,741
but I think we can turn
a small profit.

32
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:21,117
My dear Mr Warne, well,
I'm pleased. Very pleased indeed.

33
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,815
I shall do everything possible to
ensure that you've not made a mistake.

34
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,720
Miss Wiggin, I believe we can go.

35
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,126
Thank you very much indeed.
Messrs Warne, for your time.

36
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:37,635
Our pleasure. My brother always
knows what he's doing.

37
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:45,135
Oh, I'm quite particular about
book size and price,

38
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,543
and I'd like to avoid that
dreadful Gothic typeface

39
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,115
your children's books usually have.

40
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,411
I'm sure everything will be
to your satisfaction.

41
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,416
Miss Potter.

42
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,817
Your...

43
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,120
Of course.

44
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,525
My portfolio.

45
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,233
Come along, Peter.

46
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,446
- Sir Isaac, the newt!
- You can't be serious, Fruing.

47
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,709
- That book won't sell ten copies.
- Of course not!

48
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:29,720
- However, the thought did occur to me...
- Norman!

49
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,120
We promised our little brother
a project.

50
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,624
If he makes a muck of it,
what will it matter?

51
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,527
I think Miss Potter may turn out
to be a Godsend.

52
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,222
Home, Miss Potter?

53
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,231
No, Saunders.
Drive me through the park.

54
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,429
Through all the parks.

55
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,541
- I beg your pardon, Miss Potter?
- Drive!

56
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,538
Walk on.

57
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,646
We did it!

58
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,807
Did you hear my heart?
It was a kettle drum.

59
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,714
You see? We cannot stay
home all our lives.

60
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,413
We must present ourselves
to the world.

61
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,423
And we must look upon it
as an adventure.

62
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,639
Faster, Saunders!

63
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,916
- Faster, Saunders, if you please!
- No, Miss Beatrix. No!

64
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,211
- Fast as you can, old boy.
- Go on!

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,824
Oh, I say!

66
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,639
Saunders.

67
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,523
Beatrix, where have you been?
It's after four o'clock.

68
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,321
I'm not a child. I can do things
without my mother's permission.

69
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,726
I was hoping to use the carriage
myself this afternoon.

70
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,832
Where were you?

71
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,026
I took a drive.
With my friends.

72
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,329
You don't have any friends.

73
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,229
Yes, I do, Mother.
Every time I draw.

74
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,337
Some of your paintings are
quite pretty, Beatrix,

75
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,442
but I'm not going to deceive you
as your father does

76
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,737
and call them great art.

77
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,022
Well, my friend,
when I am a published author

78
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,921
then we shall see.

79
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,939
Beatrix, Bertram,
time for good nights.

80
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,412
- I haven't finished yet.
- Come on, hurry up.

81
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,812
- Bertram.
- There! I got him.

82
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,719
- Bertram, you're barbaric.
- Come on, you two.

83
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,720
Hurry up. Down you go.

84
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,719
Slowly!

85
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,731
Hurry, Rupert! It won't do t
be late to the 'Hydes'.

86
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,028
Doesn't Mama look beautiful,
Beatrix?

87
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,638
Being in a temper puts such
a rose into her cheeks.

88
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,933
When you grow up, Beatrix,
and have to run a household,

89
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,839
plan parties, keep a social calendar
and put up with a man

90
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,639
who's never been introduced to a clock,

91
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,043
your cheeks will glow too.

92
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,109
Look at this ribbon.

93
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,310
That's unsightly.
Change her into something decent.

94
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,421
And give this nightdress away.

95
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,523
Oh, this will never do.
I'm just all fingers and thumbs!

96
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,218
You're impossible, Rupert!
We are so late.

97
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,022
What have you drawn today, Beatrix?

98
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,630
Benjamin Bunny having a rest.

99
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,131
His ears are getting
better and better.

100
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,226
This shading here is very good,
Beatrix.

101
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,835
Say your good nights now, children.

102
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,534
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Beatrix.

103
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,740
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Beatrix.

104
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,847
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, Bertram.

105
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,913
Good night, Father.

106
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,016
Now, hurry upstairs.

107
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,710
- Come on, mustn't make Mama and Papa.
- Later than they are.

108
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,821
- Oh, children.
- What now?

109
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,015
On my way home, I happened to
walke down Piccadilly.

110
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,217
And what do you think
jumped into my pockets?

111
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,626
Something very special for
the young entomologist.

112
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,529
And something very suitable for
the young lady

113
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,432
who's very soon to grow up
to run a fine home,

114
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,628
just like her mother.

115
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,639
- We'll open them upstairs. Come on.
- Thank you, Father.

116
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,736
- Thank you, Father.
- Come on.

117
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,513
- Late, late late!
- We are not late.

118
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,417
We will never be invited
to the Hydes' again.

119
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,922
Heaven's sake, Helen,
it's polite to be a little late.

120
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,026
Now get in the carriage.

121
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,425
This isn't polite late,
this is late, late.

122
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,828
Right, wee ones,
one story and then bed.

123
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:47,234
I want Beatrix to tell a story.
Hers are funny.

124
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,433
Indeed they are, and I know exactly
what it'll be about.

125
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,941
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.

126
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,344
Precisely. Tom, Hunker,
are you ready to play in a story?

127
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,211
Oh, yes. We're excellent actors.

128
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,615
Well, we shall see about that.
This will be your test.

129
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,016
Over there.

130
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:10,425
Once upon a time, those two excellent
housekeepers, Lucinda and Jane,

131
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,726
bought some shiny new porcelain
food which they set out

132
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,528
on their perfectly appointed
dining room table.

133
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,933
Then, they decided to go for a walk.

134
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,131
Suddenly, there came a scuffling
noise from the kitchen.

135
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,541
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker crept out.

136
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,411
The two mice saw that
the dining table was set for dinner.

137
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,018
Tom Thumb leapt up and
took a big bite

138
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,714
from the first plate
and broke his tooth.

139
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,115
Who we expecting someone?

140
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,026
That's my publishers.

141
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,923
It's not a social call.
In fact, I'm rather dreading it.

142
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,728
I wish you wouldn't invite
trades people in to the house.

143
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,234
They carry dust.

144
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,036
Well, next time,
I shall go to their office.

145
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,943
Mr Norman Warne.

146
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,141
Miss Potter.

147
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,509
I hope you will forgive my intrusion
into your daily routine.

148
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,619
I was expecting one of the...

149
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,722
Ah, yes,
I am Harold and Fruing's brother.

150
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,017
I've recently joined the firm
and they have done me

151
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,627
the great honour of assigning
your book to me.

152
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,725
Thank you. It was most gracious
of you to invite me to...

153
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,424
- Tea.
- Yes, I would love some.

154
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,729
Yes, thank you.
Lemon.

155
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,631
Thank you.

156
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,638
Extraordinary!

157
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,140
Funny!

158
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,917
Delightful and magical and
so beautifully drawn.

159
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,714
I am utterly, utterly speechless.

160
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,515
Perhaps we should discuss
our business, Mr Warne.

161
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,321
I put your drawings aside with
the greatest reluctance.

162
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,723
Your brother's letter makes
two proposals

163
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,029
which I find quite unacceptable.

164
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,332
First, they'd like the drawings
to be in colour.

165
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,736
I'm adamant they be
in black and white.

166
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,036
But Peter Rabbit's blue jacket
and the red radishes,

167
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,237
Surely you would like your enchanting
drawings reproduced as they are?

168
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,316
Well, of course I would prefer colour,
but colour will make the book cost

169
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,909
far more than little rabbits
can afford. I'm adamant.

170
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,717
Which brings us to
your brother's second point.

171
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,419
They wish to reduce the number
of drawings by nearly a third.

172
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,222
Totally unacceptable.

173
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,831
Let me explain.
The idea of reducing the number

174
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,127
of drawings was not my brother's
but my own.

175
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,032
If we can reduce the number
to 31 precisely,

176
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,435
then the illustrations for
the entire book could be printed

177
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,838
on a single sheet of paper using
what we call the three-colour process,

178
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:43,313
that you desire, and at a relatively
low level of cost. Yes?

179
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,608
I've given your book a great deal
of attention, truly.

180
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,813
I would like it to look
colourful on the shelf

181
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,925
so that it stands out
from ordinary books.

182
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,924
You have given it some thought.

183
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,326
Which other books have you
supervised, Mr Warne?

184
00:14:59,465 --> 00:14:59,931
Personally?

185
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,625
- Yes.
- This will be my first.

186
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,638
Miss Potter, I have recently
informed my brothers and my mother

187
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,039
that I am no longer content to
stay at home and play nursemaid

188
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,439
solely because I am the youngest son.

189
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,811
No. I would like a properjob,
working for my family's firm

190
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,918
and they have assigned me you.

191
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,816
Does that make things clearer?

192
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,423
In other words,
you have no experience whatsoever,

193
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,221
but because you've made
a nuisance of yourself,

194
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,025
demanding a chance,
they've fobbed you off on me.

195
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,727
Miss Potter, I know all too well
what my brothers intended,

196
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,533
giving me your, your 'bunny book',
as they call it,

197
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,440
but I find your book quite
enchanting, delightful,

198
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:50,310
and if they intended to fob me off,
as you say, then we shall show them.

199
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,111
We shall give them a bunny book
to conjure with,

200
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,119
In colours, mixed to your
satisfaction in front of

201
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,314
your very eyes at the printer.

202
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,719
At the printer?

203
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,223
Oh, I could never.

204
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,521
I will escort you there myself.

205
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,429
If you will allow me the the honour.

206
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,127
Why would I never?

207
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,326
Of course I'll go.
I'm a grown woman.

208
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,936
Miss Wiggin will be there.

209
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,030
I see absolutely no reason why
an artist shouldn't visit her printer.

210
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,836
Excellent, Miss Potter.

211
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,941
Jolly good. Thank you.

212
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,105
I shall make all the arrangements,
and I am, in every way,

213
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,615
my dear lady, at your service.

214
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,919
You and rabbits, extraordinary.
Excuse me.

215
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,523
Johnson, come and get
the charms, would you?

216
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,732
- Slowly, slowly. Put it there.
- I will be careful, ma'am.

217
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,932
One, two, three... ten.

218
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,343
<i>When I was ten, my mother badgered</i>
<i>my father into spending the summer</i>

219
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,935
<i>in the Lake District,</i>
<i>as did other fashionable families.</i>

220
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,915
<i>Like an animal released from its cage,</i>
<i>I fell under its spell.</i>

221
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,512
Mind your frocks now.
Come here!

222
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,421
The woods are full of fairies
and little folk that look for

223
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,529
children that get their
clothes dirty.

224
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,827
And when they find them,
they send the fairy beasts at night,

225
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,937
with sharp teeth and a ready
appetite for young flesh.

226
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,437
- I'm coming to get you, Bea!
- No

227
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,017
Yes!

228
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,927
Bertram. Bertram!

229
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,128
Don't! They're farmers' children.
Their hands. Germs. Come on.

230
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,738
Bertram! Bertram!

231
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,623
Catch him, Bea!

232
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,421
There he is!

233
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,725
Oh, yes!

234
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,936
Out of the way!

235
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,737
There!

236
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,713
There he is.

237
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,239
I don't think a thrashing
will be necessary.

238
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,241
I'll just leave the window
in the nursery unlatched tonight.

239
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,242
The fairy beasts will
take care of the rest.

240
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,142
No! I'll stay clean!

241
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,407
Bertram.

242
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,714
Really, Beatrix, What young man
is ever going to marry a girl

243
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,115
with a faceful of mud?

244
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,813
Well, I shan't marry,
so it doesn't matter.

245
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,423
Of course you shall marry.

246
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,119
All girls marry. I did.
Your grandmother did.

247
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,822
Even Fiona will one day.

248
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,923
- Well, I shan't. I shall draw.
- Oh, those silly drawings.

249
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,330
Then who will love you?

250
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,133
My art and my animals.
I won't need more love than that.

251
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,335
Perhaps not at 11, but let's see
if you still feel the same way at 18.

252
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,039
I drew Mama when we first met
and she married me.

253
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,412
And, Fiona, doesn't mud wash off?

254
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,018
Bertram, come along.

255
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,622
Die, you little devil!

256
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,819
Right. Prince Charming himself
couldn't resist

257
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,224
such a bonny, wee girl.

258
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,526
Not when he meets my brother,
Vlad the lmpaler.

259
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,932
- Got you!
- Bedtime my young reprobates.

260
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,936
Now, shall I leave a window
open, or?

261
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,440
No! I don't like fairy beasts.

262
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,444
Well, it is a well-known fact that
fairy beasts never eat a child

263
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,605
when he's tucked up in his own bed.

264
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,413
The fairies have been
in the north country

265
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,612
for hundreds of years,
and have had many adventures.

266
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,517
I told you about you
a changingly child?

267
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,317
No.

268
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,324
Yes, several times.

269
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,622
I want to hear it.

270
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,926
Oh, go ahead, Fiona.
I'll tell myself a story.

271
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,227
Right.

272
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,227
Once upon a time,
there was a king and a queen.

273
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,740
Once upon a time,
there were four little rabbits.

274
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,744
Their names were...
Flopsy, Mopsy...

275
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,314
Cotton-tail and Peter.

276
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,817
'Now, my dears,
said old Mrs Rabbit one morning,

277
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,717
<i>'you may go into the fields</i>
<i>or down the lane,</i>

278
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,223
<i>'but don't go into</i>
<i>Mr McGregor's garden.'</i>

279
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,622
<i>'Why not, Mother? '

280
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,629
'Because your father had
an accident there.

281
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,633
He was put in a pie
by Mrs McGregor.'

282
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,132
<i>Peter, who was very naughty,</i>
<i>ran straightaway to</i>

283
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,435
<i>Mr McGregor's garden,</i>

284
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,238
and squeezed under the gate.

285
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,640
I like it.

286
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,125
<i>But round the end of</i>
<i>the cucumber frame,</i>

287
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,926
<i>whom should he meet,</i>
<i>but Mr McGregor!</i>

288
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,433
<i>Peter was out of breath and</i>
<i>trembling with fright,</i>

289
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,628
<i>and he had not the least idea</i>
<i>which way to go.</i>

290
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,240
- It's muddy, actually.
- One more, Mr Mortimer.

291
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,238
Lighten it up.

292
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,536
<i>Mr McGregor caught sight of him</i>
<i>at the corner,</i>

293
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,236
<i>but Peter did not care.</i>

294
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,815
<i>He slipped underneath the gate</i>
<i>and was safe at last</i>

295
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,610
<i>in the wood outside.</i>

296
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:05,121
Not quite. See here?
It's still a bit...

297
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,824
<i>When Peter came home</i>
<i>his mother put him to bed</i>

298
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,730
<i>with a tablespoonful of camomile tea.</i>

299
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:23,034
<i>But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail</i>
<i>had bread and milk</i>

300
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,336
<i>and blackberries for supper.</i>

301
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,308
This book, it's changed things
for me, Mr Warne.

302
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,613
How so?

303
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,922
For one thing, it's given me
the chance to prove to my mother

304
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,521
that an unmarried woman of 32 can
do more than attend tea parties

305
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,124
- and smile at dull conversations.
- Yes, indeed.

306
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,432
You know, my family never wanted me
to get into publishing either.

307
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,837
We do make rather a good team,
don't you think?

308
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,742
Provided, of course,
we prove them wrong.

309
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,723
Mother, this is Miss Potter.

310
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:22,423
At last, we poor forgotten folk
in Bedford Square get to share

311
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,228
some of Norman's excitement.

312
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,031
Mrs Warne, it's so kind of you
to invite me.

313
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,733
Nonsense. It was the desperate
act of a woman who was beginning

314
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,138
to forget what her son looked like.

315
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,541
Mother!
And this is my sister, Amelia.

316
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,646
Hello.

317
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,806
Norman allowed us a peek at
Peter Rabbit, Miss Potter.

318
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,509
We found it utterly charming.
So we wheedled, cajoled,

319
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,712
and absolutely insisted that
Norman bring you round for tea.

320
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,915
I have decided that you and I
are going to be friends.

321
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,819
Have you?

322
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,425
Well, Norman tells me that
you're unmarried, as am I,

323
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,930
and that you're not
unhappy about it.

324
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,931
And I can't tell you how much
that pleases me.

325
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,628
Why can't you talk about
the weather like other girls?

326
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,433
Well, all the other unmarried
daughters in our circle,

327
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,132
and, believe me, there are many
they sit around all day,

328
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,143
gossiping and unaccountably
bursting into tears.

329
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,908
But you have done something.
You've written a book.

330
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,815
I warn you, I am prepared to
like you very much.

331
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,513
Well, in that case, I shall have
to like you too, Miss Warne.

332
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,920
Call me Millie, and that's to be
the last of Miss Potter too,

333
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:20,422
I'm afraid.

334
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,925
Absolutely. Beatrix, by all means.

335
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,723
Thank goodness, the tea!
I'm beginning to feel quite ill

336
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,126
with all this bonhomie.

337
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,630
Oh, do let's have tea
in the garden, Mother.

338
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,826
It's too beautiful a day
in every way not to share it

339
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,334
with the flowers.

340
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,334
Well, I love to garden.
Mother disapproves,

341
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,842
but I can't help myself.
I love flowers shockingly.

342
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,037
That's why you have
the hands of a greengrocer.

343
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,238
I do not!

344
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,806
Thank heavens Norman sometimes
deigns to read to me.

345
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,715
If I had to rely on you
for companionship,

346
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,617
I should expire of loneliness.

347
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,916
My mother's taste in books,
Miss Potter, and, I'm afraid,

348
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,618
in life, runs to the er...
melodramatic.

349
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,421
Oh, nonsense.

350
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,929
I like good English biographies
and you know it.

351
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,331
I loathe silly romances, such as
the ones your brothers publish.

352
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,027
My brothers and I, Mother.

353
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,139
I am part of the firm now too,
you know.

354
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,640
A sweet-natured boy like you
does not need to work.

355
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,835
Your brothers provide quite well
for all of us,

356
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,345
and I need your smile here.

357
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,312
But then, no-one listens to
a crotchety old lady

358
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,110
in a wheelchair.

359
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,810
Indeed they don't, Mother.

360
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,420
My mother may be crotchety,
Miss Potter,

361
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,523
but she does have an eye
for beautiful things.

362
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,818
She was fascinated by your drawings.

363
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,320
Utterly unique.

364
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,732
Well, when I see something unusual,
I'm not contentjust to look at it.

365
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,927
I must capture it.

366
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,338
Last summer, in the farmyard,
I was drawing something

367
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,942
that was quite lovely in the sun,

368
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:49,240
and suddenly, I realised I was
drawing the pigs' swill bucket.

369
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,612
I had to laugh at myself.

370
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,911
I feel a bit of a chill, Norman.
Can you take me inside?

371
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,521
- Of course.
- Please excuse me.

372
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,022
It was delightful meeting you,
Miss Potter.

373
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:00,920
And you.

374
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,621
Do stay longer, and teach
Millie how to behave.

375
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,929
I think that means she likes you.

376
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,435
Did she say she likes to
draw swill buckets?

377
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,235
Indeed she did, Mother.
Indeed she did.

378
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,343
I think by Wednesday, you could
hang the lace curtains upstairs.

379
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,609
- Then at least it will look like summer,
even if it doesn't feel like it. -Yes, Madam

380
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,810
Oh, Beatrix. What is this stain
on your blouse?

381
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,013
Jane says it won't wash out,
and she's tried everything.

382
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,215
- Oh, it's ink.
- Ink?

383
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,122
I must have brushed against
something at the printers'.

384
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,025
Jane, I'm very sorry for causing
you extra work.

385
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,133
Jane, take the blouse away.
Give it to the poor.

386
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,236
This behaviour shows scant
regard for your father's money.

387
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,431
Well, one day, I shall make enough
money to buy my own clothes.

388
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,441
I'm far too old to be living off
the generosity of my father.

389
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,044
You're too old to be
spending so much time

390
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,613
in the company of a man
who takes you to printers!

391
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,013
Your father does not approve,
and neither do I.

392
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,415
Mr Warne is publishing my book.

393
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:07,218
Oh, that book! I can hardly wait
till it's finished and forgotten.

394
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,122
I don't understand you, Beatrix.

395
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,229
Your father and I have introduced
you to so many suitable young men

396
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:16,027
of your class, young men of fortune,
and impeccably good family.

397
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,536
Oh, certainly, like that charming
fellow, Lionel Stokely.

398
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,439
Lionel is a particular favourite
of his uncle, the earl,

399
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,238
whom we visit every summer
at Stokely Court.

400
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,110
Oh, and I do regret terribly that
I didn't accept Harry Haddon-Bell.

401
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,308
Harry's great-grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

402
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,214
Harry's grandfather
went to Sandhurst.

403
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,321
Harry's father
went to Sandhurst.

404
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,322
And so I went to Sandhurst.

405
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,827
Father and I and the gamekeeper often
go out riding in the morning...

406
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,124
Ashton's a crack shot.

407
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,533
But no, you're just
a pig-headed girl.

408
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,137
Mr Warne is asking for you
at the door, Miss.

409
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,536
Mr Warne? He's not expected.

410
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,143
Unannounced. Perfection!

411
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,224
Come on, here.

412
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,638
Two sold while we were
at the booksellers.

413
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,036
That amounts to 40 in a week.

414
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,143
- Which is 160 in a month.
- Good gracious!

415
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,041
I'm trying to remember
my twelve-times table.

416
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,011
1,920 in a year.

417
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,019
- I can't breathe.
- That's just in one shop.

418
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,917
My dear Miss Potter,
you are an author.

419
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,917
We have achieved
what we set out to do.

420
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,117
We have created a book.

421
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,421
Yes.

422
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,624
What's the matter?

423
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,627
A cloud just passed across your face.

424
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,935
You've been very generous
with your time, Mr Warne,

425
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,736
Shown me things that
I never would have seen.

426
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,435
Printing houses!

427
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,509
- I shall miss your company.
- Are you losing my company?

428
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,415
Ltjust occurred to me
that the book is out

429
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,921
and our association is
coming to an end.

430
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,218
Miss Potter.

431
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:27,020
I had hoped that you might
have other stories.

432
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,325
Really?

433
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,427
Really?

434
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:36,236
Do you know, I recently remembered
one I thought I had forgotten it.

435
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,534
About a duck...

436
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,138
a very stupid duck.

437
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,940
Based on one of your friends?

438
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,112
It's based on myself, I think

439
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,617
It's a story I told a friend once.

440
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,722
My family summers in the Lake District,
and there was someone there,

441
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,726
the grounds man's son, who was
always interested in my stories.

442
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,932
Miss Beatrix. Are you skulking?

443
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,734
No such thing, Willie Heelis. No.
I was drying off my sketch book.

444
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,805
Not bad, Miss Beatrix.

445
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,109
Do you have any animal
stories for me today?

446
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,914
I don't. Sorry. Nothing new.

447
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,226
That's Jemima.
She doesn't have a story yet.

448
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,827
Not a proper one.

449
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,125
- Jemima Duck?
- Jemima Puddle-Duck.

450
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,234
And a stupider duck
the world has never seen.

451
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,033
She goes looking for a safe
place to lay her eggs

452
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,732
and meets a charming gentleman
with a long bushy tail

453
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,139
and very sharp teeth.

454
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,737
Precisely.

455
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,612
The gentlemen offers her his shed
and Jemima is surprised to find

456
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,514
that there are so many feathers in it.

457
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:59,214
But then, as I told you,
she is a very stupid duck.

458
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,917
I like it.

459
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,129
I'd love to paint every view
in this valley,

460
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,528
but I'm not very good at landscapes.

461
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,430
Wait too long and it won't be
here to paint, Miss Beatrix.

462
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,834
- Really, that's ridiculous.
- No, I'm serious.

463
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,431
The large farms are being broken up
into small plots and sold off.

464
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,841
Well, you can't stand
in the way of progress.

465
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,242
So they say.

466
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,810
But I say beauty's
worth preserving.

467
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,317
I know you do, Willie.

468
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,218
But nobody could disagree
with you about that.

469
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,926
Well, I'll see you soon, then.

470
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,723
Perhaps not, Miss Beatrix.
I'm leaving for Manchester next week.

471
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,927
To study the law?

472
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,126
Yes, indeed. I have to better
myself somehow.

473
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,437
- Good luck.
- Send me some drawings.

474
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,733
I will.

475
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,639
<i>He encouraged me to take</i>
<i>my writing seriously.</i>

476
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,010
We must get started on
the new story straight away.

477
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,709
Jemima Puddle-Duck.
I think the public should like that,

478
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,320
and Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.
What do you think?

479
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,819
Well, if you, if you think.

480
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,015
Your book has been very
important in my life.

481
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,422
You have been very
important in my life.

482
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,925
And you in mine, Mr Warne.

483
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,122
- And we must do it again and again.
- And again!

484
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,825
I promise you,
I intend to be a nuisance.

485
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,219
When did you decide
you wouldn't marry?

486
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,919
Just before my 20th birthday.

487
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,624
Mother came to my room and
announced that Lionel Stokely

488
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,929
was to marry Gwendolyn Alcott and
they were to live at Stokely Court,

489
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,834
which Lionel had just
inherited from the earl.

490
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,341
And I knew right then that
she would bring me no more suitors

491
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,342
and that I would never marry.

492
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,913
And that shocked me.

493
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,318
But I felt relieved.

494
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,913
And that shocked me.

495
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:15,021
So I went into the garden and filled
an entire notebook with sketches.

496
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,720
Men are bores.

497
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,726
They're useful for only
two things in life

498
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,423
financial support and procreation.

499
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:25,434
Millie!
You say outrageous things!

500
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,939
- Ah, but the price.
- What price?

501
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:35,739
Domestic enslavement.
Childbirth. Terrifying.

502
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,814
No, unmarried women have
a better life.

503
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,712
I swear it's true.

504
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,413
No houses, no babies, no husbands
demanding things all the time.

505
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,115
As long as one's lucky enough
in life to have a good friend.

506
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,022
I'm so glad Norman found you, Beatrix.

507
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,629
I was missing something
I didn't even know.

508
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,846
<i>Dear Miss Potter,</i>
<i>I enclose with great pleasure</i>

509
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,006
<i>the latest in what I hope</i>
<i>will be a long line of tales.</i>

510
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,209
<i>Yours affably, Norman Warne.</i>

511
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,717
Mr Warne.

512
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,913
Would you and Millie like to
come to a Christmas party?

513
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,615
My parents hold one every year,

514
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,023
and I think it's high time
that I invited someone.

515
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:28,223
Yes, we'd be delighted to attend.
Thrilled, in fact.

516
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,905
Be still, little imps!

517
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,108
Peter, you naughty boy!

518
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,412
Look what an example you're setting.

519
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,416
That's better. Any more of that
and I'll paint you out.

520
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,321
Your father is home.

521
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,135
How was your day at the club, Father?

522
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,731
Interesting, as always.

523
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,742
Rupert, we seem to have a situation.
We need your resolution.

524
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,904
I want to invite Norman Warne and
his sister to our Christmas party.

525
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,608
With Lady Armitage?
With Sir Nigel and Sybil?

526
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,810
A tradesman, Rupert!
How will anyone have fun?

527
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,923
He's the gentleman
who publishes my books, Father.

528
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,326
- Rupert.
- I have something here, Beatrix.

529
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:37,225
I went into Hatchards bookshop and
I purchased this with good money.

530
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,633
Hugh Whitteford bearded me in
the club and rattled on for hours.

531
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,830
You know old Hugh, jowls all aflutter.

532
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,339
Wife's bought three of
your girls' books

533
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,737
for her granddaughter's nursery.

534
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,936
Sending more by ship
to chums in Bombay.

535
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,707
Very soon, the whole club was
telling me of some purchase

536
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,817
that they had made of
our daughter's creation.

537
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,714
So I thought it was time
that I bought one.

538
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,220
So I went straight into Hatchards,
put my shilling onto the counter.

539
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,324
I would have given you one.

540
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:04,019
But I wanted to buy one
like everyone else.

541
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,230
Now, I owe you an apology, Beatrix.

542
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,130
When you showed me your books,
all I saw was my little girl

543
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,432
bringing me clever drawings
for me to comment on.

544
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:19,236
You're not a little girl anymore.
You're an artist.

545
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,038
The genuine article.

546
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,308
I would have been proud to use
that word about myself,

547
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,009
and now, I'm proud of you, Beatrix.

548
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,517
Thank you, Father.

549
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,715
So I don't see any reason why
we cannot make a little social effort

550
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,420
to welcome the gentleman responsible
for this blessing into our home.

551
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,025
Thank you, Father.

552
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,226
Thank you.

553
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,033
I think it will be good
for all of us.

554
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,541
Merry Christmas, Rupert.

555
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,320
Glenys, don't serve Sir Nigel
the punch with brandy

556
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,012
- unless he demands it.
- Yes, madam.

557
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,420
And after dinner, he'll take port.

558
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,925
Come and give me a little signal
after he's had four glasses.

559
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,724
The house shimmers, my darling.
You've done it again.

560
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,732
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

561
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,931
- Mr Warne, Millie,
- how wonderful!

562
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,235
Thank you, Jane.

563
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,637
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,319
Mother, Father,
I would like you to meet

565
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:39,014
Miss Amelia and Mr Norman Warne.

566
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,319
How charming of you
to be so punctual!

567
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,605
Go on, one wouldn't hurt.

568
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,813
I think Wiggin is under strict
orders never to leave our side.

569
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,512
How festive!

570
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,519
Such scintillating conversation.

571
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,316
Oh, mine as well! The weather
in Amsterdam in July.

572
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,517
Could I interest you ladies
in an after dinner coffee?

573
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,220
Some of the gentlemen would like
to play a few hands of cards,

574
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,830
but they're short of a fourth.

575
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,727
I don't suppose you play whist,
Mr Warne?

576
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,027
I'm afraid I've never had
much aptitude for cards.

577
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,831
- Oh, that is a pity.
- I play.

578
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,836
This is to play with Sir Nigel,
Miss Warne.

579
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,941
Sir Nigel takes his whist
very seriously.

580
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,044
I play rather well, actually.

581
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,740
Do you, Millie?

582
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,213
Well, I'm sure you two have
plenty to talk about without me,

583
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,410
and if they can't play
without a fourth...

584
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,215
Come along, Miss Warne.

585
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,022
Carols in the music room, my dears.

586
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,332
Perhaps I could show you
your Christmas present.

587
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,433
Yes.

588
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,228
It's upstairs.

589
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,836
I will bring the coffee.

590
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,422
- Mrs Wiggin.
- Miss.

591
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,615
Miss Wiggin. I have taken
the liberty of adding

592
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,023
a splash of brandy to our coffees.

593
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,719
Well, it is Christmas.

594
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,728
Is this where you paint, Miss Potter?

595
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:07,031
Yes, and it's where we shall
find your Christmas present.

596
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,342
Oh, my!

597
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,343
I think, other than Bertram and Father,
you are the first man ever

598
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,343
to set foot in this room.

599
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,108
- Would you like me to leave?
- No, no, no. Wiggin is here.

600
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,219
And if this is the best I can do
for scandal at my age,

601
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,413
I'm hardly worthy of my reputation
for creativity.

602
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,617
Here.

603
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,623
My, but it's beautiful!

604
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,028
Is it the new story?

605
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,829
Miss Potter, is it the new story?

606
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,128
- Is it?
- I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,431
Come over here.

608
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,336
That's Jemima Puddle-Duck.

609
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:49,037
It's the first drawing I ever did
of Jemima. I was eight, I think.

610
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,807
Jemima, stop that!

611
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,511
Stop what?

612
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,118
Just some silliness.

613
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,516
- And what's this?
- Oh, it's a music box.

614
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,127
My father gave it to me
for my sixth birthday.

615
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,626
He did the painting himself.

616
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,424
So your father is an artist too?

617
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,432
No. He always wanted to be an artist,
but the family disapproved.

618
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,229
So, he took up law.

619
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,233
The joke is I've never once
heard him discuss a case.

620
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,934
He goes to his club every day,
and never his office.

621
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,840
So, I don't really know
what he does.

622
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,616
- Oh, dear.
- Wiggin is fallible.

623
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,618
I'm afraid, Miss Potter, your
reputation is now officially dented.

624
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,825
'Let me teach you how to dance'.
Do you dance, Miss Potter?

625
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,223
No. Well, not well.

626
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,919
I make a terrible hash of it too
when I try,

627
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,530
but the words are very sweet.

628
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,633
You know the words?
Will you sing the words?

629
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,428
Well, er...

630
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,630
<i>#Let me teach you how to dance</i>

631
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,703
<i>#Let me lead you to the floor</i>

632
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,416
<i>#Simply place your hand in mine</i>

633
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:06,514
<i>#And then think of nothing more.</i>

634
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:11,218
<i>#Let the music cast its spell</i>

635
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:16,231
<i>#Give the atmosphere a chance.</i>

636
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,031
<i>#Simply follow where I lead</i>

637
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:26,438
<i>#Let me teach you how to dance.</i>

638
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,408
Miss Potter.

639
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,315
I know you have decided not to marry.

640
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,919
All my life, I thought that
I would not marry either

641
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,718
but something has happened that
has caused me to change my mind.

642
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,724
No, please, let me go on,
for if I do not say

643
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,022
what I have to say it now,
I fear I never will.

644
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,531
Miss Potter,
I would like you to consider...

645
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,533
Mr Warne.

646
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,231
Doing me the honour, and I do not
expect an immediate answer.

647
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,533
Beatrix?

648
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,140
I was just showing Mr Warne
his Christmas present.

649
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,616
I'm an impeccably genteel,
unmarried lady, Mother.

650
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,014
I haven't begun to invite
men to my room.

651
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,313
Mr Warne?

652
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,426
Wiggin!

653
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,706
What is the picture, Beatrix?

654
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,013
I've written and drawn
little children's books,

655
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,020
which have been published.

656
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:51,924
The man who published them is here.
Mr Norman Warne.

657
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:56,226
To thank him for his assistance
and generosity...

658
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,033
Well... l'm...

659
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,433
I'm writing him a Christmas story.

660
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,640
- Can we hear it?
- It isn't finished, so...

661
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,141
Oh, go on.

662
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,110
I suppose, before we part
for the evening,

663
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:19,018
I could share a glimpse of
the unfinished tale of

664
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,420
'The Rabbits' Christmas Party'.

665
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:30,923
One particularly snowy Christmas Eve,
a young rabbit and

666
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:36,335
his fearsome older brothers
and fiercely brave sister

667
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,034
set out on a journey they make
every year to celebrate

668
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,838
with their friends.

669
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,107
Now, rabbits are highly sociable
creatures, and legend has it that

670
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,809
wherever they find themselves
on Christmas Eve,

671
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,819
they get together and
throw a jolly party!

672
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,622
Now, I know such a legend exists
because I made it up.

673
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,229
The rabbits travel through
the woods to the well-appointed

674
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:07,929
burrow of their cousins where
a warm fire is waiting for them.

675
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:13,840
They take off their frosty coats
and the party begins!

676
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,912
Now, I know on this night
that they will eat and talk

677
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:22,007
and dance and laugh and
roast apples on the fire!

678
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:26,521
But I'm not certain
how the story ends,

679
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,616
because I haven't made
that part up yet.

680
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,931
But, in any case, Mr Warne will
have to read it first,

681
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,933
as he is my strict censor,

682
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,629
and, well, it is his present.

683
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,535
Merry Christmas, Mr Warne.

684
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,636
Thank you, Miss Potter.
It's so beautiful.

685
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,805
There'll be no problem with presents
for the grandchildren next year,

686
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,112
- I dare say.
- You must be very proud, Helen.

687
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,812
It's just a children's story.

688
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,518
Outstanding!

689
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,217
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

690
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,427
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

691
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,127
No. As my confidante.

692
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,940
You have something to confide?
How delicious!

693
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,533
Your brother has asked me
to marry him,

694
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:26,615
and I feel, quite irrationally,
that I may say, 'yes'.

695
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,315
I'd like your approval.

696
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,221
My approval?

697
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,320
Beatrix, don't be a fool.

698
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,724
Marry him.

699
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,634
Tomorrow. Don't waste a moment.
How could you hesitate?

700
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,135
You're not upset?

701
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:49,930
Well, why would I be upset?

702
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,737
Well, both Norman and I.
You'll be alone.

703
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:58,314
You have a chance for happiness,
and you're worrying about me?

704
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,110
I wouldn't worry about you if,
if someone came along

705
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,516
who loved me and whom I loved,
I would trample my mother.

706
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,724
- Do you love Norman?
- Yes.

707
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:12,420
Then marry him. Don't you dare
think about anyone else.

708
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,827
But what about all
the blessings of being alone?

709
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:15,932
Hogwash.

710
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,432
What else is a woman on her own
supposed to say?

711
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,729
You have a chance to be loved.
Take it.

712
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,639
And leave me happy,

713
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,939
knowing that the two people
that I love are happy.

714
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,412
That is the most thought
you should ever have for me.

715
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,814
There you are, Beatrix!
The guests.

716
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,215
Yes, Mother.

717
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,615
Millie...

718
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,321
Go.

719
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,024
What is going on tonight?

720
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,435
Why do I feel like a stranger
in my own home?

721
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,335
You have a clever daughter, Rupert.
You must be very proud.

722
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,534
- Of Beatrix? Yes, we are.
- To write and draw like that!

723
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,408
Beatrix should meet my niece, Anne.
She makes pots.

724
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,006
- Ceramics, Nigel.
- Look like pots to me.

725
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:14,622
As for you, madam,
I suggest you take up knitting.

726
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,020
Merry Christmas.

727
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,130
What was all that about?

728
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,132
Sir Nigel disapproves of the way
I play whist.

729
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,737
I'm afraid I won two guineas from him.

730
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,031
Mr Warne!

731
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,739
- Your painting.
- Oh, yes. My Christmas present.

732
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,009
Yes.

733
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,324
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.
- Goodbye, Mr Warne.

734
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,015
Sir?

735
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,023
I have an appointment to see
Mr Rupert Potter in the Eagleton Room.

736
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,423
- He's expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

737
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,941
Come along, Norman,
it's only her father.

738
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,207
Come in.

739
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,925
Thank you very much, Mr Potter,
for taking the time

740
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,617
out of your very busy day.

741
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,228
Goodbye, Mr Warne.

742
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,634
If you will not accept our advice
in this decision,

743
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,430
then we will have to impose
that advice.

744
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,835
Respect our knowledge and
the worth of our opinions, Beatrix.

745
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,411
Oi! Get over there!

746
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,016
I said that I'll do it and I will.

747
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,713
Norman Warne is a tradesman, Beatrix.
No Potter can marry into trade,

748
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,720
- and that's final.
- And what are we?

749
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,325
Father's money comes from
Grandfather's printing works

750
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,429
in Lancashire.
A trade, Mother.

751
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,531
And if Grandfather hadn't
run for parliament,

752
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,634
we'd still be living
in the shadow of his factories.

753
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,829
Your legacy came from Grandfather
Leech's cotton trade.

754
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,236
When did we become
so high and mighty?

755
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,936
We're parvenus, Mother.
Social climbers.

756
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,310
Your father and I We will not
allow this marriage for your own good,

757
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,916
and there is no reason to
become insulting!

758
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,610
It's not an insult!
It's the truth!

759
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,018
Our lives are pretension and
social aspiration.

760
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,124
Sir this and Lady that!

761
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,421
Norman Warne is a gentleman
of comfortable means,

762
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:43,829
and not one bit beneath us,
and I intend to marry him.

763
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,130
Not if you expect to take
one penny of your inheritance!

764
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,329
You haven't disinherited Bertram
for running off

765
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,737
with a wine merchant's daughter.

766
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,038
Happily, I am a published author.
I have means of my own.

767
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,009
This discussion is over.

768
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,625
Come in, Father.

769
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:17,622
Why is it that after any difficult
situation, she always sends you?

770
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,428
Mama didn't send me.

771
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:25,735
I don't like tension in my home.
I want to resolve this matter.

772
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,344
Well, you can't.
I've made my decision.

773
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,914
Your mother wants what is
best for you, as do I, Beatrix.

774
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,209
An impulsive and inappropriate
marriage is something that

775
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,114
you would ultimately regret.

776
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,517
You can't allow me to
marry and leave.

777
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,714
With Bertram moved away,
who would take care of you?

778
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,916
You surely do not think
we would deny you happiness

779
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,425
just simply because we needed
a nursemaid?

780
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,426
That is a knife in my heart.

781
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,622
Well, then, what is it, Father,
because I cannot understand.

782
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,733
You cannot make us the villains,
Beatrix.

783
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,633
Your mother trotted out countless
suitors all of them acceptable.

784
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,433
- You rejected every one of them.
- I know that, Father.

785
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,543
I didn't want to be a silly woman
marrying a man simply

786
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,807
because he was acceptable,
or rich enough to take care of me.

787
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,406
But does that mean that
I'm never to be loved?

788
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,313
Father?

789
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,421
Wiggin, wait here, please.

790
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:27,532
I'd like to enquire about my
royalty earnings, Mr Copperthwaite.

791
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:34,941
And whether I might, at some stage,
afford a house of my own

792
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,602
in the country.

793
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:41,206
You have enough to buy an estate.
Several estates, and a house in town.

794
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,013
You're quite a wealthy woman,
Miss Potter.

795
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,013
Am I truly?

796
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:51,821
Yes, the income has become
quite regular.

797
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,625
If your fortune continues to grow,
you should have no financial worries

798
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,733
for the rest of your life.

799
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,838
Extraordinary.

800
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,515
Beatrix.

801
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,320
Beatrix, come and sit with us,
please.

802
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:26,122
- I'd rather not, Father.
- We have something to discuss.

803
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:26,922
A proposition.

804
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,624
And, for heaven's sake, Beatrix.
Let the servants carry your dishes.

805
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:37,340
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

806
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,034
Nonsense. You always take tea.

807
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,236
Contrary to what you think and
what you have so vehemently

808
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,407
expressed, your mama and I
want you to be happy.

809
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,917
We simply doubt that
this marriage will do the trick.

810
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,023
Helen, please.
Sit down, Beatrix.

811
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,727
What we don't want is for you
to rush into something

812
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,228
which you may later wish
to reconsider.

813
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,626
I won't want to reconsider.

814
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,530
- We are not convinced.
- Helen, please.

815
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:11,534
We are not convinced.
Yet, neither have we hearts of stone.

816
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,142
Therefore, this is what we propose.

817
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,913
You may accept Mr. Warne,

818
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:23,418
but it must remain a complete
secret even from his own family.

819
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,113
Now, this summer, yourself,
Mama and I will go,

820
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,315
as always, to the Lake District.

821
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:33,521
Lf, at the end of the summer,
you still wish to proceed,

822
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,826
then we will announce
your engagement

823
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:40,834
and you can marry with
our blessing and our love.

824
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,834
Why must no one know?

825
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,033
So there'll be no public
embarrassment when you change.

826
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,011
- Lf, If you change your mind.
- Lf.

827
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,017
Now, Beatrix, if you care for
this man as much as you say you do,

828
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,917
then in a few months the ardour
will still be there.

829
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:05,016
If your mother, and I, are correct,
and this emotion cools with time,

830
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:10,224
then we will have protected you
against humiliation and unhappiness.

831
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,530
- It will not cool.
- Beatrix, listen to me.

832
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,638
A woman at your age must
consider very carefully...

833
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:20,232
Mother, the only thing true
at my age is that at my age,

834
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,538
every day matters.

835
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:32,620
Very well, Mother, Father,
I accept your terms.

836
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,919
Norman and I may decide to
wait in any case.

837
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,128
But make plans.

838
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:43,232
There will be a wedding
in this house by October.

839
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,321
They're beautiful.

840
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,729
Which carriage, Rupert?

841
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,730
Saunders?

842
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,439
Four carriages down.
This way.

843
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,415
Well...

844
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,026
- This is the Potters' for Windermere.
- Right you are, sir.

845
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,830
Here and those two.

846
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,230
Beatrix!

847
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,109
Mr. Warne!

848
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,207
Oh, I do apologise.

849
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,330
- Miss Potter!
- Mr. Warne!

850
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,832
I was beginning to fear
you wouldn't come.

851
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:33,628
You're soaked.

852
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,032
It wasn't raining
when I left the office.

853
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,230
I brought you the proof of
the new book for your trip.

854
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:41,241
- Oh, you'll catch cold.
- I couldn't miss seeing you off.

855
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,242
You know nothing would stop me.

856
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,405
This is going to be the longest
summer I've ever spent.

857
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,016
- It's only the summer. That's all.
- Yes.

858
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,619
And this time is not for us.
It's for your parents.

859
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,415
How can they know what we're feeling?
They've never felt it.

860
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,717
We can afford them
this three months.

861
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,726
I suppose.

862
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,329
This is not how I wish
to say goodbye to you.

863
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:23,309
Goodbye, Miss Potter.
I look forward to your speedy return.

864
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,819
As do I, Mr. Warne.

865
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,820
Quickly. Here.

866
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,731
Goodbye, Miss Potter.

867
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,630
Goodbye, Mr. Warne.

868
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,137
Goodbye, Norman.

869
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,236
<i>My dear, dear Norman,</i>

870
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:19,933
<i>this absurd forced separation</i>
<i>is surely a kind of madness,</i>

871
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:25,605
<i>most notably, that of my mother,</i>
<i>but you are here, my dear, for me.</i>

872
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,216
<i>The beauty of this place seems</i>
<i>magnified somehow,</i>

873
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,216
<i>with you in my mind.</i>

874
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:34,517
<i>In my occasional lonely moments,</i>
<i>I imagine conversations between us,</i>

875
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:39,117
<i>and yesterday startled a duck with</i>
<i>my declaration of love for you.</i>

876
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:42,122
<i>All of my thoughts are with you,</i>
<i>my darling.</i>

877
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,530
<i>I know that you find Harold</i>
<i>and Fruing terribly boring,</i>

878
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,636
<i>but, in fact, I'm having</i>
<i>what I could almost describe</i>

879
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,931
<i>as wild enjoyment working</i>
<i>with them.</i>

880
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,041
<i>You may wake up, one day,</i>
<i>to find yourself married</i>

881
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,642
<i>to a businessman.</i>

882
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,704
<i>Praise the day when I can wake up</i>
<i>to find you beside me.</i>

883
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,509
<i>I took one of the boats out</i>
<i>onto the lake at sunset</i>

884
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,212
<i>to watch the water hens feeding.</i>

885
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,822
<i>They made noises like kissing.</i>

886
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,425
<i>I closed my eyes and pictured you.</i>

887
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,926
<i>I find I love my heart more now,</i>

888
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,724
<i>because that is where I know</i>
<i>I can find you.</i>

889
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,425
<i>Amelia sends her fond love and</i>
<i>wishes for us all</i>

890
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,830
<i>to be together again,</i>

891
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,938
<i>as do I, multiplied a hundredfold.</i>

892
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,612
Sir... Hill Top Farm.

893
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,217
May I ask,
is it a working farm?

894
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:41,312
Aye. Another great one falls,
but this one breaks your heart.

895
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,220
Really? Why?

896
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,921
Now, miss, a body would have to

897
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:49,122
be a poet, which I certainly am not.

898
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,627
Excuse me, but I'd swear you
were someone I once knew.

899
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,635
Good heavens, Willie Heelis!

900
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,830
Miss Beatrix! Miss Potter!

901
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,134
- Is that you?
- How good to see you!

902
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,936
Well, hello!

903
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,811
I see you've given up on the law.

904
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,005
Have you decided to make
an honest living?

905
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,312
Ah, yes, the law.
Well, not exactly. No, no.

906
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,116
A country solicitor needs to
be proficient in many skills.

907
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,226
And it suits me to be out of
the office now and again.

908
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,726
Now, I could show you Hill Top,
if you have the time.

909
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,933
Yes. Yes.
Time is exactly what I have.

910
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:28,229
Good.

911
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:42,106
- Not a bad outlook, Miss Potter.
- It's sublime.

912
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,912
<i>By chance, I met an old friend</i>
<i>today who showed me</i>

913
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,421
<i>a beautiful farm that's for sale.</i>

914
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,721
<i>It would be a perfect country home,</i>
<i>and though I know we'll live</i>

915
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,226
<i>mainly in the city</i>

916
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,525
<i>I'm very keen to share</i>
<i>my favourite places with you.</i>

917
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:15,907
The post has arrived and, once again,
no letter from your Mr. Warne.

918
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:19,112
Is it time for me to start getting
just a little hopeful?

919
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,418
He did mention he might take
a few days' holiday.

920
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,822
The post is no doubt slow
from wherever he's gone.

921
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,121
Indeed.

922
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,629
But there is something that
appears to be from

923
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,630
that interesting sister of his.

924
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,634
Millie? How delightful!

925
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,635
Excuse me.

926
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,234
Norman is ill.

927
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:38,231
- I'm Beatrix Potter.
- Please come in, miss.

928
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,538
- Ah, Miss Potter.
- Hello.

929
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,033
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

930
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:51,506
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Yes. It's very kind of you.

931
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,410
Very, very kind indeed.

932
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,410
How is he?

933
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,012
Beatrix.

934
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,417
Millie?

935
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,920
Millie?

936
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,631
I'm too late.

937
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,605
He was so happy.

938
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,419
He sang songs.

939
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:33,021
He made me dance with him
in the parlour.

940
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:37,316
He laughed all the time,
everyone noticed the change in him.

941
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,121
Only I knew the reason.

942
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:46,731
But all summer, he had a cough,
and then the cough got worse,

943
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:50,532
and in one night, he was gone.

944
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,837
It was so sudden. I keep thinking
that it hasn't happened.

945
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,002
I keep expecting to see him
in the garden.

946
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,812
When's the funeral?

947
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,112
It was yesterday.

948
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,416
It was only the immediate family,
and I...

949
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,319
Well, I couldn't think of a reason
to ask them to delay it for you.

950
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:19,227
It was considerate of you to come
and pay your respects, Miss Potter.

951
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,735
Our mother is particularly moved,
and is sorry she isn't well enough

952
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,238
to come down to greet you.

953
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,832
I'll be taking over our late brother's
business affairs, Miss Potter.

954
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,706
Fine.

955
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,714
I want to assure you that F Warne
and company will do everything

956
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,911
in its power to ensure that
our tragic loss causes you

957
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,114
the least possible inconvenience.

958
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:45,921
Please accept the gratitude
of the entire family.

959
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,639
- They want me to go.
- I'm sorry.

960
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,033
Miss Beatrix!
What are you doing in London?

961
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,533
- Is something wrong?
- A friend died.

962
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,035
I'm sorry, miss.

963
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,535
Was she a close friend?

964
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,544
Miss Beatrix?

965
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,214
Miss Beatrix?

966
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,617
I'll leave your dinner outside
the door, then, miss.

967
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:44,512
Saunders is here, Miss Potter,
to take you to the station.

968
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,815
I shan't be going back to the Lakes.

969
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,713
Can I get you anything, then?

970
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,014
Nothing, Hilda.

971
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,917
Very well, Miss Potter.

972
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,526
Beatrix, it's Millie.

973
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,825
Look, I know I'm unannounced,
but they sent back all my messages.

974
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,633
Please, please, please, let me in.

975
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:20,429
We've got to get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.

976
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,129
Let's get you washed and dressed
and out of this room.

977
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,933
Go and find something to wear.

978
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,036
I can't.

979
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,509
Millie!

980
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:36,813
I can't!

981
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,928
I've been torturing myself.

982
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,929
I should never have encouraged
you with Norman.

983
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,632
I'd have saved you all
this terrible grief.

984
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,338
I loved him.

985
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,013
I loved him too.

986
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,112
But he's gone.

987
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,821
I must leave this house.

988
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,528
I will leave this house.

989
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:46,916
Congratulations, Miss Potter.

990
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,853
You are now the proud owner
of Hill Top Farm.

991
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,320
Thank you, George.

992
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,225
Well, I'm sure you'll be
very happy at Hill Top.

993
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,025
I spent some time there
as a child.

994
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:01,830
Is that so? I did have other
plans for it, but...

995
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,734
I'm sure that I will love it
in any case.

996
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,441
Yes. If you need any other
assistance or help...

997
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,602
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

998
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,111
Good day.

999
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,509
Good day, Miss Potter.

1000
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:31,328
What I don't understand, Beatrix,
is how you're going to pay

1001
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,434
for this farm.

1002
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,230
I'm a writer, Mother.
People buy my work.

1003
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,235
Our daughter is famous, Helen.

1004
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,636
You are the only person
who doesn't know it.

1005
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,612
What I don't understand is
why you find it necessary

1006
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,308
to leave your home.

1007
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,613
It is not a choice, Father.

1008
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,219
Beatrix, if I could undo anything...

1009
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,019
There's nothing to undo.

1010
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,027
This has nothing to do
with you or Mother.

1011
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,523
I must make my own way.

1012
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,036
So you must.

1013
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,030
So you must.

1014
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,730
Everybody out.

1015
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,133
You see?

1016
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,640
I told you we could not know
where ourjourney would lead.

1017
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,334
It has led us here.

1018
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,210
This is your new home.

1019
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,525
No tears!

1020
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,339
Miss.

1021
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,836
Millie!

1022
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,411
It's wonderful to see you!

1023
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,813
Oh, this place is perfect.

1024
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,111
Millie!

1025
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,813
What have you brought?

1026
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:19,527
I thought it best not to
bring this, but then...

1027
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,129
itjumped into my hand
as I walked out the door.

1028
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:34,735
I'm sorry.

1029
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,409
Thank you.

1030
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,414
It's getting easier.

1031
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,422
- It's getting etasier for me too.
- Good

1032
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,424
I'm painting again.

1033
01:18:56,965 --> 01:19:02,232
My mind's going mad with the story.
I've got pigs running amuck up there.

1034
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,841
Well, it's this place, isn't it?

1035
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,204
Who'd want to be cooped up in London
when they could be up here?

1036
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,212
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.

1037
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:18,110
I've been so lucky with visitors.
First, my brother Bertram,

1038
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,618
then my mother.

1039
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,622
You think that's lucky?
Your mother is a monster!

1040
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:27,017
No, its fine. My mother and I have
come to an understanding.

1041
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,620
We've agreed to not
understand each other.

1042
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,417
Look, if some city slicker wants to
offer me a half-decent price

1043
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,429
for a derelict property and then
pay me and my lads good money

1044
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:05,624
to knock the damn place down.

1045
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,433
Let him build what he likes.

1046
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,733
If we allow these city developers
to buy up our land,

1047
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:13,636
there'll be no more farming.

1048
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:18,712
And all you're left with is
a ruined landscape and no community.

1049
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,411
Miss Potter!

1050
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,617
Ah, Mr Heelis.

1051
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,424
I see you've found me.

1052
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:37,329
I played here so often as a child.
I know your farm very well.

1053
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,832
I swam in the stream,
played hide and seek in the woods

1054
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,630
with Cousin Charles.

1055
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,435
I brought you the executed deed
for the farm.

1056
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,543
At last.
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

1057
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,004
- Busy.
- Yes.

1058
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:56,209
Yes, I've asked Mr Canon to stay on
and run Hill Top as a working farm.

1059
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,216
I'm learning a great deal.

1060
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,117
I wish everyone who bought
land up here could be so...

1061
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,021
enlightened.

1062
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,623
You've bought a farm,
you've kept the workers on,

1063
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,627
you're working the land and
you're preserving this place.

1064
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,924
Yes. It makes me happy.

1065
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:17,226
Mr Cannon says the two farms
adjoining mine are for sale.

1066
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,840
I'd hate to see the developers
get hold of them.

1067
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,943
Do you know anything about them?

1068
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,006
- Morning, Mr Canon.
- Miss Potter.

1069
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,719
My, they've grown!

1070
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,113
- Handsome lot, wouldn't you say?
- Yes.

1071
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,615
Have you named them?

1072
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,727
We don't often give them names,
Miss Potter.

1073
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,421
Makes it a bit hard,
come slaughtering time.

1074
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,529
Hello, Miss Potter!

1075
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:50,630
Hello yourself, Mr Heelis.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1076
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,133
I've come with a message.
Mr Hubbard is ill

1077
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,743
and will be unable to show you
the neighbouring farms today.

1078
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:59,813
- Oh, dear. It's not serious, I hope?
- Chronic illness, I'm afraid.

1079
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,711
Recurs several times a month.

1080
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,717
Usually after a night
at the Rose And Crown.

1081
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,713
I see.

1082
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:10,015
Mr Hubbard wondered if I might
show you the properties instead.

1083
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,424
I'd be pleased to have
so knowledgeable a guide.

1084
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:17,031
I'll just get my shawl.

1085
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,028
Well, it's prime land.

1086
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,226
There's a lot of profit
in building houses on it.

1087
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,929
But more value as
a working farm, surely?

1088
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,336
Spoken like a true
Lakes woman, Miss Potter.

1089
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,339
Indeed, Mr Heelis.

1090
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,603
You do realise I've never
been to an auction.

1091
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:31,905
It's simple enough.

1092
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:35,016
Don't bid too early and
stick to your limit.

1093
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,516
I know my limit, Mr Heelis.

1094
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,414
Craven's Mill Farm,

1095
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:44,218
40 acres of splendour.
 1,100 anywhere?

1096
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,224
 1,100 I'm bid.

1097
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:49,819
 1,150?
Come along, gentlemen.

1098
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,627
Splendid little farm, this.
Lots of development potential.

1099
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:56,533
 1,150.
 1,200 anywhere?

1100
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,731
 1,200.
 1,300 anywhere?

1101
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,434
Bidding, madam?
 1,300.

1102
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,909
Seated at  1,300.

1103
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,105
 1,400.

1104
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:08,715
 1,500.

1105
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,613
 1,600.

1106
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,016
Seven hundred.
Eight hundred.

1107
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,019
 1,900.

1108
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:19,923
At  1,900.
 2,000 at the back.  2,000

1109
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:23,622
Any more at  2,000.

1110
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,528
 2,300.

1111
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:29,535
- Rich Bastard!
- Thank you, sir.  2,300.

1112
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,037
At  2,300.

1113
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:36,132
Any more, then, at  2,300?

1114
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,507
 2,500.

1115
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,307
The lady at  2,500.

1116
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:43,713
Against you, sir,
at  2,500.  2,800.

1117
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,616
Miss Potter, you've bid more
than that farm is worth.

1118
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:53,216
3,000, at 3,000 seated,
with the lady. Against you, sir.

1119
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,819
Are we all done at 3,000?

1120
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,125
Going once,

1121
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,427
Going twice,

1122
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,729
Sold to the lady, 3,000.

1123
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:08,633
Sir, you should control your client.

1124
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,507
She has allowed her emotions
to get the better of her.

1125
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:12,010
Really?

1126
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,412
She has squandered any possibility
of profit from that farm.

1127
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,108
It was prime development land.

1128
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,914
This place, this community
is an inspiration.

1129
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,615
It should be conserved for
future generations,

1130
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,918
and not destroyed.
It deserves protection.

1131
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,823
Madam, your observations are
woefully inadequate...

1132
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:30,829
Please, sir. I am no longer
in the habit of being lectured to,

1133
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:35,527
and, thankfully, I do not require
your approval or anyone else's.

1134
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:39,436
So, if you'll excuse us?
Mr Heelis?

1135
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:51,009
I hope you're not going to make
a habit of this, Miss Potter.

1136
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,519
Do you know, Mr Heelis,
I think I might.

1137
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,114
Now, will you have time tomorrow
to show me those other farms?

1138
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,921
- I certainly will.
- Excellent!

1139
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:13,932
Come in.

1140
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,306
Oh, my!

1141
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:22,115
Goodness me!

1142
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,717
I'll be just a moment.

1143
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:53,204
Now then young man, how are you
taking to your new home?

1144
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,412
I know it's not London,

1145
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,019
but Hill Top might suit
a young rabbit better.

1146
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,219
He seems to be taking
to the place.

1147
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,826
As am I, Mr Heelis.

1148
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,625
- Now, the road.
- Oh, yes.

1149
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,424
Yes, of course, Miss Potter.

1150
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,137
How would you feel about
calling me William

1151
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:21,231
instead of this infernal Mr Heelis?
I sound like an undertaker.

1152
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,503
Of course, William.

1153
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:27,911
And I believe Beatrix might be
perfectly appropriate as well.

1154
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:51,031
<i>There's something delicious about</i>
<i>writing the first few words of a story.</i>

1155
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,233
<i>You can never quite tell</i>
<i>where they're take you.</i>

1156
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:01,006
<i>Mine took me here.</i>
<i>Where I belong.</i>
