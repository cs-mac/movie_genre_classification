1
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,148
Why must you be this way?

2
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,413
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.

3
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,255
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?

4
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:38,656
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!

5
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,422
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?

6
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,760
- How long?
- Far too long.

7
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:48,733
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?

8
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,897
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.

9
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:13,694
Let's try to make the best of this.

10
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,357
Where's thls idiot
who's supposed to meet us?

11
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,459
Move!

12
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,971
Mr. Harrer.

13
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,702
I have your tickets.

14
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:32,644
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.

15
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:36,114
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.

16
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,277
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!

17
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:40,286
Mr. Harrer?

18
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:44,313
May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer...

19
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:47,589
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.

20
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,130
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.

21
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:52,564
Yes. but I'm sure that
.
as a distinguished member...

22
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,659
of the National Soclalist Party,
you would be proud to plant...

23
00:04:55,736 --> 00:05:00,730
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.

24
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,776
Hans Lobenhoffer.

25
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,436
Lutz Chicken.

26
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,976
And a picture with your lovely wife.

27
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,789
And Mr.--

28
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,792
Horst lmmendorf. Family frlend.
No plcture necessary.

29
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,130
When is the little one due.
.
Mrs. Harrer?

30
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,689
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.

31
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,634
Thank you.

32
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,333
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?

33
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,509
I'm getting on that traln.
Do you have anything you want to say?

34
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,607
Fine.

35
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,752
Go. Leave.

36
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:50,146
I'll see you in four months.

37
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,391
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will. Heinrich .
.

38
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,406
We will travel 5,000 miles.

39
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,073
When we reach lndia,
we will head for the Hlmalayas...

40
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:24,083
and the ninth highest peak
on Earth, Nanga Parbat.

41
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:27,643
Germany calls it "Unserberg--
Our Mountain. "

42
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,858
Before us, four German expeditions
attempted it.

43
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:33,484
All failed.

44
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:37,224
Eleven climbers were killed
in storms and avalanches.

45
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:41,860
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat
is a national obsession--

46
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,302
a matter of German pride.

47
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,235
July 29, 1939.

48
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:56,147
We have already made Camp Four
at 22.000 feet.
.

49
00:07:56,217 --> 00:08:01,211
Overhead is the Reklak Glacier
and a difficult climb up the icefall.

50
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,919
The baby must be
at least one month old now.

51
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:11,861
I have been
so confused and dlstracted.

52
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,730
I can 't climb
with my usual confldence.

53
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,523
Are you all right?

54
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,461
Shit!

55
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:55,902
- Are you al I right?
- Shall we come down?

56
00:08:58,212 --> 00:09:00,009
Lost a crampon !

57
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,810
Go ahead!

58
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:27,135
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.

59
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:34,180
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.

60
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,642
Rocks!

61
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,045
Look out below!

62
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,758
Hold me!

63
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,239
Have you got me?

64
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:44,217
Hold me!

65
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,412
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.

66
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:52,152
I should take a look at lt.
I could sew it up.

67
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,886
It's not your problem.

68
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,829
Actually, it is my problem.

69
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,025
- It's my life.
- What?

70
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,730
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...

71
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:12,772
I consider th at my problem.

72
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,934
No, you put your life at rlsk.
I saved it, so shut up !

73
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,205
Please, it is not your place--

74
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,871
Shut up !

75
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,345
The next time you lle
about an lnjury, Heinrich...

76
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,253
you're off the team.

77
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,388
Try it.

78
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:56,637
August 4th, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.

79
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,702
My teammates are nervous
about the avalanches...

80
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,248
so we 've been holed up for days.

81
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:06,548
Aufschnalter should take advantage of
this lowland weather to make high camp.

82
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,283
But he disagrees with me. Fool.

83
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,328
It seems the others don 't mind
sitting here waiting...

84
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,160
hoping, doing nothing.

85
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,965
So much time to question
one 's self is not good.

86
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,531
I am beginnlng to think
this whole expedition was a mistake.

87
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,061
Run ! Avalanche! Get out!

88
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,362
Leave everything!

89
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,084
Put that down !

90
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,049
We are going down now!

91
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,989
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.

92
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,391
I could summit on my own !
Always give the best man his shot!

93
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,953
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.

94
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,261
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...

95
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,267
and my final attack tomorrow!

96
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,304
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!

97
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,305
- I want th at peak!
- As a team! That's an order!

98
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:36,934
That is an order! An order!

99
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,737
Follow me!

100
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:45,103
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.

101
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,045
Take it. Si Hib.
.
It will protect you.

102
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:51,482
No, that means nothing to me.

103
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,180
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.

104
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,017
Si Hib, take it.

105
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,023
Good protection for you.

106
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,332
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

107
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,569
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...

108
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,838
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.

109
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,380
It might save you some prison time.

110
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,084
What is this? Who are you?

111
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:30,180
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?

112
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,724
I'm afraid not.

113
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:37,057
You see, war has been declared between
Hls Majesty's Government and Germany.

114
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,193
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.

115
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,914
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!

116
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,644
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian ! I'm a cllmber!

117
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:34,949
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!

118
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,055
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!

119
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,925
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!

120
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,766
Pigs! All of you, pigs!

121
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,186
October 15, 1939.

122
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,857
Reaching prison camp,
I make a promise to myself.

123
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:18,960
I will be lying beside lngrid before
the summer solstice of the new year.

124
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,392
The Hlmalayas are right in front of us.

125
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,439
It will be easy to escape
and get lost in them.

126
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,880
My fourth escape attempt
brings me no closer to my goal.

127
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:46,323
How far did you get this time?

128
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,329
All I have achieved is a certaln
dubious celebrity among the prisoners.

129
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,988
If only my hand could express
what is ln my heart.

130
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,771
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.

131
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:38,171
Yes.

132
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:40,713
Would you mail these?

133
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,683
Thank you.

134
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,118
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?

135
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,554
It was checked out to you.

136
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,765
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?

137
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,299
About this.

138
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,710
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?

139
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,803
After monsoon season. And you?

140
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:19,711
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.

141
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:23,722
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.

142
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,055
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?

143
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,290
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.

144
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,924
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.

145
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,833
Stop this embarrassing charade.

146
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:43,140
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.

147
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,475
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.

148
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:49,606
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.

149
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,225
The mailman has come.

150
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,624
Dear Heinrlch:

151
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,397
Please sign the enclosed dlvorce papers
and send them to my lawyer.

152
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,532
Horst and I intend to be married
as soon as the divorce is flnalized.

153
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,542
As for your letter, yes.

154
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,569
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born
while you were climbing the mountain.

155
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:58,584
He is now two years old
and calls Horst "papa. "

156
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,847
When he is old enough,
I will tell him...

157
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,549
his real father was lost
in the Himalayas.

158
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,682
It seems the kindest thing
to say consldering...

159
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,227
you never wanted the child anyway.

160
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,855
Needless to say,
I have no intention...

161
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,662
of "resolving our differences "
as you suggested.

162
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:18,192
They were resolved
the moment you left Austria.

163
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,434
I'm sorry you have been
imprisoned ln lndia...

164
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:25,706
and hope this dreadful war will soon
be over for everyone's sake.

165
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,371
Ingrid.

166
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,833
I'm coming with you.

167
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,079
This is your plan?

168
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:14,245
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.

169
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,187
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.

170
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,032
Open the charts. Turn around.

171
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,007
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!

172
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:27,521
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.

173
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,653
We are clear. Okay.

174
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,702
Open the gates!

175
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:56,947
See to this. Open the gates!

176
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,093
I'm going off on my own.

177
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,219
So, good luck.

178
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:17,701
First escape from prlson camp,
November 18, 1939.

179
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,898
Rolf Harrer--
three and a half months old.

180
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:27,270
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.

181
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:32,182
Rolf Harrer-- exactly one year,
11 months and 26 days.

182
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,022
Last escape from Dehra Dun.
Rolf Harrer--

183
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:10,504
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.

184
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,514
What are you doing here?

185
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:21,747
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.

186
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:28,159
What about the others?

187
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:30,855
The ltalians were caught
outside Nelang.

188
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,990
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.

189
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:39,027
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.

190
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:45,633
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?

191
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,645
Be my guest.

192
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,910
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.

193
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,304
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?

194
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:15,602
A ten-piece orchestra?

195
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:20,078
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...

196
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:24,173
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...

197
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,241
you may have dlfficulty
catchlng up with them.

198
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,947
I don 't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.

199
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,012
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.

200
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,152
- But I don't.
- Don't what?

201
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:39,158
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?

202
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:45,336
No particular reason.

203
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:47,201
When you get there, tell my wife...

204
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:51,300
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.

205
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:53,937
And I'm glad to be free of them both.

206
00:32:56,949 --> 00:33:01,181
I'm not golng back either,
not until this shameful war is over.

207
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:03,984
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.

208
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:08,652
Then on to China.
.
see if I can find some work there.

209
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,194
And you ?

210
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:15,724
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.

211
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,395
Tibet is 68.

212
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:22,635
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.

213
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,109
No, just full of food.

214
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,976
- Precisely.
- Mine.

215
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,308
That's too bad.

216
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,219
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.

217
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,484
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.

218
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,890
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...

219
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,155
I think I'm safer without you.

220
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,728
Of course.

221
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:57,405
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculatlon.

222
00:33:57,476 --> 00:34:00,673
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.

223
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,850
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?

224
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:12,690
All you've got is some stale crackers.

225
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,856
But I'm right. I'll win.

226
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,270
Tibet, the roof of the world.

227
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,468
It feels as though we have
ascended a medieval stone fortress...

228
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,376
towering above the center of Asla.

229
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:09,937
This ls the highest country on Earth.

230
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:11,950
And the most isolated.

231
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,484
There it is.

232
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:25,429
Tibet.

233
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,262
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.

234
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:33,935
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.

235
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:53,286
Yes.

236
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,328
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.

237
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:02,127
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?

238
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,569
Tibet.

239
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,876
- No foreigners allowed in Tlbet.
- Oh, please!

240
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,475
No foreigner!

241
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,544
Oh, please!

242
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:32,858
Yes. Thank you. Of course.

243
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,394
No translation needed.

244
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,257
Some people are glad to see us.

245
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:38,626
Don't let it get to your head.

246
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:42,827
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.

247
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,908
We need to find food.

248
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,953
It is the prophecy. It says here...

249
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:13,226
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.

250
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:17,065
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...

251
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:19,900
will be attacked by outside forces.

252
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:23,271
Unless we can guard our own country...

253
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,573
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.

254
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:30,411
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.

255
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:34,316
The Dalai Lama an d all
the revered holders of the faith...

256
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,911
will disappear and become nameless."

257
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,686
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to forelgners here?

258
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:44,855
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.

259
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,160
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our--

260
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,258
His Excellency, the Garpon.

261
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:59,303
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.

262
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,279
We wanted to apologize.

263
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:03,940
Apologize.

264
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,945
And give you this really special gift.

265
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,718
Please, from us.

266
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:18,058
Long live the Dalai Lama,
Hi s Holiness.

267
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,964
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to lndla!

268
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:38,849
Two days into Tibet 's western frontier
and we are graciously klcked out.

269
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,182
Our guides have strict orders
to escort us...

270
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,417
to the lndian border
some 40 kllometers away...

271
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:48,324
and to shoot us
if we attempt escape.

272
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,187
Must mean hello.

273
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:26,527
As long as they don't try to kiss me.

274
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:33,294
We have to stock up. I'm broke.

275
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,674
Don't look at me.

276
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:40,109
We have to eat. Peter.
.
Know what time it is?

277
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,846
It is not negotiable.

278
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,407
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount BI anc.

279
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,612
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.

280
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,882
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.

281
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,034
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.

282
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:39,627
Communlsm soldier come from Chin a.
Very nice.

283
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,674
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.

284
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,710
You like military uniforms, yes?

285
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:52,681
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?

286
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,116
Wait.

287
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,356
Give me these, for the guards.

288
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:06,898
Look!

289
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:15,132
Like this. You like?

290
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,310
Very good. They're tough.

291
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:23,144
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?

292
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,584
You must make this face.

293
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,130
Come! Yes.

294
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,793
Stop!

295
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,899
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.

296
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:53,438
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.

297
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,850
Stand like this.

298
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,067
Guess what?

299
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:53,534
All clear.

300
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:19,090
Know what time it is?

301
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:26,002
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...

302
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:28,631
I should foot the bill?

303
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,108
You are such a blg man
you don't need to contribute?

304
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,870
You have a problem?

305
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:36,380
Remind me...

306
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:40,610
what you said at the bazaar back there.

307
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:46,022
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."

308
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,193
You do not have one.

309
00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:54,562
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!

310
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,113
This is junk
from some ltalian prisoners.

311
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,581
I don't give a shit!

312
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,777
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?

313
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:16,343
What principle?

314
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:19,413
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.

315
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:21,982
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you !

316
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:26,589
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating !

317
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:29,566
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?

318
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:33,002
Try apologizing.

319
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:35,130
Try feeling a little remorse.

320
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:38,699
And if all else fail s,
try wiping that smirk off your face!

321
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,211
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!

322
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:46,746
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.

323
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:58,794
No wonder you are always alone.

324
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:02,061
No one can stand
your miserable company.

325
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:36,466
Please, take them.

326
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,876
It was wrong of me to hide them.

327
00:46:59,157 --> 00:47:01,489
- Keep this.
- No.

328
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:10,558
I didn't deserve It either.
Go ahead.

329
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:30,354
He'll be three and a half years old now.

330
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,127
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.

331
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:42,966
Which is fine.

332
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,495
Why?

333
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:52,702
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.

334
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:56,480
Write him a letter.

335
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:00,144
Let him know you're still alive.

336
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:11,258
New York.

337
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,393
Venice.

338
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:26,304
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?

339
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:28,471
It ls time for your lesson.

340
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:38,755
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.

341
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,451
Dear Rolf Harrer:

342
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:46,793
I'm a person you don 't know...

343
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:49,663
a man you 've never met.

344
00:48:49,734 --> 00:48:52,464
But you are someone
who occupies my mind...

345
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:54,437
and my heart...

346
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:56,599
in this dlstant land
where I have gone.

347
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:02,702
If you can imagine a hidden place
tucked safely away from the world...

348
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:06,182
concealed by walls
of high, snowcapped mountains--

349
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,846
a place rich with all the strange
beauty of your nighttime dreams--

350
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:13,457
then you know where I am.

351
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,395
In the country
where I am traveling, Tibet...

352
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:22,664
people believe if they walk
long distances to holy places...

353
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,567
It purifles the bad deeds
they've committed.

354
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,162
They believe
the more difficult the journey...

355
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,868
the greater the depth
of purification.

356
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:38,046
I've been walking from one faraway
place to the next for many years--

357
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:41,378
as long as you have lived.

358
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:46,081
I have seen seasons change
across the high plateaus.

359
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:49,388
I have seen wild kiangs
migrate south in winter...

360
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:52,396
and sweep back across the fields
when spring appears.

361
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,857
In this place,
where time stands still...

362
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,869
it seems that everything is moving...

363
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:01,703
including me.

364
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,078
I can 't say I know where I'm going...

365
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:10,171
nor whether my bad deeds
can be purified.

366
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:14,777
There are so many things
I have done which I regret.

367
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,687
But when I come to a full stop,
I hope you will understand...

368
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:23,387
that the distance between us
is not as great as it seems.

369
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,894
Wlth deep affection...

370
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:30,457
your father, Heinrlch Harrer.

371
00:50:31,436 --> 00:50:33,028
Get up.

372
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,606
My God!

373
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:51,219
I'll give you these.

374
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:14,008
Yellow head!

375
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,014
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!

376
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:18,515
We have no money!

377
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,483
Give me watch !

378
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:23,077
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you !

379
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,454
Wait!

380
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,095
Where are you headed?

381
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:45,398
I have permit.

382
00:52:56,848 --> 00:52:58,782
Lhasa. I have permit.

383
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,326
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.

384
00:53:54,372 --> 00:53:58,331
Only a month ago, we were certain
of death at the hands of bandits.

385
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:04,177
And today, we have reached the gates
of the forbidden city of Lhasa.

386
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:07,047
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...

387
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:11,885
and preclsely as attractive
because it ls closed to all foreigners.

388
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,725
Even in our miserable condition...

389
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,786
we feel the lure
of Tlbet 's holiest city...

390
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:21,263
home of the Dalai Lama.

391
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,035
Only a few foreigners
had penetrated its mysteries.

392
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,264
Oh, my God!

393
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:48,008
- Is It over?
- No. it is not over.
.

394
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,329
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.

395
00:56:33,531 --> 00:56:35,123
We'd like that very much.

396
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:39,599
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.

397
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:42,071
I am Peter.

398
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:48,741
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...

399
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:52,476
an audlence with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?

400
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,919
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.

401
00:57:01,993 --> 00:57:03,927
With respect, Rinpoche...

402
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,990
If your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...

403
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:13,470
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...

404
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:15,938
is not the most effective tactic.

405
00:57:18,209 --> 00:57:22,509
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.

406
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,344
Of course. Forgive me.

407
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,285
You may leave now.

408
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:34,848
Start translating the letter
as written .

409
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:37,486
Of course.

410
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:58,078
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?

411
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,051
We should respect them.

412
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,180
If we return them to lndla,
they'll surely go back to prison.

413
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:08,589
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.

414
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:12,493
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...

415
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:16,897
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.

416
00:58:16,968 --> 00:58:19,835
Invited them to stay at your place?

417
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:21,895
But why?

418
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:24,999
Must one have reason
to help those in need?

419
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:29,636
Beast.

420
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:36,419
I think she said you stink.

421
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:14,389
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.

422
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,393
I know who you are.

423
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:19,526
I am Pema Lhaki.

424
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:23,397
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.

425
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:29,767
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.

426
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:35,143
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.

427
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:37,681
Who is he to be so thoughtful?

428
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:40,216
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.

429
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,946
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.

430
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:46,046
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.

431
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:50,320
You're a seamstress?

432
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:54,455
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...

433
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:58,366
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.

434
01:00:01,072 --> 01:00:03,973
So, I pick?

435
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,509
Yes, choose whichever you like.

436
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:12,543
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.

437
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:16,386
- Very good.
- Did you make this?

438
01:00:16,454 --> 01:00:19,685
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

439
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:21,452
- Th ank you.
- Do you like this?

440
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:23,460
Whichever you like.

441
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:29,227
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.

442
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,963
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.

443
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:35,403
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

444
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:37,407
And you, sir?

445
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,707
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.

446
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,344
Please, sir, take off your chu-pa.
I would like to measure.

447
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:05,930
Stand still, please.

448
01:01:10,141 --> 01:01:12,075
Thls way, please.

449
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:18,548
- Stand still.
- Sorry.

450
01:01:27,525 --> 01:01:30,221
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.

451
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:42,134
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.

452
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:45,869
Still, walking up mountain s
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.

453
01:01:45,943 --> 01:01:48,309
Not so foolish, really.

454
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:54,373
Look at this.

455
01:01:56,854 --> 01:01:58,412
Go ahead.

456
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,357
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.

457
01:02:10,868 --> 01:02:16,272
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.

458
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,300
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.

459
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,142
You admire the man...

460
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:27,378
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...

461
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:30,818
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.

462
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,856
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.

463
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:55,837
Gentlemen.

464
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:01,743
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.

465
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,379
I am Ngawang Jigme.

466
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:11,518
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.

467
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:14,291
Thank you for your generous gift.

468
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:16,560
It's wonderful. Thank you.

469
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:23,399
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.

470
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:38,520
Perhaps you could help us explain...

471
01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:40,682
why the min isters...

472
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,558
demand that the Chinese government...

473
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:48,530
"...cease making generous
financlal contributions...

474
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,763
to Tibetan monasteries."

475
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:57,171
Do our gifts displease your government?

476
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:01,439
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.

477
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:03,844
I am only a mere secretary.

478
01:04:03,914 --> 01:04:08,408
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.

479
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,563
A man of such obvious talent
cannot be satisfied...

480
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,033
with just translating letters.

481
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:27,229
Your diplomatic skill...

482
01:04:27,304 --> 01:04:30,102
would be richly rewarded here.

483
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:37,007
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.

484
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,252
I ask permission to take my leave.

485
01:05:52,857 --> 01:05:55,553
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.

486
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,018
Yes, there's a--

487
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,327
Please, take a seat.

488
01:06:45,142 --> 01:06:47,576
Do you like these?
I'll buy them for you.

489
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,842
Thank you,
but I don't eat much meat.

490
01:06:50,915 --> 01:06:54,078
- Don't eat meat?
- He says they are knives from West.

491
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:56,517
You put them on your feet to cut meat.

492
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:02,582
They are ice skates.

493
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,128
You put them on your feet...

494
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:06,526
to skate...

495
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:09,259
to glide--
sort of dance on ice.

496
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,233
- Yeah.
- Why?

497
01:07:11,302 --> 01:07:14,931
- Why n ot?
- It's another fool's pleasure.

498
01:07:19,743 --> 01:07:22,143
Let's get them.
How mu--

499
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:29,745
No, for this?

500
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,412
Ten.

501
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:35,624
And for this?

502
01:07:35,693 --> 01:07:37,627
Did you see?

503
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,463
Did you see that?

504
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:55,306
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No, thank you. I'm okay.

505
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:58,940
Here we go. Up.

506
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:03,112
- You okay? Did you bang your head?
- No, I'm having fun.

507
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:05,519
- You must hold on.
- Watch me!

508
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,401
- Do not look too much at the ground.
- All right.

509
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,531
- Look only lnto my eyes.
- Yes, all right.

510
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:44,350
Can I help you?
Here, take my h and.

511
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:56,002
- Are you happy?
- Very happy.

512
01:09:19,797 --> 01:09:22,630
I try to picture you, Rolf...

513
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,396
and this is what I see:

514
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:28,700
a young boy who is strong
and bright...

515
01:09:30,107 --> 01:09:33,133
a boy filled with curioslty
about llfe...

516
01:09:35,145 --> 01:09:39,206
a boy who lsn't afraid
to learn from his mistakes.

517
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:03,529
Hello, married woman.

518
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:07,407
Hello. bachelor man.
.

519
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:14,814
Congratulations.

520
01:10:16,987 --> 01:10:20,320
Well. come in.
.

521
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:23,587
The Japanese army is facing
a growing challenge...

522
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,094
not from China 's unified front...

523
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:28,393
but from the powerful
Chinese Communist Army.

524
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,831
Under the control
of Mao Tse-tung--

525
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,632
The rumor is that
the Communists have taken over...

526
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:40,506
the whole of North and Central China.

527
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:42,477
Rumor? It's a fact.

528
01:10:42,546 --> 01:10:45,413
Ngawang keeps me up-to-date
on all China's war news.

529
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:02,157
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?

530
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:05,690
Frankly, I wouldn't know.
I moved out five months ago.

531
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:09,170
Really? Has it been this long
since we have seen you?

532
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:13,369
- Apparently it h as.
- And have you been busy?

533
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:16,503
This is why I'm extremely busy...

534
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,606
since I've been hired to survey
the entire clty of Lhasa.

535
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:25,945
Unfortunately, your place is too
far out for me to include it on my map.

536
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,657
We like our privacy.

537
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,891
Yes, apparently so.

538
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,067
What about women?
Have you met anyone you like?

539
01:11:40,637 --> 01:11:42,036
Women.

540
01:11:42,105 --> 01:11:45,336
Since I failed miserably
with an Austrlan wife...

541
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:48,071
an exotic failure with
a Tibetan wife seems misguided.

542
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:52,047
But to answer your question,
no, I haven't. You?

543
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:58,354
A friend's good fortune
is a blessing.

544
01:11:58,422 --> 01:12:00,356
I'm sorry you resent ours.

545
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:06,825
You must be very lonely and sad.

546
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:31,211
The war is over!

547
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:33,017
Have the Communists won?

548
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,025
Your war, my friend.
Germany has surrendered.

549
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:47,704
- Where are you going?
- Back home. Austria.

550
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:10,152
Mr. Harrer, letter.

551
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:18,060
We miss you .

552
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:21,903
I miss you.

553
01:13:39,056 --> 01:13:41,581
"Dear Mr. Helnrich Harrer:

554
01:13:41,658 --> 01:13:43,990
You are not my father.

555
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:47,622
Please stop writing me letters.

556
01:13:47,698 --> 01:13:49,757
Rolf lmmendorf."

557
01:14:18,562 --> 01:14:20,587
Honorable Harry Harrer?

558
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:28,064
- Yes?
- A letter for you.

559
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:32,539
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer
doesn't want any more letters.

560
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:36,705
It is from the Great Mother
of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

561
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,635
Thank you for comlng, Mr. Harrer.

562
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,738
Thank you for inviting me,
Great Mother.

563
01:15:21,358 --> 01:15:25,089
Do you know the rules
of protocol concerning my son?

564
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:32,093
Not exact-- I know one bows
and performs prostrations.

565
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,138
When you are in the presence
of His Holiness...

566
01:15:36,206 --> 01:15:38,504
you must always be standing...

567
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:42,511
bent in obeisance,
hands folded in supplication.

568
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:46,606
If seated, you must always
be seated lower than he.

569
01:15:46,683 --> 01:15:50,642
Never look him in the eye.
Never speak before he does.

570
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,780
Always refer to him
as "Your Holiness."

571
01:15:53,857 --> 01:15:57,884
Never turn your back to him.
And never. never touch him.
.

572
01:15:57,961 --> 01:16:01,397
He is the reincarnation
of Avalokiteshvara...

573
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:03,433
the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

574
01:16:05,035 --> 01:16:08,004
After his recognition,
he was renamed...

575
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:13,202
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang
Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso...

576
01:16:13,276 --> 01:16:18,009
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory,
Eloquent, Compassionate...

577
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:22,848
Learned Defender of the Faith ,
Ocean of Wisdom.

578
01:16:24,054 --> 01:16:27,990
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,
would like to meet you.

579
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:35,792
As his advisors have not permitted
a private audlence with you...

580
01:16:35,866 --> 01:16:41,327
His Holiness has asked me to bring you
along to my monthly audience.

581
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,514
I'd be honored and moved.

582
01:18:53,703 --> 01:18:54,897
Yellow head.

583
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:07,273
You have hair on your arms too?
And legs?

584
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,652
- How about you?
- Mr. Harrer.

585
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:26,933
It's an honor to meet you,
Your Holiness.

586
01:19:39,716 --> 01:19:41,274
Do you like movies?

587
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,147
You know, I haven't seen a movie
in about eight years.

588
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:49,817
- But as I recall, yes, very much.
- So do l.

589
01:19:49,893 --> 01:19:54,830
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I have a movie projector. And films.

590
01:19:54,898 --> 01:19:59,062
I want to build a movie house.
Here. at the Potala.
.

591
01:19:59,135 --> 01:20:02,502
- With seats and everything.
- Seats would be advisable.

592
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:04,403
Can you build it?

593
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:09,470
- Excuse me?
- Can you build a movie house for me?

594
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:13,346
My advisors cannot disapprove,
and you wIll be well paid.

595
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:16,613
And you will have to come here every day
to build it, every single day.

596
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:20,918
When you are here, you'll visit me. We
can have conversations on many toplcs.

597
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,652
I would like to learn
about the world you come from.

598
01:20:23,727 --> 01:20:27,493
For example, where is Paris, France?
And what's a Molotov cocktall?

599
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:29,327
And who i s Jack the Ripper?

600
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:32,658
You can tell me many things.

601
01:20:38,241 --> 01:20:41,074
I'm proud to be of servlce,
Your Holiness.

602
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:05,901
What is the problem?

603
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:09,566
Worms.

604
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:12,130
Please, no more hurtlng worms.

605
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,335
- Please.
- Worms?

606
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:19,474
In a past life, thls innocent worm
could have been your mother.

607
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:21,483
Please, no more h urting.

608
01:21:21,551 --> 01:21:24,486
It's impossible. Please, no more.

609
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:28,822
But you see, Tibetans believe...

610
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:32,384
all living creatures were
their mothers in a past life.

611
01:21:32,462 --> 01:21:36,865
So we must show them respect
and repay their kindness.

612
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:40,801
And never, never
harm anything that lives.

613
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:44,306
You can't ask a devout people
to disregard a precious teaching.

614
01:21:44,374 --> 01:21:46,308
Yes, but Your Holin ess...

615
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:52,543
with true respect,
we can't possibly--

616
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:57,681
I'm sorry, but we can't
possibly rescue all the worms...

617
01:21:57,754 --> 01:22:00,587
not if you want a theater
finished in this lifetime.

618
01:22:00,657 --> 01:22:03,922
You have a clever mind.
Think of a solution.

619
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:07,292
And in the meantime, you can
explaln to me what is an elevator.

620
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:43,927
Antarctica.
That's down below.

621
01:22:46,469 --> 01:22:47,401
Here.

622
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,864
Fantastic.

623
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,913
Englan d.

624
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:04,548
Don't look at me for h elp.

625
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,956
Here?

626
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:17,165
Shift.

627
01:23:19,402 --> 01:23:22,428
Oh, I know him.
Honk. Hello!

628
01:23:24,307 --> 01:23:25,331
Turn !

629
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,311
Brake!

630
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:05,379
The robe of a minister is so much finer
than your old brown robe, i sn't it?

631
01:24:06,616 --> 01:24:08,140
Please.

632
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:10,447
Everyone, please.

633
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,852
You must be very clever
to get such a good promotion.

634
01:24:14,023 --> 01:24:16,457
I did not intend to be
a secretary forever.

635
01:24:16,526 --> 01:24:18,892
Apparently so.

636
01:24:18,962 --> 01:24:21,692
Well , congratulations.

637
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:37,172
Evil omen !

638
01:24:43,486 --> 01:24:46,717
From his headquarters
in Peking...

639
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:49,917
the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung,
was triumphantly proclaimed leader...

640
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:52,018
of the new
People 's Republic of China.

641
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:58,924
Chairman Mao vowed that the first task
of the Communist regime...

642
01:24:59,002 --> 01:25:02,233
is to reunite
the Chinese motherland.

643
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:05,331
He declared that
the remote kingdom of Tibet...

644
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,434
Is an lntegral part
of the Chinese territory...

645
01:25:08,511 --> 01:25:10,536
and must join
the great new republic.

646
01:25:10,613 --> 01:25:13,081
"...and must join
the great n ew republic."

647
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:16,744
People's Republic of China
is advised...

648
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:21,984
the government of Tibet
recognizes no foreign sovereign.

649
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:24,549
We are an independent nation.

650
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:28,324
All the Chinese officials will be
expelled from the borders of Tibet.

651
01:25:29,265 --> 01:25:31,199
We wish you a happy return
to your h omeland.

652
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:35,067
Have a safe and pleasant journey
back to China.

653
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:39,234
May you have a safe and
pleasant journey back to China.

654
01:25:40,877 --> 01:25:44,574
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

655
01:25:44,647 --> 01:25:47,013
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

656
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,119
Let me see.

657
01:25:52,622 --> 01:25:58,424
You have a very long lifeline,
unlike others here.

658
01:26:57,286 --> 01:27:00,483
When we are faclng the light,
it's day, yes?

659
01:27:00,556 --> 01:27:03,116
When we are in shadow,
it's night.

660
01:27:03,192 --> 01:27:07,128
So if the sun is just rising
in Lhasa...

661
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,895
that means it is just setting...

662
01:27:10,967 --> 01:27:14,368
in New York City, perhaps.

663
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:17,873
That's why it can't be the same time
in every place.

664
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,876
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

665
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,774
Tell me more.

666
01:27:55,111 --> 01:27:57,375
What else do you want to know?

667
01:27:58,748 --> 01:28:02,844
In a few moments, you wIll be
entering the world of mass media.

668
01:28:02,919 --> 01:28:05,353
I can hear news
from all over the planet?

669
01:28:05,421 --> 01:28:08,254
I don't know if they have live
broadcasts from the Tonga lslands...

670
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:12,021
but generally speaking, yeah.

671
01:28:12,094 --> 01:28:14,892
Do you listen to news
from your country?

672
01:28:14,964 --> 01:28:18,991
From Austri a?
No, not really.

673
01:28:19,068 --> 01:28:21,036
Give me some light, Ku-Dun.

674
01:28:21,103 --> 01:28:24,766
- Why? It's your home.
- Not anymore It isn't.

675
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,469
But don't you have
friends and family there?

676
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:30,171
A few friends, no family.

677
01:28:31,881 --> 01:28:34,179
Keep the light steady,
Your Holiness.

678
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:38,615
Why? ls everyone dead?

679
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,491
Do you know there's another sentence
construction aside from the question?

680
01:28:47,463 --> 01:28:49,795
I was married,
but I'm divorced.

681
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,259
What did you do?

682
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:06,145
I didn't want a child,
so I ran away to climb a mountain.

683
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:08,479
You h ave a child?

684
01:29:10,586 --> 01:29:13,817
Although I've never seen hlm.

685
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:19,016
All right. Let me show you
how this thing works.

686
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:38,678
- Glve it all you've got.
- Yes, Mr. Harrer.

687
01:30:20,122 --> 01:30:21,555
Happy Christmas.

688
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,058
Thank you.

689
01:30:36,038 --> 01:30:38,734
- What is this special occasion?
- This is Chrlstmas.

690
01:30:39,575 --> 01:30:42,840
And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.

691
01:31:31,494 --> 01:31:33,428
"I found it in a shop
in the Barkhor.

692
01:31:34,296 --> 01:31:37,891
It has traveled a long way
and finally come back home.

693
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:41,425
Thank you for your friendshlp.
Heinrich. "

694
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:07,395
It is incredible.

695
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:12,367
Thank you for saving my life.

696
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:25,475
...must be liberated
from religlous oppressors.

697
01:32:25,548 --> 01:32:27,482
Tibetans must be reunited...

698
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,347
- with their brothers and sisters...
- Turn that off.

699
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:32,717
- of the great family of new China.
- I'm very sorry.

700
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:35,757
Foreigners control
Tibet's corrupt government.

701
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:40,228
Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated
from foreign imperialists.

702
01:32:40,296 --> 01:32:43,322
Tibet 's million serfs
must be freed.

703
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:46,493
How many foreigners
are there in Tibet?

704
01:32:46,569 --> 01:32:49,094
You, Heinrich.

705
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:50,832
Tibet will be liberated.

706
01:33:54,203 --> 01:33:57,263
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.

707
01:34:11,287 --> 01:34:16,486
They were destroying the village
I was born in, Takster in Amdo.

708
01:34:16,559 --> 01:34:18,891
It was terrible.

709
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:22,556
It was just a dream.
You had a bad dream. That's all.

710
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:26,567
But it was so real.
Where did it come from?

711
01:34:27,836 --> 01:34:31,897
My mind could never imagine
such terrible things.

712
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:19,652
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid the dream will come back.

713
01:35:22,391 --> 01:35:24,985
A couple of insomniacs.

714
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:29,488
Tell me a story.

715
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:34,732
Tell me a story
about cllmbing mountains.

716
01:35:34,803 --> 01:35:39,968
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.

717
01:35:40,042 --> 01:35:42,306
Then tell me
what you love about it.

718
01:35:42,378 --> 01:35:43,811
What--

719
01:35:47,082 --> 01:35:51,018
The absolute simplicity.
That's what I love.

720
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:55,748
When you're climbing,
your mind is clear...

721
01:35:55,824 --> 01:35:58,156
freed of all confusions.

722
01:35:58,227 --> 01:36:00,024
You have focus.

723
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:05,193
And suddenly
the light becomes sharper...

724
01:36:05,267 --> 01:36:07,895
sounds are rlcher...

725
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,530
and you are filled with...

726
01:36:10,606 --> 01:36:14,167
the deep, powerful presence of life.

727
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:23,144
I've only felt that way
one other time.

728
01:36:23,218 --> 01:36:25,049
When?

729
01:36:29,758 --> 01:36:31,817
In your presence, Ku-Dun.

730
01:36:34,296 --> 01:36:38,232
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

731
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,633
They have ransacked a village,
destroyed the monasteries...

732
01:36:41,704 --> 01:36:44,468
burnt scriptures
and defaced holy relics.

733
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,599
We've been told they've
even killed some monks--

734
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:49,906
- Which vill age?
- Takster in Amdo.

735
01:36:49,978 --> 01:36:53,004
It's where His Holiness was born.

736
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:05,459
Go ahead.

737
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:10,798
When you were defense minister
to the previous Dalai Lama...

738
01:37:10,866 --> 01:37:13,357
then you wanted to
reorganlze the army.

739
01:37:13,435 --> 01:37:15,369
Can you do it now?

740
01:37:15,437 --> 01:37:19,931
The People's Liberation Army
is one million troops strong.

741
01:37:20,008 --> 01:37:23,535
We have 8,000 men
with 50 pieces of artillery...

742
01:37:23,612 --> 01:37:26,103
and a few hundred mortars
and machine guns.

743
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:27,842
The task is hopeless.

744
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:30,407
Then you refuse
the appointment, do you?

745
01:37:33,155 --> 01:37:35,589
No. I accept it with honor.

746
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:39,488
You two gentlemen know about wars.

747
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:41,961
What type of weapon
do you recommend?

748
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:58,571
It seems the Chinese troops are
advancing toward our northern borders.

749
01:37:58,647 --> 01:38:01,172
Where's His Holiness?

750
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,275
The glory of
a British coronation.

751
01:38:03,352 --> 01:38:06,378
Nowhere in the world
is there anything half so wonderful.

752
01:38:06,455 --> 01:38:09,618
Only once or twice in the life of each
one of us comes such a day as this...

753
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:12,353
when we know that we are watchlng
history in the making...

754
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:16,296
when we know that generations to come
will look back on this day...

755
01:38:16,365 --> 01:38:19,562
for May 12, 1937, wIll be
one of the dates in hlstory...

756
01:38:19,635 --> 01:38:23,196
that schoolchildren will learn about
maybe a thousand years from now.

757
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,864
Every moment
the thrill of excitement--

758
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:29,468
Do you thlnk someday people will
look at Tibet on the movie screen...

759
01:38:29,545 --> 01:38:31,536
and wonder what happened to us?

760
01:38:31,613 --> 01:38:33,376
The coronation coach moves forward.

761
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:35,917
I don't know.

762
01:38:35,984 --> 01:38:38,077
Don't you have all the answers?

763
01:38:42,224 --> 01:38:44,192
I don't.

764
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,163
On the same field where Tibetans
traditionally gathered for picnics...

765
01:38:55,237 --> 01:38:57,205
ground was cleared
to build an alrstrip...

766
01:38:57,272 --> 01:39:00,764
so that the plane carrying
three Chinese generals could land.

767
01:39:00,843 --> 01:39:04,438
Nearby, the Tibetan army
practiced its maneuvers.

768
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:07,243
Some of the soldiers
wear ancient mesh armour.

769
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:10,752
They bring old muskets
and spears as artillery.

770
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:16,416
The spectacle of a peace-lovlng nation,
vainly attempting to create a mllitary.

771
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:19,655
The fears of war
on my friends ' faces...

772
01:39:19,728 --> 01:39:24,324
strike a deeply burled
personal chord.

773
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:27,095
Echoes of the aggressions
of my own country...

774
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:30,161
the will to overpower
weaker peoples...

775
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,333
bring shame to me.

776
01:39:33,408 --> 01:39:37,868
I shudder to recall how once long ago
I embraced the same beliefs...

777
01:39:37,946 --> 01:39:40,005
how at one time I was, in fact...

778
01:39:40,082 --> 01:39:44,314
no different from
these intolerant Chinese.

779
01:39:46,054 --> 01:39:48,545
The Tibetans say an enemy
is the greatest teacher...

780
01:39:48,624 --> 01:39:51,752
because only an enemy can help
develop patience and compassion.

781
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:55,728
They believe with rock-llke faith
that the power of their religion...

782
01:39:55,797 --> 01:39:58,357
will protect them
against these Chinese.

783
01:40:00,068 --> 01:40:02,195
In preparation for
the generals ' visit...

784
01:40:02,271 --> 01:40:05,365
sacred ceremonies are performed
throughout Lhasa.

785
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:10,639
Sculptures of deities have been carved
with great care in butter.

786
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:15,411
As the sun melts them, they become
a reminder that nothlng lasts.

787
01:40:28,797 --> 01:40:32,528
The rising star of the cabinet,
Minister Ngawang Jigme...

788
01:40:32,601 --> 01:40:35,195
made an offering of his own
to greet the Chinese generals...

789
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,261
and lead them through Lhasa.

790
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:43,344
Raising their flag is an honor
the Chinese don't deserve.

791
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:46,939
When you are not strong enough to fight,
you should embrace your enemy.

792
01:40:47,015 --> 01:40:50,212
With both arms around you,
he cannot point a gun at you.

793
01:40:50,285 --> 01:40:53,777
Nothing in politics
is a matter of honor, my friend.

794
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:03,784
History repeats itself,
even in paradise.

795
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:08,718
General, we shall have
our audience with His--

796
01:42:34,056 --> 01:42:38,516
General, the monks have been making
this mandala of sand for many days.

797
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:42,359
It is a symbol of
enlightenment and peace.

798
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:43,762
General !

799
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:59,774
We do not sit lower than he does.

800
01:42:59,848 --> 01:43:02,009
But, General,
It is our custom.

801
01:43:02,617 --> 01:43:04,551
I can sit down there.

802
01:43:21,436 --> 01:43:24,166
Your Holiness,
this is General Chang Jing Wu...

803
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:27,572
General Than Gua,
General Than Gua San.

804
01:43:27,642 --> 01:43:30,475
They wish to have
an audience with you.

805
01:43:31,913 --> 01:43:35,212
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

806
01:43:36,718 --> 01:43:41,417
They are promising regional autonomy
and religious freedom...

807
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:46,427
if Tibet accepts that China
be its political master.

808
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:54,362
Until I attain my majority, the
regent ls the political leader of Tibet.

809
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:56,870
You should have requested
an audlence with him...

810
01:43:56,938 --> 01:43:58,963
to discuss these important matters
of the world.

811
01:44:00,809 --> 01:44:04,245
My experience of such things
is limited.

812
01:44:05,814 --> 01:44:08,408
I am a simple Buddhist monk.

813
01:44:08,483 --> 01:44:13,113
All I know is the scripture
and the words of Lord Buddha.

814
01:44:13,188 --> 01:44:18,353
He sald, "All beings tremble
before danger and death.

815
01:44:18,426 --> 01:44:20,394
Life is dear to all.

816
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:25,399
When a man considers this,
he does not kill or cause to kill."

817
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:27,059
You must understand.

818
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:31,902
These words are ingrained
in the heart of every Tibetan.

819
01:44:31,973 --> 01:44:37,411
It ls why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.

820
01:44:39,014 --> 01:44:43,451
I pray you will see this is
our greatest strength...

821
01:44:43,518 --> 01:44:45,816
not our weakness.

822
01:44:46,888 --> 01:44:49,356
I thank you for your vislt.

823
01:44:52,194 --> 01:44:55,357
An offering
to the Enlightened Ones.

824
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:13,314
Rellgion is poison.

825
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:24,116
The Chinese have attacked
the Tlbetan frontier near Den-Go.

826
01:46:36,798 --> 01:46:40,962
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops
of the 1st and 2nd Field Armles...

827
01:46:41,036 --> 01:46:45,473
under the overall command
of General Chang Jing Wu...

828
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:49,169
attacked the Tibetan frontier
near Den-Go.

829
01:46:49,244 --> 01:46:53,203
The Tibetan army believes
an attack on Chamdo is imminent.

830
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:56,250
Ngawang Jigme,
our newly appointed governor...

831
01:46:56,318 --> 01:46:58,582
is preparing to send troops
toward the Chinese column...

832
01:46:58,653 --> 01:47:01,520
In order to stop
their progresslon. "

833
01:47:02,691 --> 01:47:06,422
As you know, Chamdo
is the gateway to Tibet.

834
01:47:06,494 --> 01:47:09,292
If Chamdo falls.
.
the whole of Tibet will fall.

835
01:47:09,364 --> 01:47:12,629
If I did not know that, I would not
have been appointed governor.

836
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:18,230
You do realize our troops are committed
to fighting the Chinese to the last man.

837
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:20,399
They would rather die than surrender.

838
01:47:22,243 --> 01:47:26,907
Rest assured. there will be no surrender
.
as long as I am in Chamdo.

839
01:50:49,951 --> 01:50:52,351
Radio Lh asa.

840
01:50:53,421 --> 01:50:55,582
Now.

841
01:50:55,657 --> 01:50:58,490
We request permission
to surrender.

842
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,495
- But there will be no surrender--
- I said, "Radio Lh asa."

843
01:51:01,563 --> 01:51:04,293
Permission to surrender now.

844
01:51:50,778 --> 01:51:54,407
We lost the war in 11 days,
Heinrich.

845
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:57,144
This surrender is
our death sentence.

846
01:51:58,486 --> 01:52:03,981
And I'm afraid our friend
Ngawang Jigme has issued it.

847
01:52:04,058 --> 01:52:09,428
He abandoned Chamdo and then
destroyed the ammunition dumps.

848
01:52:10,698 --> 01:52:13,997
Without weapons and ammunition...

849
01:52:14,068 --> 01:52:17,003
there was no hope for
the troops who wanted to fight.

850
01:52:18,339 --> 01:52:21,672
Our guerrillas could have held
the mountain passes for months...

851
01:52:22,577 --> 01:52:24,442
even years.

852
01:52:24,512 --> 01:52:29,506
It would have bought us time to make
appeals for help to other nations.

853
01:52:29,584 --> 01:52:31,950
Now it's lost.

854
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,215
They broke down the gates.

855
01:53:22,603 --> 01:53:24,696
Hello, my friend.

856
01:53:31,612 --> 01:53:33,546
We did what was the best
for our country...

857
01:53:34,649 --> 01:53:36,583
for Tibet.

858
01:53:37,819 --> 01:53:42,222
On the way to Lhasa, I would see
Tibetans wearing these jackets.

859
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:44,451
"Chinese soldiers.
Very nice.

860
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:49,053
Glve food, clothes, money.
Very nice."

861
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:52,759
It's strange to me that something
so harmless as a jacket...

862
01:53:52,834 --> 01:53:56,736
could symbolize
such a great lie.

863
01:54:01,242 --> 01:54:03,972
After all these years, you still
do not understand Tibetan ways.

864
01:54:05,213 --> 01:54:08,774
To return a gift is unforgivable.

865
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:15,255
A man who betrays his culture
should not preach about its customs.

866
01:54:22,096 --> 01:54:25,031
There was a time
I would have wished you dead...

867
01:54:25,099 --> 01:54:27,294
but your shame
will be your torture.

868
01:54:27,368 --> 01:54:30,804
And your torture
will be your life.

869
01:54:30,872 --> 01:54:33,204
I wish it to be long.

870
01:54:44,986 --> 01:54:47,784
We pray that His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama...

871
01:54:47,855 --> 01:54:51,757
will be granted the power
to unify his people.

872
01:54:51,826 --> 01:54:56,763
We humbly ask the Tibetan government
to honor our request...

873
01:54:56,831 --> 01:55:00,995
and let the Dalai Lama
attain his political majority.

874
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:58,525
You have the entire palace
in a panlc.

875
01:56:00,495 --> 01:56:03,225
I'm hiding from the world
for a day.

876
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,064
Kind of difficult
in a glasshouse, no?

877
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:17,140
It's The Moonlight...

878
01:56:17,211 --> 01:56:19,202
by Debussy.

879
01:56:21,983 --> 01:56:25,316
What else do you know
about this song?

880
01:58:03,584 --> 01:58:06,144
Him, him and him.

881
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,902
I hope you've received your invitation
to the enthronement ceremony.

882
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:24,232
Yes. Thank you.

883
01:58:24,305 --> 01:58:27,035
- It's next week.
- Th ank you.

884
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:43,681
Do I look like an egghead?

885
01:58:43,758 --> 01:58:45,953
No, they suit you.

886
01:58:48,329 --> 01:58:50,763
We have a saying in Tibet...

887
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:55,393
"If the problem can be solved,
there is no use worrying about it.

888
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:58,336
If it can't be solved.
.
worrying will do no good."

889
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:01,130
So stop worrying.

890
01:59:02,576 --> 01:59:07,070
You have to leave Tibet.
Your life's at great risk.

891
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:13,450
Forgive my presumption, but I made
arrangements to get you out safely.

892
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:17,184
We should leave after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it--

893
01:59:17,258 --> 01:59:22,491
How can I help people if I run away from
them? What kind of leader would I be?

894
01:59:24,365 --> 01:59:26,663
I have to stay here.

895
01:59:26,734 --> 01:59:29,100
Serving others
is my path to liberation .

896
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:42,972
- Then I don't go either.
- Why not?

897
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:46,213
Because you are my path
to liberation.

898
01:59:48,422 --> 01:59:53,587
The Buddha sald. "Salvation
.
does not come from the slght of me.

899
01:59:53,661 --> 01:59:57,290
It demands strenuous effort
and practice.

900
01:59:57,364 --> 02:00:02,199
So work hard and seek
your own salvation diligently."

901
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:07,037
I am not your son...

902
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:11,340
and I never thought of you
as my father.

903
02:00:12,513 --> 02:00:15,539
You were much too informal
with me for that.

904
02:00:26,727 --> 02:00:29,218
Do you ever think about him?

905
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:45,710
And wh at do you think about?

906
02:00:56,991 --> 02:01:00,893
It's not the conscious thought
really.

907
02:01:00,961 --> 02:01:03,395
It's just always there.

908
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:15,071
When I crossed Tibet,
he was with me.

909
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:17,474
When I came to Lhasa.
.
he was with me.

910
02:01:17,545 --> 02:01:19,809
When I sit beside you,
he's...

911
02:01:21,782 --> 02:01:23,773
there with me.

912
02:01:28,122 --> 02:01:32,252
I can't even imagine how I pictured
the world without him in it.

913
02:01:35,229 --> 02:01:38,426
Then you should go home
and be his father.

914
02:01:45,639 --> 02:01:47,470
I know.

915
02:01:49,343 --> 02:01:52,107
You have finished
your job with me.

916
02:01:55,082 --> 02:01:57,209
But you have to stay
for my enthronement.

917
02:01:57,284 --> 02:02:00,845
I want you to see me
in all my pomp and glory.

918
02:02:03,924 --> 02:02:06,051
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.

919
02:03:24,705 --> 02:03:26,866
From the government of Tibet...

920
02:03:26,941 --> 02:03:29,535
to Your Holin ess,
the fourteenth Dalai Lama...

921
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:31,544
we ask you to rule your people...

922
02:03:31,612 --> 02:03:36,379
as the spiritual and
temporal leader of Tibet.

923
02:03:42,022 --> 02:03:46,322
By your prayers and wishes,
I humbly accept.

924
02:04:41,982 --> 02:04:44,815
Butter tea.
It was never my cup of tea.

925
02:04:48,288 --> 02:04:52,384
- One was enough.
- Yes, we must follow the custom.

926
02:04:52,459 --> 02:04:57,260
A fresh cup of tea is poured
for the loved one departing.

927
02:05:02,136 --> 02:05:06,402
It sits untouched,
walting for hls return.

928
02:06:07,601 --> 02:06:11,833
May all travelers find happiness
wherever they go.

929
02:06:11,905 --> 02:06:17,104
Without any effort may they accomplish
whatever they set out to do.

930
02:06:17,177 --> 02:06:20,374
And having safely
returned to the shore...

931
02:06:20,447 --> 02:06:25,214
may they be joyfully reunited
with their relatives.

932
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:38,397
Mr. Harrer...

933
02:06:42,302 --> 02:06:43,735
from His Holiness.

934
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:19,155
- Hello, Horst.
- Hello, Heinrich.

935
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:22,964
Rolf, come out to meet him.

936
02:08:23,036 --> 02:08:25,971
No, I don't want to.

937
02:08:27,641 --> 02:08:29,074
May l?

938
02:10:08,842 --> 02:10:11,640
Rolf, take your time.

939
02:10:28,595 --> 02:10:30,620
Well done, son.

940
02:10:31,698 --> 02:10:33,131
Well done.
