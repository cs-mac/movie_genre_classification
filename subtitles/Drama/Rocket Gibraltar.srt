Looks like we're

Oh, I can't complain.

What? Luck?

27

No, luck hasn't changed.
In fact, this is true,

28
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,240
Last week
I caught a cold,

29
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,941
And I got some
of that new stuff

That opens up
your nasal passages

And while they were open,
I caught another cold.

Just seeing you

I thought you were
supposed to fill
this up yesterday.

Why do I always
have to take care
of everything?

46
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:15,622
Why?
Because it's
the summertime,

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,524
And I'm not even
supposed to be here.

Yes, but the ones I
read don't have comics.

Well, as we used to say
in good old London town,

If you can't teach

00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:22,631
Isn't my family great, Vinnie?

320
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,965
It's Tony.

321
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:26,201
My name's Tony.

323
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,769
I knew it ended with a "nie."

324
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:31,039
(Tony)
they're, um,
they're wonderful.

325
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,306
(aggie)
so, what's
your family like, Tony?

326
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:36,309
They're just
regular people.

327
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,045
Like us?

328
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,445
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,980
Except, you know,
different.

330
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,715
Like, they're crazy.

331
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,985
Like, they're crazy
in a different way, you know.

332
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,555
They talk different.

333
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,957
[phone rings]

334
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,626
You want to go into the barn
and fool around?

335
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,961
What about your father?

336
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:00,363
It's ok.

337
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:01,630
He's sittin'
right over here.

338
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:02,831
It's all right. Come on!

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,402
(Rolo)
you're his agent,
why don't you do something?

340
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,137
What'd you get grandpa
for his birthday?

341
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,305
Nothing.

342
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,406
What did you get him?

343
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:13,774
I made him
a birthday card,

344
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:17,210
Made out of ice cream sticks,
glued on with Elmer's.

345
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:18,844
Ice cream sticks?

346
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:22,681
Yeah. 4 of them,
so they form the number 77.

347
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,649
I didn't get
him anything.

348
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:25,951
I didn't get
him anything.

349
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,119
Not me.

350
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,287
Nobody did.

351
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,968
(Dawn)
go ahead, Flora,
it's your pick.

352
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,703
(Flora)
what am I gonna do
with this card?

353
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,071
(Kane)
what's the score, guys?

354
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:51,139
(Orson)
13-8.

355
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:52,240
Whose favor?

356
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,240
His.

357
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,344
(Max)
ok, it's my serve.

358
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,524
(Max)
hey, where's blue going?

359
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,292
(Dawn)
I don't know.
I'm gonna take a look.

360
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:25,033
(Max)
hey, Dawn!
Come on, you guys.

361
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,030
[screams]

362
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:03,866
There he is.

363
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:04,900
Cy?

364
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,272
Hey, that's quite a roll.
Are you ok?

365
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,373
Yes.

366
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,541
Attaboy.
Gramps?

367
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:13,607
Yeah?

368
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:16,277
What do you want
for your birthday?

369
00:24:16,344 --> 00:24:17,411
Peace on earth.

370
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,279
(Emily)
hmm?

371
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,946
Peace on earth, that's all.

372
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:22,282
(Kane)
peace on earth?

373
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,584
We mean, what would you
want for a present, grandpa?

374
00:24:25,652 --> 00:24:29,188
Oh, I don't want anything.
A man like me
doesn't need anything.

375
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:33,090
Don't need ties.
Don't wear ties anymore.

376
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:36,093
I don't need socks.
Hell, I got more socks
than I could ever wear,

377
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:37,760
Even if I never
did another washing.

378
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:43,266
There's one thing, though.

379
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:48,304
Vikings say,
"cattle die, kin die,
one day even you shall die.

380
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:51,839
The only thing
that never dies
is judgment of the dead."

381
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,310
That's it. A funeral.

382
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,345
A proper funeral.

383
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,046
A Viking funeral.

384
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:01,281
What's a Viking?

385
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,548
I don't know.

386
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:05,718
Minnesota Vikings.
They wear purple uniforms.

387
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:09,120
No, Max. We're not talking
about football players.

388
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:11,889
We're talking about
Scandinavian Vikings.

389
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:15,158
Norsemen. Seamen.
Great seamen.

390
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,493
Come on.

391
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,729
Let's sit down
and face the sea.

392
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:24,133
1,000 years ago,
500 years before Columbus,

393
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,402
They crossed the Atlantic.

394
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,305
They had great ships,
magnificent vessels
for their time.

395
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,541
You see,
the sea was their whole life.

396
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,544
The sea and their boats.
And in celebrating death...

397
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:40,313
Yes, you could say
celebrating,
they used them both.

398
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:42,382
The families
of the great Vikings

399
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,184
Took the body
of their loved one
and put it on a ship.

400
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,085
They covered it with straw.

401
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:50,456
And as the sun was setting,
they cast
the boat into the water.

402
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,757
They built huge bonfires
on the beach.

403
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,792
The priest blew
into a ram's horn.

404
00:25:56,662 --> 00:26:00,163
Then the men would light
the tips of their
arrows in the bonfires

405
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,998
And shoot them at the ship.

406
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,702
It must have
been so beautiful.

407
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,304
Fire on the water.

408
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,375
Legend has it
that if the color
of the setting sun

409
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:16,143
And the color
of the burning boat
are the same,

410
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,111
Then that Viking
has led a good life.

411
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,913
And in the afterlife
he will go to, uh...

412
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:21,214
Viking Heaven?

413
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:24,684
Yes, that's it. Exactly.
Something like that.

414
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:27,320
All night long,
the Viking men,
women, and children

415
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,521
Watched the burning
boat in the water.

416
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,725
When Dawn came,
only ashes were left.
Complete obliteration.

417
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,627
Carried by the currents
to the 4 corners of the earth.

418
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,896
Fresh. Beautiful.

419
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,731
Vanished completely.

420
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,367
Like a dream.

421
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:47,102
Kane, help me.

422
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,004
[groans]

423
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,645
Now, isn't that better
than being
buried in the earth?

424
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,146
Absolutely.
Yeah.

425
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,880
(Kane)
definitely the best way to go.

426
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:05,551
Buried in the earth,
the body decays.
It lies there dead, rotting

427
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:10,222
While slimy, starving worms
suck you to the very bone.

428
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,890
Not a pretty picture, is it?

429
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,694
(Emily)
no. We all like the Viking
funeral idea better.

430
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,795
I hate worms.

431
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:19,229

Go back to sleep, cy.

439
00:27:56,895 --> 00:27:58,529
I got one question.

440
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:00,297
What's the question?

441
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,333
<i>Can we give
the  Rocket Gibraltar
to grandpa</i>

442
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,768
For his
birthday present?

443
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:07,737
What are you talking about?

444
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:10,105
What is
the "Rocket Gibraltar"?

445
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:12,808
(Emily)
go back to bed, blue.

446
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:16,745
Go back to bed, blue.
You're waking everybody up.

447
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:19,146
We'll talk about
it in the morning.

448
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,305
I'll call you
tomorrow. Bye.

449
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,748
I'll see you
all tomorrow. Bye.

450
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:05,485
I'm telling you, Rose,
that girl has no shame.

451
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,287
Let's face it,
she's a tramp.

452
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,588
Do you really think so?

453
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:11,624
Do you remember
when dad caught her

454
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,659
In the barn with 4
basketball players?

455
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,493
I thought that was you.

456
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,334
(crow)
hey, where you
going, son?

457
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:26,102
(blue)
to get grandpa
his birthday present.

458
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,404
Hey, that's a good idea,
cy blue.

459
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:31,273
Hey, that reminds me,
I've got to get him
something.

460
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:32,708
What did you get him?

461
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:33,975
I don't know yet.

462
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:38,747
Dad, have you
seen blue?

463
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:42,082
Yeah, he's back there.
Said he's picking out
a present for your granddad.

464
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,218
Ok, so, I'm having dinner
with Charles Manson last night

465
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:48,888
And he says to me,
"Dwayne, is it hot in
here or am I crazy?"

466
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,023
See, that's a historical joke.
I'll let you know

467
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,091
When there's
a funny one coming.

00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,417
I like to catch them,
cook them, and eat them.

636
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,853
Our lunch.
You're gonna like this.

637
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:28,457
A couple of bay leaves.

638
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,060
A little salt.

639
00:40:36,798 --> 00:40:37,798
Stir.

640
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:43,336
(Jessica)
do you think
we'll have it ready in time?

641
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:44,870
(Kane)
we better.

642
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:50,308
(Dawn)
hey, guys, I saw something
we could use for a mast.

643
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,976
(Jessica)
it's about time.

644
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,310
(Max)
hooray.

645
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,846
Can I have the sand paper?

646
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,447
(Kane)
stop looking around
and get to work. Come on.

647
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:59,716
Can you give me
that pillow
over there? Please?

648
00:40:59,784 --> 00:41:00,784
Hey, Dawn.

649
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:06,522
Now, ain't that the best
food you ever tasted?

650
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,357
Yeah, it's real good.

651
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:11,993
Man is smarter than fish.

652
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,895
Man eats fish,
fish don't eat man.

653
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,162
[mumbles]

654
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,665
What are you saying?
Except for the what?

655
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,066
<i>Shark in  jaws.</i>

656
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:24,069
<i>Shark in  jaws?  Ha, ha.
Well, you got me there.</i>

657
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:27,373
<i>The shark in  jaws
is the exception
that proves the rule.</i>

658
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,415
There's plenty more, you know.
Do you want another one?

659
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:42,852
Eat some more.

660
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:57,532
[screaming]

661
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:01,367
Ok, come on.
Let's go in.

662
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,236
No, I don't want
to go in tide pools.

663
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,137
We'll play frisbee,
then. Come on.

664
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:08,140
I don't want
to play frisbee.
Oh, Ro.

665
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:09,775
Crow,
you want to play frisbee?

666
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:11,409
No, I'm gonna
go jogging.

667
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:13,411
It will get your
mind off baseball.

668
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:15,479
No, I never throw
anything plastic.

669
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:17,581
[all chattering]

670
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:20,784
Oh!

671
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:28,223
[panting]

672
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,792
You know, this must be
one of the best
books ever written.

673
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,060
Something you wrote?

674
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,563
Unfortunately not.
Have you ever read it?

675
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,665
No. I faint at
the sight of blood.

676
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:39,700
You know, Billi, you really
ought to get some sun.

677
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,801
I don't like the sun.

678
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:43,335
Then why come to the beach?

679
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,872
I like the beach,
I just don't like the sun.

680
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,406
Oh.

681
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:50,475
Right. Well,
that explains everything.
Where is everyone?

682
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:51,810
They're playing frisbee.

683
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,144
Oh, I detest frisbee.

684
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:55,646
If anyone wants to know,
I'm going to play golf.

685
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,281
Oh, that's nice.

686
00:42:57,348 --> 00:43:00,249
Yeah, if I could just avoid
these damn sand
traps everywhere.

687
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:06,288
Hey, guys, I got the sail!

688
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,124
All right!

689
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:11,093
Help me unfold it.

690
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,827
(Jessica)
hey, where'd you
find those?

691
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:14,428
(Kane)
all right. You guys
put yours down.

692
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:15,997
(Max)
great job, guys.

693
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:17,632
Where'd you find it?

694
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,165
Put it in the boat.

695
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:20,734
It was just down
there a little ways.

696
00:43:20,802 --> 00:43:22,135
Somebody
untangle that rope.

697
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:25,237
Ok, you ready?
Keep it upwards.

698
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:26,706
(Emily)
down, don't you mean?

699
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,107
Down. Well, I meant...

700
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,542
(Dawn)
got it?

701
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:31,843
Ok, it's going in.

702
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:32,978
(Kane)
watch it.

703
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,413
And in!

704
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,581
(Emily)
all right!

705
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:40,084
Ok. Come on.
Let's help them with this.

706
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,853
(blue)
Kane, can I paint it, too?

707
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,554
(Kane)
yeah. Sure.
There's an extra brush.

708
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:47,624
You're good.

709
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:54,997
I'm having
so much fun at this job.

710
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:58,332
I'm so glad I was nominated
to supervise the operation.

(all)
heave ho!

712
00:44:01,302 --> 00:44:04,671
Heave, heave, heave, heave.

713
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,273
(Kane)
I'll help Orson.

714
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:09,008
(Orson)
we're really doing it!

Grandpa?

00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,148
Blue? Blue,
where are you going?

720
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:57,848
(Jessica)
what's the little turd
up to now?

721
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:00,117
He's just weird.

722
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:02,319
Blue's got this thing.
He's psychotic.

723
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,586
Definitely.

724
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:06,489
No, I mean he's psychic.
He knows stuff.

725
00:45:07,158 --> 00:45:08,324
Blue?

726
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:09,258
Blue?

727
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:11,593
Blue?

728
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,262
Where are you going?

00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:22,035
Blue.

00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:23,837
Blue, what are you doing?

731
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:26,907
It's grandpa, Dawn.
Something happened
to grandpa.

732
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,977
Grandpa?

733
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:36,114
Grandpa?

734
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,016
He's not up there, Dawn.

735
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:42,552
Grandpa?

736
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:44,755
Gramps?

737
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,291
Gramps.

738
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,327
Grandpa? Oh, grandpa!

739
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:54,896
Oh, my God.
Grandpa? Grandpa?

740
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:58,200
Dawn, what are
we gonna do?

741
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:00,835
The most important
thing is not to panic.

742
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:03,337
Yeah, that's it.
Don't panic.
Understand?

743
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:04,839
Yeah, don't panic.

744
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:07,807
Right, now,
I saw something like this
in health class.

745
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,576
The most important
thing is not to panic.

746
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,077
I'm not panicking.

747
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,546
Ok. Now,
help me roll
grandpa over.

748
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:27,791
Run into the kitchen
and get me a glass of water.

749
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:30,926
And call Dr. B.
His number's up
next to the fridge.

Dr. B. Wasn't there,
but I talked to some lady.

00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:18,433
She said
she would tell him.

753
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,467
What the hell
am I doing here?

754
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:22,270
You fainted, grandpa.

755
00:47:22,337 --> 00:47:23,938
Yeah, you fainted.

756
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:26,306
Help me.

757
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:37,949
Hi, grandpa.

758
00:47:38,017 --> 00:47:39,417
(Kane)
hi, gramps.

759
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,719
So what was the big hurry, cy?

760
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:43,887
I had to go to the bathroom.

761
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:46,256
You could have
peed in the field.

762
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,758
But I wanted
to use the bathroom.

763
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,293
(Max)
what's going on?

764
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,328
Yeah, what is going on?

765
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:54,697
Come on,
you guys,
leave him alone.

766
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:58,834
We'll tell
you later.

767
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:02,069
Yes. Yes, that's right.
We ordered the large tent.

768
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:04,404
Uh-huh.

769
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:07,808
Ok. Now, I think
the blue-and-white
striped one is fine.

770
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,843
Just a minute.
Let me ask my brother.

771
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,610
Rolo?
What?

772
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:14,247
Should we get the striped tent
or the polka dot?

773
00:48:14,314 --> 00:48:15,948
The polka dot.

774
00:48:16,015 --> 00:48:17,850
The striped one
is fine.

775
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:21,018
Ok. Tomorrow morning.

776
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,186

hi, everyone!

777

Hi, Dr. B.

778
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:25,422
Great. Bye.

779
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,123
Can I
fix you a drink?

780
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,491
Oh, no!

781
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,893
Oh, no, no.
No thanks, rosy,

782
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:30,961
That's
very kind of you,

783
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:32,928
But, uh,
I've had enough already.

784
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,331
Everywhere I go today,
everybody's having a party

785
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:38,133
And they keep offering me
liquid refreshments.

786
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:39,901
It's too hot a day
to say no.

Where's the old geezer?

788
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:44,239
He's up in his room
resting, doc.

789
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:47,207
Sure you won't
have a little martini?

790
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:49,343
Well,
maybe on my way out, Rosey.

791
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:51,710
Keep it chilled.

Well, if this doesn't work,

She said...

She said that...

Now, you remember
how young she was.

She was...

"hank, I am
going to marry Levi...

that I'm marrying Levi."

Confused me no end.

867
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,174
And then she said,

"the reason
I'm marrying Levi

how's that arm of yours?
I read about it in the paper.

911

The arm's all right,
it's the damn shoulder.

912

many times before.

955
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:19,103
But maybe these little bums
will find this funny.

956
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,071
I'm talking about the 1950s.
A long time ago.

957
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:25,074
30 years ago,
when I was a blacklisted
teacher and writer

958
00:55:25,142 --> 00:55:26,975
Trying to feed
my growing family,

959
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:28,643
I, believe it or not,
turned to comedy.

960
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,012
Yeah.

961
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,513
In the dark days
of McCarthyism,

962
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,247
The cold war,
and I like Ike,

963
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:35,416
When you were just
little boys and girls,

964
00:55:35,483 --> 00:55:36,784
Just like them,

965
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:37,984
I became a comic.

966
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:39,419
Yeah.
Any requests?

967
00:55:39,486 --> 00:55:40,453
Garden of Eden.
No.

968
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,554
Garden of Eden.

969
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:43,523
Now, that was
a long time ago.

970
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,657
I remember all the trouble
in the garden of Eden.

971
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:48,627
The trouble that started
when Eve bit into
that piece of fruit.

972
00:55:48,694 --> 00:55:50,795
I had the same problem myself,
down in Mexico.

973
00:55:50,862 --> 00:55:52,463
[all laughing]

974
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:54,532
But there's something
that always bothered me.

975
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:55,733
You take Adam and Eve.

976
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:57,700
I mean, Adam was
an incredibly handsome man.

977
00:55:57,768 --> 00:56:00,270
And Eve was an indescribably
beautiful woman.

978
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:02,172
So where did all
you ugly people
come from?

979
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,372
Hey, hey, hey.

980
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,907
Now, now, now.
I'm a peaceful man.

981
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:05,975
How peaceful are you,
Levi?

982
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:07,609
I'm so peaceful
I'm not even antibiotic.

983
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:10,745
But, seriously, folks.
Seriously, folks.

984
00:56:10,813 --> 00:56:13,014
I know a girl who
was pure, really pure.

985
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,316
(Rolo)
how pure was she, dad?

986
00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:15,916
She was so pure,
she was considered

987
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:17,418
A fanatic in
the virgin islands.

988
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:18,618
Was she dull?

989
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:20,687
Ho, ho, ho,
was she dull?

990
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:23,622
She had to go topless
just to be a wallflower.

991
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:24,924
Come on, let's go.

992
00:56:24,992 --> 00:56:27,625
(Levi)
let me tell you something
else about this lady.

993
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:29,027
Where are you guys going?

994
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,562
You'll see.

995
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,364
I guess they
don't like comedy.

996
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,165
More. More. More.

997
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,867
All right,
this girl's
got a sister,

998
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,169
And the sister
is not pure.

999
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:39,270
Has this girl
been around?

1000
00:56:39,337 --> 00:56:40,636
Has she been around?

1001
00:56:40,704 --> 00:56:43,806
She knows 6 house detectives
by their first knock.

1002
00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:47,009
She's crossed more state lines
than a greyhound bus.

1003
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:49,511
You see,
she wants to love everybody.

1004
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:52,713
Problem is,
that she does it
to one person at a time.

1005
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:56,317
Women are getting bigger.
Women are getting bigger.

1006
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:58,452
But if you don't think
women are getting bigger,

1007
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,920
When was the last time
you heard of one
of them drowning?

1008
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:02,956
[all laughing]

1009
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:05,657
Hey, dad,
what about
water pollution?

1010
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:07,793
Oh, yes, water pollution.
Well, water pollution.

1011
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,661
Let me tell you
how bad water pollution is.

1012
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:11,662
Half the scuba equipment
that's being sold

1013
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,830
Is being sold
to the fishes.

1014
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:14,599
[all laughing]

1015
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:17,034
Is your wife Irish?

1016
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:19,769
Is my wife Irish?
I don't know if she's Irish.
I think she's Irish.

1017
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:22,505
Every time I eat her cooking,
I turn green.

1018
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,374
Now, I don't want
to say she's getting fat,

1019
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,842
But this morning,
we had to let out the sofa.

1020
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,577
Ah, the 4th of July.
Now, there's
an interesting holiday.

1021
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:32,314
You try explaining
to your kids that
they can't buy fire crackers

1022
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,016
While the government's
buying h-bombs.

1023
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,682
[all exclaiming]

1024
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,118
Whoo!

1025
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:45,591
This next tune's going out
to Levi Rockwell

1026
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:48,693
Celebrating his 77th
birthday in Sagaponack.

Kane, look at crow.

Look at crow...

1056
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,169
He's got
his curveball back.

Where?

1058

He was there just
a minute ago.

Honest.

1060

He got his curveball back.
I'm not kidding.

Yeah,

Between what's a dream
and what's real.

We've got
a trailer hitch on our van.

1118

Yeah, there's an old boat

(Dawn)
I'm going back to bed.

1122
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:34,633

01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:36,301
Ah, crow, you old boy,

1124
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,637
I got something
for you, buddy boy.
Here.

1125
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:41,773
It's just
what I need.

1126
01:04:41,841 --> 01:04:43,608
I think

Nobody ever

It's like

Yeah,

Yeah, I mean,

Worms.

Really icky worms.
They ate up grandma.

But--

But what if
he doesn't want
to be buried there?

1183
01:07:28,013 --> 01:07:30,114
This is our
family plot, Orson.

1184
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:31,916
One day we'll all
be buried here.

anything. I hate them.

Max, you said that already.
But what are we gonna do?

01:29:23,764 --> 01:29:25,130
(Kane and Dawn)
yeah.

1583
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:26,332
Let's go.

1584
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:27,766
(Dawn)
ok. Come on. Ready?

1585
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:32,370
[police siren wailing]

1586
01:29:33,305 --> 01:29:35,340
[all grunting]

1587
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:37,006
(Orson)
come on, guys.
We can do it.

1588
01:29:37,074 --> 01:29:38,308
(Kane)
push.

1589
01:29:42,846 --> 01:29:44,347
Ok, stop.

1590
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:56,122
I told you,
I left my registration
in my pocketbook.

1591
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,524
You're supposed
to have--

1592
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:58,525
Officer,
we're--

1593
01:29:58,593 --> 01:29:59,660
I wasn't
talking to you.

1594
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:00,761
Good afternoon.

1595
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,062
I suggest you all
get back in your cars.

1596
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:05,030
Officer,
I can explain everything.

1597
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:07,999
We were in the middle
of a birthday party
when we discovered...

1598
01:30:12,171 --> 01:30:14,638
(blue)
come on, Kane,
get it all around.

1599
01:30:15,974 --> 01:30:18,075
(Max)
when can we light the fire?

1600
01:30:18,142 --> 01:30:19,510
Well, when can we?

1601
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:21,210
Soon.

1602
01:30:21,945 --> 01:30:23,312
Come on.

1603
01:30:24,715 --> 01:30:25,814
Faster.

1604
01:30:26,516 --> 01:30:27,649
Let's go.

1605
01:30:29,051 --> 01:30:30,486
Now can we light
the bonfire?

1606
01:30:30,553 --> 01:30:31,854
(all)
yeah.

1607
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:34,054
(Kane)
no, we have to get
the boat in the water.

1608
01:30:34,122 --> 01:30:35,890
[police siren wailing]

1609
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,159
[tires screeching]

1610
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,463
(Dawn)
oh, come on.

1611
01:30:44,531 --> 01:30:46,632
We almost got it.
Come on.

1612
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,966
(Kane)
we're almost there.

1613
01:30:50,069 --> 01:30:51,569
[all grunting]

1614
01:30:53,171 --> 01:30:54,472
Ok, let's light
the bonfire.

1615
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:58,609
(Rose)
where should we go now?

1616
01:31:00,011 --> 01:31:01,912
(Ruby)
we'll look from the dunes.

1617
01:31:14,023 --> 01:31:15,656
(Flora)
who's going to
shoot the arrow?

1618
01:31:15,724 --> 01:31:16,724
(Kane)
Orson and me.

1619
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:17,725
(Jessica)
oh, come on!

1620
01:31:17,793 --> 01:31:18,659
Sorry.

1621
01:31:22,663 --> 01:31:24,163
[tires screeching]

1622
01:31:27,234 --> 01:31:29,301
(Kane)
get this in the water.
Come on.

1623
01:31:45,349 --> 01:31:47,716
There they are. That's them.

1624
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:48,884
What the hell
are they doing?

1625
01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:51,954
(Ruby)
there's a weird little boat.

1626
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:54,689
Do you see dad?

1627
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:57,459
Oh, no.
My God!

1628
01:31:57,526 --> 01:31:58,358
What?

1629
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,226
Come on, guys!

1630
01:32:19,277 --> 01:32:20,210
Kane!

1631
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,013
Let's go!
Get the arrows, quick!

1632
01:32:33,255 --> 01:32:34,957
(Dawn)
come on, Kane. You can do it!

1633
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:44,397
[all yelling]

1634
01:32:46,734 --> 01:32:48,066
(aggie)
stop!

1635
01:32:48,134 --> 01:32:49,434
(Jessica)
quick, come on!

1636
01:32:49,503 --> 01:32:50,369
Kane!

1637
01:32:55,908 --> 01:32:57,008
(Rose)
no!

1638
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:06,616
[cheering]

1639
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:15,790
[all cheering]

1640
01:34:20,011 --> 01:34:23,480
<i>(Levi)
their whole life was the sea,
the sea and their boats.</i>

1641
01:34:23,548 --> 01:34:25,716
<i>And so, in celebrating death,</i>

1642
01:34:25,784 --> 01:34:27,450
<i>Yes, you could say
celebrating,</i>

1643
01:34:28,351 --> 01:34:29,752
<i>They used both.</i>

1644
01:34:31,488 --> 01:34:33,789
<i>The families of
the Vikings would put the body</i>

1645
01:34:33,856 --> 01:34:35,390
<i>Of their
loved one on the ship,</i>

1646
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:37,258
<i>Cover it with straw,</i>

1647
01:34:37,326 --> 01:34:40,695
<i>And then as
the sun was setting,
cast it away into the water.</i>

1648
01:34:40,762 --> 01:34:43,931
<i>They would light huge bonfires
on the beach,</i>

1649
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:47,166
<i>Then the Vikings would light
the tips of their
arrows in the bonfire</i>

1650
01:34:47,234 --> 01:34:49,803
<i>And shoot them at the ship.</i>

1651
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:52,237
<i>Oh, it must have
been so beautiful.</i>

1652
01:34:52,305 --> 01:34:55,140
<i>Fire on the water.</i>

1653
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:58,009
<i>Legend has it
that if the color
of the setting sun</i>

1654
01:34:58,077 --> 01:35:00,912
<i>And the color of
the burning ship
were the same,</i>

1655
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:04,447
<i>Then that Viking
had led a good life,
and in the afterlife</i>

1656
01:35:04,515 --> 01:35:06,549
<i>He would go to Viking Heaven.</i>

1657
01:35:07,384 --> 01:35:09,752
<i>Yes.</i>

1658
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:12,321
<i>All night long,
the Viking men,
women, and children</i>

1659
01:35:12,388 --> 01:35:15,657
<i>Watched the ship with the body
that burned on the water.</i>

1660
01:35:15,725 --> 01:35:18,526
<i>By Dawn,
all that was left was ashes.</i>

1661
01:35:18,594 --> 01:35:20,394
<i>Complete obliteration.</i>

1662
01:35:20,462 --> 01:35:23,764
<i>Carried by the currents
to the 4 corners of the earth.</i>

<i>Fresh and beautiful.</i>

01:35:27,835 --> 01:35:29,435
<i>Vanished completely.</i>

1665
01:35:30,704 --> 01:35:32,005
<i>Like a dream.</i>
