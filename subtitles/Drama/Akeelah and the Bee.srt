Holy cannoli!

781
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,555
Right off the bat,
Akeelah uses all her letters,

782
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:46,727
getting 50 extra points
for a whopping 82.

783
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,646
What will Dylan do?

784
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,357
He's fighting the clock.

785
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,485
You could cut the tension
with a butter knife.

786
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:56,653
Shut up!

787
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:09,708
Shazam! Dylan gets his own bingo
for 76 points.

788
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:18,842
[Javier] It's come down to this.

789
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:23,055
After having crushed all five opponents,
Dylan has only Akeelah to beat.

790
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:26,642
But she's ahead by 21,
and has only a few letters left.

791
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,852
Is this an upset in the making?

792
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,896
What kind of birthday party is this?

793
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,732
[laughing]

794
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:40,197
[punches clock]

795
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,618
Yowza! Using the triple-word score,
Dylan charges ahead by six.

796
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,335
Just go.

797
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,303
[crowd] Whoa...

798
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:07,266
Yeah! Akeelah's in the lead by 12 points,
and has only one letter left.

799
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,726
But this could be Dylan's final play.

800
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:18,360
[snorts]
<i>Arrividerci,</i> sweetheart.

801
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:24,324
12 points decides the game.

802
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:26,493
But Dylan gets Akeelah's last two points.

803
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:29,788
He wins.
A heartbreaker.

804
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,417
Wow, Akeelah.

805
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,878
No one ever gets
that close to beating Dylan.

806
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,212
But I didn't beat him.

807
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:41,842
Girl, you passed up
the mall to play Scrabble?

808
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,473
[Dylan] She just got lucky.

809
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:51,560
[Mr. Chiu] If you can barely beat
a little black girl at a silly board game,

810
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,729
how do you expect
to win the National Bee?

811
00:46:56,106 --> 00:47:00,736
Listen! We're not coming in second
again this year.

812
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,614
We're gonna win.

813
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:05,866
Let's go.

814
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:11,580
[Akeelah] <i>"He began to have a dim feeling</i>

815
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,999
that to attain
his place in the world,

816
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,877
he must be himself
and not another."

817
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,880
[sighs] Dr. Larabee,
this book is too heavy.

818
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,382
Good. It'll develop your arm muscles.

819
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,551
I thought we were developing
my vocabulary.

820
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:26,386
We are.
Please continue reading.

821
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,722
But I already know most of the words
in this speech.

822
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:33,018
It's not a speech, it's an essay
by W.E.B. Dubois,

823
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,104
the first black man to receive
a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

824
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:38,315
Maybe we should be studying
more big words.

825
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,150
Spell "cabalistic."

826
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:44,780
C-A-B-A-L-I-S-T-I-C.
"Cabalistic."

827
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,573
And when did you learn that one?

828
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,784
About two minutes ago on this book.

829
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,787
But in the time it took
to learn that one word,

830
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,497
Dylan probably learned 20.

831
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,416
And those 20 words won't mean
anything to him.

832
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,379
He's just a little robot,
memorizing lists of words.

833
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:03,632
The people we're studying...
Dubois, Dr. King, JFK...

834
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:07,427
these people used words
to change the world.

835
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:13,141
And they didn't acquire their vocabulary
by rote memorization.

836
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,435
Okay.

837
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:16,812
But when I'm at the bee,

838
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,649
and they tell me to spell
some little fish from Australia

839
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:22,568
or some weird bacteria
on the Moon,

840
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:26,071
we're gonna wish we'd done
a little bit more rote memorizing

841
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,031
and not so much essay reading...

842
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,577
if you don't mind me saying.

843
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,623
Bacteria don't exist on the Moon.

844
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:39,126
Let me ask you something.

845
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,545
Where do you think
big words come from?

846
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,755
People with big brains?

847
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,881
[chuckles]

848
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:47,759
All right.

849
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,137
What do you see?

850
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,097
A bunch of big words I don't know.

851
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,890
Ah. Look again.

852
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:58,228
What kind of power
do we get from the sun?

853
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:01,607
- Solar.
- So, what does "sol" mean?

854
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,860
- Sun.
- What does "terraneous" sound like?

855
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,903
- Terrain.
- Meaning the earth.

856
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,405
"Soliterraneous" means...

857
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:12,284
The sun and the earth
working together.

858
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,286
So where do big words come from?

859
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,621
Little words.

860
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:17,414
And how many little words
do you know?

861
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,124
- Tons.
- Yes!

862
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,460
And there are tons more
for you to learn.

863
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,712
There are Greek ones.

864
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,173
There are Latin ones.

865
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:27,883
French ones.

866
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,927
And if you learn them all,

867
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:34,014
you can spell any word,
no matter how big.

868
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:39,895
Maybe we should
get back to the essay reading.

869
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,355
What's the matter?

870
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:44,691
I thought you wanted to win
the National Spelling Bee.

871
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:48,403
Maybe just getting there
this time is good enough.

872
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:51,323
Don't give me that.

873
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:55,994
You want to win it so badly,
it keeps you up at night.

874
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:58,163
Ever since you found out
there was such a thing

875
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,706
as the National Spelling Bee,

876
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,000
you've seen yourself
holding up that trophy.

877
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:05,337
But if you can't say it,
you can't win it, so say it.

878
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,381
- I wanna win.
- Say it louder, please.

879
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,424
- I wanna win.
- You wanna win what?

880
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:12,219
I wanna win the National Spelling Bee!

881
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:15,722
Good. Good.

882
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:18,350
You'll win using my methods,

883
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,395
by first understanding
the power of language,

884
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,355
then by deconstructing it,

885
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:26,650
breaking it down
to its origins, to its roots.

886
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:30,112
You'll consume it.
You will own it.

887
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,738
And then you know
what you'll be?

888
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:33,990
Mm-hmm. Tired.

889
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,243
You'll be a champion.

890
