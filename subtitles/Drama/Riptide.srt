1
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,521
Annie Freelinghouser.
Did your lordship reply to this ?

2
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:29,305
I did.
Accepting ?

3
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,598
Accepting.

4
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,502
Have you ever seen anything like this in your life ?

5
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:37,422
I'm afraid not, milord.
It's ridiculous.

6
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:41,278
What is it, you suppose ?
It said Insect Man on the box.

7
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:44,457
Insect Man !
This is an amazing country, Ransome.

8
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:49,899
Hello.
How am I going to smoke with this thing ?
What am I going to do about drinking ?

9
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,230
It doesn't seem very convenient
in any part of the costume.
Hm ?

10
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:58,316
Oh, I see what you mean now.

11
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:02,162
The car for Mrs. Freelinghouser is waiting.
Very uncomfortable.

12
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,265
Your antennae.
My...

13
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,038
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.

14
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,646
Couldn't we take the head off from the torso ?
No we could not. It's fixed on to the body.

15
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,593
It's a pity, milord.

16
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,578
It's a great pity, Ransome.

17
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,017
Is this Westbury ?
No, this is West 70th Street.
We pick up a lady here.

18
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,791
Charming.

19
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,707
Celeste !
Celeste !

20
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,577
Celeste !

21
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:36,045
Who are you ?
The car for Mrs Freelinghouser.

22
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,822
Oh, so you're the car for Mrs Freelinghouser.
Well you'll have to wait.

23
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:43,624
Celeste come here. I'm going mad.
There's something missing from this costume,
I can't go like this. I'm half naked.

24
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,267
See if you can find it.
What's it supposed to be anyway.
Does it say on the box ?

25
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:51,203
It calls itself a Lady Skybug.
Celeste, you're on something.

26
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:55,475
It's gonna fall to pieces.
It's never gonna last the night out.

27
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,632
See if you can find where that goes.

28
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:01,142
Oh, will you go. or stay, or laugh or do something.

29
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:03,116
There's a gentleman waiting in the car.

30
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,351
What's he like ?
He said he was an Insect Man.

31
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,059
A what ?

32
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,069
Celeste, did you send for an Insect Man ?
You're a funny fellow, aren't you ?

33
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,920
No, I'm not funny. It's a gentleman from the Ritz.
A Mr. Lord Rexford.

34
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:18,570
Tell him to come up. Never even heard of him.
Tell him to come up and have two or three drinks.
I'm gonna be hours.

35
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:22,110
Celeste, if you prick me again I'm gonna scream !

36
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,904
Let me take a look at this.

37
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,155
What a contraption.

38
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:29,254
That Annie Freelinghouser must be insane.
What are we all gonna look like anyway ?

39
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:32,429
Aren't there some instructions or something ?
I know I haven't got the thing on right.

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,238
Yes, here they are.

41
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,433
Oh.

42
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,311
I have to be painted.

43
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:41,825
Isn't that just dandy ?
Yes. There's a box of paint and a brush.

44
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,789
They didn't forget a thing, did they ?

45
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,165
Will you answer that ?
It must be the Insect.

46
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,159
Oh, I'm going crazy.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,722
Hello.
Hello ?

48
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,981
What ?
Oh, hello.

49
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:58,327
No, not tonight. I'm going to that Freelinghouser ball.

50
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:01,800
No, I stood her up once before.
I can't do that.
What ?

51
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,379
I know it's insane, but it might be fun.

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,185
My costume is beginning to fall off already.
I think everyone else's will too.

53
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:10,309
So you see, I might meet some dinos after all.

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,561
Well, that's all she wants, the dirty old...

55
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:14,507
Oh, my God !

56
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,011
What is this ?

57
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,016
What ? No...

58
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:21,257
Something just came in.
No, it's pretty awful.

59
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:24,135
Who ?
No, tell him no.

60
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:28,219
No, no, no. Tell him to jump in the lake.
Bye, sweetie, bye.

61
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,202
Ooops !
My dear.

62
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,347
Listen, you turn your head, will you ?

63
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,709
I'm sorry, I can't. It's fixed onto my body.

64
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,133
Turn your body then,
unless you want to get a load of mine.

65
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:43,932
That's pretty awful. What's it supposed to be ?
I'm an insect man.

66
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:48,006
That's right, so your friend said.
For your information, I'm a Lady Skybug.

67
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,544
An insect's eye enlarges the image it sees.

68
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,856
So what ?

69
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:55,508
I was trying to be funny, but I can't.
Mu humor's completely gone. I...

70
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,027
Would you mind something awfully ?
Awfully what ?

71
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:00,669
Would you do with a very great
kindness of going to this affair alone ?

72
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,805
I'm awfully sorry. I simply can't go through with it.
It is too absurd, too unsane.

73
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:08,061
You remind me, Mr Bug, I want to thank you.
How do you do ?

74
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:10,929
Thank me for what ?
For saving me from going too.

75
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,303
Listen. I tell you what. We go up to my sister Sylvia's.
There's some fun going on up there.

76
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,936
Do you like mad parties ?
Well, yes, I think I do, thank you very much.

77
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,803
Good. What's your name ?
Rexford.

78
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,499
Where do you live ?
Ritz chambers.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,443
Well, you run along home and get on a nice evening dress
and pick me up in an hour. How's that ?

80
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:30,164
Right.
Right. No, wrong. I'll pick you up.
That'll be quicker. And step on it.

81
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:33,068
Yes, I'd better, before somebody steps on me.

82
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,555
The lady, milord.

83
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,955
Thank you.

84
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:47,842
Milord.
Milady.

85
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:50,525
Is he kidding ?
Are you a lord ?

86
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:53,631
I'm terribly sorry, yes.
Are you really the beetle ?

87
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,536
I was the beetle.

88
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,158
How do you like
picking up a lady to go to a ball ?

89
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,066
Adored it.
Lucky, wasn't it ?
Most fortunate.

90
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:08,463
You could be cavorting around a hot room
with some fat old sheep tick or even a flea.

91
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:15,410
Now here you are on the threshold of trouble
with someone who happens at the moment to be very unattached.

92
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,411
The gods be praised.

93
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,994
Just how unattached are you ?

94
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,015
Free as the air.

95
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,940
We haven't differed on anything up to now, have we ?
No, I know.

96
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,482
I think it's a good sign.

97
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:35,982
From home.

98
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,108
How did you know I wanted a highball ?

99
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,742
Just instinct.

100
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:41,818
Sweet.

101
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,910
And you too.

102
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,314
Fun, isn't it ?

103
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:51,467
From out of nowhere.
It's where the best things come from, nowhere.

104
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:54,174
Glad ?
Thrilled.

105
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,744
May I ?

106
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,482
If you want to.

107
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,116
Old beetle.

108
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,625
Are they blowing that whistle for us ?

109
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,002
No, the French lines
are very sympathetic about a thing like this.

110
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:39,040
How sweet.
Come with me to my stateroom.

111
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,479
No, no. That boat's my enemy.
It's taking you away from me.

112
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,471
But only for a while.

113
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:47,429
You think so ? No.
Forever, I'm afraid.

114
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,890
Darling, do you know why
I can't stand you leaving me ?

115
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:54,733
It's been so perfect up to now.
Too good to be true, hasn't it ?

116
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:58,218
And it's everything a woman thinks of love.

117
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,528
I'm not over it yet, but I will be eventually.

118
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,511
Marry me.
Will you marry me ?

119
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:10,888
Oh, darling.
How sweet of you to say that.

120
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,812
That's perfect, but...

121
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:17,010
I wouldn't do such because I loves you too much.

122
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,845
Kipling.
Oh, why not ? Why not ?

123
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:24,881
No, we're entirely different people.
You're completely you and I'm...
well, I don't know what I am.

124
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,974
I don't see we're so different.
Don't you ?

125
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,829
You would when you came out of the ether.

126
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,338
It's been a beautiful spree.

127
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,028
And I mustn't let you
be swept of your feet, you see ?

128
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,684
I just want you to think of me once in a while.

129
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,148
Come on.

130
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:54,204
Oh, thank you, Ransome.
I'd almost forgotten these. For you.

131
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,384
It looks expensive.

132
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:00,156
Oh, you haven't !
Pearls.
But why ?

133
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:03,239
Round your neck. Why not ?
I thought pearls...

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,941
Oh, darling, pearls have nothing
to do with the way I feel about you.

135
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:10,868
No, you haven't money enough
to buy what you have already given me.

136
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:14,253
A very bright little corner of the city in all my life.

137
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,086
Oh, my sweet.
I suppose it was rather odd of me.

138
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,071
Not at all.

139
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:24,263
Now get on that boat
that's taking you thousands of miles away.

140
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,962
This time even you are going too far.

141
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:43,508
Be happy, Mary. All your life.
And all yours, Philip.

142
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,564
Let's not have one regret ever, never one.
No.

143
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,742
Would you like the message
delivered personally, madam ?

144
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,353
Darling !

145
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,502
Your boat.
There are lots of boats.

146
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,978
Only one Mary.

147
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,440
Your baggage ?
Gone.

148
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,792
Gone ? I can't believe it.

149
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:41,025
Do you know some place where
they can accept a nice
respectable lad without luggage ?

150
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:47,970
This is a very hospitable city we have here, sir.
Darling, I suddenly couldn't leave you. I simply couldn't.

151
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,812
Mary, this is it.

152
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,434
What ?
Us.

153
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:55,236
You mean...

154
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,453
Me Lady Rexford ?
Yes, dear.

155
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,492
Oh, darling.

156
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,396
After all those things I told you about me ?

157
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:06,066
Think now. Think hard.
I have thought. It's all forgotten.

158
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,930
Or isn't it ?
Oh, yes, if you say so. Buried and forgotten.

159
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,318
Only you in the world.

160
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:16,205
Are you sure you can forgive it all ?
Forgiven.
Forgiven ?

161
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:23,142
All right, from now on a ring in the nose
and a beating every Saturday night, please.
Yes.

162
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:31,096
I remember distinctly what I said.
How I hate you in this mood.

163
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,146
You always crabby after lunch.

164
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:38,150
Why do you go if you don't have to ?
Because Philip happens to be going to America today.

165
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,690
And he knows I'm in town.
Isn't he very dull ?

166
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:45,697
No sense of humor whatever.
They say the little American girl
he's married is full of ginger.

167
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:50,672
I invariably laugh with Americans.
But she can't be very amusing,
or she'd never have married Philip.

168
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:56,107
You'll laugh. You always do.
Oh, his father was such a gay old buck.

169
00:11:56,108 --> 00:12:01,266
The naughty old devil.
Now, please don't start
a long old story of reminiscence.

170
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,157
We're nearly there.
You cheeky little brute.

171
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:11,617
How I hate London. I hate it !
Why did I ever come back ?
Tell me, why did I ever come back ?

172
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:17,008
We'll go to the Riviera tomorrow.
And you told me to close the Villa.

173
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:21,461
And I closed it.
Very well, then it stays closed.
We can go to the Carlton Hotel.

174
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:24,235
Now understand,  tomorrow morning we start.

175
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:31,047
Oh, I've got a pain.
It's the lobster.
Not at all. It's not in my tummy, it's in my heart.

176
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,783
It's because you're so cruel to me, Bertie.

177
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,404
David !
Yes, Mary.

178
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:47,517
Is the captain on th bridge ?
Yes, he is.

179
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:50,137
What are the chances ?
Very slim, I'm afraid.

180
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:52,923
Did you put in a word for me.
My dear, I'm only a secretary.

181
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm only a wife.

182
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,290
You know how he is when his mind's made up.

183
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,881
I've never known him
when his mind isn't made up.

184
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:03,178
Bad as all that ?
Not so bad but very stubborn.

185
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,597
Here goes for a good row.
Never known him to.
What ?

186
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:09,019
Row.
Here's one now.

187
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,370
Am I accompanying my husband
to America or am I not ?

188
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,049
Not, I'm sad to say.

189
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,137
Oh, darling.
Five years and we haven't been apart a week.

190
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:32,200
And now just because someone you work for says no women,
as though women were trunks or something...

191
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:37,773
Oh, darling, I can hurry, I can rush,
I'm not an old frump like Mrs. Parrish.

192
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:40,236
Really, you should have insisted.

193
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,478
I could scream.
Go on then, scream.

194
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:46,490
How's that ?

195
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,263
Oh, Mary, you are making me feel such a swine.
I don't mean to.

196
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:55,509
I know you can't take me.
I'd most likely be an awful nuisance.
No, no, it really isn't so tragic.

197
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,277
Aren't you glad I think it is ?
Oh, yes.

198
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:10,993
You know, sometimes I get the absurd idea
that you might think New York isn't
quite the place for me again.

199
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:12,916
You don't think that, do you ?

200
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:17,163
What on earth do you mean ?
Oh, you know.
No I don't, really.

201
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:22,948
Well, I'm glad.
'Cause I can't remember New York
without thinking of us, can you ?

202
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,716
You know what I mean ?
Yes.

203
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:28,800
I wasn't exactly your wife then, was I ?

204
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:34,545
Or don't you want to remember that ?
You're my wife now. Don't talk like that.

205
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:39,878
That doesn't have anything to do
with your aunt taking me, does it dear ?
Of course not.

206
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,554
I think I'll leave a card. They're probably busy.
How do you do, Lady Riversleigh ?

207
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:48,492
How do you do er...
Who are you ?

208
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:51,056
I'm Lord Rexford's secretary.
Oh, really, how nice.

209
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,298
This is my secretary, Bertie Davis.
What's your name ?

210
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,667
My name's David Fenwick.
Oh, is it.
How do you do ?

211
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:04,102
That's Philip's valet.
What a distinguished face he has.
And I'm talking to the servant.

212
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:09,292
I'm so confused.
I'm sure it's a bad day to call.
I think I'll leave a card.

213
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:14,676
No, please, I know they're both expecting you.
Oh, they changed the hall. Painted it white.

214
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:17,053
Looks like a railway station as it is.

215
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:23,999
It's Lady Riversleigh.
I'm counting out my cigarettes.
Bertie go to the car and get them there.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,422
Aunt Hetty, how are you. I haven't seen you for years.
Mmm... and donkey's ears...

217
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:32,559
Oh, how nice.
You're looking so well.

218
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,296
I wish I felt as well as she looks.
This is er...
Mary.

219
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:42,886
My dear, you're divine.
I heard on all sides how attractive you were.

220
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,403
Well, I've been waiting for years
to see what I'm really like.

221
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:49,019
Why ? Americans are so amusing.
What does she mean ?

222
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,589
When I ran a little naughty, they'd always say:
"Oh, you're just like Aunt Hetty.

223
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,079
At my age, I'm really flattered.
You shouldn't be.

224
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,593
How sensible of Philip to marry
a nice healthy girl full of Mmmmmmm!

225
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:04,325
Zimmm.
Oh, I like that.

226
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:08,659
You have that Mmmmmm.
I had it too when I was a girl.

227
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,699
I was full of Mmmmmm.

228
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,537
Joie de vivre.
You still have.

229
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,530
Philip, did you hear the nice
compliments Aunt Hetty is paying me ?
What are they ?

230
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,476
She says I have er....

231
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,678
That sounds fine. What does it mean ?

232
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,204
Don't you know what that means ?

233
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,580
That means this.

234
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,537
She's getting pottier and pottier every day.
I beg your pardon, sir.

235
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,465
Every day.
yes, sir.

236
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,191
Look what I found out here, please.

237
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:39,412
This is Pamela.
Four years old and weighs a ton.

238
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:43,252
My dear, not a ton.
Why I only weigh a ton and a quarter.

239
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:48,220
What a nice little bit.
And look. She has mother's twinkle in her eye.

240
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:55,269
Aunt Hetty, forgive me for rushing away.
Goodbye and good riddance.
I'm going to stay here and talk to your lovely wife.

241
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,092
Aunt Hetty, you will excuse us for a moment, will you ?

242
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,174
What a lovely little girl.

243
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:05,210
Oh, Bertie, where have you been ?

244
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,288
There are your cigarettes.
Well, don't throw them at me.
What's the matter with you ?

245
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:15,612
Come on, darling. Daddy has to catch a train.
You pick her up.

246
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:17,177
Goodbye, my angel girl.

247
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,974
I expect to find you
a whole inch taller when I get back.

248
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,361
You promise me ?

249
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:26,289
Here, Clark, you better take her.
I've a little tear I don't want her to see.

250
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,372
Oh, Mary, my Mary.

251
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,996
Telephone me sometimes, will you ?

252
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,878
Of course I will.

253
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,017
I shan't be able to tell you any
more than I cn tell you now.

254
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,259
Say it, darling.

255
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,539
I love you, I love you.
Do you ?

256
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,166
Sometimes I wonder if you do.
Darling, how dare you.

257
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,763
Please take care of yourself.

258
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,041
Men.

259
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:06,173
So they've gone.
How nice it is when people go.
The house seems so quiet.

260
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:13,475
Oh, Aunt Hetty, I wanted to run across
that square after that car and bring him back again.

261
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:18,222
A little girl in love.
You're right, darn it.

262
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,031
But why should I be left here all nights ?

263
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,724
Oh, my dear, talking nights...

264
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:26,813
Have you any wine that's cold ?
I have a little sinky feeling at this time of day.

265
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:32,193
Have you ? Well I'm sinky too.
What about a bottle
of cold champagne for two little girls ?

266
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,892
That's a marvelous idea.
Bollard, bring some champagne.
Big cocktails, you like cocktails, don't you ?

267
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:42,493
I adore cocktails. And don't forget
the Angostura and the sherry, Bollard.
Yes, milady.
And make sure they're cold.

268
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:48,831
They must be cold, my dear, we mustn't tell him.
Aunt Hetty, you're very naughty.
Of course I am. Why not ?

269
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:53,723
Why not ? I was once.
I'm sure you were,
with that molted twinkle in your eye.

270
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:55,909
And does Philip know ?
Hm-hm.

271
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,747
Since you were married ?
Before ?

272
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,595
He caught you red-handed ?
Oh, no, I told him everything.

273
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,166
Oh, my dear, you foolish girl.

274
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:07,090
It isn't that I don't adore Philip, I do.

275
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:12,589
And I'm not a neglected wife, don't think that.
I think as I please,
you're telling the story, I'm listening.

276
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,788
It's just that I don't seem
to amuse him these days.

277
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:20,997
He's like the conductor of an orchestra in a theater,
who doesn't laugh at the poor comedian's jokes any more.

278
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,037
No sense of humor. He never had any.

279
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,386
He looks at me in that funny dry way of his
and I feel more like crying than laughing.

280
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:32,814
I seem to have developed an unconscious fear
of displeasing him somehow or other.

281
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,235
My dear girl, come with me to Cannes.

282
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:38,489
What ?
Come and stay with me at Cannes.

283
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,409
That sounds divine, but...
You need sunshine, and laughter and a coat of tan.

284
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,290
Get thee behind me, Satan...

285
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,248
You need music.

286
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,377
Hi to yourself.

287
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:09,858
Lovely, gracias señorita.
Thank you, Brooklin, New York.

288
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,712
I must say...

289
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,340
Oh, do your best. Go and find Tommie...

290
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:15,341
Look at you.
My dear, I'm furious I'm living !

291
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:23,248
You know, you're missing all the fun.
The heartlessness of youth !

292
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:27,370
Now what's the matter ?
Have you forgotten Nina Pourtalès' mad party tonight ?

293
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,981
You were invited.
A mad party ? Why aren't we there ?

294
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:32,411
This is a mad party right here...
Oh, but where is Tommie ?

295
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:34,267
He's upstairs in bed.
Who's in bed ?

296
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,117
Tommie Trent.
Tommie what ?

297
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,693
Tommie, you know...
He's from New York, so are you, aren't you ?

298
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:42,155
Am I ? And do I know Tommie ?
Why, the old slouch, where is he ?

299
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:46,300
In bed with his miseries.
With whom.
No names, please. Even among cads.

300
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:50,836
He's in bed with his sorrows, his miseries,
he won't see a doctor, he won't even take a drink any more.

301
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:54,340
He says he's world weary.
Poor Tommie. Misery and too much fun.

302
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:58,482
He promised faithfully. We must get him.
Dynamite wouldn't get him out of bed tonight.

303
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:02,448
He has skull pains up to here. No kidding.
I bet I could get him out of bed, we're old friends.

304
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:06,948
My dear, I promised Nina Pourtalès.
You know that Tommie can make any party.

305
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,377
Yes, so I've heard.
I'm gonna get him.

306
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:13,120
No, no, then you won't come.
Tommie can bend anyone to his will.

307
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:17,048
I'm not bending this season.
Come on you, chaperone me. I'll get him out.

308
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,371
He looked my way once in New York.
Lucky you.

309
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:24,586
Now what does that mean in American ?
That means making a pass, my darling. Making a pass.

310
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,959
Come on, what's your name ?
You tell me yours first...

311
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,116
Easy, easy.

312
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,834
At's all the ice balls, there ain't no mo'.

313
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,526
Well, go and get some more ice.

314
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,322
Yessum.
Don't slam the door.

315
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,132
Tommie, I have a lady to see you.

316
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,959
Tommie ! Peek....

317
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,043
... a-Boo !

318
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:21,647
What, no Tommie.
Tommie.

319
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,615
Where's the lovely heir ?
Tommie ?

320
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,331
See if he's in there.
Thomas.

321
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,086
Tommie !
Not in bed.

322
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:31,169
I think he's gone out.
He must be here, the music's still on ?

323
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:35,058
Here Tommie, here Tommie....

324
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,368
What ? No Tommie.
Perhaps he's out on the balcony.

325
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,641
Tommie Trent, you old son-of-a-gun !

326
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:47,060
Madam, these old eyes fail me somewhat.
But that voice has a ring...

327
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:51,469
... that brings back memories of better days.
Take a look stranger, Mary Watts, New York City.

328
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,991
Collonade, 21. Man who hit on my roof and went to sleep
and woke me up in the middle of the night
when it started to rain. Who ?

329
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,619
Who ?
No one but you-hoo.

330
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,308
Madam, pray be seated.
Come on, Hetty is furious.
You've stood her up and kept the old gal waiting.

331
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:08,281
Erskine, you in your rude sound shattter me.
You're playing on my one raw nerve.

332
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:11,008
Leave me, Erskine, leave me.
I'm so sorry, sire.

333
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,881
No, now, don't you go.
You're going to a party.
What ?

334
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:16,928
Yes. That's what I said. Now wait a minute... wait...
this is mad...

335
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,868
Madam, I am glad to see no one, but from afar
pilgrims do come to dip their fingers
in the magic fluids of my dome.

336
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:25,245
And what must I do ?
What can I do but submit ?

337
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:30,365
It got to you at last. I knew it would.
Listen, I'm going, you're frightening.
Call me up when you come out of it, will you ?

338
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,955
Mary.

339
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:38,064
Well, that's something like it.
Mary, darling, I'm glad to see you.
How are you ?

340
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:41,850
I'm a little hung over, but I'm glad to see you.
You're just a teddy bear with a sore head.

341
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:46,548
What is this I read about you in the newspapers ?
Are you a duchess or something,
or is that just a press stunt ?

342
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,268
You guess.
Corn in Egypt, oasis in the desert,
but you are a sight for sore eyes.

343
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,102
Very touching, but we're going places.
Erskine, come on let's get some clothes on him.

344
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,785
You're going to a party.
Whither thy goeth, so will I follow on.

345
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:03,308
Allez, tout de suite, vite, marche !
I will be bathed, perfumed, dressed, earled...
What shall I wear ?

346
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,856
Something quite simple and a small hat.

347
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:08,278
A tuxedo ?
My old lace.

348
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,424
See that the lady has nothing she wants, Erskine.
I'll return in a jiffy.
You'll never be missed.
He's a scream.

349
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,113
See these gray hairs ?
Try living with him for a week.

350
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:22,319
Might be stimulating.
Look at me. I'm stimulated.
Is that what you call it ?

351
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,221
Nobody swiped them.
For me !

352
00:24:43,222 --> 00:24:46,211
For you.
Will you introduce me ?

353
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:49,379
That's George.
Charming little fellow, George.

354
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,936
Here's to George.
George.

355
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:54,005
Have you ever seen anything
quite as mad as that Rexford girl ?

356
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:58,467
She's awfully pretty, isn't she ?
She's quite drunk.
Did you see her on the floor with those men just now ?

357
00:24:58,468 --> 00:25:00,672
Shocking !
That was fun.

358
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:20,774
Mary. Don't do that. Mary !
It's full of water !

359
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:23,172
Mary.

360
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,829
Mary !

361
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,369
You're not gonna swim again, are you ?
What, this ? No, it's just for effect.

362
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,996
My hair is soaking.

363
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:44,409
Well friend Thomas, what now, what now ?
What now, Lady Mary, we are outcasts.

364
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,887
What now ?
Please, what makes you think
you can get away with that ?

365
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:54,403
You said please.
Now you've spoiled everything.

366
00:25:54,404 --> 00:26:00,611
All right, now wait a minute.
Have a little drink. I mixed it all by my little self
over at the little bar.

367
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,390
Drink up.

368
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,578
Good.

369
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,077
Oh my, oh my, oh, my.

370
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,418
What an age, what a world.

371
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:23,649
What's wrong with it ?
I find it a very pleasant world.

372
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,165
It's all part of the coming of the great catastrophe.

373
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,534
What is ?

374
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,309
When girls like you turn out to be prudes.
What ?

375
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,973
What's gonna become of men like me,
that's what depresses me.
What do you mean, prude ?

376
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:39,199
You're pretending to be one
and you're being pretty convincing about it.

377
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,648
Just because I didn't let you...

378
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,974
You're crazy.

379
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,532
Where is she ?
With Tommie.

380
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:51,626
He's on an edge for days.
Give him a break.

381
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,012
Something must be done.

382
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,857
We must find them.

383
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:58,888
Bertie, they'll be all right.
Hetty's responsible for her.

384
00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:02,767
Oh, Bertsie. You have no romance.

385
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:06,249
No. Come.

386
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,174
I'd love to.

387
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:12,514
You must admit that
if there wasn't a certain reason
for your saying no...

388
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:21,515
... that this moon, this place, this moment,
me, might not be quite so...

389
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,838
... repugnant.

390
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:26,720
Did I say anything about anything being repugnant ?

391
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,989
If it had been, I'd have left.

392
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,379
Then why the pose ?
What pose ?

393
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,499
A leopard cannot change its spots.

394
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,169
No more can you, ducky.

395
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,383
Can't a woman forget a past whatever it's been
when she marries and settles down ?

396
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:45,966
You settled down, all right.
That's an insult.

397
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:48,598
All right, be insulted then.
I am.

398
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,827
Bushes ? Tommie never goes in the bushes.

399
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,331
One of us must keep our senses.

400
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:58,023
Hetty goes absolutely pottie.
No thought of tomorrow, only thought of today.

401
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,493
I'm going to get up.
What will it look like if you do ?

402
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:03,760
Let's keep on looking.
I f we don't find them,
at least we shall have done our duty.

403
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:09,354
Not that there's anything wrong.
I've always had a feeling that I could sleep better
after having done my duty.

404
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:12,149
I wouldn't trust that Tommie with my old Buick.

405
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:18,203
Tommie, too much Vermouth.

406
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,902
I'm furious.
You've ruined my evening.

407
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,478
What do you think you've done with my evening ?
What ?

408
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:30,805
Here I was contemplating a nice juicy suicide,
everything getting darker and darker...

409
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:37,071
... when you blow in with a lot of trumpets full of electricity,
inflame us and whoa !....
up on top of the world again.

410
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:40,083
Will you keep quiet.
How did I spoil your evening ?

411
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:41,896
I don't know.

412
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:48,322
Don't take me too seriously, dear.
I was wrong. Let's just be friends.

413
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:52,125
From your standpoint you weren't wrong, I guess.

414
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:56,456
That's very sweet of you to say that.

415
00:28:56,457 --> 00:29:00,890
Perhaps I did take too much for granted.
I probably encouraged you a bit.

416
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:04,334
Let's just be real pals. Real buddies.

417
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:09,717
We'll go over to St. Tropez tomorrow
and have a real hearty lunch and watch the sea.

418
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:12,734
No, no, I don't think that would be such a good idea.

419
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:16,760
You see, Tommie, I'd love to, but...
All right, all right. Don't explain.

420
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:20,188
Tonight's been perfect.
You're sweet.

421
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,824
You really are.
Mary...

422
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,480
Mary, I could marry you.

423
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:30,090
I've never said that to any woman before.
I've never thought it about any woman before.

424
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:33,619
You're mad. You're beautifully batty.

425
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,103
You're always reaching out
for something, somewhere, somehow...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,682
Aren't we all ?

427
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:46,151
This whole human setup is just grab, grab, grab,
and I'm getting very sick of it.

428
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:51,626
I think human biengs are the most unfortunate
of all animals, all the reptiles and all the birds.

429
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,929
Tommie, you're a fool, but a nice one.

430
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,288
You know, you have a funny sense of truth in you...
And so have you.

431
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,401
If only you'd be true to yourself.

432
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:01,985
Listen.

433
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:04,058
Listen to those birds up there.

434
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,215
They don't have to drink to be gay.
They don't have to doll up
and gab a lot of nonsense.

435
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:14,987
Listen to that row back there.

436
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,588
Now listen to him.

437
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,363
He's a happy little fellow, isn't he ?

438
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:23,697
We could be happy too, Mary.

439
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,809
Two people like us.

440
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,465
I am happy.

441
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:31,546
No. I mean two kindred spirits like you and me.

442
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:38,423
How ?
They could sleep all day...

443
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:41,819
They can get up just when the evening was gonna get gay...

444
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,371
... and they could dance,
and take long walks into the moonlight.

445
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,993
... then back and change,
and out with the horses and riding into the dawn.

446
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:56,989
Just when everybody else was waking up to face the day.
They could be flitting in and out of warm shower baths...

447
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,483
... and pulling down the blinds on trouble,
and bores and telephones.

448
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,581
Then they'd be up in the evening
and drink steaming hot coffee...

449
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:09,037
... and pull up the shades
and let that old moon in again.

450
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:12,313
It would be paradise, wouldn't it ?

451
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:15,843
They'd be children of the night.

452
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:19,893
Satan...
See me sometimes, Mary.

453
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,654
Just like this.

454
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:27,361
Forget all that solid routine they call living.
Spread your wings and flutter with me sometimes.

455
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:31,730
I've forgotten how to flutter.
I can teach you. Wouldn't it be fun,
wouldn't it be marvelous ?

456
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:36,971
Think of the thrill of knowing that just around the corner
there was fun and laughter....

457
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:39,366
... waiting to hold you....

458
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:40,764
... like this....

459
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,150
... and say...

460
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,291
hello, Mary darling.

461
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,960
It's perfect, isn't it ?

462
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,495
Nearly.

463
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,104
Why not perfect ?

464
00:31:58,105 --> 00:32:00,832
I'd like a drink.

465
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,840
All right, I'll get you one.

466
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:07,215
Don't want you to get cold.

467
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,433
I'll be back in just a second.

468
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,391
First a little gin.

469
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:22,595
Now a little... a little gin.

470
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:29,695
Oh... Mary.

471
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:34,539
Mary, I will disguise this
so that you will never know.

472
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,716
A dash of bitters...

473
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:46,148
Ice... pardon my fingers.

474
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,372
Oh my, what a moon, what a moon.

475
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,183
Mary, look at...

476
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,750
Mary.

477
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:02,167
Mary !

478
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:04,052
Mary !

479
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:08,360
Where is she ?
There she goes.
Mary !

480
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,963
Hello there, Tommie.
Good morning.

481
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:19,621
Mary !

482
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:24,325
These Americans...

483
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:34,742
Mary ! Mary !
Mary, you can't do that !

484
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:39,008
I'm sick of being thrown out of hotels.
Mary, you said that you would wait. Now, Mary...

485
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,866
Mary, open the door !

486
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:44,790
Mary !
Mary, open the door !

487
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:50,524
Monsieur, vous ne pouvez...
Mary !
Oh, mon Dieu. Venez avec moi...

488
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:58,186
Slick, I smell trouble.
What you smellin', Mr. Grey ?

489
00:33:58,343 --> 00:33:59,820
Mary !

490
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:04,261
Ce n'est pas juste, Il y a d'autre monde qui dorme...

491
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:07,129
Mary !
Mais, non, regarde quel heure est-il.

492
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,911
Mary !

493
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:16,055
Every time I find something that I really like
away it pops.

494
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,715
But she's married.
So was Cleopatra.
How do you know ?

495
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:21,394
Go to bed, Slick.
Get in here.

496
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:25,202
All I needed was that girl.

497
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:28,393
Listen to me, you can write her off your
next year's income tax as unavoidable loss.

498
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:32,577
She trembled. She fluttered.
I know, but she'll flutter
just as well tomorrow.

499
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:36,358
No she won't. Not her.
She's got conscience written all over her face.

500
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,947
At this moment she is cooling off
like some beautiful volcano...

501
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:42,570
... that has decided not to wipe out
a lot of Italian villages.

502
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,863
Why don't you be a good boy and go to beddy-bye ?
Why ?

503
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:47,831
So I can go to beddy-bye.

504
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:50,161
That's her room over there.

505
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:52,417
Mary !
Tommie, now wait a minute.

506
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:55,384
What are you gonna do ?
Mary !

507
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:01,418
Don't make an ass out of yourself.
Leave me alone.

508
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,298
If you fall will you leave me the big car ?
Yeah, I'll leave you my ermine coat too.

509
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,159
Shh. What's your name ?

510
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,868
Mary !

511
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:54,404
Tommie !

512
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:56,646
Tommie !

513
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,901
Have you sent for a doctor ?
Yes, I've sent for one.

514
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,855
Lady Rexford ?
Yes.

515
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:05,441
Do you speak French, madame ?
I do, but I'm not in the mood.
What is it ?

516
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:07,669
Tonight, madam, you had here a visitor.

517
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,128
A gentleman.
He comes, perhaps, for a little chat.

518
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,879
A little drink.
Why, no one was here.

519
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,008
Je vous avez bien dit que vous aviez tort.

520
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:19,730
Madame was alone ?
That's what I said, yes, why ?

521
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:23,546
Then, madame, how is it that this Trent...
Trent ?

522
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:26,110
Thomas L. Trent.
What about Mr. Trent ?

523
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:28,131
They say he must have thrown
himself from your balcony.

524
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:31,389
Then it was Tommie who jumped.
Tommie jumped...

525
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,947
What happened ?
Tommie wasn't even up here tonight.

526
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,011
My dear, I didn't tell you when I came in...
Silence, please.

527
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,776
Madame should know.
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:41,830
You did not quarrel with Mr. Trent tonight ?
Of course not.

529
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,402
You did not perhaps,
in resisting him, push him out ?

530
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,646
Don't be ridiculous.
What's happened to him ? Is he hurt ?

531
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,785
We don't know. He's at the hospital.
What hospital ?
Hospital Ste. Madeleine.

532
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,965
Thank you very much.
What's he doing there ?

533
00:36:54,966 --> 00:37:00,590
Mr. Clegg, please, this is a private matter.
I know, I know.
Tommie Trent attempted suicide from this balcony.

534
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:02,497
What ?
Come on now. Who is the lady ?

535
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:03,886
Who are you ?
My name is Clegg.

536
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,606
Clog ?
Clegg ! Excelsior News Service.

537
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:12,226
Are you the Lady Rexley, is it ?
My name is Rexford.
Perhaps we can have a
little chat when the visitors leave.

538
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:15,747
Take him away.
You have taken your picture, Mr. Clegg.
It's a private matter.

539
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,509
Can't you sort this thing out ?
And what is your name, please ?

540
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:24,539
The dowager duchess of Valhalla Gotoblazes.
I accept the apology. Taken.

541
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,620
Tommie, you poor kid.

542
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,205
Mary,

543
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:40,879
Mary, you pushed me.

544
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,351
Fool.

545
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:47,029
Mary, I can't see you very well.
They've pumped me full of junk.

546
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,903
Why did you do it ?

547
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,762
Why did you run away from me ?

548
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,894
You were grand.

549
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:58,156
I was going crazy for weeks.
Then you came along and...

550
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:01,884
cured my blues,
then you ran away and locked me out.

551
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,136
And I couldn't bear it.

552
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:06,409
You might have been killed,
I suppose you know that.

553
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,528
Would you really care ?
Really ?

554
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:13,090
Of course.
What do you think I'm made of ?

555
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,491
Rainbows.

556
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,376
Well, I wish there were
something I could do for you.

557
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:22,908
There is.
What ?

558
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,600
Would you...

559
00:38:25,657 --> 00:38:27,082
Would I what ?

560
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:32,135
I can hear a lot of violins playing.

561
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:35,175
And it's all very fine and very wonderful.

562
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:38,688
And your eyes are full of stars.

563
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,972
Tommie, what was it
you were gonna ask me ?

564
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,736
Kiss me.

565
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,738
Will you go to sleep and be quiet ?

566
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,639
Yeah.

567
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,160
Thank you very much.

568
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,215
Excuse me, sir, please.

569
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:33,617
Take the big stuff round the back.
Just a moment before you go in.

570
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:37,759
Yes, dear ?
Are you terribly angry ? You haven't kissed me yet.
Yes, I have.

571
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,177
Oh, but such a silly little kiss.
I have so much to tell you, dear.

572
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,758
I'd rather not talk about it now, Mary.
I'd rather not discuss it now.

573
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:46,068
All right, dear.

574
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,927
Anyway, it's wonderful to have you back, darling.

575
00:39:59,328 --> 00:40:05,462
Wait a minute, do I hear a little mouse somewhere ?
Yes, I do hear a little mouse somewhere.

576
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,624
My angel.

577
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,039
We've gained three pounds.
Have you ?

578
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,526
Oh, no, not me.
It.

579
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:15,630
Such a very pink rose.

580
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:27,204
I'm so sorry, but these fellows
really do want to make the morning papers.

581
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:30,176
All right, my sweet, you run along.

582
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:42,032
What is that ?

583
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,205
How can you have a horse without a tail ?

584
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:47,687
You sillybilly.

585
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:51,616
You know, you've stayed up
much too late as a matter of fact...

586
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,828
... as a special treat tonight on account of daddy.

587
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:59,695
She just loved to see her daddy again, milady.
I know. I was just a little bit j-e-a-l-o-u-s.

588
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:03,596
You're too smart, too smart for a little girl.

589
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:09,045
Is that all you want ?
Yes, thank you very much, sir. Good day, sir.
Good day.

590
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:14,572
Remember me to Mr. Warmington, will you.
Yes, sir. He's had a bit of a cold but he's much better now.
That's good. Bye

591
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,837
Hello, how are you ?
Good afternoon, Lord Rexford.

592
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:20,971
I think the others are after general news,
but I'd like to ask you something more personal.

593
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:25,514
I see, yes, what ?
We've held up a story from America
about the possibility of a divorce.

594
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,130
Oh really, have you ?

595
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:30,257
Haven't you anything to say to me at this time ?
No, most certainly not.

596
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:34,067
Nothing at all ?
No.

597
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:36,940
Thanks.

598
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:39,718
David !
Shut the door.

599
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,250
What's the matter ?
Any of the other fellows talked
about Mary and the Cannes business ?

600
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,062
No, why ?

601
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:49,033
What a filthy thing to come home to.

602
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:53,443
I thought you'd decided to wait.
You've covered up your
feelings beautifully until now.

603
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,932
I've been watching you and I've been watching Mary
and she hasn't taken her eyes off you.

604
00:41:56,933 --> 00:42:00,842
It's all so unfair.
How could she put me in such a position.

605
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:02,815
May I suggest...
What ?

606
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:04,361
... that you hold your horses.

607
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:11,361
Why don't you see these other people
and get your bath and change your clothes
and then talk it all over with Mary after dinner ?

608
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,225
You know she won't lie to you.

609
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:19,129
You know if anything were wrong,
really wrong, you wouldn't have
a smiling Mary to meet you.

610
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,154
Knowing Mary.

611
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:24,781
All right, David, I'll try.

612
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:27,677
Shall I send them in ?
Yes, I suppose so.

613
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:41,078
Oh, thank you.

614
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,137
Coffee, dear ?
No, I don't think so.

615
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:48,415
I've nerves.
I think I have nerves too.
No coffee, Bolly.

616
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,525
Let me know when Fenwick gets back, will you ?
Yes, milord.

617
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,605
Darling, you're not going to run away ?

618
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:54,929
I think I ought to.

619
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,655
Cross ?
No.

620
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,483
Just a little ?

621
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:02,233
No.

622
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,562
Darling, I'm so sorry.

623
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,710
I've been terribly worried.

624
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:13,280
How could you get mixed up
with a fellow like Tommie Trent ?

625
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:19,181
Darling Tommie Trent.
He's a fool. I just happened
to know him in New York.

626
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:22,970
You did ?
That's one of the things
the American papers omitted.

627
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:26,292
I knew him very slightly.
He's always been very amusing and...
I know.

628
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:29,293
He's quite mad and...
Yes. That the papers did infer.

629
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:33,310
Darling, it's been horrid for you.
Those awful things in the papers...

630
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:37,911
I knew they'd exaggerated.
They never let down.
They kept building up in headlines.

631
00:43:37,954 --> 00:43:40,974
One would have thought
another war had been declared.
You poor dear.

632
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:44,133
Then, just when I thought it was all over,
out came the Sunday Supplement
with special features...

633
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:46,692
"Mr. Tommie Trent and some
of the women he's supposed to..."

634
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:50,591
Darling, please.
Your picture was there
with a question mark over it.

635
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:54,982
And next there was a perfectly horrible one
of me with caption underneath it saying...

636
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:57,076
"Burning". Me, burning !

637
00:43:57,077 --> 00:44:00,408
Darling, I'm so ashamed.

638
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:04,136
And I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry too. I...

639
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:05,518
I didn't mean to blow up.

640
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,781
I made myself promise myself I wouldn't.

641
00:44:07,782 --> 00:44:11,265
I don't mind. You should blow up.
I want you to blow up.

642
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:16,585
Darling, you never thought for a
moment that I was one of...

643
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:20,156
Tommie Trent's adventures, did you ?
I didn't permit myself to think.

644
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,224
Look at me, you couldn't.

645
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:24,635
There must have been something.
What made him think
he could come to your room ?

646
00:44:24,636 --> 00:44:28,687
Two or three bottles of champagne, I suppose.
Nothing else ?

647
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:32,167
If there had been anything else,
I'd have been the one to jump from the balcony.

648
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,575
Why don't you tell me the truth ?

649
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:36,623
The truth.

650
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:40,385
I went to a party with Aunt Hetty.

651
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,047
A party given by a woman called Pourtalès.
Countess Pourtalès, to be precise.

652
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:48,261
It was all a little hectic.
We didn't even get there till 2 in the morning.

653
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,621
Fun.
It was fun, Philip.

654
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:53,067
Well, go on, darling.

655
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:56,912
Don't say darling like that, darling.

656
00:44:56,913 --> 00:44:58,471
Well ?

657
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,041
There was a big full moon...

658
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,461
I didn't put it there...

659
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:10,324
... and a soft warm wind full of mimosa,
and trouble and we were talking.

660
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:17,277
You and the Mr. Trent.
Yes, He's terribly funny.
We were talking a lot of bosh and
nonsense about birds and people.

661
00:45:17,278 --> 00:45:18,741
Sounds interesting.

662
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:24,684
Well, and he kissed me.

663
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:29,384
Yes ?

664
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:37,996
It all seemed very silly and trivial
until I got back to the hotel... safe...

665
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:41,462
... a little frightened. The next thing I knew he'd fallen off a balcony.

666
00:45:41,463 --> 00:45:43,991
I naturally went to the hospital to see how he was.

667
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:48,056
And now I've told you the truth, judge.

668
00:45:48,057 --> 00:45:50,630
The whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help me...

669
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,648
I suppose it is amusing.
It makes me a little ill.

670
00:45:57,249 --> 00:46:00,474
Well.
You might have had gone for a divorce.

671
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,258
Exactly what I was thinking.

672
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:16,642
Philip. Slap me in the face, shout,
knock me down, but don't keep this up.

673
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:20,703
I was wrong, I know it.
But I'm intact, if that means anything to you.

674
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:22,794
You make it sound quite remarkable.

675
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:25,300
Darling...

676
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:27,158
Don't be so...

677
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,228
Philip, haven't you ever...

678
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:31,710
Ever what ?
Nothing.

679
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:33,866
Have never what ?

680
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:36,522
Felt temptation.
So you were tempted then ?

681
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:38,094
For an instant yes, I was.

682
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,438
Tommie Trent didn't tempt me, the moment did.

683
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:43,656
I wasn't myself if you like,
that's possible isn't it ?

684
00:46:43,657 --> 00:46:46,941
It was a bad moment. It opened my eyes
to something inside of me that frightened me.

685
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:52,261
Darling, don't go away and leave me again.
I belong to you.

686
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:55,561
I'm not so sure of myself anymore,
and I'm so sure of you.

687
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,224
Take care of me darling, I love you.

688
00:46:58,225 --> 00:47:02,135
I love you too, that's the trouble.
If you mean that, nothing
can ever happen again.

689
00:47:04,236 --> 00:47:05,842
Forgive me.

690
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:08,091
I have forgiven you.

691
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:11,721
No.

692
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:13,952
No, you haven't.

693
00:47:13,953 --> 00:47:16,709
If I could only feel inside of me that you have.

694
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,303
How can you expect me to believe
that all this ended with a kiss ?

695
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,595
Why not ?

696
00:47:24,396 --> 00:47:27,223
I'm reminded vividly of New York.

697
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,700
What about New York ?

698
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:32,619
It didn't end that way once before.

699
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,244
I think I see what you mean.

700
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:42,110
And you will still say that after 5 years,
these five years in this house
with you and the baby ?

701
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:44,578
In New York you were the kind of a
girl that wouldn't stop at a kiss.

702
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:49,619
I always knew that one day you'd say that.

703
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,448
Philip, you're angry.
I don't blame you for being angry.
But this !

704
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:59,395
Won't you believe me ?

705
00:47:59,396 --> 00:48:00,939
I don't know.

706
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,278
You don't...

707
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,637
Then you really believe me guilty.
I... don't know.

708
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,869
Philip, I demand to know where I stand.

709
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,450
I've told you the truth.
Why don't you believe that ?

710
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,740
Lady Rexford expects me.

711
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:31,906
The name, sir ?
Hm ?

712
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,213
The name, sir, please.

713
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,740
Tommie. What's yours ?

714
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:40,148
I beg your pardon, sir ?
Come, come, the name.

715
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:41,676
Albert, sir.

716
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:46,100
Tommie.

717
00:48:49,623 --> 00:48:52,640
Tommie, this is serious. Come here.

718
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:58,049
Present.

719
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,159
I want you to do something for me.

720
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,398
It may seem a little silly
and embarassing to you, but...
I want you to do it.

721
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,176
Mary, don't look so worried.
It doesn't agree with you.
But I am.

722
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,383
I can't help it, I'm nearly out of my mind.

723
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:12,194
I'd do anything in the world for you, you know that.

724
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:16,781
The account of your accident was
published all over America with the
most amazing suggestions attached to it.

725
00:49:16,782 --> 00:49:20,883
I know. I got a very charming letter
from my father about it.
I suppose your husband is...

726
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:23,732
I've explained evrything to him
and he won't believe me.

727
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:27,101
Does he believe the papers ?
He won't believe me.

728
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:29,805
Tommie, this is what you could do.

729
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:34,363
Will you see him for me ?
And tell him that there was nothing.
Nothing at all.

730
00:49:34,364 --> 00:49:39,043
If he won't believe you,
why should he take me for a Gideon Bible ?

731
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:44,537
I don't look like one, do I ?
Tommie, don't joke, please. Be serious.

732
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:46,549
Will you do it for me ?

733
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,273
Yeah. Of course I will.

734
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:52,271
Thanks.

735
00:49:55,072 --> 00:50:00,791
Mary, where is the nearest hospital ?
I brought my violin but no first-aid kit.

736
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:07,149
Philip. May I disturb you ?

737
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:08,560
Of course.

738
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:17,315
Philip, this is Mr. Trent.
My husband.

739
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:19,359
Good evening.
Good evening.

740
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,369
I telephoned Mr. Trent
and asked him to come to see you.

741
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,953
Why ?

742
00:50:31,954 --> 00:50:35,467
I'm doing everything in my power
to try to convince you that you're wrong.

743
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:39,734
Mary asked me if I would
come over and explain.

744
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:44,632
You see, I drink a bit
and I'd known Mary in New York...

745
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,609
Yes ?
Yes.

746
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,308
And when I met her down in Cannes I was...

747
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:52,804
just a little bit lit and...
one laugh led to another and...

748
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:56,640
I remember being a little bit fresh
and naturally Mary ran away.

749
00:50:56,641 --> 00:51:00,740
And I went skylarking on those balconies
and over I went.

750
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:03,849
I'm sorry to report that I wasn't killed.

751
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,441
I should have been.

752
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:12,969
You know thay say that children and drunks all...
Is that all ?

753
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,733
I was solely to blame.
Thank you.

754
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:19,743
Well, that's all I can say, Mary.

755
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:28,081
Thank you.
Not at all.

756
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:31,461
Call on me any time.
I've told you that before and I still mean it.

757
00:51:31,462 --> 00:51:33,530
Goodbye.
Bye, Tommie.

758
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:37,900
Didn't you say that was all ?
Yes, yes, good night.
Good night.

759
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,300
Good night.

760
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,421
Good night.

761
00:52:22,622 --> 00:52:26,860
Are you completely mad ?
I've never known anything
in quite such bad taste.

762
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,251
But Philip, I wanted to convince you.

763
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,910
You have.

764
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:34,409
What more can I do ?
I don't know.

765
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,414
So Mister Jeremy Fisher
invited his two friends to supper...

766
00:52:56,415 --> 00:52:58,936
... Sir Isaac Newton and Alderman Ptolomy Tortoise.

767
00:52:58,937 --> 00:53:01,837
Mr. Tortoise brought salad in a string bag...

768
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:10,916
Mr. Jeremy Fisher made some butterfly sandwiches
with Ladybird sauce which frogs
consider a great treat,

769
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:08,727
but I think must have tasted pretty nasty.

770
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,441
Clarke, what time is it ?

771
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:18,732
Half past six, milady.

772
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,820
Think somebody's pretty sleepy.

773
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:27,176
Daddy !
Let's hide, Come on.

774
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,300
Isn't he coming ?
I'm afraid not.

775
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,324
So the captain is on the bridge.

776
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:43,049
Yes, very much on the bridge.

777
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,720
A kiss for daddy.

778
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:51,176
Good night, sweet angel. Sleep tight.
Sweet dreams, darling.

779
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:53,834
All right, Clarke. Good night.
Good night, milady.

780
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:57,009
Oh, Mary.

781
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,744
What's the matter ?

782
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:16,934
David, I'm sorry. I can't help it.

783
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:20,560
I guess I should make myself scarce around here.

784
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,885
Why ?

785
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:26,055
He's avoiding me.

786
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:30,317
He waited until I left the room last night
before he came up and kissed her.

787
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:31,490
I know.

788
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:33,483
Well ?

789
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,939
I've been sent to apologize.

790
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,982
To tell you he's working. He really is.

791
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,587
He's dining out.

792
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:45,455
So men must work and women must... what ?

793
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,215
I don't know.

794
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:52,037
What I do know...
I think some women are splendid.

795
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:56,363
They have such courage. They have such patience.
Oh, David, thank you.

796
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:01,631
I know how he feels, you know.

797
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:04,239
If I could only see him
and talk to him about it.

798
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,544
What is it, Curtis ?
Mrs. Theodore Wilson on the telephone.

799
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,635
My sister Sylvia.

800
00:55:13,636 --> 00:55:18,109
I haven't seen her since she got back to town hardly.
Here it goes.

801
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:22,072
Hello.
Hello there kiddo, how are you ?

802
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:25,162
Oh, I know.

803
00:55:25,163 --> 00:55:28,995
What do you mean highbrow ?

804
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,803
Listen, darling, I can explain.
Where are you ?

805
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,259
Sounds merry.

806
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,189
I hear music.

807
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,228
What club ?

808
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:40,647
Toad in the Hole. Yes.

809
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:43,158
No, I'm afraid I can't.

810
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:46,460
I don't know, but I simply got to see you.

811
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:49,386
Toad in the Hole is an
awfully merry little spot.

812
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:56,356
Sylvia... I'll be over.

813
00:55:56,357 --> 00:55:58,587
Yes, where is it ?
Brooke Street.

814
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,379
Yes, I'll find it all right.

815
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,325
I'll be over. Listen, I need a laugh.

816
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:07,757
And besides, I'm dying
to see that old face of yours.
So hold everything.

817
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:09,043
Right.

818
00:56:12,144 --> 00:56:16,383
David, if the captain asks for me,
I say if he does...

819
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:19,393
... tell him I'll be at that jolly little spot.

820
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:25,619
Good for you, Mary.

821
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,719
You say her ladyship went out ?
Yes, milord.

822
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,356
She went with her sister to the Toad in the Hole.

823
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:36,069
Toad in the what ?
Toad in the Hole, the club.

824
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,793
My nerves are going pop.

825
00:56:39,794 --> 00:56:43,147
I'm awfully sorry,
naturally I can't help noticing...
What ?

826
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,793
I beg your pardon, sir.
That's all right.

827
00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:48,277
Where is this place ?
Brooke Street.

828
00:56:59,178 --> 00:57:02,758
Oh, Philip.
Philip, this is Robbie Grey
and this is cousin Suzie...

829
00:57:02,759 --> 00:57:05,028
And that's Charlie Clark.
And this is his wife Rosie.

830
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:07,136
How do you do ?
Philip, will you have a drink ?

831
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:10,574
No, not just now...
Hello, Lord Rexford,
it's awfully good of you to look us up...

832
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:16,990
I'm Major Mills, I run this little business.
I'll make you an honorary member.
Thank you very much.

833
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:20,641
I didn't expect you, dear.
I want to talk to you.

834
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:24,718
Anything serious ?
It's a bit late tonight and I'm off first thing in the morning,
yes it's quite serious.

835
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,790
Tell me, what is it ?
No, not here.

836
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:33,225
Major, have you got some place
where we might go and talk ?

837
00:57:33,226 --> 00:57:39,796
There the little office of mine...
It's entirely at your disposal.
That's very kind of you.
Will you forgive us ?

838
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:44,198
And keep that.
Don't let her get it.
Don't worry.

839
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:54,099
All right, Philip.

840
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:57,581
So what ?
Mary, I can't hurt you any more.

841
00:57:57,582 --> 00:58:00,486
But you are hurt too.
I know. But I've decided what to do.

842
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:03,449
What ?
We can't go on.

843
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,671
Before I went away you had
settled down into being a normal, decent wife.

844
00:58:06,672 --> 00:58:08,922
Thank you.
But the moment my back was turned...

845
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:11,665
Oh, don't start that again, Philip, I can't stand it.
Very well.

846
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:15,530
Since I've been back, all I can find is a
restless, jumpy, affected woman.

847
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:18,590
That's not fair.
But it's true.

848
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:22,824
I suppose I shouldn't have come here.
I didn't say that.
No, but you're thinking it.

849
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:28,526
Well, I had to do something.
I couldn't keep following you around the house
on my knees waiting for you
to come out of this coma.

850
00:58:28,527 --> 00:58:31,866
Am I not to be cruel to attempt
to keep you away from this atmosphere ...

851
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:34,389
... which obviously you thrive on ?
Is this Cannes again ?

852
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:39,311
Cannes, or here, all of it. It's a sort of...
It's a color of life that seems essencial to you.

853
00:58:39,312 --> 00:58:41,223
That's not true. But go on.

854
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:44,263
I'm seeing Farrington tonight.

855
00:58:44,264 --> 00:58:46,235
Your lawyer ?

856
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,555
You mean...
Yes.

857
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,553
Divorce.

858
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:08,416
So you don't want me anymore.

859
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,205
Don't put it like that.

860
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:14,993
Philip, give me another chance.
We've had our chance.
We've failed.

861
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,918
I adored you so.

862
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:22,764
I would have died for you.

863
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:27,011
Nothing you could ever have said or done
could have changed that.

864
00:59:27,012 --> 00:59:30,188
I'm being honest.
I'm protecting us both.

865
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:38,079
Pardon me you two,
but a certain fellow here wants to chip these.

866
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,157
And I think it's a good one, at least I hope so.

867
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:47,449
I can't take any money from the bar,
it upsets the barmen.
So I keep a little here for people in distress.

868
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,883
Will you have one of these ?
They're rather special.

869
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,954
No, thank you very much.
By, the way, Lady Riversleigh...

870
00:59:54,955 --> 01:00:02,824
... Mr. Trent, Mr. Brown, tho whole gang at the bar...
I took the liberty of introducing
them to your rather amusing sister.

871
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:07,606
I told them you were here.
They said when you'd finished
would you come to the bar and have a talk.

872
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:25,494
Aunt Hetty and Trent...
I didn't know they were here.
I had no idea they were coming.

873
01:00:25,495 --> 01:00:28,434
My dear, it doesn't matter any more.
Don't you see, it doesn't matter.

874
01:00:28,435 --> 01:00:31,897
Oh, it doesn't matter.

875
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:34,321
How different we are.

876
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:37,891
You stand for everything that's good and chivalrous and right,
I know that.

877
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:41,679
You don't need kindness, and tenderness and forgiveness.

878
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,150
You're so sure, so strong...
You can detain and control lives with words and divorces...

879
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:50,152
You've got the strength to take everything in life that I want.

880
01:00:50,153 --> 01:00:53,291
Well, I've got the strength to tell you: take it.

881
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:56,247
You're right. it doesn't matter anymore.

882
01:01:01,748 --> 01:01:05,486
Oh, there's Mary.
Hello, Aunt Hetty. How are you, dear ?

883
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:12,550
I've just met this charming, amusing sister of yours.
You know Americans always make me die of laughter.

884
01:01:12,551 --> 01:01:15,830
Hello stranger.
Hello there, how are you ?

885
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,622
Where's your husband ?

886
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:20,335
He's gone.
Oh. Have a drink ?

887
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:22,957
Love to.
Name it.

888
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:27,390
French 75.
Same here, French 75. Boom !

889
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:30,137
Boom yourself and everyone else.

890
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:31,396
Atta girl.

891
01:01:33,897 --> 01:01:37,246
Thine eyes like limpid pools, baby...

892
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:39,772
It's the smoke.

893
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:40,973
Sorry, Mary.

894
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:50,041
My name is Nightingale.
I'm the butler.
I'm speaking from Riversleigh Hall.

895
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:53,987
Lady Riversleigh's residence.
The place is on fire.

896
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:57,007
All right then, hurry.
The old wing !

897
01:01:57,008 --> 01:02:00,693
Hurry ! I've been trying
to get you for the last half hour.

898
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:03,745
Well, Bertie ?
It's started in the old wing.

899
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:07,491
I'm really glad. I hate the old place.
Are any of the guests in the old wing ?

900
01:02:07,492 --> 01:02:10,056
Lady Rexford is in the old wing,
the Foxtons are in the old wing...

901
01:02:10,057 --> 01:02:13,383
You'd better go to the old wing and tell them.
They probably don't know there's a fire.

902
01:02:13,384 --> 01:02:16,589
No, I'll go. I'm the hostess.
You'll get yourself scorched.

903
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:19,995
The captain must stand by the ship.
Keep the dog there.

904
01:02:19,996 --> 01:02:23,729
I think somebody must take charge.
I'm in charge here.

905
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,893
Is there anything I can do to help ?

906
01:02:25,894 --> 01:02:27,890
Suppose you take charge.
I'll take care of Hetty.

907
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:33,662
General, general.
I've just rescued these two angels.
Aren't they divine ? I've never had so much fun.
Don't you love it, General ?

908
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:36,279
I hate this place. It smells so stuffy.

909
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:41,083
Oh, dear. We didn't know a thing about it.
This wing is seldom used.

910
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:44,711
Shhh. Darling. Don't make a sound.

911
01:02:44,712 --> 01:02:47,558
Why not ?
Go and answer the door.

912
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,407
Wait a minute. Hold your horses.
Think.

913
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:53,816
Something has be going on downstairs.

914
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:55,867
Smells like a bonfire.

915
01:02:55,868 --> 01:02:58,605
It's probably your sister
giving them a good American barbecue.

916
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:06,242
Mary, do open the door
or you might burn to death.

917
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:09,399
Do you mind.
Not a bit. I was just thinking of you.

918
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,755
Don't bother. It doesn't matter any more.
I'm still thinking of you.

919
01:03:17,856 --> 01:03:23,443
Oh, Mary.
Aunt Hetty, what is it ?
Oh, my dear, there's been a fire raging.
We didn't know a thing about it.

920
01:03:23,444 --> 01:03:29,071
Lady Hetty probably saved all our lives.
We heard something going on downstairs,
but we thought it was a game.

921
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:33,458
Tommie, come on out, there's been a fire.
We didn't here any firebells.

922
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:37,014
Oh, we should have had some bells.
Bertie run along downstairs and ring some bells.

923
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,997
We've been talking.
And so were we.

924
01:03:38,998 --> 01:03:41,066
You know, you might all have been burned to death.

925
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,559
I don't mind telling you that I heard
confidentially that the whole thing is over.

926
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,680
But I didn't say a word to anybody
because it's the only excitement
we had over the weekend.

927
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:52,941
Now come and have some bacon and eggs.
And I have sweet pickles on toothpicks...

928
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:00,449
Well, it's happened.
Now what ?

929
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,703
I haven't been in St. Moritz
since the days I was a lad...

930
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:15,651
... studying Law at Cambridge.
Ah, those were the days.

931
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:19,397
Winter sports in Switzerland every year.
Life is different now, somehow.

932
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:22,485
Very different.
Very mild on the Riviera just now.
Well ?

933
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:25,536
It's Cannes I came to see you about.
I've been down there on your case.

934
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:27,894
What on earth has Cannes got to do
with Mary getting a divorce from me ?

935
01:04:27,895 --> 01:04:30,968
Didn't I make myself clear ?
Didn't I tell you how I wanted the matter handled ?

936
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:34,061
I think you should understand,
a little pardonable caution
on the part of your lawyer.

937
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:37,412
You know, this type of lady
has been known to be a trifle difficult.

938
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:39,486
What do you mean this type of lady ?
Well...

939
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:45,524
As in the case of Webster versus Webster
where the husband tried to do the decent thing
when he had absolute proof.

940
01:04:45,535 --> 01:04:47,190
So you went to Cannes for proof.

941
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:49,751
I wanted us to be protected
in case she became unreasonable.

942
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,574
And you found it.

943
01:04:51,575 --> 01:04:53,498
On the contrary. Not a shred of evidence.

944
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:57,029
Of course I went personally because
I knew you wanted the matter to be kept
as private as possible.

945
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,125
And I interviewed policemen, chambermaids,
hotel managers, hotel detectives...

946
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:04,323
And you found nothing.
Nothing.

947
01:05:04,324 --> 01:05:08,965
The night manager of the hotel
stated very clearly that on the night in question,

948
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:13,985
he together with other employers of the
hotel had to remonstrate with this Trent fellow...

949
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:19,270
... he then being intoxicated, for knocking
on the door of the suite occupied
by your wife and your aunt.

950
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:21,675
The door then being securely locked.

951
01:05:21,676 --> 01:05:26,699
I got a statement from Lady Riversleigh.
She said that your wife...
I resent your making these inquiries.

952
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,973
They're unnecessary and humiliating.

953
01:05:28,974 --> 01:05:33,801
Where's Mary now ?
As far as I know, staying quietly
with Lady Rivesrleigh in the country.

954
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:36,018
And you could think for one moment
that I should be the one to bring suit ?

955
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,599
Well, I'm afraid you've got no case
if attempted divorce.

956
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:40,578
What made you think that I wanted a case ?
Do you believe her innocent ?

957
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:45,470
Oh, yes, I...

958
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,270
I do, I do, I...

959
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:50,694
I really see... I believe that now.

960
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:54,519
Farrington. Do nothing more.
I really have been out of my mind.

961
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,059
Go carefully, Philip.
You married her impulsively,
you threw her aside impulsively.

962
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,316
Now do think.
I have thought.

963
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:02,994
I was wrong. I know I was wrong.

964
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:08,076
I do believe her.
All right, supposing subsequently you find
she has been unfaithful to you ?

965
01:06:08,346 --> 01:06:10,495
I can't think that.
I wouldn't answer for the consequences.

966
01:06:10,496 --> 01:06:11,621
What are you going to do ?

967
01:06:13,622 --> 01:06:15,414
Take her back ?

968
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,046
Will she take me back ?

969
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,821
Wanna play ?

970
01:06:26,822 --> 01:06:30,763
Yes, come on. I'll beat you.
Aren't you drinking ?

971
01:06:30,764 --> 01:06:32,871
Me ? Never.

972
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,605
What ?

973
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:37,352
I don't need to anymore.

974
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:40,761
You fool, you fool...

975
01:06:40,762 --> 01:06:43,444
Come on, double.

976
01:06:43,445 --> 01:06:46,193
Don't cheat yourself.

977
01:06:50,694 --> 01:06:51,658
Hello.
Hello, yes.

978
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,280
No.

979
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:59,139
Lady Rexford ?
Oh, yes. A telegram ?
Why don't you send it ?

980
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,758
The telegraph boy's a fireman and he's here
Oh, it's all very confusing.

981
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:07,597
Will you read it to me ?
Yes, I have paper and pencil here.

982
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:08,715
Yes.

983
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:12,941
To Lady Rexford...

984
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:17,274
Essencial we should talk.

985
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:23,367
Can you come here to me at once ?

986
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:26,336
Don't fail. Waiting.

987
01:07:26,337 --> 01:07:29,691
All love. Philip.

988
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:32,186
Yes, I've written it all down.
That's all right.

989
01:07:32,187 --> 01:07:33,856
Where is it from ?

990
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:37,345
St. Moritz.
Oh, yes. Thank you.

991
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:43,474
It's as if he's on her trail.
A bit late.
Why not ?

992
01:07:43,475 --> 01:07:46,195
Mary, can I speak to you ?

993
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:49,967
There's a telegram for you.
I copied it out. It's private.

994
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:53,077
I'm a fraid it's not private any longer, darling.

995
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:54,986
What does she mean ?

996
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,144
Well ?

997
01:07:57,145 --> 01:08:00,931
Go on. Your move.
No, it's your move.

998
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:02,479
What are you gonna do ?

999
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,404
Well... oh yes.

1000
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:09,077
I'm going.
Pretty cold in St. Moritz right now.

1001
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:12,273
Perhaps.
Seriously, Mary, you can't go.
Why not ?

1002
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:16,330
Mary, darling, you can't go now.
Why not ?

1003
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:20,277
You're gonna tell him the truth ?
Are you afraid ?

1004
01:08:20,278 --> 01:08:21,923
No.

1005
01:08:21,924 --> 01:08:25,808
No, I'll go with you.
We'll tell him together.

1006
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,778
No.
You couldn't.
No ?

1007
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:33,528
I'm going.

1008
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:40,280
We have the epidestra.

1009
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:43,877
The convolvuli and a
very large type of rhododendrum.

1010
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:45,832
Flowers.

1011
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:48,245
Blooms, blossoms.
Oh, I see.

1012
01:08:48,246 --> 01:08:52,428
Personally I prefer the carnation to any other flower.

1013
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:56,942
Oh.
Carnation, you know. Carnation ?

1014
01:08:56,943 --> 01:09:00,433
It's hardly the same thing, do you think ?
That's why I prefer them.

1015
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:02,798
Oh, so infinitely more.

1016
01:09:07,162 --> 01:09:10,422
He whistles for you and you go scampering.
He wants to see me.

1017
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:13,231
And you want to see him,
but I'm not gonna let you go alone.

1018
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,640
No man is gonna let me
or not let me do anything ever again.

1019
01:09:16,641 --> 01:09:19,779
Celeste, pack. We're leaving for London imediately.

1020
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,335
We can pack there again,
catch the Golden Arrow to Paris at 11 o'clock.

1021
01:09:22,336 --> 01:09:24,231
We'll take a night train
out from Paris to Switzerland...

1022
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:27,975
... St. Moritz, warm clothes and no nonsense.
Gotta make those connections.

1023
01:09:27,976 --> 01:09:31,089
You'll have to step on it.
I'm gonna step on it,
how I'm gonna step on it.

1024
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:34,563
I never packed so much in my whole...
Oh, stop mumbling to yourself.

1025
01:09:34,564 --> 01:09:37,591
Mary, I thought he'd called it a day.
He did.

1026
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:41,173
And now something that was
apparently dead has started up again.

1027
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:45,789
I'm gonna stop it at once for his sake.
It was dead and it's gonna stay dead.

1028
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:50,189
You still care for him, don't you ?
As a friend only.
No more, no less than anyone.

1029
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,699
Tommie, go on.

1030
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,560
Will you go now ? I have to dress.

1031
01:09:56,561 --> 01:10:00,244
You're unfair, inconsiderate,
you're behaving like a hysterical ...
Oh, Tommie...

1032
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:02,843
I've heard all that too.

1033
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:05,282
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

1034
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:07,615
Will you go now ?
When will I see you again ?

1035
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,690
When I get back.
When will that be ?

1036
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:13,726
The instant I've told him the truth
and closed that chapter.

1037
01:10:13,727 --> 01:10:15,960
Take care of yourself.
Hm-hm.

1038
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,782
For me.

1039
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:27,587
Mary, I love you.

1040
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:56,224
Oh, Mary, my Mary.
Hello, Philip.

1041
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,334
Sweet of you to come so quickly.

1042
01:10:58,335 --> 01:11:02,810
I came at once because I had something
to tell you that I couldn't write.

1043
01:11:03,089 --> 01:11:06,774
That I ...
There's lots of time...
So much that could be said, but...

1044
01:11:06,775 --> 01:11:10,611
Well, whatever it is,
we can discuss it quietly as friends,
can't we ?

1045
01:11:10,612 --> 01:11:11,870
Friends...

1046
01:11:22,371 --> 01:11:24,732
Are those waiters
going to stand there forever ?

1047
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:26,551
I'll throw them out.

1048
01:11:26,552 --> 01:11:29,786
Would you two gentlemen mind
holding your meeting outside ?

1049
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:41,395
Philip. Listen to me.

1050
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:45,499
No, Mary. Hear me first.
A criminal is entitled to a hearing.

1051
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,151
I never said...
Mary.

1052
01:11:47,152 --> 01:11:51,509
People, just people can get married,
actually married, in a few minutes.

1053
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,449
But sometimes it takes years
to marry their natures...

1054
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,850
... to come to a perfect understanding, each for each.

1055
01:11:57,851 --> 01:12:02,242
... to give and take,
to find that divine adjustment when
you can look at each other and say...

1056
01:12:02,243 --> 01:12:03,951
This can go on forever.

1057
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:09,707
If you'd only held me for a moment.

1058
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,266
One look, one word.

1059
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:16,803
Love's a cruel thing.
You can get angry in love.

1060
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:20,151
You want to drive it out
because it becomes agonizing in anger.

1061
01:12:20,152 --> 01:12:22,598
And then at the moment it's leaving you...

1062
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:24,713
you die inside you.

1063
01:12:24,714 --> 01:12:29,465
With such pain, and such a longing
to undo things we may have said.

1064
01:12:29,466 --> 01:12:32,996
I died, Mary, inside me.

1065
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:35,282
I can't go on without you.

1066
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:38,780
Oh, I do trust you.

1067
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:42,922
Please, please forgive me.
Philip !

1068
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:46,099
You're making it so
difficult for me to tell you what I must.
No, not another word.

1069
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,311
You do.
Please, Philip.
I don't want to hear anything.

1070
01:12:49,312 --> 01:12:51,630
Tell me you forgive me.

1071
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:54,062
There's somebody in the other room.
You have, Mary.

1072
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:55,945
Would you go and see who it is.

1073
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:05,246
It's you, Celeste. What is it ?

1074
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,985
I wouldn't bother you, I...
I was just borrowing one of
your sleeping powders...

1075
01:13:08,986 --> 01:13:12,680
I can't sleep. It's the altitude.
I've got an attack of nerves.

1076
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:16,132
I tried to get everything right.
I forgot half the things
I should have brought.

1077
01:13:16,133 --> 01:13:20,005
Let me get you some brandy.
No, it'd make me sick.

1078
01:13:20,006 --> 01:13:24,248
I'll be all right.
I know I rushed you off, you poor girl...

1079
01:13:25,849 --> 01:13:28,030
What is the matter, Celeste ?

1080
01:13:28,031 --> 01:13:31,027
You mustn't get so upset.
Get to that telephone.

1081
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:33,305
It's London. Lady Riversleigh.
Why didn't he put it through ?

1082
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:36,070
She said I was to get you alone.
It's urgent.

1083
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:41,546
Hello.

1084
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:44,340
Hello ?
Yes, I'm in London now.

1085
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:48,562
Yes, my dear.
Tommie Trent has just left.
He's as drunk as a fool.

1086
01:13:48,563 --> 01:13:53,354
He's insane. He says he's going to
take an airplane and come
to St. Moritz at once.

1087
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:56,186
Well, stop him, can't you ?
Have you said anything to Philip ?

1088
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:58,098
No, no, I don't know.

1089
01:13:58,099 --> 01:14:00,676
I can't explain.

1090
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:03,334
Stop him if you can. Yes.

1091
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:05,960
All right. Goodbye.

1092
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:10,904
Thanks.

1093
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:34,752
Mary. You've been hours.
I've been trying to gather my courage.

1094
01:14:34,753 --> 01:14:37,063
So have I. I was thinking...
Philip, will you hear me ?

1095
01:14:37,064 --> 01:14:41,039
Yes, dear.
You know, the last time we saw each other...

1096
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,586
in that little room in the club, remember ?
Yes...

1097
01:14:43,587 --> 01:14:46,106
You said that I'd failed you...

1098
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:50,791
I hadn't then...
I never really believed in my heart...
Mary I couldn't have believed
that you were untrue to me.

1099
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:54,611
If I had believed it
I would have killed you and myself too.

1100
01:14:57,012 --> 01:14:59,333
If I could only tell you in words...

1101
01:15:01,134 --> 01:15:03,339
Last night...

1102
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,959
I wrote to you
things I haven't been able to say.

1103
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,608
Do read it, Mary.

1104
01:15:41,962 --> 01:15:44,400
I thought I'd lost you forever.

1105
01:16:02,274 --> 01:16:03,978
Tell me one thing.

1106
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:05,998
You do love me, don't you ?

1107
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:08,699
Do you love me ?

1108
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:11,525
Before God I do.

1109
01:16:14,126 --> 01:16:16,838
Philip, wait a minute.

1110
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:19,660
Once you told me
you couldn't put your arms around me.

1111
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:22,225
And I understood you then.

1112
01:16:22,226 --> 01:16:24,229
Now...

1113
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,223
... please just don't hold me, will you ?

1114
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:28,617
Let's go.

1115
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,869
All right.

1116
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,893
Good night, Mary.
Good night.

1117
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:07,310
Yes.
I have Mr. Trent here on the line.
Will the lady speak now ?

1118
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,840
No.

1119
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,229
Hey, Tommie. Get this.

1120
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:21,980
Lord and Lady Rexford return
from St. Moritz to their London residence.

1121
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:26,988
You'd better check out that romance, my boy,
or the shooting season'll star early this year.

1122
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:28,827
Is she there ?

1123
01:17:28,828 --> 01:17:32,573
Ask her if she could say er...
Good morning, Tommie.

1124
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:35,259
Aw, come on, just one little word.

1125
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,510
Wait a minute. I'll ask her.

1126
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:39,428
It's Tommie.

1127
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:42,087
He wants to talk to you. Just a word.
Sylvia, no, I can't.

1128
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:44,423
Well, you're out of luck.
She won't speak.

1129
01:17:44,424 --> 01:17:48,599
He wants to come around. Is that all right ?
No, of course not. Sylvia, please tell him.

1130
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,817
What ?
What's the matter ?

1131
01:17:50,818 --> 01:17:52,687
Where ?

1132
01:17:52,688 --> 01:17:55,282
In the lobby ?

1133
01:17:55,283 --> 01:17:57,172
Hold on.

1134
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,234
Who ?
Are you kidding ?
Please don't joke.

1135
01:18:00,235 --> 01:18:02,964
Who ?
He isn't kidding.

1136
01:18:02,965 --> 01:18:04,950
Philip's over there at the Ritz right now.

1137
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:06,777
Hello.

1138
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:08,173
Hello.

1139
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:10,856
What ?

1140
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,494
Oh, no, please don't see him.

1141
01:18:13,496 --> 01:18:14,799
Don't see him, will you ?

1142
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,127
All right.

1143
01:18:16,128 --> 01:18:18,509
Listen, Mary. I've gotta see you.

1144
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:21,729
Hetty tells me
you're gonna have lunch with her.

1145
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:25,095
I'll see you there at lunch time.
I've gotta see you.

1146
01:18:25,096 --> 01:18:26,821
All right, I'll see you there.

1147
01:18:26,822 --> 01:18:29,123
Now, you won't see him, will you ?

1148
01:18:29,124 --> 01:18:30,577
No.

1149
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:32,361
All right.

1150
01:18:32,362 --> 01:18:33,642
All right.

1151
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:39,994
Just tell his lordship that I am not home.
I'm you, you know, out.

1152
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:41,082
Out.
Out.

1153
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,664
Slick !
Yo.

1154
01:18:42,665 --> 01:18:47,849
Bath, shave, massage,
hot towels, blue suit, white flower...

1155
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:50,966
A weddin' ?
No. I don't know. Who knows ?

1156
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:53,271
I'm in love. I'm in love.

1157
01:18:53,272 --> 01:18:56,552
Mary, he's on the wagon, high and dry.

1158
01:18:56,554 --> 01:19:01,207
Why, he even telephoned his father
in New York this morning to tell him
he wanted to go to work and settle down

1159
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,835
Sylvia, my problem is here with Philip.

1160
01:19:03,837 --> 01:19:06,627
I almost lost him once
and I'm not going to lose him again.

1161
01:19:06,628 --> 01:19:09,977
Mary, you watch your step.

1162
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:15,448
With that state of mind you're in
he'll find it out any moment unless you can
begin to forget, and apparently you can't.

1163
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:18,664
I can forget it.

1164
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:27,422
I do forget it until I hear his voice...

1165
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:31,003
... till I look into his eyes.

1166
01:19:31,004 --> 01:19:38,907
Till I see him watching me
with that tender inquiring sort of a look
and I want to ask him what he's thinking about.

1167
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:41,846
I'm terrified that he suspects something.

1168
01:19:43,847 --> 01:19:46,160
What can I do ? I've...

1169
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:49,176
... I've avoided his arms and his kisses, but...

1170
01:19:49,177 --> 01:19:50,695
... that can't go on.

1171
01:19:52,696 --> 01:19:55,510
What am I going to do ?
What ?

1172
01:19:56,111 --> 01:20:00,888
Mary, what's this thing about
conscience and cowards ?

1173
01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:10,572
Lady Rexford.
Hello, Hetty.

1174
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,827
Hello, dear.
Hello, Mary.

1175
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:14,859
Hello, Sylvia.

1176
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,992
Hello, Tommie.
Hello, stranger.

1177
01:20:16,993 --> 01:20:20,005
You look better, Mary.

1178
01:20:20,006 --> 01:20:24,173
Do I ? I feel fine.
Had a lovely walk across the park.
It was nice and fresh.

1179
01:20:24,174 --> 01:20:26,910
You do look well.
Whatever you're doing is doing you good.

1180
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:29,225
Is the twinkle still there ?
I don't know. Is it ?

1181
01:20:29,226 --> 01:20:32,351
Let me see.
Yes, it's still there.

1182
01:20:32,352 --> 01:20:35,029
Way back in here eyes where Mary lives.

1183
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,425
How pretty.
I wonder what's at the back of my eyes.

1184
01:20:38,426 --> 01:20:40,806
Rose pink clouds at sunset for you dear.

1185
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:45,970
I like the rose pink, but why the sunset ?
I'm not setting, it sounds like a hen.

1186
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,591
That's awful.

1187
01:20:49,192 --> 01:20:51,699
Well, Mary, what are we gonna do now ?

1188
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:56,267
Tommie, I'm going to stay
right where I am, if I can.

1189
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,955
Oh...

1190
01:20:57,956 --> 01:20:59,873
In the old ancestral home.
Yes

1191
01:20:59,874 --> 01:21:02,335
You haven't told Philip anything ?
She has not.

1192
01:21:02,338 --> 01:21:04,222
And no one else is going to tell him anything either.

1193
01:21:04,223 --> 01:21:07,391
How can you stop them, Mary ?
I may not be able to stop them,
but I can deny it.

1194
01:21:07,392 --> 01:21:11,459
Mary, do I warrant any consideration ?
Of course you do, Tommie.

1195
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,838
But my first consideration is Philip.

1196
01:21:13,839 --> 01:21:16,014
I should have thought of that before
but I didn't.

1197
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:19,260
All right, but there are
certain facts that should be faced.

1198
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:23,383
Tommie, those facts must be forgotten.

1199
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,953
Nonsense.
You can't keep gossip like that quiet.

1200
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:28,280
Of course you can't.
That is true, Mary.

1201
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,354
Don't you think I know what a fool I've been ?

1202
01:21:30,355 --> 01:21:36,058
I haven't closed my eyes for nights.
I've been trying and trying
to tell Philip the truth but I simply can't.

1203
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,987
I'm afraid.

1204
01:21:37,988 --> 01:21:40,233
Not afraid for myself, but I'm afraid for him.

1205
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:43,586
Mary, if you remember, in the country...
Tommie

1206
01:21:43,587 --> 01:21:45,618
So much has happened since then.

1207
01:21:45,619 --> 01:21:51,398
If I had only known before.
If I had only known how deeply,
how truly I do love him.

1208
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:53,433
It's just a case of love at second sight.

1209
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:55,806
I've made up my mind definitely to one thing.

1210
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:59,031
There is something more sacred than truth.

1211
01:21:59,032 --> 01:22:01,247
That's protection.

1212
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:03,801
To protect someone you care for from pain.

1213
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:07,209
This thing would break him.

1214
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,589
I realized that at St. Moritz.
He must never know. Never.

1215
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:13,621
Fair enough, but Mary...
I'll lie, I'll fight, I'll do anything.

1216
01:22:13,622 --> 01:22:16,003
But there's never gonna be
anything else to lie about, ever.

1217
01:22:16,004 --> 01:22:18,530
Lord Rexford.

1218
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:21,885
Philip.
Hello, dear.

1219
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,146
Hello, Mary. What is it ?
Anything wrong ?

1220
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:29,480
No, dear.
What a surprise. You'll stay to lunch.
Mary, why didn't you tell me he was coming ?

1221
01:22:29,481 --> 01:22:31,153
I didn't know.
I didn't know myself.

1222
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:34,353
Well, I'm very flattered.
I had no idea I was in your better graces.

1223
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:37,459
What made you suddenly make up your mind to look me up ?

1224
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,525
I wanted to see Trent.
Yes, I heard you called.

1225
01:22:40,526 --> 01:22:42,798
Can I be of any service ?

1226
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,973
Oh, yes, you can.
Well ?

1227
01:22:44,974 --> 01:22:48,095
I want you to stop annoying my wife.
Philip !

1228
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:51,017
Philip, what do you mean ?

1229
01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:53,972
Dear, I'm asking him to refrain from annoying you.
That's simple enough, isn't it ?

1230
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:56,133
No, I don't understand you.

1231
01:22:56,134 --> 01:22:58,420
Mr. Trent tried to phone you at St. Moritz.

1232
01:22:58,421 --> 01:23:02,407
Now I find him conveniently lunching here,
still intruding himself upon you.

1233
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,488
The last thing that I wanted was to intrude.

1234
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:07,420
Mary, was my telephoning you an annoyance ?

1235
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:09,889
Well, it annoyed Philip, apparently.

1236
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,872
As a matter of fact, Tommie wasn't lunching here.

1237
01:23:13,873 --> 01:23:16,213
He simply came by to pick up Sylvia.

1238
01:23:16,214 --> 01:23:21,273
We'll have to keep an eye on these two.
It's the third time this week
that they've lunched together.

1239
01:23:21,274 --> 01:23:23,985
What did they say of the corner table at The Embassy ?

1240
01:23:23,986 --> 01:23:27,534
Yes, but I've arranged...
Don't be a killjoy.
You want to be alone, don't you, Tommie ?

1241
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:31,337
Oui, madame.
When I telephoned this morning
your man told me you were lunching here.

1242
01:23:31,338 --> 01:23:34,075
He's crazy, that man.
Aren't we all ?

1243
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:37,205
Mary, did you expect to meet Trent Here ?

1244
01:23:37,206 --> 01:23:40,119
No. I did not.
It was just a coincidence ?

1245
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,335
Yes. What's so strange about that Philip ?

1246
01:23:43,336 --> 01:23:44,789
Don't you believe me ?

1247
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:49,144
I don't understand you.
It's only fair you should understand me.

1248
01:23:49,945 --> 01:23:53,657
It's probable I'm making a fool of myself
and it's just as probable
my suspicions are unfounded.

1249
01:23:53,658 --> 01:23:58,487
Philip, I don't know what's on your mind,
but wouldn't it have been fairer if you
had told me about this this morning ?

1250
01:23:58,489 --> 01:24:00,598
I intended to tell you after I'd seen Trent.

1251
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:03,602
Do let us have lunch.
Come on, Tommie, let's go.

1252
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,361
Goodbye, Mary.

1253
01:24:05,362 --> 01:24:07,834
Goodbye, Tommie.

1254
01:24:07,836 --> 01:24:12,243
I won't annoy you again.
I promise not to call you up even to inquire
the state of your health.

1255
01:24:12,244 --> 01:24:15,310
Although you know I'll always be interested.

1256
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:16,784
Thank you, Tommie.

1257
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,474
Have a good time.

1258
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:21,467
No, I can't promise you that.

1259
01:24:22,668 --> 01:24:25,352
What's all this ?
Still jumping off balconies ?

1260
01:24:32,653 --> 01:24:35,606
As a matter of fact I could for Mary.
You see, I happen to love her.

1261
01:24:35,607 --> 01:24:36,862
No, Tommie, please.
Yes ?

1262
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,936
I've asked her to leave you and marry me.

1263
01:24:38,937 --> 01:24:41,449
Tommie, what are you saying ?
Is this true ?
Do tou want to leave me for him ?

1264
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,522
No, Philip, no.
Have you told him that ?

1265
01:24:43,523 --> 01:24:46,400
Yes, I have.
And he persists.
Yes, but I told him it's impossible.

1266
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:48,476
Now what right have you...
Every right. I love her. I've seen her suffer.

1267
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:52,692
Stop, Tommie, stop !
Mary, haven't I the right to...
No, that's not true. I beg you.

1268
01:24:52,823 --> 01:24:55,068
Tommie, please.

1269
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:57,286
What are you all trying to hide ?

1270
01:24:57,287 --> 01:24:59,546
Philip, there's nothing to hide.

1271
01:24:59,547 --> 01:25:02,380
I came here to help you out of an embarassment.

1272
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:04,866
Loving you and trusting you, Mary.

1273
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:06,289
And what do I find ?

1274
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:10,242
Nothing but a lot of hedging,
and dodging and denials.

1275
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:12,791
That's your own imagination and your own jealousy.

1276
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:16,548
But why wouldn't I be jealous ?
Yes if you have grounds, but...

1277
01:25:16,549 --> 01:25:19,152
You, your eyes, I've been watching you.

1278
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:22,400
If you have anything to tell me, tell me now.
There's nothing.

1279
01:25:22,401 --> 01:25:25,560
Even he had the decency
to come and tell me to my face
that he's asked you to leave me.

1280
01:25:25,561 --> 01:25:27,613
Has he the right to ask ?
Have you given him the right ?

1281
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:29,892
I don't know what you mean.
You do know what I mean.

1282
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:32,983
You can't answer me, can you ?
Yes, I...

1283
01:25:32,984 --> 01:25:35,010
Mary.

1284
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:37,096
You came back to me in St. Moritz.

1285
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:40,148
You came back living a lie.

1286
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,608
I didn't know anybody could be so...

1287
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:45,948
I should have known what to expect.

1288
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:53,052
I could answer so much.

1289
01:25:53,053 --> 01:25:58,307
But nothing I could say would justify what you've just discovered...

1290
01:25:58,308 --> 01:26:01,317
... and this time happens to be true.

1291
01:26:04,518 --> 01:26:06,990
I did try to lie to save you.

1292
01:26:06,991 --> 01:26:10,910
But lies, truths, faithful, unfaithful, right or wrong...

1293
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:15,088
...our real tragedy is that
our love for each other isn't big enough...

1294
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:17,208
... isn't strong enough as you said,

1295
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:19,860
to overcome everything.

1296
01:26:19,861 --> 01:26:21,821
And neither of us is quite big enough.

1297
01:26:21,822 --> 01:26:25,245
So this time, Philip...

1298
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:27,658
... it must be divorce.

1299
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:38,943
I never knew that a punishment
could be so just and terrifying.

1300
01:26:39,057 --> 01:26:41,658
I know I must go, but...

1301
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:43,764
I'll tell you the truth now.

1302
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:47,267
If there was only one place that I ever really wanted to be...

1303
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,568
... that was by your side.

1304
01:26:52,251 --> 01:26:56,900
This has been a horrible business.
She must be a very erratic woman.

1305
01:26:56,901 --> 01:27:01,592
No, not at all. She's enchanting.
Well, she'll be here. She's left her hotel.

1306
01:27:01,593 --> 01:27:05,497
Good.
Now I understood that the money
mentioned here is outside the original agreement,

1307
01:27:05,498 --> 01:27:09,169
... it's a gratuitous gesture.
To buy the child from her,
I think she has been punished enough.

1308
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,319
Punished ? A clear name ?
And a handsome income.

1309
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,859
What's happening ? Is she coming ?
Yes, she'll be here in a moment.

1310
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,674
Well, we are ready for her.
Good morning, Sir Geoffrey.
I understand your client is sailing today.

1311
01:27:18,675 --> 01:27:19,965
Yes, so I understand.

1312
01:27:19,966 --> 01:27:21,111
It's all very confusing.

1313
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:23,227
Thank you, I'll keep it.
Yes, milady.

1314
01:27:23,228 --> 01:27:27,331
No, Clarke. I can't see her possibly.
Couldn't trust myself.

1315
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:30,205
Tell me...

1316
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:32,281
How did the little birthday party go ?

1317
01:27:32,282 --> 01:27:36,590
Quite nice, milady.
We missed you.
I gave your present and read your little note.

1318
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:40,893
Did you tell her I had gone away
on a great big boat ?
Yes. She doesn't quite believe it, though.

1319
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:43,201
She asks for her mother
every morning and every night.

1320
01:27:43,202 --> 01:27:46,375
Does she ?
Couldn't you see her for a moment, milady ?

1321
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:51,392
How could I ?
I guess I'd never let her go.

1322
01:27:51,393 --> 01:27:53,341
You shouldn't have to, milady.
It's a crime.

1323
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:56,457
I thought for a moment I'd seen her hiding.

1324
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:59,763
What was it ?
Something I wanted to ask you.

1325
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:01,140
Oh, yes.

1326
01:28:01,141 --> 01:28:03,494
You might steal a couple
of those snapshots for me, would you ?

1327
01:28:03,495 --> 01:28:05,465
You know, the ones from last year by the sea.

1328
01:28:05,466 --> 01:28:06,855
Celeste couldn't find them when we left.

1329
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:09,547
There's one with me running with her
and another one in the water. Remember ?

1330
01:28:09,548 --> 01:28:11,230
Yes, I know, milady.

1331
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:16,307
Clarke.
Now, wait a minute... don't.

1332
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,117
It's all right.

1333
01:28:24,318 --> 01:28:26,505
Hello, Mary.
Hello, David.

1334
01:28:26,506 --> 01:28:29,171
Philip.
Mary.

1335
01:28:29,172 --> 01:28:32,401
Sir Geoffrey.
I'm afraid I'm not
a very cooperative client, am I ?

1336
01:28:32,402 --> 01:28:36,539
Your maid said you had a cold and I believed her.
That was very sweet of you.

1337
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:40,258
Mr. Farrington.
How do you do ? You know my brother, my partner ?
Yes, yes.

1338
01:28:40,259 --> 01:28:43,410
Well, Sir Geoffrey, what is it ?
You said it was important.

1339
01:28:43,411 --> 01:28:47,604
Yes. There is an agreement they want you to sign
taking your baby from you
and giving an income in return.

1340
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:52,035
Well, I have an income.
Please don't be silly. You'll need money.

1341
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,238
Philip, I want nothing.

1342
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,918
You might regret this, Lady Rexford.
You've been awarded this baby and I'd be very happy...

1343
01:28:57,919 --> 01:28:59,552
That's very kind of you, Sir Geoffrey, but no.

1344
01:28:59,802 --> 01:29:01,884
Shall I read this ?

1345
01:29:01,885 --> 01:29:05,632
Couldn't I just write a simple note,
would that be all right ?

1346
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:08,510
David, why don't you take it down ?
Yes, I will.

1347
01:29:12,711 --> 01:29:14,207
Dear Philip...

1348
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:18,513
... Pamela stays with you...

1349
01:29:18,514 --> 01:29:21,138
... her father,

1350
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:25,457
I have no claim on you or her whatsoever.

1351
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,306
You have behaved most generously,
and I appreciate it.

1352
01:29:34,107 --> 01:29:37,087
All through your charming anxiety for my future.

1353
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:40,526
Now, would you hurry with that, David,
so I can sign it before I go.

1354
01:29:40,527 --> 01:29:44,348
Yes, I'll have to hurry.
I doubt the legality of that note.

1355
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:45,895
It's enough.

1356
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:48,745
All right, if Lady Rexford won't change her mind.

1357
01:29:48,746 --> 01:29:51,327
I won't.
I believe you, Lady Rexford.

1358
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:53,424
Come on.
I want to talk to you a minute outside.

1359
01:29:56,525 --> 01:30:01,984
There is nothing I can do for you before you leave ?
No, thank you. You have been very kind.

1360
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:05,725
Well, what will the address be in New York ?
700, Park Avenue.

1361
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,061
Will you see Pamela now ?

1362
01:30:10,062 --> 01:30:12,030
No, Philip.

1363
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:14,455
Hurry up, David.

1364
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,923
I want to sign that letter
before I go for your peace of mind.

1365
01:30:16,924 --> 01:30:20,224
You don't have to.
Why do you trust me ?

1366
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:23,490
I'm sorry, Philip.
I didn't mean that to be a joke.

1367
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:27,855
Well.

1368
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,034
No, I couldn't say goodbye to you, Philip...

1369
01:30:36,036 --> 01:30:38,690
... any more than I could say goobye to Pamela.

1370
01:30:38,696 --> 01:30:41,385
I see.
You've been fine about that, Mary.

1371
01:30:41,386 --> 01:30:44,477
It's the least I could do for you, isn't it ?

1372
01:30:46,678 --> 01:30:50,026
When she grows up to be a big girl, I...

1373
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,900
Funny to think of it, isn't it ?

1374
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:55,818
Don't let her think me too bad, will you ?
No, I won't.

1375
01:30:55,819 --> 01:30:57,730
Thank you, Philip.

1376
01:30:57,731 --> 01:30:59,735
You made a pretty good job of it this time, Mary.

1377
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:03,870
Anger, doubts, tears all have gone.
Just two polite little people.

1378
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:06,762
Friends, though, really.
Oh, yes, of course.

1379
01:31:06,763 --> 01:31:09,902
When are you sailing ?
Tonight some time.

1380
01:31:09,903 --> 01:31:12,876
Would you mind if I come and see you off ?

1381
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:14,217
Why, Philip ?

1382
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,524
I don't know. I'm like you.
I find it rather hard to say goodbye too.

1383
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:19,270
But we mustn't.
It's just a moment.

1384
01:31:19,272 --> 01:31:21,137
It's been every moment through it all.

1385
01:31:23,138 --> 01:31:24,803
Philip, you don't...

1386
01:31:25,804 --> 01:31:28,429
You don't mean that.

1387
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,525
Here all these lawyers and people, hard at work,
all the machinery for parting us...

1388
01:31:32,526 --> 01:31:35,861
Even ourselves.
It can't be done, Mary. Can it ?

1389
01:31:35,862 --> 01:31:39,126
Can it, Mary ?

1390
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:43,174
No, Philip.

1391
01:31:47,675 --> 01:31:52,675
Pam, my baby ! Pam, my girl !

1392
01:31:52,868 --> 01:31:54,778
Oh, my darling.

1393
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:57,317
Oh, my sweetheart.

1394
01:31:57,318 --> 01:32:01,318
Here we go. Here we go.

1395
01:32:04,471 --> 01:32:07,407
Oh, my darling.
My darling !
