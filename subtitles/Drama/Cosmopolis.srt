1
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240
Where?

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
I want a haircut.

3
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,680
The president's in town.

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,040
We don't care.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,080
We need a haircut.
We need to go across town.

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,240
We'll hit traffic that
speaks in quarter inches.

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Just so I know...

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,440
...which president
are we talking about?

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,600
United States.

10
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Barriers will be setup.

11
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,320
Entire streets deleted
from the map.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Show me my car.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,720
What have we learned then?

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,280
Our system is secure.
We're impenetrable.

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
There's no rogue program.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
It would seem, however...

17
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
- Eric!
- No, we ran every test.

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,120
No one's overloading the
system or manipulating our sites.

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,360
When do we do all this?

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Yesterday.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
At the complex, our rapid response team.

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,920
There is no vulnerable point of entry.

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,240
Our insurer did a threat analysis.

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,840
We are buffered from attack.

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
Everywhere.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,840
Including the car?

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,120
Including, absolutely, yes.

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
My car, this car...

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Eric, yes! Please...

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,640
We've been together, you and I,
since the little-bitty startup.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,480
I want you to tell me that
you still have the stamina to do this job.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
Single mindedness.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
This car, your car...

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The relentless will.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,560
'cause I keep hearing
about our legend

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,760
that we were young,
smart and raised by wolves

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
that the phenomena of reputation

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,000
is a delicate thing.
Person rises on a word

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,520
and falls on a syllable.

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,520
I know I'm asking the wrong man.

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh, what?

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,880
Where's the car last night
after we ran our tests?

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,720
I...

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,760
I don't know.

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,360
Where do all these limos go at night?

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,760
I know I'm changing the subject.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,200
Haven't been sleeping much.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I look at books and drink brandy.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,920
What happens to all these stretched
limousines that prowl the throbbing city all day long?

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,600
Where do they spend the night?

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,960
Do you ever get the feeling, sometimes,
that you don't know what's going on?

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,600
Do I wanna ask you what you mean by that?

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,080
All this optimism

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
All this booming and soaring.

56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Things happen like...
bang! This! And that! Simultaneous.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I put out my hand
and what do I feel?

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,000
I know there are a thousand things
that you analyze every 10 minutes

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,160
patterns, ratio, indexes,
whole maps of information.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,960
I love information.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Eric, this is our
sweetness and light.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,720
It is a fuckall wonder

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,120
and we have meaning
in this world

64
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,840
people eat and sleep in
the shadow of what we do.

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,840
But at the same time

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
What?

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,000
Any special reason we're in
the car instead of the office?

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What makes you think we're
in the car instead of the office?

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,800
If I answer that question...

70
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Based on what premise?

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,560
I know I'll say something
that's half-way clever, but...also shallow

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,280
and probably inaccurate on some level

73
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,680
and then you will pity me
for having been born.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
We're in the car 'cause
I need a haircut.

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Get the barber come to the
office, get a haircut there

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,720
or have the barber come
to your car, just...

77
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,200
get your haircut and
go to the office.

78
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,880
A haircut has what?
Associations

79
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,320
Calendar on the wall,
mirrors everywhere.

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
There's no barber chair here.
Nothing swivels but chair your in, Shiner.

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Where's your car?

82
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,240
We can't seem to find it.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
I'd offer you a ride.

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,880
I couldn't. Absolutely.

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
I know you work enroute.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,200
and I like taxis.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,320
I was never good at geography and I
learned things by asking the drivers where they come from.

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,880
They come from horror and despair.

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
Yes, exactly.

90
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,560
One learns about the country where
unrest is occurring by riding the taxis here.

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,360
I haven't seen you in a while.

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,200
I looked for you this morning.

93
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Your eyes are blue.

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,280
Have you eat breakfast yet?

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
No.

96
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Good. I'm hungry for
something thick and chewy.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,680
You never told me you were blue eyed.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,680
When are we going to talk about?

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
I want a heliboard on the roof.

100
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,640
I've acquired the air rights,
but we still need the zoning variants.

101
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't you wanna eat?

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,080
There's a shooting range
next to the elevator bank.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
Let's talk about us.

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,880
You and I?

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
We're here so we might as well.

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,680
When are we going
to have sex again?

107
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,640
We will, I promise.

108
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,720
We haven't in a while now.

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
When I work, you see...

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,320
the energy is precious.

111
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
When you write?

112
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes.

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Where do you do this?

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
I look for you, Elise.

115
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,520
I curl up somewhere.

116
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
I've always done this.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
My mother used to send
people to find me

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,320
maids and gardeners,
combing the house and rounds

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
She thought I was
dissolvable in water.

120
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,280
I like your mother.

121
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,880
You have your mother's breasts.

122
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,880
Breasts?

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,280
Great stand-up tits.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Tell me this: where will you go now?

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,320
To a meeting somewhere
to your office?

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,040
Where is your office?

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
What do you do, exactly?

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,320
You know things,
I think this is what you do.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
I think you're dedicated to knowing.

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,880
I think you acquire information and turn it
into something stupendous and awful.

131
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,880
You're a dangerous person.
Do you agree?

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,680
A visionary.

133
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
A report from the Complex.

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
It's a credible threat,
not to be dismissed.

135
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,560
Which means riding cross town is...

136
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,320
Had numerous threats, all credible.

137
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm still standing here.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,880
Not a threat to your safety, to his.

139
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,200
Who the fuck is "his"?

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,680
The president's.
This means a ride cross town...

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,200
does not happen unless we make
a day of it, with cookies and milk.

142
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,560
Do people still shoot at presidents?
I thought there were more stimulating targets.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
In the next block, there are two
haircutting saloons, there's one and two.

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
No need to go cross town

145
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,200
Situation is unstable.

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,920
Here.

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,080
I know that smile, Michael.

148
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,240
I think the yuan...I mean there's
reason to believe we may be leveraging too rashly.

149
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
It's gonna turn our way.

150
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,400
Yes, I know, it always has.

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,680
The rashness you think you see.

152
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,240
What is happening doesn't chart.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
It charts.

154
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,280
You just have to search a little harder.
Don't trust standard models, think outside the limits.

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,280
The yuan is making a statement.

156
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
Read it and leap.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
We are betting big time here.

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
I know that smile and I wanna respect it,
but the yuan can't go any higher.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
I wanna trust it.

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,920
We're borrowing enormous enormous sums.

161
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Any assault on the borders of
perception is gonna seem rash at first...

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah, come on, we're speculating into the void!

163
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Your mother blamed the
smile on your father

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
he blamed her

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,160
there's something deadly about it

166
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,640
she thought she had to enroll
you in special counseling.

167
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,880
I think we ought to adjust.

168
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
Where's Shiner?

169
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
On his way to the airport.

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,160
Why are they called airports?

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,360
I know I can't answer these questions
without losing your respect.

172
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Shiner told me our network is secure.

173
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
Then it is.

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Safe from penetrations.

175
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,440
Why am I seeing things that
haven't happened yet?

176
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,440
How old are you?

177
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
22

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
What? 22!

179
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
You look younger.

180
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,040
I was always younger than anyone
around me. One day I began to change.

181
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I don't feel younger.

182
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,920
I feel located totally nowhere.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,280
Think I'm ready to quit,
basically the business.

184
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,080
Put a stick of gum in your
mouth and try not to chew it.

185
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,400
For someone your age and your gifts, there's only one
thing in the world worth pursuing both professionally and intellectually.

186
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
What is it, Michael?

187
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,240
The interaction between
technology and capital

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
the inseparability.

189
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,160
Highschool was the last true challenge.

190
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,880
There's a poem I read in which
a rat becomes the unit of currency.

191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,040
Yes, that would be interesting.

192
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah, that would
impact the world economy.

193
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
The name alone,
better than the dong or the kwacha.

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
The name says everything.

195
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,520
Yes.

196
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,440
The rat.

197
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,120
Yes, the rat close lower
today against the euro.

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,840
Yes, there's going concern that
the Russian rat will be devalued.

199
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,520
White rats, think about that.

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,760
Yes, pregnant rats.

201
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,440
Major sell-offs of
Russian pregnant rats.

202
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,120
Britain converts the rat.

203
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,880
Joins trend to universal currency.

204
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,600
Yes, US is establishing
the rat standard.

205
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Is every US dollar
redeemable for rat?

206
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,280
Dead rats!

207
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes, stockpiling of dead rats called

208
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,440
global health menace.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,520
How old are you, now that
you're not younger than everyone else?

210
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,880
Was I expecting you?

211
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
Just passing by.

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,560
Thought you'd drop in, did you?
That's nice. I'm glad.

213
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,120
Been a while.

214
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
I read about it.

215
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,080
Of course. Or did I see it on TV?

216
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
What?

217
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
What? The wedding!

218
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
Strange you didn't tell me.

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
It's not so strange.

220
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,360
Not so strange?

221
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,160
Two great fortunes!

222
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,000
Like one of those great arranged
marriages of old empire Europe.

223
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Except I'm a world citizen with
a New York pair of balls.

224
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,360
So how many billions together
do you two represent?

225
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
She's a poet.

226
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Is that what she is?

227
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,800
I thought she was a Shifrin.

228
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Little of both.

229
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,760
So rich and crisp.

230
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,760
Does she let you touch
her personal parts?

231
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,080
You look gorgeous today.

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,080
For someone who's 41 and
finally understands what her problem is.

233
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,480
What's that?

234
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,320
Life is...

235
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,680
too contemporary.

236
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,560
So how old is your consort?

237
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,200
Nevermind, I don't wanna know.

238
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
You'd tell me to shut up.

239
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Oh, one more question.

240
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Is she good in bed?

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Is she good in the limo?

242
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't know yet.

243
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,960
Aww, that's the trouble
will old money.

244
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Now tell me to shut up.

245
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,240
I know something you wanna know.

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,680
What's that?

247
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,040
There's a Rothko in private
hands that I have the privileged knowledge of.

248
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
It's about to become available.

249
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
You've seen it?

250
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,200
Three, four years ago, yes.

251
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
It is...

252
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,120
luminous.

253
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,920
What about the chapel?

254
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,560
What about it?

255
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,320
I've been thinking about the chapel.

256
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
You can't buy the god-damn chapel.

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
How do you know?

258
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,880
Contact the principals.

259
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,240
I thought you'd be thrilled
about the painting. One painting.

260
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,960
You don't have a important Rothko
and you've always want one, we've talked about this!

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,960
How many paintings in this chapel?

262
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't know.

263
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,720
14? 15?

264
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
If they're selling the chapel,
I'll keep it intact.

265
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
Tell them!

266
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Keep it intact? Where?

267
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Tell them!

268
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,400
In my apartment there's
sufficient space.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can make more space.

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,560
The people need to see it.

271
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,880
Let them buy it.

272
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Let them outbid me.

273
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,160
Forgive the pissed way to say this,
but the ??? chapel belongs to the world.

274
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
It's mine if I buy it.

275
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,960
How much do they want for it?

276
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,280
They don't wanna sell the chapel

277
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:49,560
and I don't wanna give you lessons in self-denial and social
responsibility because I don't believe for a second you're as cruel as you sound.

278
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
How much?

279
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,080
What does it mean to spend money?

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
A dollar?

281
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
A million?

282
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,240
For a painting?

283
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
For anything.

284
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,560
I have two private
elevators now.

285
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,120
One is programmed to play
Satie piano pieces.

286
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
And move at one-quarter the normal speed.

287
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,520
This is right the Satie and this is the
elevator I take when I'm in a certain...

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,280
let's say...

289
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,320
unsettled mood.

290
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,600
It calms me, makes me whole.

291
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
Who's the other elevator?

292
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,960
Brother Fez.

293
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
Who's that?

294
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
The Sufi rap star.
You don't know this?

295
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
I miss things.

296
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,440
I don't know what
money is anymore.

297
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm losing money
by the ton today.

298
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,880
Many millions.

299
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
Betting against the yuan.

300
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
Isn't the yuan asleep?

301
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Currency markets never close.

302
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,280
Shanghai runs day and night,
all the major exchanges, seven days a week.

303
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,680
I miss that.

304
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
I ???

305
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
How many millions?

306
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
Hundreds of millions.

307
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,880
How old are you?

308
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
28?

309
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
28.

310
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,280
I want you to go to the chapel
and make them an offer.

311
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Whatever it takes.

312
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,880
I want everything that's there.

313
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Walls and all.

314
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,320
I remember what you told me once.

315
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,440
What's that?

316
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Talent is more
erotic when it's wasted.

317
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
What did I mean?

318
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,960
A word?

319
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
Yeah.

320
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,920
Complex recommends extra security.

321
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,960
- You're not happy about this.
- No.

322
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,120
First, a threat
at the president.

323
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
You're confident you can
handle whatever it comes up?

324
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,240
Now an attack on the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund.

325
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,120
Arthur Rapp?

326
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,080
Arthur Rapp, yes.

327
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,680
Where?

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,680
Nike, North Korea, while being
interviewed on television.

329
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
It's on all the channels.

330
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,760
Director Rapp, will this
change your policy on the yuan?

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,720
The yuan is uncharacteristically
inflated, which makes it unstable

332
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,560
and eventually it will drop,
and when it...

333
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,240
The Complex...

334
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
accept their recommendation.

335
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Good.

336
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,360
All these limos, my God,
that you can't tell one from another.

337
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
We could be kids on prom night.

338
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
Or some dumb wedding wherever.

339
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,800
What's the charm of identical?

340
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,720
That I'm a powerful person that
chooses not to demarcate his territory with

341
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,080
singular driblets of piss, is what?

342
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Something I need to apologize for?

343
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
I want to go home and
tongue-kiss my Maxima.

344
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,000
You now what today is?

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,080
Incidentally...

346
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,360
- I know.
- It's my day off, dammit!

347
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,120
I know this.

348
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,080
I need this extra day, desperately.

349
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,760
I know this.

350
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,920
But you don't know this.

351
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,000
You can't know what it's like,
I am a single struggling mother.

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,920
We have a situation here.

353
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,880
I am a mother running in the
park when my phone explodes in my navel

354
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,240
I think it's the kid's nanny who
never calls unless the kid's fever reaches 105.

355
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
But it's the situation, it....

356
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,840
we have a situation alright,
we have a yuan carry that can crush us in hours.

357
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,720
Take some water.
Sit on the banquette.

358
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
I like face to face.

359
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,800
And I don't need to look at all
those screens, I know what's happening.

360
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
The yuan will fall.

361
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,600
That's right.

362
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,360
Consumer's spending down.

363
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,640
That's right.

364
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,080
Besides, the Bank of China
left the interest rates unchanged.

365
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,400
This happened today?

366
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
This happened tonight in Shanghai,
I called the source at Shenzhen.

367
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,160
While running?

368
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,920
While flinging my body down
Maddison Avenue, to get here on time.

369
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,560
The yuan can't go any higher.

370
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,880
That's true, that's right.
Except it just did.

371
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,800
Hadn't sleep last night.

372
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,040
There's a time limit.

373
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,720
Doctor Ingram?

374
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Who the fuck are you?

375
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Doctor Ingram.

376
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
Where's Doctor Nevius?

377
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Called away suddenly.
A personal matter.

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,440
Speak slowly and clearly.

379
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,720
Called away suddenly,
I don' know, a family crisis...

380
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm the associate, I...I...

381
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,120
flushed out your ear holes once.

382
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,440
You do this why?

383
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,840
What?

384
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyday.

385
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,600
No matter...?

386
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Wherever I am, that's right.

387
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,800
No matter.

388
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,880
So you do what?
Same routine every day?

389
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,160
Varies.

390
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,520
Depending.

391
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
So he comes to your house

392
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Nice!

393
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,480
On weekends.

394
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,000
We die, Jane, on weekends. People.

395
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
It happens.

396
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,920
You're right.

397
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
I didn't think of that.

398
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
We die because it's the weekend.

399
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,880
I thought we were moving,
but we're not anymore.

400
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
The president's in town.

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
You're right.

402
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,640
I forgot. I though I've
seen him when I ran out of the park.

403
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,680
There's an entourage of limousines
going down 5th with a motorcycle escort.

404
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,480
I thought all these limos are for the president,
I can understand, but it was for somebody famous's funeral.

405
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,600
We die everyday.

406
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,800
What do we do about this?

407
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,920
Let it express itself.

408
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
What? Do nothing?

409
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Let it express itself.

410
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,440
You can stand up now.

411
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,320
So, look, we have two rumors
working on our favor.

412
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,000
First, there's the bankruptcies
for six straight months.

413
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
More each month, more on the way.

414
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Large Chinese corporations.

415
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,840
This is good.

416
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
The yuan will drop.

417
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,040
This is loss of faith.
It will force the yuan to drop.

418
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,440
Dollar will settle up.

419
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,960
The yuan will drop. Where's Chin?

420
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,120
Working on visual patterns.

421
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,120
This thing doesn't chart.

422
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,960
It charts.

423
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,680
It doesn't chart the way
you chart technology stocks

424
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,840
you can find real patterns there,
locate predicting components, this is different.

425
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,040
We're teaching him to see.

426
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
You should do the seeing,
you're the seer.

427
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,560
What is he? He's a kid.
He's got a streak in his hair, he's got the earing...

428
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,160
He doesn't have the earing.

429
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,240
If he was any dreamy,
we'd have to put him on life support.

430
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
What's the second rumor?

431
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,440
There's a rumor, it seems,
involving the Finance minister

432
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,480
some kind of scandal
about a misconstrued comment

433
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,560
He made a comment about the economy
that may have been misconstrued.

434
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,320
The whole country is now analyzing
the grammar and syntax of this comment.

435
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,080
Or it wasn't even what he said,
it was when he paused.

436
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,120
They're trying to construe
the meaning of the pause.

437
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,720
It may be deeper
even than grammar.

438
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,880
He may be breathing.

439
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,400
So the whole economy convulses
because the man took a breath.

440
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,160
You gripped the water bottle.

441
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,880
Yes, it's that soft type plastic.

442
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,320
You grip it.

443
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,320
You choke it.

444
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,280
It's a matter of fact thing.

445
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,360
It's sexual tension.

446
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,040
It's every day
nervousness in a life.

447
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
It's sexual tension.

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,520
Days like these...

449
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
What?

450
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,240
That whole sad business of
Judeo-Christian jogging. You were not born to run.

451
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,920
I look at you. I know what you are.

452
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,280
Your sloppy body, smelly and wet

453
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,440
a woman who was born to stay strapped in a
chair, while a man tells her how much she excites him.

454
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,200
How come we've never
spend this kind of time together?

455
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,080
Your prostate is asymmetrical.

456
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,680
Those two, they're ours?

457
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
I felt the need

458
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,040
imperative, that we reroute.

459
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,680
The situation is what?

460
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,600
This.

461
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,320
Water main break, we have flood
conditions ahead. State of chaos.

462
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,200
This. The question of the president
and his whereabouts. He is fluid. He is moving.

463
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,120
Wherever he goes, our satellite receiver reports
a ripple effect in the traffic that causes mass paralysis.

464
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,360
This also.

465
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,720
There's a funeral proceeding slowly
downtown and now deflecting westward.

466
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,280
Many vehicles, numerous mourners on foot.
And finally this.

467
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,120
We have a report of imminent
activity in the area.

468
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,040
Activity?

469
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Imminent.

470
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,760
Nature is yet unknown.

471
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,760
Complex says "use caution".

472
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,480
Recite to me.

473
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
Where's your necktie?

474
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,040
I had my checkout.

475
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Saw my heart on the screen.

476
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,960
I don't like saying this.

477
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
But?

478
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,400
You smell of sex.

479
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
That's my doctor's
appointment you smell.

480
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I smell sex all over you.

481
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,720
It's what?

482
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,200
It's hungry you smell.

483
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
I wanna eat lunch.

484
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
You wanna eat lunch.

485
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
We're people in the world.

486
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,000
We need to eat and talk.

487
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm not sure how hungry I am.

488
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Eat. You'll find out.

489
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,240
Speaking of sex.

490
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,200
We've been married only weeks.
Barely weeks.

491
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,760
Everything is barely weeks.
We have minutes to live.

492
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,320
We don't want to start counting the times, do we?
And having solemn discussions on the subject.

493
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,920
No, we wanna do it.

494
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,600
And we will.
We shall.

495
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,600
We wanna have it.

496
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,240
Sex.

497
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Yes.

498
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,000
Because there isn'time
not to have it.

499
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Time is a thing that grows scarcer every day.
What, you don't know this?

500
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,360
I like that bookshop.
Do you know why?

501
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,400
Because it's semi-underground.

502
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,840
You feel hidden.
You like to hide.

503
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,840
From what?

504
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Sometimes only noise.

505
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,080
You're one of those silent
wistful children, glued to the shadows.

506
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,760
And you?

507
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I don't know.
I don't think about it.

508
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,160
Think about one thing
and tell me what it was.

509
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,760
Alright, one thing.

510
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,080
When I was four, I figured out how
much I weight on each of the planets in the Solar System.

511
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,640
That's nice.
I like that.

512
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,800
Such science and ego combined.

513
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,080
When are we going to the lake?

514
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,560
Fuck the lake.

515
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,040
I thought we like it there
after all the planning,
the construction.

516
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,720
To get away, to be alone together.
It's quiet at the lake.

517
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,320
It's quiet in town.

518
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,120
The way we live, yes, I suppose.
High enough, far enough.

519
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,480
What about your car?

520
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Not so quiet, surely.

521
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
You spend a lot of time there.

522
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I had the car prousted.

523
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,240
Yes?

524
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,880
The way they build a stretch is this:

525
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,640
Take a vehicle base unit cut in half
with a huge throbbing saw device.

526
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,200
And they add a segment to lengthen
the chassis by ten, elven, twelve feet.

527
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,640
Whatever desired dimension.
Twenty-two feet, if you like.

528
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,640
While they did this to my car,
I sent the word that they had to proust is.

529
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,240
Cork-line it against street noise.

530
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,320
It's lovely, actually.
I love that.

531
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,720
The vehicles are armored, of course.
This complicated the cork-lining.

532
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,160
But they managed in the end.

533
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,080
It's a gesture.
A thing a man does.

534
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Did it work?

535
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
How could it work, no!

536
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,320
This city eats and sleeps noise.
Makes noise out of every century.

537
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,200
Makes the same noises that were made in the seventeen century,
along with other noises that where developed since then.

538
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,320
No.

539
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,000
But I don't mind the noise.
The noise energizes me.

540
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Important thing is that it's there.

541
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,800
Cork?

542
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
That's right. The cork.

543
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,840
This is what finally matters.

544
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,320
Is this what I wanted?

545
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,720
Tell me what you wanted.

546
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,560
Duck consommé
with an herb twist.

547
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,880
It's true, you know.
You do actually reek of sexual discharge.

548
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,640
It's not the sex you think I've had.
It's the sex I want, that's what you smell on me.

549
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,720
'Cause the more I look at you,
the more I know about us both.

550
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Tell me what that means.

551
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Or don't.
No, don't.

552
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,520
And the more I wanna
have sex with you.

553
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,720
Because that's a certain kind of sex
that has an element of cleansing.

554
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,760
It's the antidote to disillusion.
The counter-poison.

555
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,520
You need to be inflamed, don't you?
This is your element.

556
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,200
Where are you going after the bookstore?
Because there's a hotel.

557
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I was going to the bookstore. Period.

558
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,720
I was in the bookstore,
I was happy there.

559
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,480
Where were you going?

560
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
To get a haircut.

561
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,320
Do you need a haircut?

562
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
I need anything you can give me.

563
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,080
Be nice.

564
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,240
I need all the meanings
of the inflamed.

565
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,760
There's a hotel just across the avenue.
We can start over.

566
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,440
Or finish with intense feeling,
that's one of the meanings.

567
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,400
To arouse a passionate feeling.
We can finish what we barely started.

568
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,240
Two hotels, in fact.
We have a choice.

569
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,840
I don't think I want to pursue this.

570
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,560
No, you don't.
You wouldn't.

571
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,480
Be nice to me.

572
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,560
A specter is haunting the world!
A specter is haunting the world!

573
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,560
A specter is haunting the world!

574
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,640
We want to think about the art of money-making.
The greeks have a word for it.

575
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,480
Chrimatistikos.
But we have to give the word a little leeway.

576
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,200
Adapt it to the current situation.
Because money has taken a turn.

577
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,880
All wealth has become wealth for its own sake.
There's no other kind of enormous wealth.

578
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,920
Money has lost its narrative quality,
the way painting did once upon a time.

579
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,560
Money is talking to itself.

580
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,720
I want this car, which I love.
The glow of the screens.

581
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
I love the screens.

582
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,120
The glow of cyber-capital.
So radiant and seductive.

583
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I understand none of this.

584
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,480
Does it ever stop? Does it slow down?

585
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
Of course not.

586
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,160
Why should it?
It's fantastic.

587
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,280
But you know how shameless I am in
the presence of anything that calls itself an idea.

588
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,760
The idea is time.
Living in the future.

589
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,120
Look at those numbers running.
Money makes time.

590
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,880
It used to be the other way around.
Clock time accelerated the rise of the capitalism.

591
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,800
People stopped thinking about eternity
and began to concentrate on hours.

592
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,040
Measurable hours, man hours,
using labor more efficiently.

593
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
It's cyber-capital
that created the future.

594
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,800
What is the measurement
called a nanosecond?

595
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,720
Ten to the minus nine power.

596
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,160
- What?
- One billionth of a second.

597
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,640
I understand none of it.

598
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,400
But it tells me how rigorous we need to be in order
to take adequate measure of the world around us.

599
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,960
There are zeptoseconds.

600
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
Good, I'm glad.

601
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,720
Yoctoseconds.
One septilionth of a second.

602
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,560
Because time is a corporate asset now.
It belongs to the free market system.

603
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
The present is harder to find.

604
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,280
It is being sucked out of the world to make way
for the future of uncontrolled markets and huge investment potentials.

605
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,360
The future becomes insistent.

606
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,120
This is why something will happen soon.
Maybe today.

607
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,160
To correct the acceleration of time
and bring nature back to normal, more or less.

608
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,640
You have to understand.

609
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,840
The more visionary the idea,
the more people it leaves behind.

610
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,400
This is what the protest is all about.

611
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Visions of technology and wealth, the force of the cyber-capital
that will send people to the gutter to retch and die.

612
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,840
What is the flaw of
human rationality?

613
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
What?

614
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,080
It pretends not to see the horror and death
at the end of the scheme it builds.

615
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,440
This is a protest against the future.

616
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,320
They want to hold off the future. They want
to normalize it, keep it from overwhelming the present.

617
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,960
The future is always a wholeness,
a sameness, we're all tall and happy there.

618
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,400
This is why the future fails.
It can never be the cruel happy place we want to make it.

619
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,240
What would happen if they'd knew
the head of Packer Capital was in the car?

620
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,920
We know what the anarchist have always said.

621
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,000
Yes.

622
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,080
Tell me.

623
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,520
The urge to destroy
is a creative thing.

624
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,520
This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought.
Enforced destruction.

625
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,040
Old industries have to be harshly eliminated.
New markets have to be forcibly claimed

626
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,200
and old markets have to be re-exploited.

627
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,040
Destroy the past. Make the future.

628
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,160
This is the thing about genius.
Genius alters the terms of its habitat.

629
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,200
Technology is crucial the civilization, why?
Because it helps us to make our fate.

630
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,160
We don't need God, or miracles
or flight of the bumblebee

631
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,880
but it is also crouched and undecidable
It can go either way.

632
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,640
You've been talking about the
future being impatient, pressing upon us.

633
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,920
That was theory. I am your
chief of theory, I deal in theory.

634
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
It's not original.

635
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
What's original?

636
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,000
He did it, didn't he?

637
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's an inappropriation.

638
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,360
He poured the gasoline
and lit the match.

639
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,080
All those Vietnamese monks
one after another in all their lotus positions.

640
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,680
Imagine the pain.

641
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,000
Sit there, feel it.

642
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,920
Immolating themselves endlessly.

643
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,880
To say something.

644
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,640
To make people think.

645
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,080
It's not original.

646
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,600
Just now.

647
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,400
What?

648
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,400
A report from the Complex,
concerns of your safety.

649
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,320
A little late, aren't they?

650
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,560
This is specific and catergorical.

651
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
There's been a threat, then.

652
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,200
Assessment, credible red.
Highest order of urgency.

653
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,960
An incursion is
already in progress.

654
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,400
Now we know.

655
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Now we have to act
now on what we know.

656
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,520
But we still want
what we want.

657
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,760
We want a haircut.

658
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,560
It's interesting,
isn't it?

659
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,240
About men and immortality.

660
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,280
You live in a tower that soars to heaven
and goes unpunished by God.

661
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,760
And you bought an airplane.

662
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,440
I've nearly forgotten this.

663
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,160
Soviet or ex-soviet.

664
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,160
A strategic bomber, capable
of knocking out a small city.

665
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,000
Is this right?

666
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,240
It's an old Tu-160.
NATO calls it Blackjack A.

667
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
It was deployed around 1988,
carries nuclear bombs and cruise missiles.

668
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
This were not included in the deal.

669
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,160
And they wouldn't let you fly it.
Could you fly it?

670
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
Could and did.

671
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,240
They wouldn't let me fly it armed.

672
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,480
Who didn't?

673
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,240
State Department.

674
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,040
The Pentagon, The Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

675
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,520
The Russians?

676
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,240
What Russians? I've bought it black market and dirt cheap
from a Belgian arms dealer in Kazakhstan.

677
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,280
That's where I took the controls,
for half hour, over the desert.

678
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
US Dollars, 31 million.

679
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,560
Where is it now?

680
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,320
Parked in a storage facility in Arizona,
waiting for replacement parts that nobody can find.

681
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,320
Sitting in the wind.

682
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,680
I go out there now and then.

683
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
To do what?

684
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,840
To look at it.

685
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,160
It's mine.

686
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,240
People will not die.

687
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,640
Isn't this the creed
of a new culture?

688
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,840
People will be absorbed
in streams of information.

689
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,840
I know nothing
about that.

690
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,120
Computers will die.

691
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,600
They're dying in
their present form.

692
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,040
They're just about dead
as distinct units.

693
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,640
A box, a screen,
a keyboard...

694
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,320
they're melting into
texture of every day life.

695
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,800
Is this true or not?

696
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,640
Even the word "computer".

697
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,040
Even the word "computer"
sounds backward and dumb.

698
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,440
You work out?

699
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,080
Six percent body fat.

700
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,720
Used to be my number.
Then I got lazy.

701
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,640
What are you gonna do about it?

702
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,400
Hit the machines in the morning and
run in the park at night.

703
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,320
Where is he now?

704
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,920
Who?

705
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,840
You know.

706
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,400
He's in the lobby. Torval.

707
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,400
He's watching them
come and go.

708
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,840
Danko's in the
hall outside.

709
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Who's that?

710
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Danko, my partner.

711
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,080
He's new.

712
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm new. He's been watching
your back for sometime now.

713
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,240
??? after these wars in the Balkans.
He's a veteran.

714
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,360
What's he gonna
say to you about this?

715
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,360
Torval.
That's who you're talking about?

716
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,240
Say his name.

717
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
What's he gonna say to you?

718
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,960
Just so you're safe.
That's the job.

719
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,560
Men get possessive.
What, you don't know this?

720
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
I heard the rumor.

721
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,800
Fact is, I technically speaking
went off-duty an hour ago, so...

722
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,120
Basically, my time
we're dealing with here.

723
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,160
Do you find this interesting?

724
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,440
What?

725
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,960
Protecting someone in danger.

726
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,280
What makes you willing to do this?
Take this risk.

727
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,000
Maybe you're worth it.

728
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,520
Maybe it's just the pay.
It's pretty good.

729
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,680
The risk?

730
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,320
I don't think about the risk.

731
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,520
You're the man in the crosshairs,
I figure the risk is yours.

732
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,680
But is it interesting?

733
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,760
It's interesting to be near
men somebody wants to kill.

734
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,400
You know what they say,
don't you?

735
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,280
The logical extension
of business is murder.

736
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,640
Move little left.

737
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,240
Move little left.

738
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,680
Nice.
Perfect.

739
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
What kind of weapon
did he give you?

740
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,400
Tazer.

741
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,400
He doesn't trust me
yet with deadly force.

742
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,520
How many volts at your disposal?

743
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,520
Hundred thousand.

744
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,920
Jams your nervous system.

745
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,520
Drop you to your knees.
Like this.

746
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,960
Stun me.

747
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,440
I mean it.
I want you to do it, Kendra,
show how it feels like.

748
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,040
I'm looking for more.

749
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Show me something
I don't know.

750
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,920
Stun me to my DNA. Come on, do it!
Click the switch!

751
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,400
Aim and fire.
I want all the voltage the weapon holds.

752
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,800
Do it!
Shoot it!

753
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,560
Now.

754
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,600
I need to know
where you're going.

755
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Wait and learn.

756
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,520
You smoke since when?

757
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,600
I took it up when
I was fifteen.

758
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,240
It's one of those things a girl takes up.
It tells her she's more than a skinny body nobody looks at.

759
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,200
There's a certain
drama in her life.

760
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,360
She notices herself.
Then other people notice her.

761
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,600
Then she marries one of them.
Then, they go to dinner.

762
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,680
You're wearing a cocktail dress.

763
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes?

764
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,840
It's navy blue.

765
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,480
Yes.

766
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,600
And that's your...
silver jewelery.

767
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,840
Yes, it is.

768
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,840
I'm noticing.

769
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,840
How was the play?

770
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,480
I left at intermission,
didn't I?

771
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,400
What was it about
and who was in it?

772
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
I'm making conversation.

773
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,440
I went on impulse.

774
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,760
The audience was sparse.

775
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,520
Five minutes after the
curtains went up, I understood why.

776
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,080
Where is your jacket?

777
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,480
Where's my jacket?

778
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,480
You were wearing a suit jacket earlier.

779
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,600
Where is your jacket?

780
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,040
Lost in the scuffle, I guess.
You saw the car.

781
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,040
We were under attack by anarchists.

782
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,040
Just two hours ago, there were major
global protests. Now, what, forgotten.

783
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,640
Something else I wish I could forget.

784
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
That's my peanuts you smell.

785
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,200
Didn't I see you come out the hotel up the
street while I was standing outside the theater?

786
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,880
Is that the hotel
you wanted to take me to?

787
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,200
We don't need a hotel.

788
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,840
We'll do it in the ladies room.

789
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,880
We'll go to the alley out back,
rattle a garbage can. Look...

790
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,280
I'm trying to make contact
in the most ordinary ways.

791
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,480
To see and hear.
To notice your mood.

792
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,920
Your clothes.

793
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,040
This is important.

794
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,000
Are your stocking on straight?
I understand this at some level.

795
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
How people look...

796
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,200
what people wear.

797
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,200
How they smell.

798
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Do you mind my saying that?

799
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,320
Am I being too wifely?

800
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,520
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

801
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,120
I don't know how
to be indifferent.

802
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,920
I can't master this.

803
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,760
And it makes me
usceptible to pain.

804
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,480
In other words, it hurts.

805
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,520
This is good.

806
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,960
We like people talking.

807
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,520
Isn't this how they talk?

808
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
How would I know?

809
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,360
My prostate is asymmetrical.

810
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
What does that mean?

811
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,720
I don't know.

812
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,000
You have to see a doctor.

813
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,280
I just saw a doctor.
I see a doctor every day.

814
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,280
You just saw a doctor.

815
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,280
That's how I know.

816
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,560
Packer Capital portfolio is being reduced to
near nothingness in the course of a day.

817
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,600
My personal fortune in the tens of billions
is in ruinous convergence with this fact.

818
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,560
And there's been a
credible threat at my life.

819
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,960
It's OK.

820
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,920
It's fine.

821
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,960
Makes me feel free in
a way I've never known.

822
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,960
That's so awful.
Don't say things like that.

823
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,680
Free to do what?
Go broke and die?

824
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,600
Listen to me, I'll help you financially.
I'll truly do what I can to help.

825
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,560
You can reestablish yourself.
At your pace, in your way.

826
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,800
Tell me what you need
and I promise I'll help.

827
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,520
But as a couple, as a marriage,
I think we're done, aren't we?

828
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,600
You speak of being free.
This is your lucky day.

829
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,280
This is very crazy.
Take over whole theater.

830
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,240
What do you think?

831
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,000
I don't know

832
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,040
I don't know either.
But I think it is crazy.

833
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,920
Looks like drug scene.
What do you think?

834
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes.

835
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,800
I think it is latest drug.
Called novo.

836
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,400
Makes pain go away.

837
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,040
Look how good they feel.

838
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,080
Kids.

839
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,560
They are kids, exactly.

840
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,600
What pain do they feel that they
need to take pill? Music?

841
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,400
Too loud. So what?

842
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,280
It is beautiful how they dance.

843
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,680
What pain do they feel
too young to buy beer?

844
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,880
There's pain enough
for everybody now.

845
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,760
I don't believe I'm here.

846
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,240
You tell me when we leave.
I'll take you out.

847
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,240
Where is he?

848
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,920
At the entrance.
Torval?

849
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,560
He watches the entrance.

850
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,320
Do you kill people?

851
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,920
What do you think?

852
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,720
Like lunch.

853
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,120
What do we know?

854
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,120
We know it's not a coup.

855
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,480
It's not an organized terror cell or
international kidnappers with ransom demands.

856
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
It's an individual.

857
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,280
Do we care?

858
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,680
We don't have a name.
But we have a phone call.

859
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,800
The Complex is analyzing
the voice data.

860
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,120
It made certain assessments. They're projecting
a course of action on the part of the individual.

861
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,920
Why can't I work up any
curiosity on the subject?

862
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,880
Because it
doesn't matter.

863
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,240
Whoever it is.
That's who it is.

864
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,560
Eric.

865
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,920
Why we're here?

866
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,920
You ain't heard?

867
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,000
What?

868
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Brother Fez.

869
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,360
What?

870
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,320
Dead.

871
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,840
No!
What? Can't be!

872
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,680
Dead. Died. Earlier today.

873
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,520
I don't know this.

874
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,000
Funeral has been
in progress all day...

875
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,400
The family wanted the city
to have a chance to pay respect.

876
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,240
Record label wanted an
exploitation event. Big and loud.

877
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,280
Street to street.
Right through the night.

878
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,640
I don't know this.

879
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,520
How can this be? I love his music.
I have his music in my elevator.

880
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,840
I know the man.
What, they've shot him?

881
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,360
Fez've been having cardiac
problems for years. Since highschool.

882
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,600
Been seeing specialists,
been seeing faith healers.

883
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,280
The heart just wore out.

884
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,680
This ain't a thug down some alley.

885
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,560
The man never been breathalyzed,
barely, since he was seventeen.

886
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,960
Hope you're not disappointed.

887
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,520
Disappointed?

888
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,800
That our man here wasn't shot!

889
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,800
Hope he didn't let you down.

890
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Natural causes,
now that's a let-down.

891
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,400
What happened to your stretch?

892
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,520
Let a fine machine degrade in public.

893
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,160
That's scandal, man.

894
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,960
Everything's a scandal.

895
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,000
Dying's a scandal,
but we all do it.

896
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,600
I think I'm hearing
voices in the night.

897
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,800
Because I can't
believe you're saying this.

898
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,800
Ask me: do I love this shit?

899
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,120
Me being big as I am and a retro-nigger.
I have to love what I'm seeing.

900
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,080
Because this is something I can never dream
of doing in my thinnest day on Earth.

901
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,960
He liked having the clergy nearby.

902
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,920
He showed up in my office once with an imam
and two white boys from Utah in suits.

903
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,360
He was always excusing
himself so he could pray.

904
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,560
He lived in a minaret,
for a while, in Los Angeles.

905
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,320
Yeah, I heard that.

906
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,040
I went to visit him once.

907
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,320
He built it next
to his house.

908
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,000
He moved out of his house
and into the minaret.

909
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,920
I'm after you long time.

910
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,840
Son of a bitch.
I glop you good.

911
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:17,080
Today you are cremed by the master
Andre Petrescu. The pastry assassin.

912
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,480
This is my mission worldwide to sabotage
power and wealth.

913
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,280
For years, I'm waiting for this.
Freshly baked only, you know.

914
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,240
I passed up the president of the United
States to make the strike.

915
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:43,880
I can creme him anytime,
but you are major statement.

916
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,560
Very hard to zero in.

917
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,240
You lack of humor, Mr. Packer.

918
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:13,800
You live up your reputation, okay, but I've been kicked and
beaten by the security so many times I'm walking dead.

919
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,880
You know they put me a radio collar
when I was in England, to save the Queen.

920
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
They tracked me like a rare crane.

921
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,160
But please, believe one thing.

922
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,440
I cremed Fidel three times
when he was in Bucharest years ago.

923
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,640
I am an action painter of cremed pies.

924
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,320
I...

925
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,440
Dropped from a tree on Michael Jordan one time.
This was the famous Flying Pie.

926
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,280
Museum quality.
Video for the ages.

927
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,000
I quiched the fucking
sultan of Brunei in his bath.

928
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,200
They put me in black hole until
I was screaming for my eyes.

929
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,840
Okay, let's go.

930
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,000
Do you play?

931
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,560
Not really my game.

932
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,960
Rugby...
Now that was my game.

933
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,800
You play?

934
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,720
Some.

935
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,080
I like the action and the pain.

936
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,040
Pump iron now.

937
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,560
Of course you understand.
There's still someone tracking you.

938
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,560
Still someone out there.

939
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,960
This was a petty incursion.

940
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,720
The whipped cream.
Technically irrelevant.

941
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,240
I understand.

942
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,240
Next time, no pies and cake.

943
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,080
Dessert...is over.

944
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:20,240
Yeah, he's out there.
And he's armed.

945
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,920
He's armed and you're armed.

946
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,200
This is true.

947
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,280
You'll have to draw your weapon.

948
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,040
This is true.

949
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,640
Let me see the thing.

950
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,480
Let you see the thing?

951
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,360
Okay.

952
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,720
Why not, you paid for it, right?

953
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,000
Manufactured in Austria.

954
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,720
Nice.

955
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,240
Smart tool.
Scary smart.

956
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,600
Voice recognition.

957
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
That's right.

958
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,480
You, what, you speak and
it knows your voice?

959
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,000
That's right.

960
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:17,360
The mechanism doesn't activate unless
the voice print matches the stored data.

961
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,240
Only my voice matches.

962
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,520
You have to speak German
before it fires?

963
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,680
No, but the voice is
only half the operation.

964
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,640
You're saying there's a code as well.

965
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,520
Preprogrammed spoken code.

966
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,640
What is it?

967
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,960
Nancy Babich.

968
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,480
We are here.

969
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,800
But how come you're such
a stranger lately?

970
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,800
Hello, Anthony.

971
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,200
Long time.

972
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,200
Long time.

973
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,200
I need a haircut.

974
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
You look like what?

975
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,720
Get in here
so I can look at you

976
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,160
Never seen such ratty hair on a human.

977
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,440
I woke up this morning
and knew it was time.

978
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,440
You knew where to come.

979
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,960
Said to myself:
"I want a haircut".

980
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,520
Maybe you wanna eat something first.

981
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,680
I could eat something.

982
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:59,080
I have takeout in the fridge that
I nibble at it when I get the urge.

983
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,560
So, you married that woman?

984
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
That's right.

985
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,280
That her family has got like money
unbeknownst.

986
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,520
Never thought you'd get married so young, but...
what do I know?

987
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:35,080
I have chickpeas all mashed up and
eggplants with rice and nuts.

988
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,880
- Give me the eggplants.
- Yeah. Good.

989
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,920
You father did not tell
your mother until he had to.

990
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,240
He went fast once they found it.
He was diagnosed and then he went.

991
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,280
You were four years old.

992
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,680
Five.

993
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,320
Exactly.

994
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,680
And you?

995
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,760
You're keeping well?

996
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,040
You know me kid.
I could tell you I can't complain.

997
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,800
But I could definitely complain.
The thing is, I don't want to.

998
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,280
Let me thing what I have
that we could drink.

999
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:19,320
Water from the tap, I drink water now.
I have a bottle of liqueur that's been there don't ask how long.

1000
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,560
I could drink some of that.

1001
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:27,160
Because if your father himself walked in here
and I offered him tap water

1002
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:33,000
oh God forbid, he would rip out my last hair.

1003
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,200
Maybe we could ask my driver to come in
my driver is outside in the car.

1004
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,280
Oh, we could give him the other eggplants.

1005
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,840
I drove a checkered
cab. Big. Bouncy.

1006
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,480
I drove nights. I was young.
What could they do to me?

1007
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,800
Night is not so good if you have
a wife and child.

1008
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,000
Besides, I can tell you, it was crazy enough
in the daytime.

1009
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I loved my cab.

1010
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,320
I drove twelve hours non-stop.
I stopped only to pee.

1011
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,760
A man is hit one day by another taxi.
Comes flying into my taxi.

1012
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,040
I mean, he was flying in the air,
crashed against the windscreen.

1013
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,880
Right there in my face.
Blood is everywhere.

1014
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,280
I never left my garage without my Windex.

1015
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,960
I am Acting Secretary of
External Affairs in a previous life.

1016
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:37,440
I said to him. Get off from there.
I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.

1017
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:42,960
I ate at the wheel.
I kept my sandwiches in tinfoil.

1018
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,320
I ate at the wheel also.
I could not afford to stop driving.

1019
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,720
Where did you pee, Ibrahim?
I peed under the Manhattan Bridge.

1020
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,760
This is where I peed exactly.

1021
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,960
I peed in parks and alleys.
I peed in the pet cemetery once.

1022
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,040
Night is better in some ways,
I am certain of it.

1023
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:15,600
I was here, what?
Probably four hours a day.

1024
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,800
Helping my father cut hair. Nights,
I drove my cab. I loved my cab.

1025
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:28,240
I had a little fan that worked on battery,
because air conditioning

1026
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,040
forget about it in that day and age.
And then, I had a drinking cup

1027
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,760
with a magnet that I stuck on the dashboard.

1028
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:42,920
I had my steering wheel upholstered, very nice, in zebra.
And my daughter, with her photograph on the visor.

1029
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,240
I give this guy his first haircut.

1030
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,240
He didn't want to sit in the car seat.

1031
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,760
His father tried to jam him in there.
He was going "no, no, no, no!"

1032
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,160
So I put him right where you're sitting now.
His father pinned him down.

1033
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:08,040
I cut his father hair when he was a kid.
Yeah, I cut his hair.

1034
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:16,280
Where is the chief of security in this situation?
I realized he's not with us.

1035
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,280
We are alone.

1036
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,280
I gave him the rest of the night off.

1037
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,840
You have protection, right, in the car?

1038
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,560
Protection?

1039
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,760
Protection.
You know what that means?

1040
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,680
I had a gun, but
I threw it away.

1041
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,320
But why?

1042
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,600
I didn't want to make plans.
I wasn't thinking ahead.

1043
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Didn't want to take precautions.

1044
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,040
You know how that sounds?
How does it sound?

1045
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,760
I thought you were some kind of big shot

1046
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,480
that destroyed people in a blink of an eye.
But you sound pretty iffy to me.

1047
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,480
This is Mike Packer's kid that had
a gun and threw it away?

1048
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,080
What is that?

1049
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,600
Yes, what is that?

1050
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,800
Yeah. In this part of town
and you had a gun

1051
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,680
There are steps you must
to take to save-guard yourself.

1052
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,680
In this part of town

1053
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,320
you cannot walk five meters after dark,
you'd be careless. They'd kill you straight away.

1054
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:20,200
You'd be reasonable with them?
They'll take a little longer, tear out your entrails first.

1055
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,160
What happened to your eye that got all twisted that way?

1056
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,800
I can see. I can drive.
I passed their tests.

1057
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,600
You were beaten and tortured.

1058
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,600
An army coup.

1059
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,600
By the secret police.

1060
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,880
Or they thought they executed you.
Fired a shot to your face.

1061
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,880
Left you for dead.

1062
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:59,320
I loved my cab.
I gulped my food.

1063
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,600
I drove twelve hours straight night after night.
Vacations? Forget about.

1064
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,080
But what did I do for protection?

1065
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,120
I need to leave.

1066
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,400
How come?

1067
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,160
I don't know how come.

1068
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,720
That's how come.

1069
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,080
But let me do the left side, at least.
So both sides are equal.

1070
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,920
I'll come back.
Take my work for it.

1071
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,440
I'll sit and you'll finish.

1072
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,240
Ibrahim.
Tell me this.

1073
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,480
Yes.

1074
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,600
These stretched limousines that fill the streets.
I've been wondering.

1075
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,600
Yes?

1076
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,800
Where are they parked at night?

1077
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:36,920
They need large tracts of space.
Out near the airports or somewhere in the Meadowlands.

1078
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,600
Long Island.
New Jersey.

1079
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,960
I will go to New Jersey.
The limo stays here.

1080
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,920
Next block there would be an
underground garage. Limos only.

1081
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,960
I would drop off your car, pick up my car
then drive home, through the stinking tunnel.

1082
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,040
Early in the morning, you could see, right here
teams of men in white coveralls

1083
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,920
they are washing limousines.
A marketplace of limos, rags flying.

1084
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,800
Eric Michael Packer!

1085
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,800
Nancy Babich.

1086
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,960
What are you doing here?

1087
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,800
That's not the question.

1088
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,400
The question is yours to answer.
Why do you wanna kill me?

1089
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,120
Now, that's not the question.
That's too easy to be the question.

1090
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,280
I want to kill you because I want
to count for something in my whole life.

1091
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,800
See how easy?

1092
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,560
You're not a reflective man.
I live consciously in my head.

1093
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,640
Give me a cigarette.

1094
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,640
Give me a drink.

1095
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,280
Do you recognize me?

1096
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,280
I can't see you clearly.

1097
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,720
Sit.
We'll talk.

1098
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,720
Yes.

1099
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,240
I'd like that.

1100
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,120
Sit and talk.
I've had a long day.

1101
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,920
Things.
People.

1102
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,280
Time for a philosophical pause.
Some reflection.

1103
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,520
Yes.

1104
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,960
You're not familiar with that weapon.
I fired that weapon.

1105
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,800
That's a serious weapon.
Whereas this...

1106
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,440
I'm thinking of installing a shooting range
in my apartment.

1107
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,400
Why not your office?
Line them up and shoot them.

1108
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,280
You know the office, is that right?
You've been in the office.

1109
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,520
Tell me who you think I am.

1110
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,760
I don't know who are you.

1111
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,680
Maybe if you'd tell me your name.

1112
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,680
You wouldn't know my name.

1113
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,640
I know names more than faces.
Tell me.

1114
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,640
Benno Levin.

1115
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,160
That's a phony name.
It's phony. It's fake.

1116
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,120
It's fake, it isn't real.

1117
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,160
But I think I recognize you now, you were
at the cash machine out side the bank

1118
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,160
some time around noon.

1119
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,160
You saw me.

1120
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,400
You looked familiar.
I didn't know why.

1121
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,040
Maybe you used to work for me.

1122
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,080
Hate me, wanna to kill me. Fine.

1123
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,640
Everything in our lives...
yours and mine

1124
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,400
has brought us to this moment.

1125
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,200
Fine.

1126
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,840
I could use a tall beer
about now.

1127
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,280
How old are you?
I'm interested.

1128
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,520
Do you think people
like me can't happen?

1129
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,960
- How old?
- We happen.

1130
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,160
Forty-one.

1131
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,200
Prime number.

1132
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,880
But...not an interesting one.

1133
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,920
Or did I turn forty-two. It's possible, because
I don't keep track. Because why should I?

1134
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,520
I've become an enigma to myself.

1135
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,520
So said St. Augustine.

1136
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,360
And herein lies my sickness.

1137
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:39,040
Well, that's a start. It's a crucial self-realization.
I'm not talking about myself.

1138
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,560
I'm talking about you.
Your whole waking life

1139
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,960
is a self-contradiction. That's why you're
engineering your own downfall.

1140
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,760
Why are you here?

1141
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,680
That's the first thing I said to you
when I came out of the toilet.

1142
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,680
I noticed the toilet.

1143
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,000
It's the first thing
I've noticed when I walked in the room.

1144
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,400
What happens to your waste?

1145
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:20,040
There's a...There's a whole below the fixture.
I knocked a hole in the floor

1146
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,880
then I positioned the toilet so that
one hole fits over the other.

1147
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,760
Holes are interesting.
There're books about holes.

1148
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,440
There're books about...
shit.

1149
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,400
But we wanna know why you would willingly

1150
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,480
enter a house where there's someone
inside that's prepared to kill you.

1151
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,880
Alright, tell me.
Why am I here?

1152
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,600
You have to tell me.

1153
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,320
Some kind of unexpected failure.

1154
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,200
Shocked your self-esteem.

1155
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,640
The yuan.

1156
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,800
I couldn't figure out the yuan.

1157
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,040
The yuan?

1158
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,720
I couldn't chart the yuan.

1159
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,000
The yuan eluded me.

1160
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,120
And so you brought everything down.

1161
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,040
This had never happened.

1162
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,240
I've become half-hearted.

1163
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,840
This is because you only have half heart.

1164
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,840
Give me a cigarette.

1165
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,280
I don't smoke cigarettes.

1166
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,080
Huge ambition and contempt...

1167
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,640
I can...

1168
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,160
list the things, name the appetites,
people.

1169
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:06,600
Mistreat some, ignore some.
Persecute others.

1170
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,800
The self-totality.

1171
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,920
The lack of remorse.

1172
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,800
These are your gifts.

1173
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,800
What else?

1174
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,440
Intuition of early death.

1175
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,840
What else?

1176
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,840
What else...

1177
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,840
Secret doubts.

1178
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,120
Doubts that you
could never acknowledge.

1179
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,120
You know some things.

1180
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,840
I know you smoke cigars.

1181
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,720
I know everything that's ever
said or written about you.

1182
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,080
I know what I see in your face

1183
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,760
after years of study.

1184
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,160
You worked for me, doing what?

1185
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,760
Currency analysis.
I worked on the baht.

1186
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,720
The baht is interesting.
I loved the baht!

1187
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,920
But your system is so micro-timed that I couldn't
keep up with it. I couldn't find it. It is so infinitesimal!

1188
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,520
Then I began to hate
my work and you

1189
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,200
and all the numbers on my screen
and every minute of my life.

1190
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,960
One hundred satang to the baht.

1191
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,560
What's your real name?

1192
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,200
You wouldn't know it.

1193
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,200
Tell me your name.

1194
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,640
Sheets.
Richard Sheets.

1195
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,480
Means nothing to me.

1196
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,920
Tell me: do you imagine that I stole
ideas from you?

1197
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,200
Intellectual property.
What does anyone imagine?

1198
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,360
A hundreds things a minute.

1199
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,920
Whether I imagine a thing or not,
it's real to me.

1200
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,120
I have syndromes. Where they real?

1201
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,000
From Malaysia, for example.

1202
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,840
The things that I believe become facts.
They have the time and space of facts.

1203
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,720
You're forcing me to be reasonable.
I don't like that.

1204
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,120
I have severe anxieties that my sex
organ is receding into my body.

1205
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,080
But it's not.

1206
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,080
Shrinking into my abdomen.

1207
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,840
But it's not.

1208
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,880
Either it is or not, I know it.

1209
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,600
Show me.

1210
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,640
I don't have to look.
There are folk beliefs.

1211
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,400
There are epidemics that happen,
men in the thousands in real fear and pain.

1212
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,760
Alright.
Alright.

1213
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,280
People like you can't happen.
I understand this.

1214
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,240
I believe it, but not the violence. No the gun.
The gun is all wrong.

1215
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,680
You're not a violent man.

1216
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,480
Violence is meant to be real
based on real motives,

1217
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,000
on forces in the world that, what, make us want
to defend ourselves or take aggressive actions.

1218
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,520
The crime you want to commit
is cheap imitation.

1219
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,760
It's a stale fantasy.
People do it because other people do it.

1220
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,080
It's just another syndrome,
it's a thing you caught from others.

1221
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,840
It has no history.
It's all history, the whole thing is history.

1222
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,720
You are foully and berserkly rich.

1223
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,120
Don't tell me about
your charities.

1224
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,640
I have no charities.

1225
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,680
You don't resent the rich,
that's not your sensibility.

1226
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,680
What's my sensibility?

1227
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:15,000
Confusion!
This is why you're unemployable.
Why?

1228
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,280
Because you wanna kill people.
That's not why I'm unemployable.

1229
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,560
Then why?
Because I stink.

1230
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,040
Smell me!

1231
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:32,760
Even when you self-destruct, you have to fail
more, lose more, die more, stink more than others.

1232
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:42,840
In...in the old tribes, the chief that destroyed more
property than the other chiefs, was the most powerful.

1233
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,840
What else?

1234
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,520
You have everything to live for,
I have nothing and neither.

1235
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,920
That's another
reason to kill you.

1236
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,680
Richard!

1237
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,280
I want to be known as Benno!

1238
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,560
You're unsettled 'cause you
feel you have no role.

1239
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,840
You have no place.

1240
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,920
But you have to ask yourself
whose fault you that is?

1241
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,760
'Cause, in fact, there's very little in the society
that you have to hate. Think!

1242
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,440
Think.

1243
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,080
Violence...
needs a cause.

1244
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,360
A truth.

1245
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,040
There's nothing in
the world but other people.

1246
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:40,040
I had this thought one day.
It was the thought of my life.

1247
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,040
I'm surrounded by
other people.

1248
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:50,760
It's "buy and sell". It's "let's have lunch".
I thought "look at them and look at me".

1249
01:29:53,120 --> 01:30:01,160
Light shines through me on the street.
I'm, what's the word, pervious to visible light.

1250
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,880
I thought, "all these other people",
I thought...

1251
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,320
How do they get to be
who they are?

1252
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,800
It's...

1253
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:19,320
...banks and car parks. It's airline tickets and their
computers. It's...restaurants filled with people

1254
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:23,200
talking. It's people signing
the merchant copy.

1255
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,640
It's people taking the merchant
copy out of the leather folder

1256
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,320
and then signing it and
separating merchant copy

1257
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:35,360
If I'm the customer copy and putting the credit
card back in their pocket, this alone could do it.

1258
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:42,400
It's people who have doctors that order
tests for them. This alone...

1259
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,440
I'm helpless in their system that makes no sense to me.

1260
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:55,120
You want me to be a helpless robot soldier

1261
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,240
and all I could be was helpless.
o.

1262
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:04,480
It's women shoes.
It's all the names they have for shoes.

1263
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,800
It's all those people in the park, behind the library.

1264
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,560
Talking in the sun.

1265
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,200
Your crime has no conscience.

1266
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,880
You haven't been driven to it by some
oppressive social force.

1267
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,880
I hate to be reasonable.

1268
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,880
You're not against the rich.
Nobody is against the rich.

1269
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,400
Everybody is ten seconds away from being
rich, or so that everybody thought.

1270
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,400
No.

1271
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,400
Your crime is in your head.

1272
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:53,680
Another fool shooting up a diner because
Bullets flying through the walls. So useless and stupid.

1273
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,640
Even your weapon is a fantasy.
What is it called?

1274
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,480
What are the attachments mounted on the barrel?
What are they called, what do they do?

1275
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,080
Alright.

1276
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:13,200
I don't have the manhood to know these names. Men
know these names. You have the experience of manhood.

1277
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:17,360
I can't think that far ahead.

1278
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,200
It's all I can do to be a person.

1279
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:29,200
Violence needs a burden.

1280
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,800
It needs a purpose.

1281
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,400
What are you doing?

1282
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,440
I don't know.

1283
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,520
Maybe nothing.

1284
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,160
My prostate is asymmetrical.

1285
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,440
So is mine.

1286
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,000
What does it mean?

1287
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:43,640
Nothing, it means nothing.
It's harmless. A harmless variation.

1288
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:48,360
Nothing to worry about.
At your age, why worry?

1289
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,800
You should have listened to your prostate.

1290
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,760
You tried to predict movements on the yuan
by drawing on patterns from nature.

1291
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,640
Yes, of course, the mathematical
properties of tree rings.

1292
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:08,040
Sunflower seeds. The limbs of galactic spirals.
I've learned this with the baht.

1293
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:12,840
I loved the cross-harmonies between nature
and data. You've taught me this.

1294
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:17,400
You've made this form of analysis horribly
and sadistically precise.

1295
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,920
But you forgot something along the way?

1296
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,240
What?

1297
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:26,720
The importance of the lopsided.
The thing that's skewed a little.

1298
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,480
You were looking for balance.

1299
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,600
Beautiful balance, equal parts,
equal sides, I know this.

1300
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,080
I know you.

1301
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,120
But you should have been tracking
the yuan in its ticks and quirks.

1302
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,080
A little quirk.
A misshape.

1303
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,480
The misweave.

1304
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,960
That's where the answer was.
In your body, in your prostate.

1305
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,840
But I still have to shoot you.

1306
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,760
Don't you ever walked through the park behind the library

1307
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,760
and see all those people setting in their little chairs
and drinking at those tables

1308
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,400
on the terrace, after work, and hear
their voices mingling in the air

1309
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,960
and want to kill them?

1310
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,280
No.

1311
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:34,080
I'm having my Korean
panic attack.

1312
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:41,800
That's from holding
in my anger all those years.

1313
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,480
But not anymore.

1314
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:50,160
You have to die, no matter what.

1315
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,280
I can tell you my situation
has changed in the course of a day.

1316
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:05,320
I have my syndromes, you have your complex.
Icarus falling. You did it to yourself!

1317
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,720
Meltdown in the sun.

1318
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:15,200
You will plunge three and half feet to your death.
It's not very heroic. Is it?

1319
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,840
Even if there's a fungus
between my toes that speaks to me.

1320
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,040
Even if the fungus told me to kill you. Even then, your death
is justified because of where you stand on Earth.

1321
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,680
For your apartment and what you paid for it.

1322
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,400
For you daily medical checkups.
This alone...

1323
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,240
Medical checkups,
every day.

1324
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,000
For the limousine that displaces the air
that people need to breath in Bangladesh.

1325
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,880
This alone.

1326
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,960
Don't make me laugh.

1327
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,760
Don't make you laugh?

1328
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,360
You just made that up. You've never spend
a minute of your life worrying about other people.

1329
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,040
Alright.

1330
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:26,480
But the air you breath,
this alone, the thought you have...

1331
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:33,720
Is there a fungus that
speaks to you? I'm serious.

1332
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,800
People hear things. They hear God.

1333
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:53,400
Anyway, you're already dead. You look like someone
already dead. Someone dead a hundred years.

1334
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,800
Many centuries dead.
Kings dead.

1335
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:02,880
Royals in their pajamas
eating mutton.

1336
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,960
Have I ever used the word "mutton" in my life?
Came in my head, out of nowhere.

1337
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,960
Mutton.

1338
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:28,280
I wanted you to heal me.
Save me.

1339
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,960
I wanted you to save me.

1340
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,000
