1
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:15,475
East Germany, Brandenburg Prison 9.
November 1989

2
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,035
Last night, many East Germans crossed the
border by just showing their IDs.

3
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,315
Several West Berliners also paid a
short visit to East Berlin.

4
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:31,235
However, it has been
announced that from 8 am onwards,

5
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:35,195
an ID card will no longer be required.

6
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:39,195
11 years later, 20 prisoners jailed during the
Communist era are still
in the Brandenburg Prison.

7
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,195
Martin Schulz is being released today.

8
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,035
Have you got everything?

9
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,755
Off you go!

10
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,035
Good luck!

11
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:34,595
See you, Martin.

12
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,475
Your driver's license, your ID

13
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,275
and your wallet.

14
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,515
And your money.

15
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,275
Please sign here.

16
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,155
So Mr. Schulz, here's your release
allowance of 800 marks,

17
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,115
a train ticket to Berlin, and

18
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,515
your release certificate.

19
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:34,915
You must contact your probation officer in Berlin.
I'm sure you know that.

20
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:39,315
Papers are there, too.

21
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,355
If you could just sign here.

22
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,075
SEASON TICKET
AMOUNT: DM 79.00

23
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,515
STANDARD FARE
AMOUNT: DM 3.90

24
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,555
Hello, may I help you?

25
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,275
Uhm ... yes.

26
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,435
I want a present for my son.

27
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,355
How old is your son? - Eleven.

28
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:10,315
What does he like? - He ...
- What are his hobbies?

29
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:14,555
Hobbies ...

30
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,435
Yes ...

31
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,955
What's he like doing? Well ...

32
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,355
When you ask me like that ...

33
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:27,195
I don't know what he does
or what his hobbies are.

34
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,515
But it should be something modern.

35
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,875
I saw an ad for it. It's something
where you press with both hands ...

36
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:36,715
A Gameboy?

37
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,755
But not a Tamagotchi.

38
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:42,115
I saw a TV program on it.
I reckon they're absurd.

39
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:45,035
Feeding an electronic pet
seems warped to me.

40
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,595
No, it's something you have
to press with both hands.

41
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,515
Perhaps just a football is better.

42
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,915
Um, hello.

43
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,795
Is this where the Schulzes live?
- Yes, it says so there.

44
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,755
Oh, yes.

45
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:12,755
And are you Rokko? - Yes.

46
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:19,795
Is your mother home? - No, at work,
and then she wanted to go shopping.

47
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:21,795
Shopping.

48
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,675
Actually I just wanted to
drop off a few presents.

49
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,635
My mother says I'm not
allowed to let strangers in.

50
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,835
Your mother's quite right.

51
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:37,675
Then I'll just put everything
in front of the door.

52
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,915
By the way, the little
package is for you.

53
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,555
Thank you.

54
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:48,275
OK. Goodbye, Rokko.

55
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,075
Piss off!

56
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,275
Piss off, I said.

57
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,355
Leave me alone!

58
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,955
Piss off!

59
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,995
Piss off, I'm going to jump.

60
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:50,115
Leave me alone. Piss off, I said.

61
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:53,955
Clear off! Piss off!

62
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,675
It's at least a 15 meter jump.

63
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,875
2 or 3 seconds, and you're gone.

64
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,195
But if you jump, then ...

65
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,915
...I'll jump, too.
-Piss off! Piss off!

66
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,675
Leave me alone!

67
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:09,275
Are you crazy?

68
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,395
Don't you recognize me?

69
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,475
Piss off!

70
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,275
Leave me alone!

71
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,795
Calm down.

72
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:20,995
Calm down.

73
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:26,555
Martin!

74
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:29,955
Martin!

75
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:33,075
What's wrong with you, what's wrong?

76
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:37,915
After reunification,

77
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,595
I went over to the West,
to a building site in Stuttgart.

78
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:45,715
Are you from East Germany?
Eastie, can you lift this?

79
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:50,275
Over there, their own people come
first, then Giuseppe, then Achmed,

80
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:53,035
then "Easties" right at
the bottom.

81
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:54,315
"Eastie"!

82
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,195
I couldn't take it, and
came back to Berlin.

83
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:00,155
I worked a while
as a floorer ...

84
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,835
... now they say
interior designer.

85
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,435
And then I wanted
to set up on my own.

86
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,835
That was all so complicated.

87
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,395
My last job was as an "ice-man".

88
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,715
Frozen goods.

89
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,475
An "ice-man".

90
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:24,555
"Ice is Nice" was
written on the van.

91
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:28,435
I got my truck license specially.

92
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:34,915
Then I forgot to shut the back, and
all the stuff fell out on the street.

93
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:36,515
That was it.

94
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:42,595
Then you sit with a woman in a pub,
and she asks what you do for a living.

95
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,995
And I say nothing, simply nothing.

96
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,155
You know how women are.

97
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,995
If you have nothing, you are nothing.

98
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:55,275
Yes ... and then

99
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:59,155
I thought, "I'll jump off the roof

100
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,875
and put an end to my misery".

101
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:07,195
But I didn't even manage that.

102
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,595
I'm not even capable of that.

103
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,355
Do you have a handkerchief?

104
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:19,555
Martin?

105
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,955
Could you give us two beers, Ute?
- I won't do it on tab anymore.

106
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:31,875
I'll pay, OK?

107
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,275
Thanks, Martin.

108
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:52,235
And what's Manfred doing?

109
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,635
Haven't seen him for ages.

110
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:57,235
And Enrique?

111
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,875
Haven't seen him for ages either.

112
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,835
Well, if it isn't Mr. Pau!

113
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:04,875
What a surprise!

114
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,155
- Kurt, if you want to make trouble, get out.
- Don't interfere

115
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,315
get me a beer.

116
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:15,315
When do I see my money again?

117
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,675
Do you owe him money? - Yes.

118
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,155
Who's this here?

119
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:24,995
We don't like tourists here, do you?
-How much d'you owe him? - 300 marks.

120
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:28,755
Here, take your dosh and get out.

121
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:30,995
Is Daddy paying for you?

122
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:34,955
OK, the Party thanks you.

123
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:38,075
Have you been in a gay bar, meeting
such generous people?

124
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:40,275
Piss off!

125
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,475
Come on, get out of here!

126
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,035
Listen here!

127
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,355
Don't try talking to
me like that, you motherfucker.

128
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,475
You alright? - Yeah, I'm alright.

129
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:38,595
We could go to my place. You can
sleep over. - No, I'm OK. I'll be off.

130
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:40,035
Go home.

131
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,675
Martin?

132
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:03,275
Despite being almost totally submerged,

133
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:07,795
they can breathe, smell, see and hear.

134
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,875
They sink down silently,

135
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:14,635
their lungs holding enough
air for 5 minutes.

136
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:18,315
Buoyancy and gravity are
more or less equal.

137
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:22,515
Above water, there's turmoil again.

138
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,555
Hippopotamuses are known
for their aggression.

139
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:30,835
Their powerful jaws and sharp
teeth are dangerous weapons,

140
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,035
but most scuffles end peacefully.

141
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,475
Martin!

142
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,835
What a surprise!

143
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:44,875
But why the TV? Why didn't
you leave it for the others?

144
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:48,635
They've all got one.
I brought your picture, too.

145
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,755
Two jailbirds sat before the bank,
one was smelly, the other stank.

146
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,955
Then Smelly said to Stank:
I'll sit in front of another bank.

147
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,515
What's it mean? - It's poetry.

148
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:01,715
No, Victor, it's shit. - It's not shit.

149
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,235
Hubes got 3 years more.

150
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,035
He tried it on
with a social worker.

151
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:12,435
And Bucki? - Still the
warders' best friend.

152
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:13,955
And Ralli ...

153
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,635
... is in the looney bin.

154
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,595
He lost it a few months ago.

155
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,275
He kept hitting his
head against the wall.

156
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:23,675
They just took him away.
But he had life anyway.

157
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,515
And you?

158
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,035
Any plans?

159
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:29,355
Well ...

160
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,435
... to slowly get back into things.

161
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,395
My wife's with another
guy ... - You knew that!

162
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,835
Yes, I knew, but it's still strange
seeing her with someone else.

163
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,835
And your son?

164
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:45,515
At least I've seen him
for the first time.

165
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,515
And you?

166
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:48,995
Porn?

167
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:52,115
I'm ... I'm in retirement, Martin.

168
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,355
I see nothing, I hear nothing!

169
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:00,835
Do you want to go in?

170
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:05,595
For you it's free.

171
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,035
Live show!

172
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:03,115
Have you been here before?

173
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:06,075
Or ... is it your first time?

174
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:11,035
Do you like it?

175
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,195
Shall I ...

176
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,835
... tell you my prices?

177
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:26,555
One ... two ... three.

178
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,075
Can you speak Russian?

179
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:31,795
I understand ... a little.

180
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:34,755
Where did you learn? Are you from ...

181
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:36,715
... East Germany?

182
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:39,315
My mother ... was ...

183
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,235
a Russian teacher ...

184
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:43,435
in an East German school.

185
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,395
I'm not stupid, little soldier.

186
00:24:57,635 --> 00:25:01,315
Good morning, Mr. Schulz. Oh, sorry, did we wake you?
- Yes

187
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,075
We're from the Berlin News.

188
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:11,275
We chose your address at random,
and would like to do a short interview.

189
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,155
May we come in?

190
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,395
Thank you.

191
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:27,875
Do you like it? - Nice.
A bit big, maybe.

192
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:32,875
Here's information on
opening a savings account,

193
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:35,835
this is to help you
find an apartment,

194
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:41,235
here are job center addresses, something
on health and pension schemes,

195
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,955
and here's your new tax card.

196
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:46,315
An application for social welfare.

197
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:49,515
A job training program
is also possible.

198
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:54,835
And I've also prepared an
application for supervised lodgings.

199
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:58,075
I'd rather stay in the hotel,
and find work myself.

200
00:25:58,555 --> 00:25:59,595
That's alright.

201
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:05,035
But you'll have to come here
regularly so we can monitor progress.

202
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:07,435
I recommend our workshops.

203
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:11,315
I take the art therapy, and
would love to see you there.

204
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:14,555
Take a look at the
pictures on the wall.

205
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:23,435
Now you can see when it's our turn.
We've 345, and it's showing 325.

206
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,715
So there are 20 people to go.

207
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:27,995
Do I need my passport? - Of course.

208
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:32,235
Here's the Berlin News' card. They asked
where I was when the Wall came down.

209
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,275
Here, look.

210
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:38,915
They should've asked me.
Do you know where I was?

211
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:40,715
No. - Didn't I write? - No.

212
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:43,315
I was sitting in a tank. The T72.

213
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:47,035
Not an animal, not a man,
but an armored infantryman.

214
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:50,755
That was October '89, with
the demos on the Alexanderplatz.

215
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,755
We all knew what was up.
We had to give blood.

216
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:56,075
They asked for our blood groups.

217
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:59,555
We gave blood and got in
the tanks. The square was full.

218
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,595
I wouldn't have known what
to do if we'd mobilized.

219
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:05,475
You couldn't talk, the
Stasi were always there.

220
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,115
They'd have let us fire,
like in China. And me in a T72!

221
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:19,115
Profession? - Engine fitter.

222
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:26,435
Where did you train? - Karl
Liebknecht transformer works.

223
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,515
What was your last
place of employment?

224
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,755
Where was your
last place of employment?

225
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:39,235
In Brandenburg. -With What firm?

226
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:45,275
In the metalworking shop
of the Brandenburg Penitentiary.

227
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,075
Floorer, interior designer.

228
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:56,155
You can't call me at home,
because I'm in a telephone box.

229
00:27:56,635 --> 00:28:00,195
But you can call me here.
The number is 4-6-7-2-3-9-8.

230
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,315
Yes, goodbye.

231
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,315
Yes, I'm a fitter.

232
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:08,715
Of course I've got experience.

233
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:11,875
The last thing I did was
installation work abroad.

234
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,595
Ringing me at home is difficult, but

235
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:18,115
you can get me in this telephone box.

236
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:22,595
I'll wait for your call.
The number is 4-6-7-2-3-9-8.

237
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:23,915
4-6-7...

238
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,075
... hello?

239
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,835
Hello? - What's wrong? - Hung up.

240
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,755
Hello.

241
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:32,795
Hello.

242
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:35,555
I thought ...

243
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:37,915
... I'd just come ...

244
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,555
... to see how you are.
You're looking good.

245
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,715
Thanks.

246
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:45,475
You, too.

247
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,595
What are you doing tonight?

248
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:56,995
Today's bad, we've got visitors.

249
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,395
Perhaps we could ...

250
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,595
Wait.

251
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,555
Here's a visiting card from work.

252
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:13,475
My telephone number's on it.
You can ring me there.

253
00:30:14,115 --> 00:30:14,875
I mean ...

254
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:19,475
... we could organize something.
It'd be nice if you rang. – OK.

255
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,035
See you.

256
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:38,995
Martin?

257
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,395
Don't you want to come in?

258
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,795
Yes.

259
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,155
... and then we go to Spain or Portugal.

260
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:59,475
This is Martin, an old friend.

261
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:01,995
Martin. - Petra. Pierre. – Pierre? Pierre.

262
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:09,675
Wolfgang.

263
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:11,115
Martin.

264
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:13,035
Take a seat.

265
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:24,995
Can I offer you a drink?
- Yes. I won't say no.

266
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:27,395
I'll bring a glass.

267
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:34,275
Are you hungry?

268
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,675
What is it? - Paella.
It's Spanish.

269
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:40,955
Thanks.

270
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,275
Thanks.

271
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:49,955
Tastes good.

272
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,835
Tastes really good.

273
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,235
Nothing beats watching other
people eat, does it?

274
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,835
Are you finished? - Yes.

275
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:06,475
Superb. - Thanks.

276
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:09,995
Thanks.

277
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:12,755
You too?

278
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:16,475
Where do you all come from?

279
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:19,395
I'm from South
Germany, like Wolfgang.

280
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:23,275
I only know South
Germany from TV.

281
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:24,995
Wolfgang and I...

282
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:26,875
... studied together.

283
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:29,035
Oh, did you?

284
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,795
And you? - I'm from
near Marseilles.

285
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,315
Marseilles.

286
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:38,395
France. Only seen
that on TV too.

287
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:45,515
Where the bottle once was
full now stands a coffin.

288
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:50,555
Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin.
-Cheers!

289
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,515
Cheers!

290
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:01,355
Are you a writer? - Me? No.

291
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,195
Not me.

292
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:06,395
I just had a lot of time to read.

293
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,915
I liked the Russians best,
Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Pushkin.

294
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:15,075
They've no idea about politics,
but they can really write.

295
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:21,875
Is he a writer?
- No, I asked if he was, but ...

296
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:23,275
Manuela?

297
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:27,195
Rokko's already in bed, I suppose.

298
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:31,035
Yes. He went to bed a
quarter of an hour ago.

299
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:08,475
Thank you.

300
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:23,635
No, no need. I don't light them.
-But you can smoke here.

301
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:26,355
No, I don't smoke anymore.
-What do You mean?

302
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,515
It comes with time.

303
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:30,835
I haven't for years.

304
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:35,155
I'd like to ask you something.

305
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:40,755
You're from East Germany, too. What
were you doing when the Wall came down?

306
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:42,475
Sorry ...

307
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,595
... I'm so curious, but ...

308
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,835
... I always find
the stories so exciting.

309
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,075
Do you really want
to know? - Yes.

310
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,715
I was in the army.

311
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:55,835
National People's Army.

312
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:57,835
Armored division.

313
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:01,635
Not an animal, not a man,
but an armored infantryman.

314
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:06,235
All my friends
were in the streets.

315
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,475
My wife was
pregnant with our son.

316
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:14,435
And I sat in a tank waiting
for the order to move in.

317
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:21,755
It was terrible.

318
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,395
The hospitals stocked up on blood.

319
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:29,435
The soldiers had to donate blood.

320
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:32,315
You couldn't say anything,

321
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:35,435
because someone from
the Stasi was always there.

322
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,635
Anyway ... I got up,

323
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:45,835
and said, "Do what you want,
but I'm not shooting at my wife.

324
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:48,235
I'll take the tank ...

325
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,235
and drive it into a tree".

326
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:09,075
What do we do now?

327
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,835
Can you be quieter?
- Yes, but what should we do?

328
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:17,235
What do you want to do?
- I'd send for a taxi right away.

329
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:19,355
No way.

330
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,195
What do you mean, "no way"?

331
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,155
OK, then I'll just go to bed.

332
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,275
Why aren't you sleeping?

333
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,835
I did some English homework.

334
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,435
You were all so loud.

335
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:07,715
Good.

336
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,195
But that's enough now.

337
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,795
It's late. Sleep well.

338
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:25,515
Wouldn't it be better to lock the
bedrooms?

339
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,915
With your husband here.
-Don't start that again.

340
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,395
He seems so strange.

341
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:34,795
I know you lost contact with him, but

342
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,875
He looks like he
just got out of jail.

343
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:45,915
I'm sorry. I haven't
anything against him.

344
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:49,675
But it's weird how
he just turned up ...- Martin.

345
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:53,035
He really has just
got out of jail.

346
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,715
How do you know that?

347
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,195
I always have.

348
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,555
He went to jail in July 1989.

349
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:18,355
Before the Wall came down.

350
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:22,915
We had just married, and
I was pregnant with Rokko.

351
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:28,555
It all started in the spring of 1989.

352
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,955
I was at home on my own.

353
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:36,795
The doorbell rang.

354
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:43,675
Is your husband home,
Mrs. Schulz? - No, he's at work.

355
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:49,075
I've found an irregularity in the
list of occupants of this house.

356
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:51,795
Two weeks ago you
had West Germans here.

357
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:56,195
But you didn't register
them in the house list.

358
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:57,635
But why?

359
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:02,395
They were friends of friends,
and we registered them with the police.

360
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:06,555
Please write the names and
addresses of your visitors in the list.

361
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:09,275
So that's done.

362
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:13,035
Now for another delicate matter.

363
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:17,035
I found something in your cellar

364
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:20,235
that really worries me.

365
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,475
Mrs. Schulz,

366
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:24,915
I'm worried about your husband.

367
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:30,595
You know it's really my duty to
put these things into the right hands.

368
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,275
I don't need to tell you that crossing
the border illegally is an offence.

369
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,155
Mrs. Schulz,

370
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:41,875
I only want to help.
-He had us in his power. - Go away!

371
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:43,795
And I was scared.

372
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,035
Simply scared.

373
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,355
Actually ...

374
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:57,275
I didn't want to tell
Martin the whole story.

375
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:00,435
I shouldn't have told him.

376
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:03,435
I simply shouldn't have told him.

377
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:07,675
What happened then?

378
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:12,715
When I ...

379
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:15,435
When I visited Martin in jail,

380
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,675
he told me that he ...

381
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,875
... counted his
steps until he arrived.

382
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:27,355
He kept wondering
whether to turn back.

383
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,995
Where are my things?

384
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:39,915
Mr. Schulz!

385
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:44,835
It could look bad for you if your
equipment got into the wrong hands.

386
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:46,275
I want my things.

387
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:50,315
It'd be better to let me and
the authorities deal with it.

388
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:54,355
Give them to me! - Mr. Schulz,
I only want to help you.

389
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,915
I talked it over with your wife.

390
00:40:57,395 --> 00:41:01,715
We talked about your class
attitudes. - Give me my things!

391
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:05,755
We can talk about everything,
class attitudes, solidarity ...

392
00:41:06,235 --> 00:41:07,955
... but give me back my things.

393
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,075
My name is rokko shultz

394
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:51,115
I am a boy from Berlin

395
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,235
Berlin is in Germany

396
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:22,555
What brings you
here at this hour?

397
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,755
I need somewhere to sleep.

398
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,835
In 1974, what song
won the ...?

399
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:52,155
Wolfgang! -Waterloo?
- Eurovision prize.

400
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:55,395
What author gave his name to the literature

401
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,915
prize Cologne has been awarding since ...

402
00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:00,435
Andreas! - Heinrich Böll? - Yes!

403
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:03,915
Good night. - Good night.

404
00:44:09,235 --> 00:44:12,435
What German city
has the number plate HRO?

405
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:14,955
Rostock? - Yes ...

406
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:29,035
Good morning. - Morning.

407
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:30,435
Thanks.

408
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:51,915
THE LAST EASTIE

409
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:59,955
I've got a question about an
article in your local section.

410
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:01,915
Yes, about that man.

411
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:06,955
Can you tell me in
what hotel he's in?

412
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:09,435
Oh.

413
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,235
Then I'll come by.
Is my ID enough?

414
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:14,915
See you soon. Bye.

415
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,035
Your husband's left.

416
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:29,195
Oh.

417
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:32,355
Did he tell you where
he was going? - No.

418
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:34,475
I've even got his stuff here.

419
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:38,395
You can have it
if you pay his bills.

420
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:42,835
Your husband talked about you
a lot. When did you lose contact?

421
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:44,635
Years ago, wasn't it?

422
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:47,915
Yes. He didn't want
me to come anymore.

423
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:50,355
Why wasn't I told of his release?

424
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:54,635
You have to apply for that yourself.
We can't do everything. – Oh.

425
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:57,155
Has he already visited you?

426
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,235
Yes, briefly. He came
at a bad moment.

427
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,515
I'll be frank with you.

428
00:46:02,995 --> 00:46:06,315
Your husband's case is special.
He isn't a criminal, and his offence ...

429
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:10,515
... was unusual. But a long sentence
always has the same effects.

430
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:13,715
He'll get in touch after
a success or a disappointment.

431
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:16,875
If he can't cope at first,
he'll need your help.

432
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:19,515
You shouldn't promise
him too much.

433
00:46:19,995 --> 00:46:22,675
That could make him overreact
if he's disappointed.

434
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:27,235
But don't apply for divorce or
withdraw custody of his son yet.

435
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:29,515
That would be too much for him.

436
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,795
He needs you, but he also
has to become independent.

437
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:37,035
He didn't say anything. I said he
could stay here but he didn't want to.

438
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:39,515
Then he said he'd be in touch.

439
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:43,515
Nothing about his plans?

440
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:45,355
No. Not a word.

441
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:49,075
Maybe he's gone on holiday.
You never know with Martin.

442
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:54,275
Here are the keys ...

443
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:57,915
... to get in, for the till, and so on.

444
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,435
I don't know if this is my thing.

445
00:47:00,915 --> 00:47:01,835
What?

446
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:08,475
I bust a gut getting you a job,
and it's not good enough for you?

447
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,835
Have you got a better one?

448
00:47:11,315 --> 00:47:16,235
Don't think about what you shouldn't
do. Think about what you should do.

449
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:24,715
Dolores from Cuba,

450
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:27,275
Lee from Hong Kong,

451
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:29,795
Magda from the Czech Republic,

452
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,795
Asye from Turkey,

453
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:35,035
Petra from Lichtenberg ...

454
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:37,195
Well, hello!

455
00:47:37,995 --> 00:47:39,275
Why are you here?

456
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:42,795
He's going to work and live here.
- I'm just helping out.

457
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:47,075
You mostly have late shift, don't you?
- Leiwand! Clever boy, aren't you!

458
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:51,475
I thought she was Russian.
- "Leiwand!" "Totally leiwand!"

459
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:54,315
That's the way they talk in Vienna.

460
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:55,715
Leiwand.

461
00:47:56,315 --> 00:47:57,995
Natasha, live show!

462
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:03,275
What about the door?
- Oh, yes.

463
00:48:07,475 --> 00:48:09,475
Natasha, it's a couple.

464
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:16,395
I'd like Natasha, please.

465
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:17,795
OK.

466
00:48:18,635 --> 00:48:20,115
Natasha, live show. Sorry.

467
00:48:21,075 --> 00:48:22,115
Well?

468
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,435
Have you already finished? - Yes.

469
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,035
Tell me ...

470
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,715
Why do you pretend to be
Russian when you aren't?

471
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:49,235
It sells better.

472
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:50,955
Oh.

473
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:53,235
What's your real name?

474
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:54,635
Guess.

475
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:57,675
Erika?

476
00:49:04,835 --> 00:49:07,435
I don't know. What could
your name be? Andrea?

477
00:49:07,915 --> 00:49:09,035
No, come on.

478
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:11,515
Wait, wait ... Ursel?

479
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:13,795
No way! - Mata Hari?

480
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:15,915
Oh, please! - She was a dancer!

481
00:49:16,395 --> 00:49:18,555
You're being dumb.
- Then tell me!

482
00:49:19,035 --> 00:49:20,075
Ludmila.

483
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:21,715
Ludmila.

484
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,955
Ludmila. - Nice Name.

485
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:26,315
Thanks.

486
00:50:29,795 --> 00:50:30,795
How much?

487
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:33,035
Enrique?

488
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:36,115
Martin? How long've
you been out?

489
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:40,635
How're you doing? - Pretty
well. And you? - Fine.

490
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:44,435
My old pal!

491
00:50:46,035 --> 00:50:47,475
And Gisela? Still around?

492
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:50,915
Of course. Here she
is with my son.

493
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:56,235
It's amazing seeing you again.

494
00:50:57,035 --> 00:50:58,235
Unbelievable.

495
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:05,955
Take care. – Thanks.
See you. - See you.

496
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,235
See you. – Goodbye

497
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,715
A former colleague of mine.

498
00:51:13,955 --> 00:51:15,275
Where do we go now?

499
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:18,075
How many students live
here? - No idea.

500
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:20,515
200?

501
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:24,515
I don't have any contact.
It's all pretty anonymous here.

502
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:29,795
The exchange program pays for
the apartment. That's why I'm here.

503
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,115
It's cheaper, you see?

504
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,835
And where exactly do you come from?

505
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:44,715
Do you really want to know?

506
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:48,795
OK. Well ...

507
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:52,955
... my mother comes from
Skopje in Macedonia,

508
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:56,235
my father from Kiev in the Ukraine.

509
00:53:56,995 --> 00:53:58,635
I was born in Belgrade,

510
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:00,915
grew up in Zagreb,

511
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,675
and then I went to Vienna.

512
00:54:04,155 --> 00:54:06,075
That's pretty complicated.

513
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:12,195
Complicated.

514
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:48,675
So how's things?

515
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:51,075
Hey! - Hey, Martin! Hey!

516
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:54,795
I keep getting extra games.
By the way, Manuela visited me.

517
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:58,955
What? Manuela came to see you?
- Yeah. She asked for you.

518
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:01,595
Watch, Martin!

519
00:56:04,515 --> 00:56:07,115
Oh, isn't that cool? Listen to that!

520
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:09,675
Martin!

521
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:12,075
I've made a mint!

522
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:17,555
280, 290, 300 marks.

523
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:19,595
And the bag's for free.

524
00:56:20,075 --> 00:56:20,995
Great!

525
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:25,915
Know who I saw?
- Who? - Enrique.

526
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:28,955
Enrique? Haven't seen him for ages.

527
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:32,075
I'd like to see him
again. What's he up to?

528
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:35,195
Do you have his number?

529
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:39,315
What, you've got a mobile?
- Yeah. An investment, Martin.

530
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:41,715
No more telephone boxes for me!

531
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:42,635
18... - Yes.

532
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:44,595
20... - Yes.

533
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:47,715
2...3...4...

534
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:49,875
7... -Yes.

535
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:51,275
30... -Yes.

536
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:53,475
Gone.

537
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:57,035
I've got nothing again.
- You're holding back again.

538
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:06,755
I'll discard you ... and you.

539
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,635
We're playing grand, friends.

540
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:15,075
With grand you play your
aces or shut your faces.

541
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:21,915
Man, has he got luck!

542
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:30,515
I'd like a hand like that!

543
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:34,355
If it goes on like this,
we'll be poor.

544
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:37,435
Look what I've brought.

545
00:57:38,475 --> 00:57:40,555
Martin, that's you.

546
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:42,435
Till and Manfred.

547
00:57:43,315 --> 00:57:45,075
Peter, that's you. - Me? Yes..

548
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,795
And this is me ...
the mandatory Cuban

549
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,915
How long ago was
that? '86, '87? - Yes.

550
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,395
You were still young and beautiful!

551
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,595
Good for a medal!

552
00:57:58,915 --> 00:57:59,875
18.
- Yes.

553
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:01,075
20.
- Yes.

554
00:58:01,555 --> 00:58:02,475
22.
- Yes.

555
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:04,915
Gone. - Go on.

556
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,235
..0. - Yes.

557
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,355
24... 27...
- Yes.

558
00:58:08,955 --> 00:58:09,715
30? - Yes.

559
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,235
Peter!

560
00:58:13,235 --> 00:58:16,675
33... 35... 36...

561
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:20,115
What's a nigger doing
on your balcony, Peter?

562
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:23,395
Stop yelling, we're playing skat.

563
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,755
Let's have a look at you, nigger!

564
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,515
Isn't that the guy from
the pub? - Yes.

565
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:30,835
Watch it or we'll come over!

566
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:36,155
Are they sick?

567
00:58:37,115 --> 00:58:38,275
They're just kids.

568
00:58:41,315 --> 00:58:44,555
Are we going to stand for this?
- No, I don't think we are.

569
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:48,595
I'll hold the fort, OK?

570
00:58:53,515 --> 00:58:57,555
You lot are in for it now!
No more "uuh uuh uuh"!

571
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:06,995
Good stuff!

572
00:59:08,155 --> 00:59:09,115
Get 'em!

573
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:11,235
Yes! Look out, Martin!

574
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:13,075
Good, Enrique!

575
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:23,595
What do you want with that?
- You know, Martin ...

576
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:26,315
... some guys run around with guns.

577
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:29,515
As a taxi driver,

578
00:59:30,075 --> 00:59:31,795
you've got to watch it.

579
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:35,035
Get in.

580
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:42,555
This is some car! Can I drive?

581
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:43,995
Top left.

582
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:45,755
Hand brake.

583
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:49,315
On the left ...

584
00:59:50,315 --> 00:59:53,315
... clutch, in the middle ...
brake, on the right ... accelerator.

585
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:56,195
Like in the East. - Like in the East.

586
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,835
Oh, a lovely sound!

587
01:00:03,955 --> 01:00:06,075
Now press the accelerator gently.

588
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,115
Daring, Mr. Wenz, very daring.

589
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:07,595
Did you see your father?
- Yes. - Good.

590
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:09,355
Yesterday.

591
01:01:09,995 --> 01:01:12,235
I can go, can't I? - Yes.

592
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:19,115
Ciao.

593
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,955
How's it looking, Mr. Schulz?

594
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:25,315
Wow, great! Really great!

595
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:31,035
Your wife came to inquire about you.
Aren't you in the hotel anymore?

596
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:33,435
Manuela? What did she want?

597
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:35,595
She asked where you're living.

598
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:40,835
While you're under supervision you
must always tell us your address.

599
01:01:41,315 --> 01:01:44,115
I'm staying with Peter Pau.
I'll give you the address.

600
01:01:44,595 --> 01:01:46,995
Make sure you do. - Yes. - Good.

601
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:04,315
Why were you in the same jail?

602
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,555
I'll tell you why.

603
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:09,915
In 1990 after the reunification,

604
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:13,035
I did a bank job in the East.

605
01:02:13,555 --> 01:02:17,035
I was given years in Brandenburg jail...

606
01:02:17,555 --> 01:02:19,155
I've seen many jails

607
01:02:19,795 --> 01:02:21,195
... in my life

608
01:02:21,755 --> 01:02:25,435
But I've never experienced
something like Brandenburg

609
01:02:26,795 --> 01:02:27,755
When I came ...

610
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:29,515
... to our story,

611
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:32,435
there was ...

612
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,195
... a white towel on the floor.

613
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:41,355
A freshly laundered white towel.

614
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:45,755
All the prisoners stood there,
Martini as well.

615
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:48,115
I was just about ...

616
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:51,235
to step over the towel.

617
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:54,275
But that seemed too much bother.

618
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:59,515
And with my dirty shoes,

619
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:03,275
I trod right on top of the towel.

620
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:08,755
That was the "towel test".

621
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:11,795
If you trod on it, you were OK,
if you didn't, they had it in for you.

622
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,515
What did you do?

623
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:15,355
Me?

624
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:19,035
Well ...

625
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:20,715
... I saw the towel,

626
01:03:21,915 --> 01:03:23,195
picked it up,

627
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:25,875
and asked who'd lost their towel.

628
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:30,075
Like that.

629
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,835
Is that Rokko? - Yes.

630
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,835
He's just as small as I was.
- Then you were really small.

631
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:31,395
Did you see?

632
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,635
That's Manuela's new boyfriend.

633
01:04:34,115 --> 01:04:35,275
He's a teacher.

634
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:36,915
What a shit!

635
01:05:27,755 --> 01:05:28,675
Hello.

636
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:30,675
Hello.

637
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:37,875
I'd like to book a trip.

638
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:41,915
I want to find out what
sorts of things are available.

639
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,755
Aha. Where do you want to go?

640
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:47,355
I don't know.

641
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:49,515
What's on offer?

642
01:05:50,315 --> 01:05:54,355
Far away destinations are very popular.
Venezuela, Mexico, Australia,

643
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:58,755
- Australia. Australia's good.

644
01:05:59,235 --> 01:06:00,155
Australia.

645
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:03,795
You can fly to Sydney or Melbourne.

646
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:08,155
It'd be best to book for the school
holidays so my son can come along.

647
01:06:09,395 --> 01:06:11,715
Why would I go to
Australia on my own?

648
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,315
My idea is to do my taxi license ...

649
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:18,035
You drive a taxi? - Yes, the test's
soon, and when I get the job,

650
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:19,755
I want to see Rokko.

651
01:06:20,235 --> 01:06:22,195
To collect him at school in the taxi.

652
01:06:22,715 --> 01:06:25,035
One day he'll ask who
his dad is anyway.

653
01:06:25,555 --> 01:06:27,795
But Rokko's 11 - I know
how old my son is.

654
01:06:28,915 --> 01:06:30,795
I don't want to
interfere with your life.

655
01:06:31,275 --> 01:06:34,715
But I waited 11 years for one
thing. I want to see my son.

656
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,155
And for him to know
who his dad is.

657
01:06:37,755 --> 01:06:40,195
Having a cabby as
dad's OK, isn't it?

658
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:47,435
As usual there are questions on
streets and buildings and so on.

659
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:52,115
Yes ... the test's in
the registration office.

660
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:56,315
You from Berlin? - Yes, so to speak.

661
01:06:56,795 --> 01:06:58,875
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

662
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:02,995
Have you got someone to
test you and help you learn?

663
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:04,875
Yes, my wife.

664
01:07:05,475 --> 01:07:07,475
Then we'll put you down for the test.

665
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:09,875
So, my friend.

666
01:07:10,955 --> 01:07:12,475
All of this by heart.

667
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:17,035
That's hard. So ... Lenin Square
... no, United Nations Square ...

668
01:07:17,515 --> 01:07:21,035
... into Friedensstrasse,
then up Greifswalderstrasse,

669
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:25,595
left into Dimitroffstrasse,
is now Danzigerstrasse,

670
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,155
then right at Schönhauser Allee,

671
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:32,395
then left into Schivelbeinerstrasse ...
- Wait!

672
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,835
Once Willi Bredel Strasse.

673
01:07:35,315 --> 01:07:36,995
Schivelbeinerstrasse, then

674
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:39,435
onto Helmut Just Strasse,

675
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:43,275
now has a different name ...
- Behmstrasse.

676
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:46,315
Behmstrasse. Who thought of that?

677
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,915
So anyway, Behmstrasse,

678
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:52,715
then up Norwegerstrasse, and
there's Bornholmerstrasse Station.

679
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,075
You're good at the East.
Just forget the old names.

680
01:07:56,555 --> 01:07:58,475
Let's do a route in the West.

681
01:08:00,315 --> 01:08:02,115
Ruhleben to Heerstrasse Station.

682
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:03,675
That's easy.

683
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:08,595
Reichstrasse, Reichsportfeldstrasse,
Theodor Heuss Square, Heerstrasse,

684
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:11,275
and the station's on your left.

685
01:08:13,395 --> 01:08:14,435
Good.

686
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:29,515
Hello. - Hi. - Your taxi?

687
01:09:30,715 --> 01:09:31,835
Yes, almost.

688
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:35,795
It belongs to a friend, but soon
I'll have my own. Is Rokko in?

689
01:09:36,315 --> 01:09:37,915
Come in, I'll open the door.

690
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,595
This is where I can
buy players and ...

691
01:09:44,075 --> 01:09:45,515
... sell players.

692
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:49,395
Now I'll play a game.

693
01:09:55,115 --> 01:09:58,795
Now I can pick the players,
but I never play myself.

694
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,115
Haven't you any influence?

695
01:10:03,195 --> 01:10:04,955
I can put on substitutes,

696
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,355
but that's all. Here you can see

697
01:10:07,835 --> 01:10:12,475
what day the game's on, and
here's when the next game is.

698
01:10:13,395 --> 01:10:16,395
But I don't have
a game every time.

699
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:19,515
But now I have one.

700
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:22,915
We'll play this one?

701
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:24,835
Go on.

702
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:26,515
OK.

703
01:10:27,075 --> 01:10:30,115
I can change the team.
I can say that the ...

704
01:10:30,595 --> 01:10:32,555
... trainer selects,
and I'm the manager.

705
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:34,435
Players are on offer.

706
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:36,715
Make a bid for ...

707
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,835
How much does, say, Meisner cost?

708
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:54,915
But this is cool, isn't it?

709
01:10:55,395 --> 01:10:56,595
Yes, natch ...

710
01:10:57,075 --> 01:10:58,995
Natch? - Naturally.

711
01:11:00,755 --> 01:11:03,315
Martin? Could you come
here, please?

712
01:11:03,795 --> 01:11:04,715
Yes, natch.

713
01:11:13,155 --> 01:11:15,075
Wolfgang will be home soon.

714
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:18,515
I don't think it's good
if you're here.

715
01:11:19,115 --> 01:11:20,195
Why's that?

716
01:11:21,475 --> 01:11:22,915
It's a nice big house.

717
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:25,555
Enough chairs.

718
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:28,475
So many rooms you
can't use them all.

719
01:11:28,955 --> 01:11:30,315
I'll move in.

720
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:33,035
Enough food, too.

721
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:37,195
Ménage á trois.

722
01:11:38,955 --> 01:11:40,475
It's a bit loud.

723
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:48,115
If I had my way, travel
would be banned again.

724
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,315
OK, I'll be on my way.

725
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:56,595
I have to take
Enrique his taxi anyway.

726
01:11:57,595 --> 01:12:00,075
I'll ring to tell you
how the test was.

727
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,475
And then we'll talk to Rocco, OK?

728
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:08,995
Bye, Manu.

729
01:12:10,155 --> 01:12:11,075
Bye.

730
01:12:11,955 --> 01:12:13,355
Goodbye, Mr ...

731
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:16,195
Bye.

732
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:19,875
See you, Rokko!

733
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:27,675
Hello.

734
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:35,715
I was just at the bank, and
I tell you it'd be child's play.

735
01:12:36,195 --> 01:12:39,275
With two people you'd
need 3 minutes.

736
01:12:40,075 --> 01:12:44,915
We go in, take a hostage,
and walk to the safe in our own time.

737
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:47,555
In the East it's all changed.

738
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:51,595
Fritz Heckert Strasse is Engeldamm,
Ho Chi Min Strasse is Weissenseerweg.

739
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,915
It's really hard work.

740
01:12:55,195 --> 01:12:58,155
It's ages since I've been in
a bank with such good vibes.

741
01:12:58,635 --> 01:13:03,795
You can feel when luck is in the air,
and you only have to grab for it.

742
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:08,475
Can you tell me how they could
change Helmut Just Strasse to Behmstrasse?

743
01:13:08,955 --> 01:13:13,115
Hey, are you listening?
- No, I'm trying not to.

744
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:16,315
Martini, things aren't going so well,

745
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:19,235
and I have to ...

746
01:13:19,715 --> 01:13:22,755
... think of something.
- I'm not here much longer,

747
01:13:23,235 --> 01:13:24,995
whether things are good or bad.

748
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:28,635
I wanted to suggest you change
your name anyway, maybe ...

749
01:13:29,115 --> 01:13:31,115
... Thorsten instead of Victor.

750
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:36,715
But Victor is a good name.
Why should I call myself Thorsten?

751
01:13:37,155 --> 01:13:39,515
You don't have to
... oh, never mind!

752
01:14:02,555 --> 01:14:03,435
Hello?

753
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:06,955
Is Victor there?

754
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:09,195
No. Can I help you?

755
01:14:11,795 --> 01:14:13,675
I'm looking for videos.

756
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:18,115
The whole shop's full of them.
You just have to pick one.

757
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:22,235
What is it you want?

758
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,795
Otto Grotewohl Strasse
turns into Wilhelmstrasse.

759
01:14:35,235 --> 01:14:37,155
Ludmila, could you
come here, please?

760
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:43,915
Victor's not back yet.
I have to go to my test.

761
01:14:44,395 --> 01:14:46,715
Go on then, I'll close the shop.

762
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:48,515
OK.

763
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,155
Martin.

764
01:14:50,795 --> 01:14:51,755
Good luck.

765
01:14:53,395 --> 01:14:54,795
You can do it.

766
01:15:03,035 --> 01:15:04,075
Mr. Schulz,

767
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:06,675
...could you come? -I'm not through.

768
01:15:07,155 --> 01:15:07,875
Yes, but ...

769
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:10,115
... please come with me.

770
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:13,955
What's wrong?

771
01:15:14,435 --> 01:15:16,355
Mr. Schulz,

772
01:15:16,835 --> 01:15:19,595
we check each applicant's
police record.

773
01:15:20,075 --> 01:15:24,435
Unfortunately we found that you
were convicted of a serious offence.

774
01:15:24,915 --> 01:15:29,275
The guidelines regarding
applicants for a taxi license

775
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:32,155
exclude anyone convicted
of a serious offence.

776
01:15:58,115 --> 01:15:59,515
What's wrong?

777
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:05,675
Martin, tell us what's up!

778
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:12,035
Martini, you think you're the
only one things don't work out for.

779
01:16:13,955 --> 01:16:17,155
Haven't you any grit?
- You're getting on my nerves.

780
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:20,035
You'll be in jail again soon anyway.

781
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,355
You mess things up
and are proud of it.

782
01:16:23,835 --> 01:16:25,155
That's enough ... - Shut up!

783
01:16:25,635 --> 01:16:26,955
Do you think I'm blind?

784
01:16:27,435 --> 01:16:30,715
That I don't know what
you're selling under the counter?

785
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:35,715
People like you should be hanged!
- Pull yourself together!

786
01:16:38,235 --> 01:16:39,155
See you.

787
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:45,475
I'd hang people like you.
A nice thick rope and that's that.

788
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:52,355
Leave the shop in one piece.

789
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,515
So, some tomato ...

790
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,795
... that's always ...

791
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:31,155
... very important,
tomato or peppers.

792
01:17:32,155 --> 01:17:33,115
Hello?

793
01:17:33,755 --> 01:17:35,195
Is anyone there?

794
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:41,795
Good evening. Police. We've got
a search warrant for your shop.

795
01:17:42,915 --> 01:17:43,955
Are you the owner?

796
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:46,115
I only help out.

797
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:06,715
Bingo!

798
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,435
Behind the counter!

799
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,275
What's wrong?

800
01:19:08,755 --> 01:19:11,715
What's the time?
- Half past. Why?

801
01:19:12,195 --> 01:19:15,515
Martin had his test.
He was going to ring.

802
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:23,715
Don't look like that.

803
01:19:24,715 --> 01:19:26,555
Why not? I'll look how I like.

804
01:19:27,035 --> 01:19:28,995
You're making a fool of yourself!

805
01:19:44,355 --> 01:19:45,115
Let me go.

806
01:19:50,075 --> 01:19:52,715
Hey! Are you crazy?
Open the door!

807
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:55,755
Wolfgang, let me out!

808
01:19:57,355 --> 01:19:58,795
Are you mad?

809
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:02,275
Open the door and let me out!

810
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:10,115
Open the door!

811
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:18,075
I want to see Manuela. - Sorry ...

812
01:20:18,555 --> 01:20:20,115
... but Manuela's at her mother's.

813
01:20:20,595 --> 01:20:22,235
And where's Rokko ?

814
01:20:22,715 --> 01:20:23,715
He's with her.

815
01:20:24,355 --> 01:20:26,915
What's going on?
I can hear Manuela.

816
01:20:29,835 --> 01:20:30,715
Go away!

817
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,795
Manuela!

818
01:20:34,515 --> 01:20:36,275
Go or I'll call the police.

819
01:20:41,035 --> 01:20:46,355
Police? Leonhardt Frank Strasse.
We've got a burglar. Come quickly!

820
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:48,115
My name is Riedel.

821
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:51,155
Leonhard Frank Strasse in Pankow.

822
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:53,715
There's only one of them .

823
01:21:00,635 --> 01:21:02,555
Open the door! Let me out!

824
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,315
Are you mad? - The guy
outside's the problem.

825
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:10,755
You're the problem!
- He'll break the windows!

826
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:13,675
Martin! What's wrong?

827
01:21:14,155 --> 01:21:16,715
Wait. I'll get dressed
and come out.

828
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:20,955
What's going on?

829
01:21:21,435 --> 01:21:23,835
Go to your room.
I'll tell you later.

830
01:21:25,075 --> 01:21:27,115
What's up? - I've got hassles,

831
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:30,435
and I told you to go to
your room. - But what's wrong?

832
01:21:30,915 --> 01:21:31,835
Oh boy!

833
01:21:36,715 --> 01:21:37,635
Come here.

834
01:22:03,235 --> 01:22:04,155
Police!

835
01:22:05,235 --> 01:22:06,155
Police!

836
01:22:07,315 --> 01:22:08,875
Hands up! - Out of there!

837
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:12,475
Hands up! I want your hands up!

838
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:16,355
Come out! - I haven't
done anything!

839
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:20,995
Both hands!
- I haven't done anything!

840
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:28,835
Car calling HQ. - HQ here.
- Last name Schulz with a "z".

841
01:22:30,515 --> 01:22:32,795
Born 22.5.64 in Berlin.

842
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:35,675
First name Martin.

843
01:22:36,155 --> 01:22:38,275
Don't worry. Everything's alright.

844
01:22:38,755 --> 01:22:41,795
But ... why are you here?
He hasn't done anything.

845
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:45,075
Why did you ring us, then?

846
01:22:45,555 --> 01:22:46,475
I didn't.

847
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:49,515
He is my husband. Let him out!

848
01:22:49,995 --> 01:22:53,195
Rolf? This looks like another
family drama. Let's go.

849
01:22:53,675 --> 01:22:58,035
Watch out! He's had a conviction
and he's wanted. Bring him in.

850
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,635
What's wrong now? Open the door!

851
01:23:01,115 --> 01:23:03,315
Let him out! No, let me go!

852
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:08,035
Are you mad or
something? - Go away!

853
01:23:09,115 --> 01:23:11,315
Martin, come out! Bloody pigs!

854
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:14,595
Martin!

855
01:23:49,835 --> 01:23:51,475
Mr. Schulz,

856
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:55,075
you've had a conviction for murder,

857
01:23:55,555 --> 01:23:58,915
after the reunification it was

858
01:23:59,395 --> 01:24:00,795
changed to manslaughter.

859
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:06,995
When did you first go to prison?
- It's all in my file. I don't know ...

860
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:08,835
Answer my question.

861
01:24:09,315 --> 01:24:10,515
When was it?

862
01:24:11,515 --> 01:24:16,835
It was before reunification. I was
sentenced in the summer of 1989 in Berlin.

863
01:24:17,315 --> 01:24:19,915
Manuela and I wanted to get out
of East Germany.

864
01:24:20,395 --> 01:24:23,955
East Germany was ... - You don't have
to tell me about East Germany.

865
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:26,035
What had you done?

866
01:24:26,555 --> 01:24:30,195
I killed our house administrator, but
I didn't mean to, I flipped. It was a fluke.

867
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:35,315
It says here You beat him
to death. Is that a fluke?

868
01:24:35,795 --> 01:24:41,035
The People's Police made the report ...
- The autopsy report confirms it.

869
01:24:41,555 --> 01:24:46,995
They did what they liked with people
who wanted to escape. You know that.

870
01:24:47,475 --> 01:24:50,555
I can see you were one of
them, too. - Don't get insolent!

871
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:54,475
How do you know Victor Valentin?

872
01:24:55,915 --> 01:24:58,315
We were both in
Brandenburg Prison.

873
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,475
Was he your friend? - My friend?

874
01:25:01,995 --> 01:25:04,915
Was there a sexual relationship?

875
01:25:06,115 --> 01:25:06,955
No.

876
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:12,275
And you knew nothing about what
was sold under the counter?

877
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:13,675
No.

878
01:25:14,955 --> 01:25:17,795
That was also a "fluke".
- I didn't do anything!

879
01:25:18,315 --> 01:25:20,315
Can you tell us where he is?

880
01:25:21,395 --> 01:25:22,755
No. - Mr. Schulz.

881
01:25:23,635 --> 01:25:28,875
I'll read you Section 184,
paragraph 4 of the Criminal Code.

882
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:32,275
If the offender acts for
gain or as part of a group,

883
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:37,875
the punishment is imprisonment
for a term of 6 months to 10 years,

884
01:25:38,355 --> 01:25:40,435
in addition to your probation.

885
01:25:40,955 --> 01:25:45,115
Are you scared of
Mr. Valentin's testimony?

886
01:25:45,595 --> 01:25:49,515
I didn't do anything! Where did
you learn these methods? In the Stasi?

887
01:25:51,075 --> 01:25:51,915
Listen here.

888
01:25:52,395 --> 01:25:53,675
There are places ...

889
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:56,155
... where they hang
people like you.

890
01:26:00,115 --> 01:26:01,915
I know guys like you.

891
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:04,115
I've met enough.

892
01:26:04,595 --> 01:26:09,355
Bit boring now, eh? No electric
shocks, no padded cells. What a shit!

893
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:10,835
Mr. Schulz? - Yes?

894
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,795
I'm not from the East.

895
01:26:14,395 --> 01:26:15,595
I'm from Bremen.

896
01:26:42,235 --> 01:26:44,075
I've brought you some things.

897
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:52,475
Look.

898
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:03,595
"Dear Dad,

899
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:09,315
you have to jump over the snakes,
and watch out for the monkeys.

900
01:27:09,795 --> 01:27:11,395
Love from Rokko."

901
01:27:20,195 --> 01:27:22,315
It's not looking good.

902
01:27:25,595 --> 01:27:29,515
They want to get me with this.
I can't go through that again.

903
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,555
Why did you get involved
with Victor Valentin?

904
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:28,195
You knew he wasn't
good to be around.

905
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:30,115
And the taxi license!

906
01:28:31,075 --> 01:28:34,875
I could have told you
you needed a special report.

907
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:36,875
You can get the license,

908
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:42,475
but only when you've settled
down, and another offence is unlikely.

909
01:28:42,915 --> 01:28:47,515
I can organize a special
report so you can take the test ...

910
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:48,915
So?

911
01:28:49,555 --> 01:28:50,475
Martin...

912
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:51,915
... old Eastie,

913
01:28:52,955 --> 01:28:55,155
did you think I'd leave
you in the lurch?

914
01:28:55,635 --> 01:28:57,195
I gave myself up.

915
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:03,675
Do you think 5 years more or
less make any difference to me?

916
01:29:04,195 --> 01:29:06,635
Bring me my TV

917
01:29:07,155 --> 01:29:08,275
when you've time.

918
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:10,755
And send my love to your wife.

919
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:12,995
Don't think about...

920
01:29:13,475 --> 01:29:16,515
... what you shouldn't do, Martini.

921
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:19,115
Think about what
you should do.

922
01:29:39,955 --> 01:29:41,875
So, here... and here.
