00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,092
Good evening.

3
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,118
The following are
the lowest temperature estimates

4
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:37,319
for California citrus areas.

5
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,989
Lowest temperatures tomorrow night
will be somewhat higher than tonight

6
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:44,459
and only light scattered firing late
in the morning should be necessary.

7
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:49,809
Corona District: Corona 29,
Arlington 28, Riverside 27,

8
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,239
Highgrove 27, Elsinore 26, Marino 26.

9
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:58,569
Clear and calm, firing for lemons will be
necessary beginning about 2:00 a.m.

10
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,508
and for oranges, about 4:00 a.m.

11
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,178
High ceiling. Dew point 31.

12
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:07,119
Redlands District: Hemet 28,
Redlands 26,

13
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:10,559
Highlands 26, Rialto 25,
Bloomington 25,

14
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,217
Colton 25, Fontana 25. Ukipa 26...

15
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:16,315
Well, the night before I met her,
I was in my hotel room on Bunker Hill

16
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:19,086
down in the very middle of Los Angeles.

17
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,752
It was called the Alta Loma.

18
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,954
It was built on a hillside in reverse

19
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,583
so that the main floor
was on a level with the street.

20
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,263
My room was down on the fifth floor

21
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:33,662
so that my window was on a level
with the green hillside,

22
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,033
and there was no need for a key.

23
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,734
The window was always open.

24
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:42,374
I'd been going over the plans I'd made,
since I'd come here like everyone else

25
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:46,744
in search of fortune, fame, good health
and glamorous women.

26
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,152
Only I was going to be different.

27
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:53,512
I wasn't here to search for my future.
I was here to create it.

28
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,713
I'd write the first great novel
about this place

29
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:58,814
and everybody who came here
from somewhere else.

30
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,830
The Road to Los Angeles
by Arturo Bandini.

31
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,160
It would bring me everything
I ever wanted.

32
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:10,332
Now, after five months, I was trying
to make a very important decision.

33
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,233
What to do with my last nickel.

34
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,612
"Mr. Bandini, it has now been six weeks
since you've paid the rent.

35
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:26,451
"Four dollars per is mounting
like the national debt.

36
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:31,409
"Either you pay $24, every penny,
or pack up and leave."

37
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,889
It was her sixth note in six weeks.

38
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,720
Pretty humiliating.

39
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,201
My landlady was getting
more writing done than I was.

40
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,729
She was the kind of woman
who increased her height

41
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,029
by rising on tiptoe
and peering at me over her glasses.

42
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,368
-I'd like a room.
-Do you have a job?

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,910
I'm a writer.

44
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,237
I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Archer.

45
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,388
Wrote that.

46
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,218
Here. What's your name?

47
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,249
Mrs. Hargraves, why?

48
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:09,987
"For Mrs. Hargraves.

49
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:12,218
"A woman of ineffable charm,

50
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:17,128
"with lovely blue eyes
and a generous smile.

51
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,397
"From the author, Arturo Bandini."

52
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,697
"The Little Dog Laughed."

53
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,678
I hate dog stories.

54
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:33,208
Bandini. Young man,
are you a Mexican?

55
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,906
Me, a Mexican?

56
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:40,016
I'm an American, Mrs. Hargraves.
And that isn't a dog story, either.

57
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,647
We don't allow Mexicans in this hotel.

58
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:45,927
I'm not a Mexican,
and there isn't a dog in the whole story.

59
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,655
We don't allow Jews, either.

60
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,425
I got that title after the fable, you know,

61
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,556
"And the little dog laughed
To see such sport"

62
00:04:56,206 --> 00:05:00,604
So you're an author. How nice.

63
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:04,044
Here we are, Mr. Bandini.
This is one of my very favorite rooms.

64
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:07,914
There are windows on two sides,
which makes it extremely airy.

65
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,715
It's $4 a week,
and I expect to be paid in advance.

66
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,113
Now that includes cleaning
but no laundry. We never do...

67
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:15,213
Through that window,

68
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:18,053
I saw my first palm tree
not six feet away,

69
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,224
but the palm was blackish
at its branches.

70
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:22,994
-And no girls in the room.
-I'll take it.

71
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:40,272
Stained by carbon monoxide
coming out of the Third Street Tunnel,

72
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,243
its crusted trunk choked
with dust and sand

73
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:46,413
that blew in from the Mojave
and Santa Ana deserts.

74
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,812
What jerk's gonna believe
I made it all the way

75
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:55,251
from Colorado to downtown L.A.
without seeing one goddamn palm tree?

76
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:57,521
Kid?

77
00:05:58,903 --> 00:05:59,882
Kid?

78
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,632
Kid.

79
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,262
Do you like milk?

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,060
Yes, Hellfrick. I like milk.

81
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,900
Okay, then.

82
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,332
Here's the plan.

83
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,852
The Adohr man's a friend of mine.

84
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:24,020
Every morning at 4:00,
he parks his truck behind the hotel

85
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,490
and comes up to my room for a while.

86
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,190
-That's not much of a plan, Hellfrick.
-No, kid, no.

87
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,188
While he's having one with me,

88
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:37,688
you get 10 minutes
to help yourself to the milk.

89
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,059
So what do you think?

90
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,690
If he's your friend,
why not just ask him for it?

91
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,431
Kid, come on. Who's kidding who?

92
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,678
He knows I don't drink milk.
I'm doing this for you.

93
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:54,708
No, thanks, Hellfrick.
I like to consider myself an honest man.

94
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:58,508
It certainly makes me wonder
about your ideas of friendship.

95
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,777
Okay.

96
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,387
Only trying to do you a favor.

97
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,888
You wanna do me a favor?
Pay me the money I loaned you.

98
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:09,359
-How much was that?
-Fifteen cents.

99
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,196
-Don't have it.
-Well, how about 10 cents? A nickel?

100
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:20,267
Can't give you any hard cash, kid,

101
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:24,176
but I'll see you get all the milk you need.

102
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:42,485
Mencken. Editor of the greatest
magazine in the country.

103
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,356
Do you wanna let him down?

104
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,265
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. North and South America

105
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:50,026
and all the ships and clippers at sea.
Akron, Ohio.

106
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,366
A big strike in the Goodrich
rubber plant here was called off today

107
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:57,034
when workers agreed
on a six cent raise in pay per hour.

108
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,405
Boston, Massachusetts.

109
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:02,236
The condition
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.,

110
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:05,836
who was hurt today in a motorcar crash
near Walpole, Massachusetts,

111
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:07,473
is not serious.

112
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,884
Think of something
besides stealing a bottle of milk.

113
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,714
You're an author, not a thief.

114
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:37,272
The streets are full of them,
blondes and brunettes.

115
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,442
One in a red fox fur just getting out
of a fancy foreign car.

116
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,183
Girls in the plaza.

117
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,843
They're everywhere,
and none of them mine.

118
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:50,181
One glance and they know
I'm an inexperienced jerk,

119
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,322
ignorant of women and life,
and afraid of both.

120
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,831
You have nice hands.

121
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,200
I do?

122
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,871
Very.

123
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:15,139
Bandini?

124
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,509
You're Italian.

125
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:23,850
That'll be two cents a day
every day it's overdue.

126
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,348
St. Teresa, when I was little,
I prayed to you for a fountain pen.

127
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,190
You answered my prayer.
Anyway, I got a fountain pen.

128
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,259
Now please, sweet and lovely Saint,

129
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,358
inspire me. Give me an idea,
so I can write a story,

130
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:41,939
a great story,

131
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:45,869
so I can be rich and famous
and not be ashamed of my name.

132
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,168
Door is open.

133
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,865
To you, Mencken. To the future.

134
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:24,263
I headed down Third Street looking
for a place to spend my last nickel.

135
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,261
And there it was.

136
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,614
Come on.
Learn to dance if you can't walk!

137
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,661
The perfect place to end up flat broke.

138
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,269
-Can I get you something?
-Coffee with cream.

139
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,041
Just five months ago,
I had $150 in my pocket

140
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,139
and big plans in my head.

141
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:19,352
In those days, I was Arturo Bandini,
lover of man and beast alike.

142
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,529
All I needed was to meet one
of those beautiful golden-haired girls

143
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,560
that seemed to grow like oranges
out here,

144
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,997
and I'd write a story, a love story,
one of the greatest of all time.

145
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,888
Who brought this here?

146
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,887
There you go, Tony.

147
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,838
Thank you.

148
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,714
Are you done with that coffee?

149
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:06,384
You call this stuff coffee?
Maybe it isn't coffee at all.

150
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,553
Maybe it's just water after they boiled
your filthy shoes in it.

151
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:15,032
Maybe you don't know any better.
Maybe you're just naturally careless.

152
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:18,332
But if I were you,
I wouldn't be seen in a Main Street alley

153
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,694
wearing those haraches.

154
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:22,893
It's huaraches, not haraches.

155
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:28,001
I hope you die of heart failure right there
on that chair.

156
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,372
Camilla.

157
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,422
It's not my fault. I didn't do nothing.

158
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,722
I swear to God, I just asked him
if he wanted some coffee!

159
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,412
Take care of it.

160
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,591
If he's sick, get him out of here.

161
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:51,660
Hey.

162
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,332
Young fellow, are you all right?

163
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,902
You there? Oh, say something, please.

164
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:05,611
You can dish it out, but you can't take it,
can you?

165
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,481
You want the nickel?

166
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,341
Then mop it up.

167
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,499
Hey, you!

168
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,149
Sand from the Mojave
was blowing across the city.

169
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,816
It was everywhere.

170
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,557
It was even between the sheets,
but I didn't care.

171
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,067
All I could think about
were those huaraches.

172
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,397
"To a Mayan princess
from a worthless gringo."

173
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,975
What's the name of the girl
who works here?

174
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,147
You mean Camilla?

175
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:28,055
The one who was here yesterday.
The Mexican.

176
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,676
Camilla Lopez.

177
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,747
Will you give this to her?

178
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:37,195
Take good care of it. It's valuable.
See that Miss Lopez gets it personally.

179
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,935
The truth was, I couldn't afford
to go back and see her that night.

180
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,873
I didn't have a nickel for a cup of coffee.

181
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,584
What do you want?

182
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:12,964
I'm an honest man, kid.

183
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,560
There, see if he wants a beer
on the house.

184
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:00,510
Sorry about the coffee.

185
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,671
Everybody orders beer around here.
We don't get that many calls for coffee.

186
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,309
I can see why.
I'd drink beer, too, if I could afford it.

187
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,779
Anyway, I hope this is better.
You want cream, right?

188
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:27,729
Not bad. Certainly an improvement
over last night.

189
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,959
Did you read "The Little Dog Laughed"?

190
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,638
"The Little Dog Laughed,"
by me, Arturo Bandini.

191
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:38,838
Arturo?

192
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,718
Bandini. It's Italian.
Did you read the story?

193
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,346
-Sure.
-So?

194
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,457
It's very good.

195
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:55,848
Hey, listen. You want a beer?

196
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,487
I can get you some.
You don't have to pay.

197
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:59,428
What did you like about it?

198
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,867
-Camilla.
-I have to go.

199
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,115
You still haven't told me
what you thought.

200
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:20,276
I told you. I liked it. I like dog stories.

201
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,726
-You like dog stories.
-I like dogs a lot...

202
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:28,053
-There's no dog in the story.
-There's no dog...

203
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,715
There's no dog in the story!

204
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,484
Okay. I heard you.

205
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,754
Then why did you call it
"The Little Dog Laughter"?

206
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:37,525
Why did you lie to me? Why did you
just say you read it when you didn't?

207
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,903
Listen, kid. Please, drink your beer.

208
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,694
It's tough enough just to have
a good time, okay?

209
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,659
Sir! Sir!

210
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,859
Forgot your hat.

211
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,638
-Something else you wanted to say?
-Camilla can't read.

212
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:31,696
Not English, anyway.

213
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:44,186
And another thing, Mr. Mencken,
I have no understanding of women.

214
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:46,917
How can I write about
what I don't understand?

215
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,927
How can I write about experiences
I haven't had?

216
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,788
When I first came here,
I was so sure of myself.

217
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,795
So sure I wasn't like the others.

218
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,766
The others came to the land of sunshine
with just enough money to live

219
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,857
until the sun killed them.

220
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:03,027
Take Hellfrick, across the hall,
from Minnesota.

221
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:06,178
Gassed in the Great War
and gassed ever since.

222
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,206
Most of the time,
he has no idea where he is.

223
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:12,007
So, I guess here is as good
as anywhere else.

224
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,175
Heilman's a bank teller
from South Bend.

225
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:18,186
But his health is bad and he was told
he had to stay here or die.

226
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:21,224
He hates the sun and the fog
and the SC Trojans.

227
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:23,225
My landlady's from Back East.

228
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:26,755
She tries to make the hotel lobby
look like Bridgeport, Connecticut.

229
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,056
No Mexicans and lots of doilies.

230
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,155
-Will there be anything else, ma'am?
-No, thank you.

231
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,355
Then there's the Filipino houseboy
from Hawaii

232
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:34,833
and the redhead from St. Louis.

233
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,455
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:39,234
-How are you?
-Better now.

235
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:43,005
She's come to feel he's terribly brave
in the face of so much prejudice.

236
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:44,904
The other day when I was going
to San Pedro,

237
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:47,273
looking for work at the canneries,
I saw them.

238
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:51,242
Even with high leather heels,
he was a foot shorter than she was.

239
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:54,183
I don't know where the girl
in the red fox fur is from,

240
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:58,855
but you can find her in Bernstein's Fish
Grotto with a fresh one every week.

241
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:01,993
On the other hand,
there's the Japanese man

242
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:05,324
who grows his vegetables
down on Jefferson, near the sloughs.

243
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:09,333
Bullet-faced and always smiling,
he keeps me alive for a nickel.

244
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,304
You like plums? Good. Good for you.

245
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,272
Of course there are others too poor
and too unlucky

246
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,202
to be allowed to call
any place their own.

247
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:21,773
Even for a while.

248
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,502
All right, amigos.

249
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,281
In the end, we're all strangers here.

250
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,381
Maybe the only thing that makes you
a Californian is a pair of sunglasses

251
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:36,522
and a four-bit polo shirt.
Suddenly, you belong.

252
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,689
Mr. Bandini. You have mail.

253
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,030
"Dear Mr. Bandini,
with your permission,

254
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:51,230
"I shall remove the salutation
and ending of your very long letter

255
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,409
"and print it as a short story
for my magazine.

256
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,169
"It seems you've done a fine job here.

257
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:01,509
"I think 'The Land of Somewhere Else'
would serve as an excellent title.

258
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,591
"Check enclosed.
Sincerely yours, H.L. Mencken.

259
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:10,149
"P.S. As to your anxieties
about your limited experiences

260
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:13,159
"with life in general
and women in particular,

261
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:17,319
"it is, alas, a truism that authors
generally have less experience

262
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,760
"than other men.

263
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,839
"This owing to the incontestable fact

264
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:25,629
"that you simply can't be
in two places at once, Mr. Bandini.

265
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,337
"Either you're in front
of the typewriter, writing,

266
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:30,998
"or you're out in the world
having experiences.

267
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:35,278
"Therefore, since you need to write
and you need to have experiences

268
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:38,788
"to write about,
you have to learn to do more with less.

269
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:42,988
"And doing more with less is,
in a word, Mr. Bandini,

270
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:45,058
"what writing is all about."

271
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:05,546
Still mad at me?

272
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,115
Not that I know of.

273
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:11,086
Well, would you like
to order something?

274
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:15,075
A cigar. Something from Havana.

275
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:18,044
They're a quarter.

276
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,215
Keep the change.

277
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:43,203
-I said keep the change.
-Not from you.

278
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,214
You're poor.

279
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,922
Don't I look different?

280
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,294
I thought you'd like my shoes.

281
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,724
They're very nice.

282
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:09,092
How about something to drink?
Scotch highball.

283
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:11,631
Saint James.

284
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:19,003
Sammy, get me a highball.
Saint James.

285
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,641
You've changed.

286
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,651
Before you were just mean.

287
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:33,690
Now that you've got a couple of bucks,
you're mean and stuck-up.

288
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,030
Forty cents.

289
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,820
Well, you haven't changed.

290
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,021
You're just the same little
Mexican princess,

291
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,661
-charming and innocent.
-I'm not charming and I'm not innocent.

292
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:46,002
To me you'll always be a sweet
little peon, a flower girl from old Mexico.

293
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:48,158
You dago son of a bitch!

294
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,769
I'm just as American as you are.

295
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,410
Or at least I will be
as soon as I pass my test.

296
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,510
Sure you will,
just as soon as you learn how to read.

297
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,320
Take off those shoes.

298
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:16,988
My legs are not good enough for them?

299
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,998
They're not good enough for your legs.

300
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,378
Sorry what I called you.
I didn't mean what I said.

301
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:04,336
I didn't either.

302
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,675
-You got a car?
-No.

303
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:11,215
I do. It's in the parking lot.

304
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,055
It's a '27 convertible.

305
00:28:14,956 --> 00:28:19,057
The stuffing, it's a little bit
out of the upholstery, but it runs.

306
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,885
I'm off at 11:00.

307
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,125
Camilla Lombard?

308
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,146
Arturo.

309
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,246
-This is Sammy.
-Hi.

310
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,013
Are you coming?

311
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,933
Have a good night.

312
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:17,771
Be right back.

313
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,812
Who is he?

314
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,980
Sammy? Just a friend.

315
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,421
What kind of a friend?

316
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,691
A good one.

317
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,382
He got me my job.

318
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:10,618
-They let the bartender hire you?
-Sammy's not just the bartender.

319
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:13,629
Oh, yeah?
What else is he, a concert pianist?

320
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:17,729
Listen, Arturo,
you're not the only writer in town.

321
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:27,408
-Sammy's a writer?
-You'd be surprised.

322
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:30,179
I'd be surprised
if he could write his name.

323
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,578
Do you like my car?

324
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,087
How come it's registered to
Camilla Lombard? Your name's Lopez.

325
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:35,778
-You married?
-No.

326
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:38,478
-So what's the Lombard for?
-For fun.

327
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,889
-Sometimes I use it professionally.
-As a waitress?

328
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:44,457
Do you like your name?

329
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:49,227
Don't you wish it was Johnson
or Williams or something?

330
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:51,958
-No.
-Come on.

331
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,836
Do you honestly like
being called Bandini?

332
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,338
-I'm satisfied with my name.
-No, you're not.

333
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,907
-I am.
-You're not.

334
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,035
-I am.
-You're not.

335
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:02,776
-I am.
-You're not.

336
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,407
What's Sammy's last name,
Johnson or Williams?

337
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:08,677
White.

338
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:11,847
Pretty much sums up your ambition
in life, doesn't it? To be Mrs. White?

339
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:15,016
You can be a real son of a bitch,
you know that?

340
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,984
-Are you still cold?
-No.

341
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,695
The cliffs keep you warm.

342
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:53,592
They're like a blanket
when you're underneath them.

343
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,334
Why do you get so mean?

344
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:01,905
Why do you get so mean?

345
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,412
Can't we be friends?

346
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,451
Friends like you and Sammy?

347
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,660
Look at the fog.

348
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:41,370
An army of ghosts crawling
on their bellies.

349
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:44,973
What are you talking about?

350
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:48,900
The fog bank.
It creeps in and hugs the water.

351
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,080
-You didn't answer my question.
-I know what a fog bank is.

352
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,550
And what about you and Sammy?

353
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,249
Who are you interested in,
me or Sammy?

354
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:04,189
Come on, why don't you teach me
how to ride a wave?

355
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,520
Out there, in all this fog?

356
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah, why not?

357
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,359
Are you afraid?

358
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,237
Of course not.

359
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:23,549
What are you waiting for?

360
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:27,077
Come in! Come here!

361
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:38,989
Come here! Come on!

362
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:40,926
Get in here!

363
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:49,498
What are you hiding?

364
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:53,905
You got a pretty one.
Pink as a baby's bottom.

365
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:56,166
Relax. Let's have some fun.

366
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:05,617
-You're not gonna ride a wave tonight.
-Sure I will. You show me how.

367
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:06,814
I'm from Colorado.

368
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,646
You mean you don't know
how to ride a wave?

369
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:12,026
Listen. My technique might be not good
for you to learn. It's unorthodox.

370
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:14,215
That's okay. I'd like to learn from you.

371
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:17,166
The first thing you gotta do is
get to where the waves are.

372
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,396
Don't take any chances.
Just stay back, stay right there.

373
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:21,164
I will, I promise.

374
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,106
Just watch me...

375
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:49,053
-Help!
-Camilla!

376
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:52,124
Camilla?

377
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:56,193
Camilla! Camilla!

378
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,471
Oh, God. Camilla!

379
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:13,741
Camilla!

380
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,150
Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

381
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:20,821
Camilla! Camilla!

382
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,761
Camilla!

383
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:41,970
Fooled you pretty good!

384
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,311
It was as good as your heart attack.

385
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:50,940
-Admit it.
-It was better.

386
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,748
You can dish it out,
but you can't take it, huh?

387
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,900
Cut it out!

388
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,729
It was a joke, God damn it!
What are you trying to do, drown me?

389
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:20,038
I'll never forgive you.
Not for my whole life.

390
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:22,308
I thought your life was over.

391
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:25,718
I thought I was gonna die
looking for you.

392
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,818
That was my first time in the ocean.

393
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:40,866
What you gonna do now, walk home?

394
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,096
It's 10 miles to downtown.
Where do you live?

395
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,808
The Alta Loma.

396
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,276
Bunker Hill.

397
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,547
Old women and weak men.
Perfect place for you.

398
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:03,276
Couldn't be better.
In my hotel they don't allow Mexicans.

399
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,395
White dough.

400
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:23,035
No wonder she laughed. Who wouldn't?

401
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:27,403
Arturo Bandini, genius,
man of the world,

402
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:31,373
can't take a walk on the beach
without trying to hide his dick.

403
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:40,652
I never wanted to see you again.
You were so mean last night.

404
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:42,213
Get in.

405
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,024
What for?

406
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,152
Get in.

407
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:05,204
Arturo, don't stop.

408
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:08,472
Please don't ever stop. Arturo...

409
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,052
Jesus Christ, Hellfrick!

410
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:17,791
Have you ever heard of knocking
before you come into a room?

411
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:21,479
Sorry, kid. Didn't mean to disturb you.

412
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:24,090
Artist at work, huh?

413
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,231
Listen, kid.

414
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:29,632
How much dough you got?

415
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,359
-Oh, for Christ's sake!
-No, no, no, it's not for booze.

416
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:37,039
-Well, then what's it for?
-Meat.

417
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,931
Meat?

418
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:43,300
I mean like the steaks you used to get
Back East.

419
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,209
Real meat. Not like out here.

420
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:50,449
Sure. Cattle are different out here.

421
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,920
Absolutely.

422
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:57,020
Here's always sunny and dry.
Cows eat nothing but weeds.

423
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,588
Dead weeds. Meat's full of worms.

424
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,827
They paint it to look bloody and red.
Did you know that?

425
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,498
Maybe you could use that
in one of your...

426
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:09,509
Okay, okay. What do you need?

427
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,370
Fifty cents? There's a butcher on Olive.

428
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,738
He's got the real McCoy,
beef from Kansas City.

429
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:19,008
It would help keep me off the hard stuff.

430
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:28,657
I'll make it good with you, kid.

431
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,827
I'll pay you back 1,000 times.

432
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,956
I had just under $10.

433
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,427
It would pay the rent
for two-and-a-half weeks

434
00:39:46,537 --> 00:39:49,877
or buy me three pairs of shoes
or two pairs of pants

435
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:53,605
or 1,000 postage stamps
to send stories to Mencken.

436
00:39:55,616 --> 00:39:58,377
But you don't have any stories or talent.

437
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:06,386
"Don't stop. Don't stop.
Please don't ever stop."

438
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:09,355
Garbage.

439
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:40,453
Camilla. Camilla, wait up.

440
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:44,124
-Did you ask him?
-What's in it for him?

441
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,373
Just do it.

442
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,572
Who is it?

443
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,421
-Hello.
-What are you doing?

444
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,832
Do I know you?

445
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,232
Who are you?

446
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,990
"He took her roughly in his arms.

447
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,271
"She pressed herself
against his throbbing loins.

448
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,141
"'Don't stop! Don't ever stop."'

449
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,040
-Hey, that's private.
-I hope so.

450
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,409
It should never be made public.

451
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,079
It's pitiful and sad.

452
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,791
A hopelessly bad writer
buried in a cheap hotel on Bunker Hill.

453
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,451
In Los Angeles, of all places.

454
00:41:56,498 --> 00:42:00,368
-They'll never read what you write.
-That's not really my writing.

455
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:03,329
They won't even have a chance
to forget it.

456
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,409
Say, what's going on?
Where did you come from?

457
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,238
-Is this a gag?
-You're nobody.

458
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:12,238
I might have been somebody,

459
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:15,648
and here we are.

460
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:28,489
Lady. Lady, you've got to sober up.

461
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:33,226
How about a little fresh air?

462
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:37,656
We could go out
and have a drink. Money.

463
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:44,696
Lady?

464
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:48,536
Good idea. Let's have a drink.

465
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:54,275
You are gonna be so marvelous!
So wonderful!

466
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:56,816
-My landlady.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:02,585
-Forget it, now. Let's just walk.
-Okay, but we're having a drink.

468
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:04,753
I insist. Look, money!

469
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:08,356
Okay, we'll have a drink.
Just put it back in your purse.

470
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:25,105
-Hey, Mr. Bandini.
-Hi, Solomon. How's business?

471
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:29,814
Till you showed up, Mr. Bandini, I had
more pinball machines than customers.

472
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:33,443
-A short beer, am I right?
-And whiskey.

473
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:35,514
Lots of whiskey.

474
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:39,085
Does he know you?

475
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:43,822
Your mouth, your wonderful mouth.
God, what a mouth.

476
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:45,903
No, let's have a drink first.

477
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:56,431
-What's wrong?
-You know what's wrong.

478
00:43:56,541 --> 00:44:00,071
-No, I don't.
-You're just like the rest of them.

479
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,873
-You know!
-Know what?

480
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:06,042
-That's why you won't kiss me!
-Here we go. One short beer.

481
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:08,681
And double whiskey.

482
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,091
-So who was it?
-Who was what?

483
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,352
Who told you about my wounds?

484
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,091
Your wounds?

485
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:23,060
Do you have a nickel?
I love pinball machines.

486
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,141
One game. Would you mind?

487
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,898
-Whatever my darling wishes.
-Thank you.

488
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,578
Solomon, could you come over here?
For some reason, it's on tilt.

489
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:49,358
Play. Play.

490
00:44:51,228 --> 00:44:52,859
Who is that woman?

491
00:44:53,928 --> 00:44:55,189
Who knows?

492
00:44:56,669 --> 00:44:58,430
She was in a week before last,

493
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,697
when you were talking
about Sinclair Lewis

494
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:02,968
to that couple from Minnesota.

495
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:06,808
-I didn't notice her.
-Well, she noticed you, believe you me.

496
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,937
Listened to every word you said.
Every single word.

497
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,308
-And when you left, she left.
-And what's she doing now?

498
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:23,917
-Watching you like a prize dog.
-I gotta get out of here.

499
00:45:24,357 --> 00:45:26,516
Door opposite the men's room.

500
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:35,127
Is everything all right, darling?
Do you need another nickel?

501
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:37,896
No. No, I'm just gonna use...

502
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:08,033
-Oh, my God!
-Darling.

503
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:11,063
I took a cab and the door was open.

504
00:46:11,173 --> 00:46:12,765
Don't you think this has gone
far enough?

505
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,105
"I see them in the lobbies of hotels.

506
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,335
"I see them sunning in the parks
and limping out of little ugly churches,

507
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:23,103
"dispossessed in this place
where the seasons never change."

508
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,013
That's more like it.

509
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:29,424
Will you please get out?

510
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:33,054
You're my darling,
and you're going to love me.

511
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:36,282
Some other time. I think you better go.
I mean it.

512
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,562
I know how I revolt you,

513
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:48,132
that you know what my clothes
are covering up.

514
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,861
Know what?
I don't even know your name.

515
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:53,612
Vera Rivkin.

516
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,382
Back East I had a real life

517
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,973
and friends who knew about
H.L. Mencken

518
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,209
and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

519
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:04,210
Now I'm a housekeeper.

520
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,710
I work for a nice Jewish family
in Long Beach.

521
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:10,790
I'm tired. Tired of housekeeping.

522
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:15,890
Then one day, I saw you at Solomon's,

523
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,091
and I heard you talk.

524
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,070
And I went and I bought your story.

525
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,331
And I read it.

526
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:30,409
And I felt that you were someone

527
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:34,709
who could look at me
and see me for what I am.

528
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,279
So I followed you home.

529
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:39,251
So stupid.

530
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:41,750
Hopeless.

531
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,948
But I'm really a good person.
Honestly, I am.

532
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,089
Here.

533
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:55,158
Thank you.

534
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:59,828
-What do you want me to do?
-Tell me I'm like other women.

535
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:03,339
-Tell me I'm beautiful, please.
-But you are beautiful.

536
00:48:04,408 --> 00:48:05,879
Really, you are.

537
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,377
This is just a childish obsession.

538
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:12,438
You know, maybe a hangover
from the mumps. I don't know.

539
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:15,578
Plenty of men would give anything...

540
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:18,619
Let me show you something.

541
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:26,257
-You don't have to show me anything.
-You're going to see it for yourself.

542
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:30,526
Undo this, please.

543
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:35,266
Look, you've convinced me, all right?

544
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:06,464
Yeah. Yeah, I thought so.

545
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:15,204
You know all about them.

546
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:19,813
So what's the fuss? That's nothing.

547
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:31,321
Tell that to my husband.

548
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:35,484
"Deformed, disfigured,

549
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:38,265
"disgusting."

550
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:40,920
That's what he said.

551
00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:52,343
I say,

552
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,042
you're beautiful.

553
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:14,459
Excuse me.

554
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:20,229
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:23,699
I'm so sorry. I don't know
what was in my head. I just...

556
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:26,939
Take it easy.
I'll wait outside so you can...

557
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:29,810
Take it easy.

558
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:56,299
"Dear Boy,

559
00:50:57,268 --> 00:51:00,706
"of course I should have known
you'd have a girlfriend.

560
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,807
"Is she very beautiful?

561
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:04,968
"She's very lucky.

562
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:08,578
"Is she also kind and generous?

563
00:51:09,647 --> 00:51:13,886
"Would she ever allow you to come
to Long Beach, if only for an hour?"

564
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:20,926
I woke up relieved to think

565
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:24,086
there were other possibilities in life
besides Camilla.

566
00:51:24,196 --> 00:51:27,065
Maybe Vera was a little crazy,
but like she said about herself,

567
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:28,596
she was a good person.

568
00:51:28,706 --> 00:51:31,796
We'd read the same books,
spoke the same language

569
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:34,936
and she was capable
of appreciating my writing.

570
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:39,277
Suddenly, I felt better about myself.
I was once again, Arturo Bandini,

571
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:42,645
lover of man and beast alike,
and afraid of nothing.

572
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:46,505
Mr. Bandini! Hey! Bandini!

573
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,925
It's Sammy,
the bartender at the Columbia.

574
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:52,426
-Yeah. Sammy White.
-Yeah.

575
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:56,584
-Camilla says you've been published.
-What of it?

576
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:59,855
I was thinking about getting into
that line of work.

577
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:03,165
-Publishing?
-No, writing stories like you.

578
00:52:03,565 --> 00:52:07,932
Bartending and the damp nights don't
seem to agree with me much anymore.

579
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:11,604
Looking to find something I can do
pretty much anywhere.

580
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:13,403
Like writing stories.

581
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:15,704
Yeah, well, good luck to you, Sammy.

582
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:18,215
Yeah, I was hoping
you could give me a few pointers.

583
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:21,372
And that magazine
with "The Little Dog Laughing" in it,

584
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:24,142
you wouldn't happen to have
a spare copy?

585
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:27,353
I'd sure like to read your story.

586
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:31,654
I know I got one in here somewhere.

587
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,563
Thank you, Arturo. It's a real honor.

588
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:46,003
Like I said, I was hoping you could
give me some pointers about writing.

589
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,171
If there's anything I can do for you,
you let me know.

590
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:52,642
Sounds like you've got something
in mind.

591
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,412
Well, thought you might like
a little advice about Camilla.

592
00:52:57,351 --> 00:53:01,691
That's real white of you, Sammy,
but I think I can handle the situation.

593
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:03,390
Okey-dokey.

594
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:09,121
But you know what they say,
"Never a horse that couldn't be rode,

595
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:11,792
"never a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed."

596
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:15,859
And Camilla's one tough little pony.
She's got a real hard mouth on her.

597
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:18,900
"A real hard mouth."
Interesting turn of phrase.

598
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:22,070
You're too nice to that girl, Mr. Bandini.

599
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,801
-Too nice?
-Way too nice.

600
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,378
You don't understand Mexican women.

601
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,178
-Oh, Mexican women are different.
-No, sir.

602
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,881
They're like most women,
except more so.

603
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,788
You let up on them,
they're all gonna take advantage.

604
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:39,520
But you ease up on that little spic,

605
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,889
she gonna peg you
for a lily-livered gringo

606
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:45,159
and buck you out of the saddle
before you're in it.

607
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:50,698
A horse with a hard mouth
don't feel the bit, Arturo.

608
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:53,967
So, keep them on a tight rein,

609
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:59,097
never let them forget
who's boss for a second. No trick to it.

610
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:01,638
Ride them hard and it's easy.

611
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:06,616
Well, Sammy,
sounds like you know your horseflesh.

612
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:08,647
Yeah, I hope so, Arturo.

613
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:11,658
I'm gonna write Westerns.

614
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:17,256
By the way, amigo,

615
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:22,826
Camilla's one pony
who's worth the ride.

616
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,736
I'm glad to see you.

617
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:34,134
Why?

618
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,805
Okay.

619
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,175
Sammy told me
you were really nice to him.

620
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:46,346
I was beginning to think
you couldn't be nice to anyone.

621
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:52,725
-Can I get you something?
-Where is Sammy tonight?

622
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,553
-He left.
-Went home?

623
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:58,766
To the desert for a while.
He hasn't been feeling real good.

624
00:54:58,935 --> 00:55:01,364
-What's the matter with him?
-Camilla.

625
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,533
TB, I think.

626
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:19,023
Here. You can start with this.

627
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:24,083
-Sammy has tuberculosis.
-Yeah. Tough break, huh?

628
00:55:24,692 --> 00:55:26,254
We all gotta go.

629
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:35,393
What are you talking about?

630
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:39,203
-He won't live long.
-How dare you say something like that!

631
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,902
So how are all your other boyfriends?

632
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:43,470
I haven't got any other boyfriends!

633
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,041
Sure. Forgive an incautious remark.

634
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,212
Could I have the check?

635
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:53,610
No charge. It's on Sammy.

636
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,890
Bandini.

637
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,499
You don't have to pay
to be a smart aleck.

638
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:21,869
Besides, if it cost more than half a buck,
you couldn't afford to be one.

639
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:24,668
You're very funny.
Sammy writing your dialogue?

640
00:56:25,779 --> 00:56:29,179
Why do you have to be so mean?

641
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,809
Mean? Me?

642
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,218
I'm anything but mean.

643
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:36,858
I'm a lover, my dear girl.
Equally fond of man and beast alike.

644
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,389
You can't be mean
and be a great writer.

645
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:41,307
Well, are you?

646
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,008
Are you a great writer?

647
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:47,186
That's something you'll never know.

648
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:50,946
-Why are you so angry?
-I'm not. Just disgusted.

649
00:56:53,587 --> 00:56:54,789
With me?

650
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:58,089
Why?

651
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,966
Take a look in the mirror.

652
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:04,997
-I don't want to look in the mirror.
-I don't blame you.

653
00:57:09,477 --> 00:57:10,907
I'm tired.

654
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,506
We were busy today.

655
00:57:15,676 --> 00:57:17,835
Being busy's not the problem.

656
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,175
It's those shoes
and all that paint on your face.

657
00:57:21,285 --> 00:57:23,076
You look like a cheap imitation
of an American.

658
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:24,777
If I were a Mexican,
I'd knock your block off.

659
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:27,374
I'm bored with your Mexican remarks.

660
00:57:27,923 --> 00:57:29,895
We're not that different.

661
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:32,825
You're dark and your hair is dark
and your eyes are black.

662
00:57:32,925 --> 00:57:35,396
-Nobody's eyes are black.
-Yours are.

663
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:37,825
Why don't you go

664
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,193
think about Sammy?

665
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:44,835
What are you doing here, anyway?

666
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:53,173
-Would you ever change your name?
-What for?

667
00:57:54,043 --> 00:57:57,483
-Would you?
-No. What's it to you, anyway?

668
00:57:57,882 --> 00:58:01,213
I don't want to go
from Camilla Lopez to Camilla Bandini.

669
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:03,624
It's not much of an improvement.

670
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:07,022
Who asked you to go anywhere?

671
00:58:09,992 --> 00:58:12,293
-You'd ask me.
-No, I wouldn't.

672
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:14,924
-Yes, you would.
-I wouldn't.

673
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,663
-You would.
-I wouldn't.

674
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:23,842
I know you like the palm of my hand,
Arturo, and I'm telling you, you would.

675
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:25,872
Right after Sammy would.

676
00:58:26,282 --> 00:58:27,831
Would he do that?

677
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:30,352
Would Sammy ask you to marry him?

678
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:32,383
Who knows what Sammy's gonna do?

679
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:35,681
Would Sammy White ask
Camilla Lopez to be his wife?

680
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,152
-Who knows and who cares?
-You do.

681
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:41,392
I know you like
the back of my hand, Camilla.

682
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:44,892
I care about his name.

683
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:49,730
I want a chance in life.

684
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:54,832
I want my children to have a chance.

685
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,231
You think you're so smart!

686
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:02,779
You're gonna write a book
and have the world on a string, huh?

687
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:04,399
-Well, what if you don't?
-I will.

688
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:07,070
-Yeah, but what if you don't?
-I will!

689
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:10,520
You're book smart, but you're not smart.

690
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,149
And you're not rich,

691
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:17,748
and you're not nice!

692
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,690
You are loud, angry

693
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:26,398
-and poor.
-Then why stick around?

694
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:34,137
Come here.

695
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,609
What for?

696
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,048
Come here and I'll show you.

697
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:54,315
I'm busy.

698
00:59:54,997 --> 00:59:56,926
-You're afraid.
-Of what?

699
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,157
Of me.

700
01:00:04,606 --> 01:00:05,798
You are.

701
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:09,666
You're afraid of lying down next to me.

702
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:40,934
I'm terrified.

703
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:43,964
Take off your pants.

704
01:00:56,254 --> 01:01:00,282
-You want me to do it for you?
-Why don't you take off your pants?

705
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,693
They're off.

706
01:01:12,674 --> 01:01:14,221
How does it look?

707
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:18,933
All right.

708
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:21,943
Okay. Fine.

709
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,082
"All right"?

710
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:31,512
"Okay"? "Fine"?

711
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:35,452
Come on!

712
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:39,949
A great writer ought to do
better than that, don't you think?

713
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:43,560
Or maybe you're not so great.

714
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,301
Maybe you can't fuck or write!

715
01:01:48,132 --> 01:01:50,231
-I can't, huh?
-No! Stop it!

716
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,369
-Stop it!
-Think I can't, huh?

717
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,040
Think I can't!

718
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:01,239
-Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
-Think I can't? Think I can't?

719
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:04,079
-Stop it!
-Think I can't? Think I can't?

720
01:02:53,296 --> 01:02:55,557
Camilla would never forgive me.

721
01:02:55,737 --> 01:02:57,926
She was better off with Sammy.

722
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,066
I really didn't have the right
to touch her again.

723
01:03:22,656 --> 01:03:24,384
You look wonderful.

724
01:03:25,626 --> 01:03:27,523
Oh, say, that's quite a sight.

725
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:34,054
Enjoy the view.

726
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:37,095
Sit.

727
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:57,482
Here. Something nice and cool.

728
01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:00,722
It's not buttermilk?

729
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:05,694
Good.

730
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:13,172
Oh, darling, you're tired.

731
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:16,502
-A little.
-You're working late, as usual?

732
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:19,103
I wasn't working last night.

733
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:23,271
-Bad boy.
-I need to tell you something.

734
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:26,012
Let me guess. Out with your best girl?

735
01:04:29,093 --> 01:04:30,521
She's not my best girl.

736
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:33,050
Then you don't love her, anymore?
Oh, dear.

737
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:36,820
She doesn't love me,
unlikely as that seems.

738
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,020
-She doesn't love you?
-She hates my guts.

739
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,800
She couldn't do that.
How could she possibly...

740
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:48,301
Possibly because I insult
and humiliate her every chance I get.

741
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,710
You wouldn't.

742
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,840
You couldn't do such things.

743
01:04:54,379 --> 01:04:55,541
Oh, yeah?

744
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,341
I called her spic and greaser
and every name in the book.

745
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:02,079
And that's when I was in a good mood.
She's Mexican, by the way.

746
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:03,988
Oh.

747
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:08,889
Oh, my God.

748
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:12,221
Oh, my God.

749
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,798
-Oh, my God. God in heaven.
-What's going on?

750
01:05:14,898 --> 01:05:16,958
-What happened? Vera?
-God is punishing me.

751
01:05:17,068 --> 01:05:19,089
-Right now?
-What do you do to Jewish girls?

752
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:20,638
Jewish girls?

753
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:22,159
-All right, don't hit me.
-Are you nuts?

754
01:05:22,269 --> 01:05:24,900
-Okay, call me names, but don't hit me!
-I'm not going to hurt you.

755
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,996
I'm not going to hurt you.

756
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:29,807
Look, if I wanted to hurt you, I didn't
have to come all the way to Long Beach.

757
01:05:29,907 --> 01:05:31,469
I could've done it in my room.

758
01:05:33,077 --> 01:05:34,709
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Why would I hurt you?

759
01:05:34,819 --> 01:05:37,248
Why would I bother?
I don't even love you.

760
01:05:43,127 --> 01:05:45,177
Well, why did you come here?

761
01:05:46,227 --> 01:05:48,487
I wanted to make someone happy.

762
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:52,088
Oh, look, I'm sorry.
If I could just get my coat.

763
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,285
Is that why you insult her?

764
01:05:54,394 --> 01:05:58,167
Is that why you insult her,
because you can't make her happy?

765
01:06:01,937 --> 01:06:04,436
All I know is she usually starts it.

766
01:06:06,345 --> 01:06:08,366
How? What does she say?

767
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:12,246
-It's not so much what she says.
-What does she do?

768
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:16,175
Sometimes she'll walk across the room.

769
01:06:16,325 --> 01:06:18,257
That's pretty insulting.

770
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:22,224
Serve me a cup of coffee
wearing a brand new uniform.

771
01:06:22,324 --> 01:06:25,025
That's about as insulting
as anything gets.

772
01:06:28,395 --> 01:06:31,336
She's perfect, like the weather.

773
01:06:32,506 --> 01:06:35,195
Air and fog, eucalyptus,

774
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:37,363
dusty sunlight.

775
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:40,203
The perfect place to live.

776
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:42,974
Then we come along.

777
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:47,312
Dig for gold, drill for oil,
get into the movies,

778
01:06:47,412 --> 01:06:50,282
build these crappy hotels
and dirty streets.

779
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:52,473
We don't even come here to live.

780
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:56,654
We just dig it up, mess it up
and grab whatever we can get.

781
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,451
This is her home.

782
01:07:01,932 --> 01:07:04,191
If God had any sense or decency,

783
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:08,633
He'd blow us all to hell
and leave her home the way it was,

784
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:12,134
pure and perfect, like her.

785
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:18,403
-And you tell her these things?
-I don't tell her this.

786
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:20,711
It would sound like an insult.

787
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:25,283
No matter what I say to Camilla,
it sounds like an insult.

788
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:31,851
-Then tell it to me.
-What for?

789
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:34,562
Pretend I'm her. I'll believe you.

790
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:39,031
Look, I'd like to, but...

791
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:41,630
I am

792
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,361
Princess Camilla.

793
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:54,408
And all this beautiful land
belongs to me.

794
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,011
There are no Americans here.
No Los Angeles.

795
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,080
Just me and the desert
and the mountains and the sea.

796
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:04,881
And...

797
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,348
And then...

798
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,329
Then I come.

799
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,489
And then you come.

800
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:16,369
And you are?

801
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,669
I'm myself, Arturo Bandini.

802
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:20,097
The writer,

803
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:24,798
the genius of the Earth
has come here for me.

804
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:28,039
But I am proud,

805
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:33,006
and I resist and resist and resist!

806
01:08:35,018 --> 01:08:36,486
Until finally,

807
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:39,147
you're irresistible.

808
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:41,818
Your powers are legion.

809
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,417
You overwhelm me.

810
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:46,615
You conquer me.

811
01:08:48,626 --> 01:08:52,296
You are like a great conquistador.

812
01:08:53,237 --> 01:08:56,136
-You are like Corts.
-Only I'm Italian.

813
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:57,968
Only you're Italian.

814
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,154
You're very kind.

815
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:40,542
As he passes the endless rows
of canvas concessions

816
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:44,943
and customers eagerly wallowing
at their troughs of 10-cent pleasures.

817
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:47,542
Men in sailor suits
and girls in bathing suits,

818
01:09:47,652 --> 01:09:50,883
the old, the young, the aged and infirm,

819
01:09:51,524 --> 01:09:53,421
Bandini pitied them
their petty aspirations,

820
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:55,922
yet admired their boundless courage.

821
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:59,193
He was after all,
a lover of man and beast alike,

822
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:02,663
and he knew in his heart
what they knew in their hearts,

823
01:10:02,773 --> 01:10:07,001
that their place in the sun was really
no more than a handful of dust.

824
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:17,112
After all,
we're here only for a little while.

825
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,041
And then we're somewhere else.

826
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,951
Gone, like some forgotten dream.

827
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,422
Even you, Mencken.

828
01:11:07,727 --> 01:11:11,058
Apartment 201, Martene Wellesley?

829
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:12,430
Over here.

830
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:15,258
202, Vera Rivkin?

831
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:17,969
Vera Rivkin?

832
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,868
Forget it, Jack. She's over here.

833
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:23,637
She's gone.

834
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:26,108
208...

835
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:36,747
Thank you for tuning in to KFO X 1250.

836
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:39,488
The time is 4:35 p.m.

837
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:43,486
Most of the damage
in yesterday's 6.4-magnitude quake

838
01:11:43,596 --> 01:11:47,296
was sustained in the Long Beach,
Compton and Huntington Park areas,

839
01:11:47,395 --> 01:11:51,598
where early reports indicate
over 100 deaths and many more injured.

840
01:11:51,868 --> 01:11:54,836
While 25 miles away,
the heart of Los Angeles

841
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:57,334
seems to be relatively unaffected.

842
01:11:57,444 --> 01:12:00,035
For those without food
and shelter tonight...

843
01:12:07,084 --> 01:12:11,186
I decided to give Vera more life
than she had had a chance to live.

844
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:15,125
"The name on the mailbox
was Doris Slotkin.

845
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:16,915
"She lived down
on the Long Beach Pike,

846
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:19,753
"across the street from the Ferris wheel
and the roller coaster.

847
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:23,633
"She had pale skin and dark eyes,
brilliant from too much bourbon,

848
01:12:23,903 --> 01:12:26,164
"at once insolent and desperate.

849
01:12:26,734 --> 01:12:29,834
"I was soon to learn
the source of her desperation."

850
01:12:30,344 --> 01:12:31,935
Yeah, what is it?

851
01:12:34,944 --> 01:12:37,102
Writing another hot one, huh?

852
01:12:38,714 --> 01:12:39,773
I'm writing.

853
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:41,003
Just thought you'd wanna know

854
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:44,745
you got a registered letter
at the post office.

855
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:50,052
I'll just set it down on the dresser, okay?
Don't forget.

856
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:51,323
Thanks.

857
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:57,522
-How's it going?
-It's going.

858
01:12:57,964 --> 01:12:59,831
Well, keep going, okay?

859
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:04,460
Otherwise, you'll end up dying
in Los Angeles like the rest of us.

860
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,542
"Dear Mr. Bandini,

861
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:22,411
"I would rather not publish
this latest effort of yours just now.

862
01:13:22,521 --> 01:13:26,289
"For one thing, I believe it's a yarn
that is part of a bigger ball than you,

863
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:30,689
"in your present financial straits,
are able comfortably to contemplate.

864
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:34,319
"Therefore, please use
the enclosed $250

865
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:36,261
"to follow out the string.

866
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:39,499
"I suspect you'll find
it reaches novel length.

867
01:13:39,909 --> 01:13:42,240
"Very truly yours, H.L. Mencken."

868
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:46,040
I'd never written
more than a 10-page story,

869
01:13:46,549 --> 01:13:50,069
and here Mencken was telling me
to write an entire novel.

870
01:13:50,549 --> 01:13:52,520
How was I gonna do it?

871
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:10,557
-Who is it?
-It's me.

872
01:14:12,938 --> 01:14:15,739
I came through the window.
I hope you don't mind.

873
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,929
Not at all. Sounds like fun.

874
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:22,407
I'd like to come through the door.
How do you feel about that?

875
01:14:23,476 --> 01:14:25,308
Make yourself at home.

876
01:14:30,057 --> 01:14:31,779
What's the big idea?

877
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:33,615
I came to see you.

878
01:14:34,657 --> 01:14:38,217
Hard to believe, huh? Don't turn...
Don't do that.

879
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:47,255
-Who hit you?
-No one.

880
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,396
It was an automobile accident.

881
01:14:51,506 --> 01:14:53,805
Was Sammy driving the other car?

882
01:14:54,477 --> 01:14:56,536
Turn off the light, please.

883
01:15:06,055 --> 01:15:08,026
I don't know where to go.

884
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:11,287
You don't have to go anywhere.

885
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:14,093
I'm tired.

886
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:19,764
I'm tired. I'm so tired.

887
01:15:37,453 --> 01:15:39,044
Why did he do it?

888
01:15:42,652 --> 01:15:44,523
He said I asked for it.

889
01:15:46,362 --> 01:15:47,551
Did you?

890
01:15:48,663 --> 01:15:49,783
Maybe.

891
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:51,924
Maybe not.

892
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,861
Whenever they wanna hurt you,
that's what they say.

893
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:24,551
Arturo?

894
01:16:33,929 --> 01:16:36,159
-Where you going?
-Where are you going?

895
01:16:36,269 --> 01:16:37,429
Laguna.

896
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,131
Loan me a couple of bucks, could you?

897
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,959
I'll mail it when I get my job back.

898
01:16:46,178 --> 01:16:49,369
I thought maybe
you'd like to come along.

899
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:51,107
Oh, yeah?

900
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:53,209
Well, what for?

901
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:57,308
You look like you could use a rest.
Maybe even a walk on the beach.

902
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:00,077
-That's it?
-Isn't that enough?

903
01:17:02,988 --> 01:17:04,518
It's your funeral.

904
01:17:43,165 --> 01:17:45,096
I'll get the house keys.

905
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:23,962
That Mexican shit will get you deported.

906
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:28,534
Jesus Christ!

907
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,775
Don't sneak up on people like that.

908
01:18:35,982 --> 01:18:37,602
I'm not a hophead.

909
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:41,474
Every once in a while when I'm tired.
That's all.

910
01:18:42,623 --> 01:18:44,052
Throw it away.

911
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:48,751
-It doesn't bother me.
-It bothers me. Throw it away.

912
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:52,552
-In front of all these people?
-Now you're worried about it?

913
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:55,223
Promise you'll quit.

914
01:18:56,762 --> 01:18:59,530
-I cross my heart.
-Swear to God.

915
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:02,761
I swear to God.

916
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:23,780
Oh, my God!

917
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:27,049
Look at this place!

918
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,290
Look at this place!

919
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,947
I knew you'd like it.

920
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:56,888
No, you didn't.
Nobody's that predictable.

921
01:19:57,018 --> 01:19:59,918
You are.
You'll go for anything that's white.

922
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:03,358
You dago son of a bitch!

923
01:20:03,558 --> 01:20:06,996
Yeah, I knew you'd say
something like that.

924
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:10,956
You're teasing me.

925
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,897
You are.

926
01:20:16,737 --> 01:20:18,038
Get me up.

927
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:37,315
Here you go, Willie. Here you go.
Here you go.

928
01:20:38,396 --> 01:20:40,296
-How much?
-I don't know.

929
01:20:40,725 --> 01:20:42,426
Oh, you can come home!

930
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:44,757
He thinks he's being attacked!

931
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:49,625
-The ocean's out to get him personally.
-Tell him I understand the feeling.

932
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:16,251
Arturo! Arturo!

933
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,789
-What are you doing?
-Hold on a minute, fellas.

934
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:25,860
-Hurry up. Get dressed. Come on down.
-No. What for?

935
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,951
So the sides will be even.

936
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:30,320
What are you talking about?

937
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:34,659
Playing in the game.
You on one side, me on the other.

938
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:38,339
Are you crazy? With a bunch of Japs?

939
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:40,309
Yeah. They didn't want to play
with you, either.

940
01:22:40,408 --> 01:22:42,780
Why, 'cause I'm Mexican?

941
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:45,640
Worse. 'Cause you're a girl.

942
01:22:47,918 --> 01:22:49,108
Camilla.

943
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:50,947
Camilla.

944
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:53,847
-What?
-You might want to wear some pants.

945
01:23:02,367 --> 01:23:03,326
Give it to me!

946
01:23:04,698 --> 01:23:05,667
Camilla!

947
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:34,286
Thanks.

948
01:23:36,996 --> 01:23:39,257
What are you writing about now?

949
01:23:39,635 --> 01:23:41,996
-A girl.
-Is she Mexican?

950
01:23:43,505 --> 01:23:47,366
-Jewish, at the moment.
-She gonna change religions?

951
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:50,966
No. There might be more than one girl
in this, you know.

952
01:23:59,486 --> 01:24:01,246
What am I doing here?

953
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:06,154
Is it because
I make you feel sorry for me?

954
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,613
No.

955
01:24:11,165 --> 01:24:13,324
Then what do I make you feel?

956
01:24:18,036 --> 01:24:19,463
After everything that's happened,

957
01:24:19,573 --> 01:24:22,264
you can't imagine sleeping
with me anymore.

958
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:23,702
Is that it?

959
01:24:23,973 --> 01:24:27,104
I can and have imagined it.

960
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:33,482
I'm not sure I like you to do that.

961
01:24:33,582 --> 01:24:35,443
Why not? I did.

962
01:24:38,623 --> 01:24:43,393
Because what you imagine
might be better than the real thing.

963
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:47,181
I'm not that good a writer.

964
01:25:01,242 --> 01:25:02,671
Regardless,

965
01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:08,882
I think you should save
your imagination for your work.

966
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:13,610
Why waste it on me
when you don't have to?

967
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:20,021
Come to bed, Arturo.

968
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,761
Would you say please?

969
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:40,138
Please.

970
01:27:56,012 --> 01:27:58,601
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

971
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,432
Yeah.

972
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:40,009
Don't let go.

973
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,949
-Don't ever let go of me.
-Okay.

974
01:28:55,629 --> 01:28:58,330
I've never been served breakfast in bed.

975
01:29:00,036 --> 01:29:02,797
I've never been served
breakfast anywhere.

976
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,708
-What is it?
-Open it.

977
01:29:21,717 --> 01:29:25,388
-Another dog story.
-No, you're going to learn to read,

978
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:29,326
and you're gonna become
an American citizen.

979
01:29:31,597 --> 01:29:33,965
"Angus Lost."

980
01:29:36,406 --> 01:29:38,168
It looks like Willie.

981
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:41,995
"When winter came,

982
01:29:42,105 --> 01:29:45,505
"Angus grew tired of the same yard

983
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:47,707
"and the same house

984
01:29:48,346 --> 01:29:50,046
"and the same cat

985
01:29:50,945 --> 01:29:53,244
"and all the same things

986
01:29:53,784 --> 01:29:55,544
"he knew all about."

987
01:29:55,785 --> 01:29:57,755
This is a horrible story.

988
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,014
Will you give it a chance?

989
01:30:01,225 --> 01:30:04,496
"Angus was curious
about other places and other things..."

990
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:06,963
See? The cat is sad he's leaving.

991
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:08,864
-"What."
-"What."

992
01:30:09,164 --> 01:30:10,892
"What." Good.

993
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:15,125
-"...kind of animals cars are"
-"Cars."

994
01:30:16,873 --> 01:30:18,735
"...and things like that."

995
01:30:19,672 --> 01:30:22,802
-"What are the colors of our flag?"
-Red, white and blue.

996
01:30:22,912 --> 01:30:24,172
"How many stars are there on our flag?"

997
01:30:24,282 --> 01:30:25,273
Forty-eight.

998
01:30:25,383 --> 01:30:28,843
"There he was on the wide road.

999
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:31,144
"'Ruff!' called the other dog."

1000
01:30:31,254 --> 01:30:33,382
In Mexico, the dogs go...

1001
01:30:36,662 --> 01:30:39,952
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
that all men are created" what?

1002
01:30:40,062 --> 01:30:41,533
-Equal.
-Right.

1003
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:45,763
"That they are endowed by their Creator
with certain inalienable..."

1004
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,350
-Rights.
-Right.

1005
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:51,033
"Angus and the

-"up the weeday..."
-"Wide."

1009
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,940
"...wide road."

1010
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:05,641
"That among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of..."

1011
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:07,712
-Happiness.
-Right.

1012
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:10,740
"Around the corner

1013
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:15,250
"ran Angus."

1014
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,360
Arturo, what do they really mean
by that?

1015
01:31:18,831 --> 01:31:20,629
The pursuit of happiness?

1016
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:23,220
That in this country, you have the right
to go after whatever it is

1017
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,061
that makes you happy.

1018
01:31:25,701 --> 01:31:28,260
-What is that?
-What's what?

1019
01:31:29,339 --> 01:31:30,538
Happiness.

1020
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,179
"'Woof! Woof!' called..."

1021
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,709
No. There's no "F." "Woo, woo."

1022
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:42,308
"'Woo, woo,' called the eyes,
and Angus ran to find his house,

1023
01:31:42,588 --> 01:31:44,519
"but snow..."

1024
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:53,117
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1025
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:56,527
"Snow came and wind came,

1026
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:59,128
"and into a cave crawled Angus.

"And he waited and waited
and waited until..."

1028
01:32:03,737 --> 01:32:07,405
What does happiness mean to you,
Camilla? Do you even know?

1029
01:32:07,575 --> 01:32:08,637
Yeah.

1030
01:32:09,277 --> 01:32:12,077
That you can live in a place that is safe,

1031
01:32:14,246 --> 01:32:18,448
and fall in love with whoever you want to
and not feel ashamed of it.

1032
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:22,386
"From door to door, from door to door,

1034

01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:36,105
"and all the same things
he knew all about."

1037
01:32:37,876 --> 01:32:39,166
That's it.

1038
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:51,545
So how did it go?

1039
01:32:52,115 --> 01:32:53,104
Hey,

1040
01:32:55,185 --> 01:32:58,785
what do you say we try
and bust out of this joint tomorrow?

1041
01:33:01,065 --> 01:33:04,223
-What do you mean?
-Go into town. See a movie.

1042
01:33:07,503 --> 01:33:10,664
-But what about Willie?
-What about him?

1043
01:33:11,005 --> 01:33:14,563
Well, we've never left him alone.
What if he tries to run away?

1044
01:33:15,043 --> 01:33:16,333
Like Angus?

1045
01:33:17,112 --> 01:33:19,903
We'll lock him in the house.
He'll be fine.

1046
01:33:21,884 --> 01:33:23,573
I don't want to go.

1047
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:27,381
Why not?

1048
01:33:28,023 --> 01:33:31,453
Why should I go anywhere?
I'm right where I want to be.

1049
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,683
Well, eventually,
we gotta go somewhere.

1050
01:33:35,423 --> 01:33:38,194
Sooner or later,
we're gonna run out of money.

1051
01:33:38,293 --> 01:33:41,492
-Probably before I finish the book.
-Well, write faster.

1052
01:33:41,602 --> 01:33:43,931
You can buy this place, and then
we don't have to go anywhere.

1053
01:33:44,031 --> 01:33:48,332
Sweetheart, I'm up to 2,000 words
a day. I can't type faster than that.

1054
01:33:50,072 --> 01:33:53,410
I don't want to be some Mexican
out with a white guy.

1055
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:56,171
Everybody would stare at me.

1056
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:00,280
Camilla, no matter where you go,
people are gonna stare at you.

1057
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:03,980
And it's not because you're Mexican
or you're out with me.

1058
01:34:07,318 --> 01:34:09,020
I don't want to go.

1059
01:34:10,289 --> 01:34:12,780
I'm just not ready for it right now.

1060
01:34:14,361 --> 01:34:15,421
What?

1061
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:20,059
-You're not reading the book.
-Of course I'm reading the book.

1062
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:21,999
-No, you're not.
-I am.

1063
01:34:22,369 --> 01:34:24,430
Then why is it upside down?

1064
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,249
-Where did you get this?
-I wanted to read it.

1065
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:38,619
Well, it's junk.
It's not even part of the book.

1066
01:34:39,618 --> 01:34:42,649
What does it say?
Come on, what does it say?

1067
01:34:46,996 --> 01:34:49,657
"When I was a kid back in Colorado,

1068
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:54,027
"it was Smith and Parker and Jones
who hurt me with their hideous names,

1069
01:34:54,137 --> 01:34:56,597
"who called me wop and dago
and greaser,

1070
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:59,827
"and their children hurt me
just as I hurt you."

1071
01:35:01,837 --> 01:35:02,897
Junk.

1072
01:35:13,615 --> 01:35:16,845
I think it should definitely
be a part of the book.

1073
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:23,786
And I'll go with you into town
if you want me to.

1074
01:35:24,368 --> 01:35:25,827
To the movies.

1075
01:35:27,134 --> 01:35:29,725
Okay. That's swell.

1076
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:36,435
-Hey, you really are scared.
-Of course I am.

1077
01:35:37,847 --> 01:35:38,866
Why?

1078
01:35:45,945 --> 01:35:47,676
It's our first date.

1079
01:35:56,523 --> 01:36:01,255
Don't want to set the world on fire

1080
01:36:02,834 --> 01:36:05,165
I just want to start

1081
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:23,172
Camilla, are you all right in there?

1082
01:36:25,783 --> 01:36:27,012
I'm fine.

1083
01:36:30,322 --> 01:36:32,383
I'm almost ready. I'm fine.

1084
01:36:53,481 --> 01:36:55,471
-After you.
-Thank you.

1085
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:06,350
-...people out of work that...
-No, no, no, no!

1086
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,690
Please don't do anything like that.

1087
01:37:09,131 --> 01:37:13,328
Go ahead and rehearse. But promise
me that Ezra won't find out about me.

1088
01:37:13,568 --> 01:37:15,400
Now don't you worry because...

1089
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,269
Come on. Come on. Get into it.
Hit the deck. Let's see it now.

1090
01:37:20,408 --> 01:37:21,840
Barbara!

1091
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:27,368
-Barbara!
-My name is Joan Grey.

1092
01:37:27,478 --> 01:37:29,848
-You go put on some clothes!
-Why, I have them on.

1093
01:37:29,948 --> 01:37:31,279
Why, that's disgraceful!

1094
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:33,978
No, no. Barbara's just here as a visitor.
She isn't really in the show.

1095
01:37:34,088 --> 01:37:35,519
Oh, is that so?

1096
01:37:35,619 --> 01:37:37,089
Well, you asked me
to come to rehearsal,

1097
01:37:37,188 --> 01:37:38,709
and your dance director hired me.

1098
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:40,617
I got in this show,
and I'm going to stay in.

1099
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:43,257
Now, now. Now, honey,
maybe your father's right.

1100
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,828
Oh, you don't want me around,
is that it?

1101
01:37:45,928 --> 01:37:48,919
Afraid I'll cramp your style
with your darling Mabel?

1102
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:51,189
I've heard enough of this.
You get some clothes on!

1103
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:54,697
I don't care what either of you say.
I'm free, white and 21.

1104
01:37:55,168 --> 01:37:58,168
And if you fire me from this show,
I'll get a job in another one.

1105
01:38:00,846 --> 01:38:04,709
Oh, wait till Ezra and Matilda
hear about this. I'm ruined. Sunk. Lost.

1106
01:38:04,818 --> 01:38:06,275
Now, now, listen. You don't...

1107
01:38:12,556 --> 01:38:13,746
Camilla?

1108
01:38:14,527 --> 01:38:16,856
-Camilla, are you all right in there?
-I'm fine.

1109
01:38:16,956 --> 01:38:18,287
Then what's

1110
01:38:20,996 --> 01:38:22,466
taking so long?

1111
01:38:26,336 --> 01:38:27,527
Nothing.

1112
01:38:28,607 --> 01:38:29,566
Hey,

1113
01:38:30,907 --> 01:38:32,137
let's go.

1114
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,474
Or you want to watch
the rest of the picture?

1115
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,544
-I've seen enough already.
-Good.

1116
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:42,705
Come on.

1117
01:38:45,655 --> 01:38:48,514
Is something wrong?
Beside from the obvious.

1118
01:38:48,654 --> 01:38:52,454
-The obvious? What would that be?
-Getting upset like I did.

1119
01:38:52,724 --> 01:38:55,884
-Well, it was upsetting.
-Well, I overreacted.

1120
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:58,425
Well, sometimes
you just can't help yourself.

1121
01:38:58,535 --> 01:39:01,124
What are you doing? Give me that!
Let go!

1122
01:39:01,233 --> 01:39:03,063
Goddamn you!
You're gonna get us killed!

1123
01:39:03,173 --> 01:39:04,724
-You let go! Let go!
-Let go!

1124
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:15,503
You've been doing this all along,
haven't you?

1125
01:39:15,613 --> 01:39:17,673
-What's it matter?
-It doesn't. You'll give your word,

1126
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:20,342
swear to God,
swear on a stack of Bibles,

1127
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:23,012
none of it matters,
not when it comes to marijuana.

1128
01:39:23,122 --> 01:39:26,710
But it's not the marijuana. It's me.

1129
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:29,581
-What are you talking about?
-What else?

1130
01:39:29,691 --> 01:39:32,422
I saw it tonight at the movies. I felt it.

1131
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:35,222
I embarrass you just being by your side.

1132
01:39:35,932 --> 01:39:37,192
You call me beautiful at home,

1133
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:39,770
then you're ashamed
to be seen with me in public.

1134
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:42,270
You're ashamed of beauty
you recognize that no one else does.

1135
01:39:42,371 --> 01:39:45,771
-You're ashamed to love me.
-Camilla, I swear to God, that's not true.

1136
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:47,360
-Prove it.
-How?

1137
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,271
Marry me.

1138
01:40:00,389 --> 01:40:03,550
You see? That'll never happen.

1139
01:40:04,592 --> 01:40:06,029
You know why?

1140
01:40:06,158 --> 01:40:09,599
'Cause you're too ashamed
of being Italian to marry a Mexican.

1141
01:40:09,698 --> 01:40:13,399
If it wasn't the marijuana,
it would've been something else.

1142
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:17,861
Go home, Arturo.

1143
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:22,108
Go home and drink to life, liberty

1144
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,938
and the pursuit of happiness.

1145
01:40:31,349 --> 01:40:32,547
Camilla!

1146
01:40:56,577 --> 01:40:57,738
Willie!

1147
01:41:02,076 --> 01:41:03,046
Willie!

1148
01:41:27,474 --> 01:41:29,404
I had to get out of there.

1149
01:41:29,975 --> 01:41:32,205
I used some of the advance money
from the book

1150
01:41:32,305 --> 01:41:35,105
and bought the '31 Ford
from the bait shop.

1151
01:41:35,415 --> 01:41:37,536
Camilla? She just up and quit.

1152
01:41:38,446 --> 01:41:40,543
-Where'd she go?
-Who knows?

1153
01:41:40,914 --> 01:41:44,043
She packed up her place
over at the Alameda, too.

1154
01:41:48,995 --> 01:41:51,326
Back in L.A., it wasn't any better.

1155
01:41:51,865 --> 01:41:54,153
I looked for Camilla everywhere,
and everywhere I looked,

1156
01:41:54,263 --> 01:41:56,492
all the faces seemed like mine.

1157
01:41:56,602 --> 01:41:59,893
Tight. Worried. Lost.

1158
01:42:00,332 --> 01:42:02,563
Faces with the blood drained away.

1159
01:42:02,673 --> 01:42:06,692
Faces like flowers torn from their roots,
the colors fading fast.

1160
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:21,122
Mr. Bandini.

1161
01:42:26,222 --> 01:42:27,822
"Dear Mr. Bandini,

1162
01:42:27,932 --> 01:42:29,792
"things out here in Pearblossom

1163
01:42:29,892 --> 01:42:32,560
"haven't gone so good
the last few months.

1164
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:37,030
"I'm not doing real well and
that Mexican girl is sick as a dog

1165
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,261
"and getting sicker every day.

1166
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:43,231
"You best come get her
before she cashes in on me."

1167
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,768
Where's Sammy?

1168
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,598
I gave him 30 bucks
and told him to take a hike.

1169
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:24,280
Why, you miss him?

1170
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,337
I'll get over it.

1171
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:31,089
-What are those?
-You know what they are.

1172
01:43:44,597 --> 01:43:48,368
-I'm taking you back to L.A.
-Oh, I am not going anywhere with you.

1173
01:43:49,637 --> 01:43:52,626
Why should I? You'll just gloat to me.

1174
01:43:53,905 --> 01:43:56,376
Over me. It's gloat over me.

1175
01:43:56,506 --> 01:43:59,106
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1176
01:43:59,646 --> 01:44:01,677
You're just here so you can

1177
01:44:02,686 --> 01:44:04,878
remind me how inferior I am.

1178
01:44:06,354 --> 01:44:09,616
Now I'm not just a dumb spic,
but a sick one.

1179
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:15,626
Well, feast your eyes.

1180
01:44:18,097 --> 01:44:19,624
I'm here because

1181
01:44:20,763 --> 01:44:22,095
I love you.

1182
01:44:25,236 --> 01:44:27,174
And I want to marry you.

1183
01:44:30,474 --> 01:44:32,066
What did you say?

1184
01:44:32,643 --> 01:44:34,735
I said, I want to marry you.

1185
01:44:39,284 --> 01:44:40,774
Holy shit.

1186
01:44:48,363 --> 01:44:51,793
I remember the first day
you walked into the caf.

1187
01:44:52,493 --> 01:44:54,053
You made me mad.

1188
01:44:54,504 --> 01:44:57,233
Arturo, you're always mad at something.

1189
01:44:58,905 --> 01:45:00,391
Like what else?

1190
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:03,272
How about the world?

1191
01:45:05,513 --> 01:45:08,743
I just keep reminding you
of how mad at it you are.

1192
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:11,884
It's the way you look.

1193
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,972
The way I look?

1194
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,083
Beautiful.

1195
01:45:18,992 --> 01:45:21,423
The first time I saw you, I figured

1196
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:24,052
I'd never be good enough for you,

1197
01:45:24,164 --> 01:45:26,990
no matter what I do
for the rest of my life.

1198
01:45:33,271 --> 01:45:34,572
Come here.

1199
01:45:36,201 --> 01:45:37,502
Come here.

1200
01:45:38,512 --> 01:45:39,799
Come here.

1201
01:45:44,211 --> 01:45:45,681
Oh, I love you.

1202
01:45:51,022 --> 01:45:53,078
From the minute you saw me.

1203
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:55,979
No.

1204
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:00,791
You sort of grew in me.

1205
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:03,560
On me.

1206
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:06,628
Grew on me.

1207
01:46:07,368 --> 01:46:09,429
No, you grew in me.

1208
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:12,039
Like a baby.

1209
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,709
-Arturo.
-Yes, Camilla.

1210
01:46:23,687 --> 01:46:25,149
In the future,

1211
01:46:26,647 --> 01:46:30,920
make more of an effort to be nicer
to people when you meet them.

1212
01:46:31,829 --> 01:46:32,786
Okay.

1213
01:46:32,986 --> 01:46:35,457
First impressions are very important.

1214
01:46:35,557 --> 01:46:37,998
-Try to make a good one.
-Okay.

1215
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,698
-It makes things easier.
-I understand. Okay, okay.

1216
01:46:41,998 --> 01:46:43,398
-Okay.
-Okay.

1217
01:46:51,277 --> 01:46:53,766
Camilla Bandini.

1218
01:46:57,588 --> 01:46:59,845
I think I could get used to it.

1219
01:47:21,336 --> 01:47:22,775
Don't let go.

1220
01:47:23,975 --> 01:47:27,063
Don't ever let go of me. Don't ever...

1221
01:47:30,214 --> 01:47:32,475
Camilla, I'll get you to the doctor.

1222
01:47:38,855 --> 01:47:40,042
Camilla?

1223
01:50:01,856 --> 01:50:03,716
"When I was a kid back in Colorado,

1224
01:50:03,826 --> 01:50:08,025
"it was Smith and Parker and Jones
who hurt me with their hideous names,

1225
01:50:08,365 --> 01:50:11,155
"who called me wop and dago
and greaser,

1226
01:50:11,795 --> 01:50:14,825
"and their children hurt me
just as I hurt you.

1227
01:50:16,205 --> 01:50:19,334
"They hurt me so much,
I could never become one of them.

1228
01:50:19,434 --> 01:50:22,434
"Drove me to books.
Drove me within myself.

1229
01:50:23,643 --> 01:50:25,804
"Drove me to run away
from that Colorado town

1230
01:50:25,914 --> 01:50:28,275
"and into your home and your life.

1231
01:50:29,085 --> 01:50:30,574
"And sometimes,

1232
01:50:31,216 --> 01:50:33,543
"when I see their faces out here,

1233
01:50:34,524 --> 01:50:38,923
"the same faces, the same set
of hard mouths from my hometown,

1234
01:50:39,824 --> 01:50:42,264
"I'm glad they're here
fulfilling the emptiness of their lives

1235
01:50:42,363 --> 01:50:44,095
"and dying in the sun.

1236
01:50:44,665 --> 01:50:48,153
"And they hate me and my father
and my father's father,

1237
01:50:48,532 --> 01:50:51,733
"but they are old,
and I am young and full of hope

1238
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:55,633
"and love for my country and my times."

1239
01:50:56,902 --> 01:51:00,862
And Camilla,
when I said greaser to you,

1240
01:51:00,982 --> 01:51:04,973
it was not my heart that spoke,
but the quivering of an old wound.

1241
01:51:05,712 --> 01:51:08,842
And I am ashamed
of the terrible thing I have done.
