1
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:33,790
Your mother was so happy...

2
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,025
when she found out
she was going to have twins.

3
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,135
She bought matching clothes for you.

4
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,410
Same crib.

5
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:50,945
Yeah. It'll be good for you
to get away for a while, hmm?

6
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,700
Spend some time with your friends.

7
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,625
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,900
All right.

9
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,935
No, Mommy, there will be
no shenanigans.

10
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,860
No, we're not drinking.

11
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,840
Okay.

12
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,835
Yeah, I'll tell him.

13
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:28,865
- Dude, I don't think you should let Megan see that.
- What?

14
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,065
- Oh, yeah. No, you're right.
- She still taking her makeups in August?

15
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:36,314
- That's what she told me.
- Hey. She's here.

16
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,322
- Hey,you.
- Hey.

17
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,177
Long time, no see.

18
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,105
Come here.

19
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,585
I'm so glad you're doing this.

20
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,297
Can't blow off Senior Week.
It's tradition, right?

21
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,249
M.T., how ya doin'?

22
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,527
Good.

23
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,442
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

24
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:07,286
- I'll just get those for you.
- Thanks.

25
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,897
Mark, you wanna pick up the pace a little?

26
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,913
I wanna get there
by the time the sun sets.

27
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:27,425
Dude, this is gonna be such a rockin' Senior Week.

28
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,473
I'm so glad you could make it.
Seriously.

29
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,985
This is so cool.

30
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,345
Hey, you remember this place?

31
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:55,265
You remember the crazy old woman
who works here?

32
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:58,017
Are you kidding?
It's the best part of coming to this store.

33
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,937
Please do not forget toilet paper.
All right?

34
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:01,921
Last time I had to wipe my ass
with a potato chip bag.

35
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,097
- Mark.
- What, babe? It was barbecue.

36
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:07,335
We know. Ugh.

37
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,977
Barbecue sauce-
it has some "G" in it. It burns, man. Bad.

38
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,901
- Stop.
- Okay, fine.

39
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,828
Hi.

40
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,687
Psst. Check out the new guy.

41
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,961
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:43,104
I think we're a little bit lost.

43
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,664
You wouldn't happen to know the way
to Nowell Lake from here, would you?

44
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:49,185
Sure. Just stay on this road
for about another three miles or so.

45
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:54,248
You'll see the turnoff on the right.
So just look for the sign.

46
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,337
You, uh- Y'all from the city?

47
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,865
Yeah. We come here every summer
for St.John's Eve.

48
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:03,235
Oh. Summer solstice.
Right on.

49
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,768
- You know about that?
- Oh,yeah.

50
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,692
Cajun, born and bred.

51
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,608
So, what are we reading here?

52
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,552
Oh, that? Ghosts, black magic,
communicatin' with the dead.

53
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:13,216
Fortean Times.

54
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:15,876
It's pretty cool stuff.

55
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:25,056
- You can have it if you want. I'm done with it.
- You sure?

56
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:28,245
Yeah. I was just about
to throw it away.

57
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,478
Have a great day.

58
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,464
Thanks. Take care.

59
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,306
Megan. Time to go.

60
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:49,376
- Oh.
- You can read your magazine in the car.

61
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:52,891
- I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

62
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:33,632
You ready?
Everybody's waiting.

63
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,384
- Yeah. Sorry. I was just-
- You okay?

64
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,597
Yeah. Fine.

65
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,687
That guy was so hot.

66
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,671
He was cute.

67
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,616
- Mangy, but-
- What guy?

68
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,207
No, there was just a new guy.
working there behind the counter.

69
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:56,127
- Ah. So a local hick, huh?
- Mark-

70
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:01,376
You know, Mark,
for an alleged heterosexual...

71
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:04,103
- you have the most moist
collection of music I've ever seen.

72
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:04,608
Very funny.

73
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,943
Will you stop getting
processed barbecue all over my-

74
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,767
Look out!

75
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:18,375
Hey. You okay?

76
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:21,255
Sorry.

77
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,322
Creepy.

78
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah. See, this is about the time
that we run out of gas...

79
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,464
- and the men get gang-raped
by a band of the inbred locals.

80
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:37,594
What the-

81
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,576
Please tell me
you did not run out of gas.

82
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,655
No, babe. We have half a tank.
I don't-

83
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:49,535
All right,just don't pump it.
It might be flooded.

84
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:58,751
There we go.

85
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,892
Looks like somebody needs a tune-up.

86
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,875
I just had one done.

87
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:05,888
It's okay.

88
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,871
All right, someone choose some music.

89
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,934
- Come here.
- I can't even bear to look at that thing anymore.

90
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:40,645
I forgot how beautiful this place is.

91
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,725
Hey, um, Megan?

92
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,383
- Can I have the keys?
- Sure.

93
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:51,135
- I call master bedroom.
- Call bullshit!

94
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:53,215
That's ours!
I've got the keys.

95
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,554
Christian?

96
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:29,632
Is everything okay?

97
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:32,006
Yeah. Sure.

98
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,590
Are you gonna
take the downstairs room?

99
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,518
Yeah.

100
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,876
Beer. How you doin'?

101
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:45,014
- I'm gonna go help Mark, so-
- All right.

102
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,695
It's Christmas vacation, Sophie.

103
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,615
Lighten up.
Mom's not gonna care.

104
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,182
That's not the point, Megan.

105
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:38,897
The point is to have a good time,
something you should do for a change.

106
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:41,222
Hey!

107
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,472
What's your problem?

108
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:47,462
I can't do this.

109
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,413
What's wrong with you?

110
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:56,033
Sophie.

111
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,235
Sophie, you're losing it.

112
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:09,470
Hey, the twins have finally arrived.

113
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,501
We were starting to think
you guys forgot about us.

114
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,853
Hey, Christian.

115
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,002
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

116
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,646
You might wanna see
what's going on with Sophie though.

117
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:29,036
Hey. We're gonna go for a swim
before it gets dark. You wanna come?

118
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:37,800
Meg, you know, you can take my room
if it gets too weird for you.

119
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,996
No. It's okay.

120
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,165
I just found this.

121
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,255
When was it taken?

122
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,365
I guess about a year ago.

123
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,653
She and Christian
got in so much trouble for that.

124
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:57,502
I think she told my mom
she stayed at my Aunt Kathy's.

125
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,748
She was never a good liar.

126
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,611
She loved that stupid hat.

127
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,510
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go swimming.
- Oh.

128
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,269
No. I promised my mom
I'd pack up these things.

129
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:16,509
Rather do it now so it's not staring me
in the face all weekend.

130
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:19,650
Aha!

131
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,100
Zoe?

132
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,172
The correct answer to the question...

133
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:00,092
"In what fictional
Southern California town...

134
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,652
does The Lost Boys take place," is-

135
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,213
- Santa Carla.
- Carla!

136
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:08,540
- Okay, you guys are officially Cory Feldman geeks.
- Oh, okay.

137
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,360
Sorry. I don't sit around and watch
I love the '80s all day.

138
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:16,188
Uh-uh. Double up.
It's house rules.

139
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:18,969
This is wine.
Mark's drinking beer.

140
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:21,345
Drink.

141
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,717
Drink up, babe.

142
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,644
- Goddamn it, Mark.
- Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't mean-

143
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,404
Sorry doesn't get wine
out of my shirt.

144
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,260
Chill out, Lish.
It's just a shirt.

145
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,180
It's not like I meant
to spill it on you.

146
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,124
It was a Christmas gift from Sophie.

147
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm gonna go to bed.

148
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:52,878
I'd better go run
some damage control.

149
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,286
See you guys tomorrow.

150
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,335
Yeah. It's been a long day.

151
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,212
- Guys, good night.
- Night, Zoe.

152
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:07,523
See you tomorrow.

153
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,219
Are you going anywhere?

154
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:37,502
For school, I mean.

155
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,996
After you finish your makeups.

156
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,777
I haven't really thought about it.

157
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,865
Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

158
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,091
Okay.

159
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,409
You know, Megan...

160
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:57,616
if you ever want
to talk about anything-

161
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,771
You know.

162
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,347
Thanks, Christian.

163
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,543
Good night.

164
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,467
Good night.

165
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,527
- Hey!
- Hey.

166
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,450
There you are.

167
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,403
- Hey.
- M.T.

168
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:41,371
- Nice party, guys.
- Where's your sister?

169
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,498
Anderson. Come on, get your girl.
Meet us in the kitchen.

170
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,251
-Rum runners.
- Don't tell me they're getting back together.

171
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,203
I don't know.

172
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:10,026
I don't think she knows
what she wants anymore.

173
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:13,316
Dude, he has the hots for you.

174
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,867
As far as I'm concerned-

175
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:22,843
As far as I'm concerned,
no matter where we go-

176
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:26,010
- All you guys- You'll always be right here.
- Oh.

177
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,125
- Wow.
- That's sweet.

178
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:29,467
- And sweetheart?
- Mm-hmm?

179
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,707
- You'll always be right here.
- Ew!

180
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,570
- You're such a jerk.
- I'm kidding.

181
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,569
Ow! Ow.

182
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,884
Ow!

183
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,321
Sophie?

184
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:14,433
Hello?

185
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,322
Hello?

186
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,098
Who's there?

187
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,641
Business is off-

188
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,088
What are you doing up?

189
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:04,028
The car- The lights were on.

190
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,977
Someone must have went out
and get something.

191
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:12,321
Well, they're off now.

192
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,489
That's 'cause
I turned 'em off-

193
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:16,417
Twice.

194
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,275
They came back on by themselves.

195
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,065
It must just be
a short or something.

196
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:25,764
I'll check it out in the morning.

197
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,498
This was on the front seat.

198
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,331
It was Sophie's.

199
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:38,361
I packed it away..

200
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,605
earlier today.

201
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:45,166
Everyone keeps asking me
why she did it.

202
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,159
Like- Like I should have
seen it coming. Like-

203
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:54,944
- Like it's my fault she's gone.
- Megan.

204
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,049
That is crazy.
No one blames you.

205
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,889
She's my sister.
Nobody was closer to her than me.

206
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:04,409
- I should have seen it.
- Hey, come here. Come on. Come here.

207
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:07,108
It's not your fault.

208
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,572
Come on.
It's not your fault.

209
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:15,385
You know, I didn't see it coming either.
Nobody did.

210
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:18,111
Look at me.
Hey. Look at me.

211
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:21,536
Look at me.

212
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:23,544
I can't.

213
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:25,658
Megan, look at me.

214
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:31,489
We both loved Sophie.

215
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:39,864
And even though she and l
weren't together anymore...

216
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,792
we were still close.

217
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:45,910
You know, she never judged people.

218
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:52,415
So don't judge yourself.
That's not what she'd want.

219
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:55,296
Thank you.

220
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:01,696
You were always so good to her.

221
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,985
You guys make it easy.

222
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:39,705
I just keep thinking about Sophie...

223
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,972
about what she would want.

224
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:48,885
I think she'd want us to be happy.

225
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:53,182
I just want to feel something again.

226
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:55,167
I know.

227
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:13,625
- What?
- Nothing.

228
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,360
- Morning.
- Morning.

229
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,311
Late night?

230
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,127
Uh, I guess.

231
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,480
Hey, Christian.

232
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:45,471
Hey.

233
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,463
Did any of you guys
use the car last night?

234
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:56,215
Uh-uh. You saw
Mark and I got to bed.

235
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,485
The lights were on
and the door was open.

236
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:03,675
- You sure nobody went out there?
- No.

237
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,420
Right.

238
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,599
You know, come to think about it,
I did hear something last night.

239
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,674
- You did?
- Yeah.

240
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,103
I mean, it started off real faint...

241
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:20,721
and then it grew with intensity.

242
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:23,224
It was like, uh-

243
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:25,211
"Oh, Christian.

244
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:27,581
"Oh, Christian.

245
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:30,999
"Oh, Christian, please don't stop.
Please just keep-

246
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,759
- Stop it.
- "Oh, don't stop it.

247
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:35,222
"Keep- Oh!
Keep going, Christian.

248
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:38,839
Please don't stop. Please keep going."
And then it stopped.

249
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:45,309
Okay, shut it off.

250
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:52,183
Can't find anything. I think it's probably
just a loose connection somewhere.

251
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:54,103
But the door was open too.

252
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:56,119
Meg, I checked.
There's nothing missing.

253
00:28:56,128 --> 00:29:00,286
- You wanna break out the canoe?
- Sure.

254
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,714
All right.
Guess I'll get a head start then.

255
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:11,749
Do you want to go for a canoe ride?

256
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,519
No. I think I'm gonna go for a run.

257
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,463
Okay. I'll see you
when you get back.

258
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,854
Okay, "Smoochy McSmooch."

259
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,778
See you.

260
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,202
Ow.

261
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,542
Hey.

262
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:06,713
What you doin',
pokin' around my truck?

263
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:09,500
Oh, nothin'. Sorry.

264
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:15,573
- That hat in your truck-
- What about it?

265
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,501
Where did you get it?

266
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,101
What the hell are you doin'
out here, anyway?

267
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:32,029
I was jogging.

268
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:34,198
Yeah. Well, all the rain and everything...

269
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,501
got the swamp all "swole" up.

270
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:38,747
Creates a lot of sinkholes.

271
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:40,726
Now, if you get in one of those...

272
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:43,381
they won't find your carcass
until the dry season-

273
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,309
maybe not at all.

274
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:48,855
Can I give you a lift?

275
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,934
Oh, no, no.

276
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,592
That's okay. I'm all right.

277
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,581
Thanks.

278
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,405
Should I get a bigger bottle?

279
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:02,619
Just drink your beer, baby.

280
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:05,377
Drink your beer.

281
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,853
This thing isn't calibrated right.

282
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:14,901
I can't imagine why her parents
would keep it around.

283
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,917
Can't hit a damn thing with it.

284
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:20,501
No, honey, you're hitting something.
It's just not that bottle.

285
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,645
This is completely
none of my business-

286
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,597
about you and Megan.

287
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,677
I mean, I'm happy you guys are together.

288
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:30,069
We all are, but she's-

289
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:33,045
She's just really vulnerable right now.

290
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,381
And she's my best friend,
and-and I worry about her.

291
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:37,301
It's cool, Zoe. I get it.

292
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,597
But I'm not gonna make Megan
do anything she doesn't want to do.

293
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,837
We're just takin' it
one day at a time.

294
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:45,596
I know. Okay. I know.

295
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,700
- Right?
- I know. I know.

296
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,198
Okay.

297
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,739
Well, looks calibrated to me.

298
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:58,965
- Baby, where were you aiming?
- Straight ahead, honey.

299
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:00,437
- Straight ahead.
- Gimme that.

300
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,361
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

301
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:11,636
Shit. I hope we didn't
piss off the neighbors.

302
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:14,418
Lish, we don't have any neighbors.

303
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:30,812
Redneck alert.

304
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,680
Hey. How you doin'?

305
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:38,266
Hey.

306
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,973
Ran across one
of your friends earlier.

307
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:44,980
Looks like she had a little trouble
out in the swamp.

308
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,381
Thought I'd drop over and make sure...

309
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,332
she got back okay.

310
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,316
Yeah, no, no.
She's fine. Thanks.

311
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:56,541
"Brung" ya a fresh-picked
Louisiana watermelon.

312
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,465
Name's Leonard.

313
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,236
Need anything, just give a shout.

314
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:09,044
- I'm right across the lake over here.
- Will do.

315
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:28,342
Hey. You ran into
that creepy old guy?

316
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,829
Yeah. While I was jogging.

317
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:35,317
It's no big deal.

318
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,509
Really. Everything's fine.

319
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:56,346
- Oh! Ta-da.
- Okay, wait. Wait.

320
00:35:56,414 --> 00:36:01,305
- Let's get another game goin'.
- I need to use the restroom.

321
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:40,981
Sophie. Sophie!

322
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:45,271
Call an ambulance!

323
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,220
Sophie, wake up!

324
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:49,971
- Help me.
- Sophie! Grab her legs. Come on.

325
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,763
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Sophie.

326
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:55,156
- Is she breathing? Is she breathing?
- I can't feel her pulse.

327
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:57,236
Sophie, wake up.
Come on, Sophie, wake up.

328
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:58,835
Sophie!

329
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:03,604
- Call 911!
- Please!

330
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:06,771
- How many pills did she take?
- Sophie!

331
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:09,012
- What is that? What did she take?
- Oh, God.

332
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,028
- Where's the ambulance?
- They're gonna need to pump her stomach.

333
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:14,260
- Somebody please wait for the ambulance.
- Sophie!

334
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,187
Wake up!

335
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,748
Damn.

336
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,731
I forgot to get limes
for the marinade.

337
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,939
Can someone please make a run
to the store for me?

338
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,531
Don't look at me.
I'm not goin' there again.

339
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,451
Why, Zoe? What happened?

340
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:12,659
- I thought you wanted to be the grocery girl.
- Rule number one:

341
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,091
Do not purchase tampons
from the guy you're trying to hit on.

342
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:18,419
- Nice.
- Way to reel 'em in, Zoe.

343
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,363
What was I supposed to do? There's no
friggin' store within 20 miles of this place.

344
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:23,379
- Can't you guys just use a napkin or something?
- Ew.

345
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:25,303
That's disgusting.

346
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,859
- Okay, well, I still need a volunteer, so-
- I'll go.

347
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:30,356
What? I don't mind.

348
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:32,916
Cool. Thanks.

349
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,867
See you later.

350
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:43,699
She seems to be doing okay. You know?

351
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,579
Yeah. I think she's all right.

352
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,628
Zoe, don't! Oh, my God.

353
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,475
- What the hell is that?
- That's so gross.

354
00:38:51,485 --> 00:38:56,402
I'm tellin' you, man,
there's something not right with that guy.

355
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:21,146
- Hi.
- Hi.

356
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:25,288
- How's solstice treating you?
- Oh, great, thanks.

357
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:29,659
Uh, don't take this the wrong way..

358
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:34,514
but what are some up-towners like you guys
doing celebrating St.John's Day?

359
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:37,010
My mom teaches
cultural anthropology at Loyola...

360
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:39,762
so we celebrate pretty much
every holiday known to man.

361
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:43,154
Might be going there myself.
I applied for an academic scholarship so-

362
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:46,033
- Really? I'm impressed.
- No.

363
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:49,075
Don't be.
If I don't get accepted then, uh-

364
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:53,330
Well, hey, I'll be stuck behind this counter
for a little while longer.

365
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,635
- Your name is Megan, right?
- Yeah.

366
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,831
- I'm Nick.
- Nice to meet you, Nick.

367
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,809
Almost forgot dinner.

368
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,437
Can I ask you something?

369
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:15,602
- Sure.
- You know what they say about the solstice-

370
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:19,378
about spirits crossing over,
that kind of thing.

371
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:21,875
Yeah.

372
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:24,306
Have you ever seen anything...

373
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:27,381
you know, strange?

374
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,929
Well, um, I'll tell you what.

375
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:32,978
Growing up in these parts...

376
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:34,930
you-you learn to keep an open mind.

377
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:38,322
My, uh, grandmother
liked to dabble in a little voodoo.

378
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:40,402
She used to believe
she could talk to the dead...

379
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:43,161
especially around the solstice.

380
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:47,417
If she believed it
then, uh, who am I to argue?

381
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,770
Uh, I don't know
what you're doing later...

382
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,105
but we're having
a really big dinner at our place.

383
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:55,417
- You should come.
- Uh-

384
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:59,377
- I probably shouldn't.
- It's gonna be fun. Very traditional.

385
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:02,531
- You know, creole chicken,
sweet rice, sugar-fried bananas.

386
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:02,802
Okay.

387
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:05,179
- Okay.
- Good. Uh-

388
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:09,042
Dinner's at 8:00, and it's the white house
on the south side of Nowell Lake.

389
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,993
Know where it is.

390
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,265
Sophie.

391
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,641
It was just sittin' there-

392
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:05,009
On the side of the road,
completely out of the blue.

393
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:06,961
And you're sure
you didn't just drop it?

394
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,491
Positive.

395
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:13,871
There was something on the bridge.

396
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:15,888
Like somebody watching me.

397
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:18,767
Somebody?
Who was it, Megan?

398
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,312
I don't know.
I couldn't see.

399
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:30,166
I saw it in the rear view mirror.
But when I turned around, it was gone.

400
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,018
It felt like Sophie.

401
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:46,898
We all miss her.

402
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:49,969
Look. We can call
your mom and dad if you want.

403
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:52,400
No. No.

404
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:55,093
God.

405
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:58,178
I know I must
sound crazy to you guys.

406
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:01,616
I don't want to freak you guys out.

407
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:03,600
Please just bear with me.

408
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,736
Hey. Okay?
We're all here for you, Megan.

409
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:09,844
You don't have to worry
about anything.

410
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:25,168
- What are you doin'?
- Takin' you home.

411
00:44:25,178 --> 00:44:28,047
Christian, I'm fine.
I swear.

412
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:30,416
You shouldn't have to
stay here if you don't want to.

413
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,433
It's not that. I just-

414
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:39,088
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

415
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:41,105
She's here.

416
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,657
I felt it from the moment
that we first got here.

417
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,154
I don't know.

418
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,872
Everybody thinks
I'm some kind of new age freak.

419
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:51,954
No.

420
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:54,895
I felt her too.

421
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,904
Really?

422
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:03,076
I was coming home from work.

423
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:07,280
It was after we got
all that rain in March.

424
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,832
And I was at this crosswalk
across from St.Jackson's.

425
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:14,640
There was this group of people
across the street waiting for the light.

426
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:21,986
They were all dressed in black. They must have
been on their way to a funeral or something.

427
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:25,649
And all of a sudden,
I look up and...

428
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:28,048
there's this girl across the street
underneath an umbrella.

429
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,644
She's talking to somebody.
And I just freeze.

430
00:45:32,762 --> 00:45:35,664
I mean, it's Sophie.

431
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:38,487
It's her hair.
It's her clothes.

432
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:42,352
And then the light changes,
and I'm just standin' there, you know?

433
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:44,751
It's like my heart stopped.

434
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,412
Andas this girl gets closer,
she turns to me-

435
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,583
I mean, it was almost Sophie.

436
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,624
Obviously it wasn't-

437
00:46:00,697 --> 00:46:03,224
I'll never forget that feeling.

438
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:10,132
Yeah.

439
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,937
Maybe it is just a feeling.

440
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:18,005
Christian, I'm gonna be okay.

441
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:22,068
I promise. And- And...

442
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:24,526
I'm not leaving.

443
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:30,127
I guess I should get ready.

444
00:46:32,313 --> 00:46:35,629
For the dinner.

445
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,586
- I just don't think there's
enough food for six people.

446
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:40,367
I'll be happy to share mine.

447
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:42,287
- I'm sure you would.
- Hey! Hey.

448
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,239
- Wait for our guest.
- What?

449
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:47,428
Why? I didn't invite the guy.
Megan did.

450
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:53,142
Wow. You look great.

451
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:55,127
Thanks.

452
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:59,540
- Hi.
- Hey. Come on in.

453
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,748
Glad you could make it.

454
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:04,495
- Uh, this is Zoe.
- Yeah, we met.

455
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,415
- You remember Alicia.
- Hi.

456
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:09,240
- Hi.
- Mark and Christian.

457
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:12,402
- Nick, welcome to the party.
- Thanks.

458
00:47:13,145 --> 00:47:15,894
Hey.

459
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,319
All right.
Everybody's here. Let's eat.

460
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:20,719
- Okay.
- Nick, you can sit there.

461
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:22,647
Thanks.

462
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,735
All right. I'm starvin'.

463
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:29,007
You've told this story four times.

464
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:31,791
It was probably, like, 3:00 a.m.
"Yeah, yeah, sure. We'll go skinny dipping."

465
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:34,831
- We all run out to the docks-
- Why don't we talk about this?

466
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,975
go jumping in, like, bare-ass naked.

467
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,855
We come running back.
We're just, like- eh- close the door on him.

468
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:42,831
He's banging on the doors.
And it must have been pretty cold in the water.

469
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,439
- I t was cold outside.
- You know, you've done some pretty stupid things.

470
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,647
So, Nick, you lived
around here a while?

471
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:53,231
- Yeah, all my life.
- Oh. So you must know the old guy across the lake.

472
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,919
Drives a blue pickup.
Doesn't believe in bathing.

473
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:59,119
Oh, yeah. You mean, uh, Leonard. Sure.

474
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,991
Old school Louisiana. His family's
been farming out here for generations.

475
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,199
Pretty much just keeps to himself.

476
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,062
Well, I think he's creepy as balls.

477
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,763
What do you think, Meg?

478
00:48:11,772 --> 00:48:16,751
You think he's the bogeyman out in the woods
that's been messing with your head?

479
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,567
What do you mean?

480
00:48:19,576 --> 00:48:21,490
Oh.

481
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,246
Eh, saw something in the woods.
It was nothing.

482
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:30,639
Out here, you never know.
Especially this time of year.

483
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:33,198
Most are the result
of overactive imaginations...

484
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,430
but every now and then you get something
that's kinda hard to explain away.

485
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,644
Huh.

486
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:41,486
Then I suggest we pay.
the solstice its respects...

487
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:43,406
and get this party started.

488
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:46,840
- All right, guys. Cheers.
- Uh-huh.

489
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:53,647
Sorry about your sister.

490
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:55,663
Mark told me what happened.

491
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:57,590
You were twins, right?

492
00:48:57,656 --> 00:48:59,570
Yeah.

493
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,510
No wonder you're seeing stuff.

494
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:04,822
What do you mean?

495
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:08,174
In Haitian folklore
twins are called the Marasa.

496
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:10,767
They're believed to be
two halves of the same soul...

497
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,915
connected even in death.

498
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:17,621
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

499
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,760
since we arrived here...

500
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,790
I can feel her presence.

501
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,714
You've seen her?

502
00:49:25,724 --> 00:49:27,638
I don't have to.

503
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:32,144
She had this when she died.

504
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,630
It's hard to explain, but...

505
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,319
every time I leave it somewhere...

506
00:49:38,328 --> 00:49:40,206
it comes back to me.

507
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:43,182
Voduns believe objects
that follow people around...

508
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:46,045
are usually associated with curses.

509
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:50,350
So you're saying I'm cursed?

510
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:55,246
Really depends whether or not
you believe in that sort of thing.

511
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:58,190
I don't know what I believe anymore.

512
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:01,650
Tell you what.

513
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,974
Now you may think
I'm the one who's crazy...

514
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:09,059
but we can do this thing
my grandmother used to do.

515
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:12,462
It was her way.
of trying to communicate with the dead.

516
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:14,478
It's worth a try.

517
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:17,581
- Hey! I need a drink.
- Hey!

518
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:20,174
Please! I don't want lake water in my bottle.

519
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:33,966
I got wine in my face.

520
00:50:33,975 --> 00:50:35,893
You "wined" me.

521
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:38,478
So this is the part
where we drink the Kool-Aid, right?

522
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:41,358
Yeah. Can I ask why we have to
do this in the water?

523
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:45,006
Well, they say water's the best conductor
between our world and the next, so-

524
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:47,310
Right. Right.
I should've known.

525
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:53,824
- Ghosts and black magic.
- We should all hold hands.

526
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:57,645
All right, y'all.
Bear with me. It's been a while.

527
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,662
Let's give it a shot.

528
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,478
Papa Legba-

529
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,689
Papa Legba-

530
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,493
Something just touched my leg!

531
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:43,662
Don't worry, baby Alligators are just as afraid
of you as you are of them.

532
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:46,737
Very funny. Stop it.

533
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:52,173
Let me see that bottle for a sec.

534
00:51:52,183 --> 00:51:54,571
- Swig up.
- Okay.

535
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:57,389
Dude, what the hell, man?
That's my wine.

536
00:51:57,399 --> 00:52:02,127
-Just a little enticement. Granny's little secret.
- Right.

537
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:10,739
Papa Legba, bring the one to us.

538
00:52:10,807 --> 00:52:14,036
We welcome her.

539
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,829
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

540
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:38,584
Whoa, man!
What the hell was that?

541
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:46,930
- I'm done!
- No! Don't break the circle.

542
00:52:52,662 --> 00:52:55,826
Um-

543
00:52:55,894 --> 00:52:58,349
Papa Legba...

544
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:00,336
we welcome her spirit.

545
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:02,260
Who is among us?

546
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,934
See us worthy.

547
00:53:08,534 --> 00:53:10,901
We w-

548
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:30,413
Megan! Megan, you okay?

549
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,333
- What the hell are you thinking, man?
- Megan!

550
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,956
- Don't touch her, Nick.
- Guys, come on. Let's get out of the water.

551
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:36,716
- I'm going.
- We don't have to listen to this guy.

552
00:53:36,726 --> 00:53:38,284
Thanks for the buzz kill, Nick.

553
00:53:38,294 --> 00:53:41,555
Come on, Megan.
Let's go inside. Come on.

554
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:45,585
Why don't you just leave her alone?

555
00:54:00,982 --> 00:54:03,153
I felt like I was sinking.

556
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:08,076
Like drowning?

557
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,524
No. I saw her.
She was warning me.

558
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:15,532
It was more like being pulled under.

559
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:20,204
Well, if the key chain
really is cursed, then...

560
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:23,212
you can do what
every curse-fearing Cajun does.

561
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:24,652
What's that?

562
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,695
Wrap it in a white cloth and bury it.

563
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:34,359
According to local custom,
the earth will recycle the bad energy.

564
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,365
After that, you should be fine.

565
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:43,603
Better get goin'. Gotta work in the morning.

566
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:47,308
You gonna come to
the solstice bonfire tomorrow?

567
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:50,188
You sure your friends won't mind?

568
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:52,725
Or your, uh, jealous boyfriend?

569
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,795
He'll get over it.

570
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:58,164
Besides it's my parents' place.

571
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:02,028
I'll see if I can wander by.

572
00:55:02,038 --> 00:55:04,012
Okay.

573
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:14,343
Zoe, the house is on fire!

574
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:21,811
Night.

575
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,303
I'll see you in the morning.

576
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:34,028
Okay.

577
00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:03,723
I am not saying good-bye.

578
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:06,995
Never.

579
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,019
Shit!

580
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,002
The hat she's wearing-
I've seen it before.

581
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,210
That old guy across the lake
had it in his truck.

582
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,811
So, what?
He took her hat?

583
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,923
She wanted me to
find that photo, Christian.

584
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:44,972
This too.

585
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:47,946
- Who?
- Sophie.

586
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,826
- Megan, come on.
- You know what? Never mind.

587
00:58:50,836 --> 00:58:53,607
Megan! Hey.
Megan, where you goin'?

588
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:57,999
Megan, hey.

589
00:58:58,008 --> 00:58:59,915
She's trying to
tell me something, Christian.

590
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:03,050
I tried to make it stop, but I can't.
I gotta find out what she wants.

591
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:04,970
Okay. All this-
Sophie, things in the woods-

592
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:07,146
- You're starting to freak everybody out.
- What are you talking about?

593
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:09,482
We came out here to try
and have a good time. Remember?

594
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:12,650
Look, I know what I saw.
If you were there, you would have seen it too.

595
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:15,914
Look, Megan. Believing in something
does not make it real, okay?

596
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:19,210
Okay. So what about the old guy?
Was he just a figment of my imagination too?

597
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,370
I admit he's a little weird. But why on earth
would he bother to mess with you? That's stupid.

598
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:25,962
Thanks for your support, Christian.

599
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:28,988
You know who
you sound like right now?

600
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:33,264
Then maybe you should've
listened to her!

601
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,300
Megan!

602
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:38,654
Our first lovers' spat? Hmm?

603
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:44,306
What the hell was that?

604
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:47,281
What?

605
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:58,925
It's okay, boy. It's okay.

606
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:05,580
Okay.

607
01:01:17,075 --> 01:01:21,001
- Can I help you with something?
- You kids havin' fun?

608
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,109
Yeah, it's a gas.

609
01:01:25,746 --> 01:01:28,365
Where's your girlfriend?

610
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,606
She's not around.

611
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,649
That's too bad.

612
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:39,183
See you later.

613
01:04:54,002 --> 01:04:55,920
Come on!

614
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:31,787
Get 'em, Bernard!

615
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:56,007
- Hey, guys. Happy St.John's, everyone.
- Hey.

616
01:06:56,017 --> 01:06:58,311
- Beautiful night for the solstice.
- Dude.

617
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,231
Totally missed
the goat slaughter. Sorry.

618
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,724
It's okay, really.
You've seen one, you've seen 'em all.

619
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,999
- Nick, why don't you have a seat?
- Thanks.

620
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:11,879
- So, uh, where's Megan?
- Oh, she's not feeling so hot.

621
01:07:11,889 --> 01:07:13,991
- She's upstairs.
- Actually, I'm fine.

622
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:17,000
- Ah.
- Hey.

623
01:07:17,072 --> 01:07:20,743
So I, uh, brought you guys
a little something for the occasion.

624
01:07:20,752 --> 01:07:24,298
- What you got?
- Dead Man's Dram.

625
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:28,715
- Cajun moonshine.
- Now you're

626
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:30,086
speaking my language, man.

627
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,327
Uh, I need some lime juice.
Can't drink this stuff straight.

628
01:07:32,336 --> 01:07:34,886
And I believe you guys have
some lime juice here, right?

629
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:36,519
Yes, we do.

630
01:07:36,528 --> 01:07:39,078
- Come on. I'll- I'll show you.
- Cool.

631
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:41,446
Why can't you drink it straight?

632
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,782
Nick, I gotta ask you something.

633
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:45,710
What is it?

634
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,769
You know about this little girl?

635
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,674
That's Malin.

636
01:07:57,684 --> 01:08:00,288
She was Leonard's granddaughter.

637
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:03,023
Whole town helped look for her.

638
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,251
His granddaughter?

639
01:08:07,408 --> 01:08:09,326
Did they ever find her?

640
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,465
No.

641
01:08:11,536 --> 01:08:13,454
She just disappeared.

642
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:17,446
Good old Leonard.

643
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,204
Never been the same since.

644
01:08:27,472 --> 01:08:29,386
Oh, my-

645
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,294
Oh, man!

646
01:08:32,368 --> 01:08:35,532
This is the shit.

647
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,927
By the way, Loyola came through
on my scholarship.

648
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:40,107
Really? That's great news.

649
01:08:40,176 --> 01:08:43,878
- What, you're movin' into the city?
- Uh, yeah. Looks like it.

650
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:45,806
Congratulations.

651
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,062
- Happy solstice, everyone.
- All right.

652
01:08:49,072 --> 01:08:50,990
Happy St.John's.

653
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:57,093
I have to pee so bad.

654
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:13,418
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

655
01:09:13,427 --> 01:09:15,750
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

656
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,509
What is she gonna do,
take a piss in the woods?

657
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:00,838
Bogeyman!

658
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:03,237
I got ya!

659
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:05,319
Asshole!

660
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:07,877
- Hey! Whoa, what happened?
- She hit me, man.

661
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:09,605
- What'd it look like, man?
- Megan.

662
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:11,750
- Megan. Megan, are you all right?
- What did you do to her?

663
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:14,341
Stop it! Come on. What'd he do to her?

664
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,806
Megan. Megan!

665
01:10:16,815 --> 01:10:19,085
Whoa.
Megan, are you okay?

666
01:10:19,151 --> 01:10:21,765
- Oh, my God. She's sick.
- Megan, you're okay. Megan?

667
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,458
Megan?

668
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:26,894
What's wrong?

669
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:31,443
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- Nick, what the hell?

670
01:10:32,431 --> 01:10:35,238
- Jesus! It looks like mud!
- It's the moonshine!

671
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:37,318
- She's sick. Mark, gimme the keys.
- What the hell?

672
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:39,525
I'm taking her to the hospital.
Gimme the keys right now!

673
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,445
- Megan!
- What was in the moonshine?

674
01:10:41,455 --> 01:10:46,102
- Jesus Christ, man! Look at her!
- Gimme the keys!

675
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:52,518
Let me out!

676
01:10:57,327 --> 01:11:00,006
Megan, are you okay? You passed out.

677
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:02,725
- I know where she is.
- Where who is?

678
01:11:02,735 --> 01:11:04,645
It's in the woods.
I've been there before.

679
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,110
Megan, come back!

680
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:09,125
Megan, you should
just lay down. Please.

681
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:11,685
- We'll take you to the emergency room.
- What the hell's goin' on?

682
01:11:11,694 --> 01:11:13,900
- We need to go there right now.
- I am not wandering around

683
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:14,917
in the middle of the night!

684
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:17,477
- Then don't.
- Megan. Megan, wait!

685
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:19,685
I'm gonna come with you.

686
01:11:19,695 --> 01:11:21,765
- Dude, what the hell, man?
- Stay here with Lish.

687
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:23,689
Oh, that's enough.

688
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:27,493
Megan! There's nothing out here
except that creepy old guy.

689
01:11:27,503 --> 01:11:30,798
Megan, are you sure?

690
01:11:30,863 --> 01:11:32,781
It's this way.

691
01:11:41,358 --> 01:11:43,845
Let's turn around and just go back.

692
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:46,871
Let's just go back to the house.

693
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,301
- I'm telling you, I'm outta here, okay?
- Lish? Lish.

694
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,220
- What?
- Listen to me. Can you calm down, please?

695
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,140
We're their ride back.
We can't just leave 'em here.

696
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:58,341
I don't trust that Nick guy. And there's
something up with all of his voodoo crap!

697
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,739
I agree completely.

698
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:03,334
I'm gonna get the gun.

699
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:05,578
That's reassuring.

700
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:08,826
Let's go, Bernard.

701
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:15,884
This is it!

702
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,781
The ruins?

703
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:23,785
We were terrified of this place
when we were kids.

704
01:12:25,838 --> 01:12:29,914
Megan, what can you
possibly hope to find out here?

705
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:35,148
We have to dig here.
I fell here when I was running.

706
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:38,348
Come on!

707
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,980
Okay, guys. Come on. There's nothing out here.
Let's go back to the house.

708
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:50,208
- Look. Sophie's gone.
This isn't gonna bring her back.

709
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:51,109
No, she's here!

710
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:53,381
You know what?
You're sick. You need help.

711
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,557
- Christian, just let her be.
- Hey, don't fuckin' touch me!

712
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:57,989
- What the hell is your problem?
- You're my problem. You're everybody's problem.

713
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,397
Who the hell do you think you are?

714
01:12:59,406 --> 01:13:01,604
You Cajun freaks like messing
with people's heads? Is that it?

715
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:03,733
Shut up!
Christian, please.

716
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,180
This is over.
Come on. Let's go.

717
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,877
- Back off, all right?
- Hey! Stop it!

718
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:10,341
Oh, my God!

719
01:13:20,366 --> 01:13:22,975
- Oh, shit.
- What is that?

720
01:13:25,997 --> 01:13:27,716
It's her.

721
01:13:27,726 --> 01:13:30,629
- The little girl-
- Megan, how did you know that was-

722
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:34,788
- I don't know. I don't know!
- How did you know that?

723
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:37,383
- I don't know.
- Man.

724
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:40,796
Zoe, go back and call the police.

725
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:46,724
Um, we'll be back.

726
01:13:57,006 --> 01:13:59,780
We found a little girl's body!

727
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,732
- A body?
- Yeah!

728
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:04,324
- Where the hell's Megan and Nick?
- They're back at the bridge.

729
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:06,340
- They're with the body.
- You left her with that freak?

730
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,100
Yes! No! Shut up!

731
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,492
Um, we're gonna go to the bridge
and we're gonna have the police-

732
01:14:11,502 --> 01:14:13,790
- We're gonna call them right now
and have them meet us there.

733
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,884
Keys. I need keys. All right.

734
01:14:14,894 --> 01:14:18,275
Christian? Christian! Come on, man.
Come on. I gotta drive. Let's go.

735
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:20,292
Let's go.

736
01:14:20,365 --> 01:14:23,137
Pick up! Pick up!
Pick up! Pick up!

737
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,093
Nick.

738
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:13,608
Isn't that your sister's?

739
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:16,132
I thought it was.

740
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:18,755
Why would your sister
have a key to Malin's bike?

741
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,870
It wasn't Sophie.

742
01:15:20,941 --> 01:15:22,859
Who was it?

743
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,401
It was her.

744
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:30,186
Shit, man.
It's starting to rain.

745
01:15:30,253 --> 01:15:33,514
- Then slow down!
- Calm down. All right?

746
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:44,707
That's it!
It's right there. The bridge.

747
01:15:44,717 --> 01:15:47,203
- You see? It's right in front of you.
- All right. I see it.

748
01:15:47,212 --> 01:15:48,739
- Give me your hat, Sophie.
- Hey!

749
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,467
- Give it back!
- You really want it back, huh?

750
01:15:50,477 --> 01:15:52,227
- Hey!
- Oop.

751
01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:55,107
- Shit! Sorry.
- I can't believe you just did that!

752
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,540
- Sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

753
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:09,283
Look out!

754
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:18,120
What was that?

755
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:20,228
I don't know.

756
01:16:20,301 --> 01:16:23,154
I'll go check it out.
You stay here.

757
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,108
Mark! Baby!

758
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:30,857
- Oh, no!
- I saw her! Malin!

759
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,128
- Baby!
- Christian!

760
01:16:33,196 --> 01:16:35,335
- You shot Mark!
- Malin!

761
01:16:35,405 --> 01:16:37,667
Christian, where are you going?

762
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,523
Malin, where are you?

763
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:43,588
- Cops are coming
but we need an ambulance!

764
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:45,516
Baby!

765
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:48,196
Malin!

766
01:16:51,692 --> 01:16:53,610
Malin!

767
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:57,923
Hey, Christian!
Hey, hey! It's me! It's Nick.

768
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:02,008
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

769
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:06,181
Hey. Megan!

770
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:08,456
Nick!

771
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,597
Nick, where are you?

772
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,802
Megan, run.
Get out of there!

773
01:17:19,084 --> 01:17:20,899
Nick!

774
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:23,461
Nick, where are you?

775
01:17:28,012 --> 01:17:29,930
Christian.

776
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:36,610
Sorry.

777
01:17:38,156 --> 01:17:40,425
Christian, what did you do?

778
01:17:41,452 --> 01:17:43,939
It was an accident.

779
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:49,402
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

780
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:53,955
You killed her.

781
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:55,779
No, no. Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

782
01:17:55,788 --> 01:17:58,560
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

783
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:04,265
It was an accident.

784
01:18:04,332 --> 01:18:06,754
- We have to call somebody.
- Just help me.

785
01:18:06,763 --> 01:18:10,498
Help me grab her legs.
Come on. Let's go. Hurry up.

786
01:18:10,507 --> 01:18:13,762
- Come on. I need your help.
- We gotta tell somebody.

787
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:17,698
Sophie, tell them what?
Do you know what'll happen to us?

788
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:20,899
Your whole future-
everything will be gone.

789
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:24,002
- You killed Sophie too!
- No! I was protecting her!

790
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:25,922
We can't go to the police.
Just get it together.

791
01:18:25,932 --> 01:18:27,939
Christian, she's dead.

792
01:18:28,012 --> 01:18:30,402
She's dead, Sophie!
She's dead.

793
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:32,322
- There's nothing we can do to bring her back.
- Ow!

794
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:34,018
There's no point
in giving up our lives too.

795
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:37,026
Think about- Think about
what'll happen to our families.

796
01:18:37,035 --> 01:18:42,087
Our future, Sophie.
No one can ever know about this.

797
01:18:42,156 --> 01:18:45,282
Put the gun down.
Christian, just put the gun down!

798
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,626
Put it down!

799
01:18:49,228 --> 01:18:51,944
Christian!

800
01:18:52,012 --> 01:18:53,930
Christian!

801
01:18:56,939 --> 01:18:59,044
She's here!

802
01:18:59,115 --> 01:19:01,482
Megan!

803
01:19:01,547 --> 01:19:03,426
Come back here!

804
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:06,146
- You don't understand yet!
- Nick!

805
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:08,490
Sophie!

806
01:19:08,556 --> 01:19:11,714
- Nick!
- Megan!

807
01:19:11,724 --> 01:19:13,538
Wait!

808
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,003
You don't understand!

809
01:19:16,076 --> 01:19:18,596
Somebody help me!

810
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,818
Don't go!

811
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:25,413
Megan!

812
01:19:30,347 --> 01:19:32,452
No!

813
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:38,536
No!

814
01:19:39,563 --> 01:19:41,735
No!

815
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:45,635
It was an accident!

816
01:19:48,235 --> 01:19:50,153
Malin, I'm sorry!

817
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:54,372
Sophie!

818
01:19:59,723 --> 01:20:02,374
God! I didn't see him.

819
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,353
- No!
- I didn't see him.

820
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:07,778
No! No! No!

821
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:09,769
No!

822
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:14,410
No!

823
01:20:36,683 --> 01:20:38,952
Hey, baby.

824
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:40,937
It's okay.

825
01:20:42,827 --> 01:20:44,737
It's gonna be all right.

826
01:20:44,747 --> 01:20:47,519
I can't believe this is happening.

827
01:21:15,915 --> 01:21:20,993
I wanted to let you know, Megan,
that I ran into Leonard the other day.

828
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:24,508
He wanted me to thank you
for finding Malin.

829
01:21:32,843 --> 01:21:34,817
I went by his place this morning.

830
01:21:34,827 --> 01:21:36,745
He wasn't home.

831
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:40,455
It's probably just as well.

832
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:47,430
- You just get off work?
- Yup. Last day.

833
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:49,985
One more week and I 'm out of here.

834
01:21:49,995 --> 01:21:51,905
What, um- What about you?

835
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:56,735
Just wanted to see this place
one last time before my folks sell it.

836
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,665
Understandable.

837
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,850
- Maybe when you come to the city,
I can show you around.

838
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:04,640
That'd be great.

839
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:08,295
-Just no more black magic.
- You got it.
