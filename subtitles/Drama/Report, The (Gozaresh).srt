1
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,220
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,013
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,411
Murder.

4
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,071
Good luck, John.

5
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,283
- Any contractions?
- Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,215
Okay, Jad, what's coming?

7
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,051
Red Ball, double homicide,
one male, one female.

8
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,220
Killer's male, white, 40s.

9
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,681
Agatha nailed the time frame
at 8:04 a. m.

10
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,517
The twins are a little fuzzy on that,
so we'll need confirmation.

11
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,854
Location's still uncertain. Remote
witnesses are plugged in.

12
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,148
This will be case number 1108.

13
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,405
Good morning, detectives.

14
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,367
Case number 1108, previsualized
by the Precogs,

15
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,870
recorded on holosphere by
Precrime's q-stacks.

16
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,997
My fellow witnesses for
case number 1108

17
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,999
are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice
Frank Pollard.

18
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,125
Good morning.

19
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,210
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,421
Will the witnesses preview and validate
number 1108 at this time?

21
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,966
- Affirmative. I will validate.
- Go get him.

22
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,220
Stand by. Time of murder, 8:04 a. m.

23
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,722
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now.

24
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,515
This is a Red Ball.

25
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,169
You know how blind I am
without them.

26
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,548
Alright, Howard Marks,
where are you?

27
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,219
Howard? Howard, breakfast!

28
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,196
<i>Four score and seven years ago...</i>

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,366
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

30
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,454
A man standing in the park across
the street. I've seen him before.

31
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,957
How can you even tell? You know how
blind you are without your glasses.

32
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,125
Where are your glasses?

33
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,835
I must have left them up
in the bedroom.

34
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,128
You are running out of time.

35
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,297
You know how blind I am...

36
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,315
I show eight Howard Marks in the District.
Sorting by race and age.

37
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,108
Run their license and registration.

38
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,485
See if I can capture an address here.

39
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,988
You are running out of time.

40
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,490
You know, I was thinking maybe I'd
play hooky, stay home today.

41
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,119
What about your meeting? I've been
working too much.

42
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,538
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

43
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,876
I got six licenses. Where do
you want them?

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,627
Over here, please.

45
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,598
I'm very sorry.

46
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,817
You know how blind I am
without them.

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,992
Got him in the Foxhall,
4421 Gainsborough.

48
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,494
Send a DCPD blue-and-white.

49
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,329
Set up a perimeter, and tell them
we're en route.

50
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,124
You know, I was thinking maybe I'd
play hooky, stay home today.

51
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,336
<i>We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field...</i>

52
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,421
- What do you think?
- <i>...as a final resting place</i>

53
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,882
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

54
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,258
I've been working too much anyway.

55
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,636
<i>...is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.</i>

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,680
- <i>But in a larger sense...</i> Good.
- We could have lunch together.

57
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,848
- What do you say?
- <i>We cannot consecrate.</i>

58
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,350
<i>We cannot hallow this ground.</i>

59
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,060
- Any place you want.
- I would love...I would love to.

60
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,603
<i>The brave men, living and dead...</i>

61
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,314
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

62
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,485
<i>...have consecrated it far above our
poor power to add or detract.</i>

63
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,696
I guess that's why you look so nice.

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,658
Chief!

65
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,661
We got a problem with our location.

66
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,959
- It's no longer there.
- Shit.

67
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,169
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

68
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,255
Investigator from the Fed's here.

69
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,507
Yeah, I don't need some twink from
the Fed poking around right now.

70
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,717
John, I wrote it down on your calendar.
I left you a message at your house.

71
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,052
Check in with the papers.
They had it forwarded.

72
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,095
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

73
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,930
- Check all relations.
- Checking neighbors and relations.

74
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,307
- But, John...
- Fletch, just get him some coffee.

75
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,059
Tell him some stories how I save
your ass every day

76
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,437
- and you can't live without me.
- I got coffee, thank you.

77
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,273
Danny Witwer, the twink from the Fed.

78
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,442
Whoops. Gum?

79
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,944
Sorry, Danny, I'm gonna have to give you
the full tour some other time.

80
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,362
The Markses moved a couple
of weeks ago,

81
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,115
nobody knows where. Still searching for
family and employer.

82
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,200
Time Horizon, 12 minutes.

83
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,244
Alright. What he's doing now, we call
<i>scrubbing the image,</i>

84
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,788
looking for clues as to where
the murder's gonna happen.

85
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,667
Original running bond brick pattern,
streamlined early Georgian details...

86
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,169
The brick has been re-pointed.

87
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,838
- And, <i>That this nation...</i>
- <i>This nation...</i>

88
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,131
- <i>under God...</i>
- <i>under God...</i>

89
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,133
<i>...shall not perish from the Earth.</i>

90
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,719
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

91
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,596
Beyond that and the date
of the crime,

92
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,599
all we have to run on are the images
that they produce.

93
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,736
I show a cop on horseback.

94
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,280
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.

95
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,615
The Mall?

96
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,909
Georgetown.

97
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,120
The Precogs can see a murder four
days out. Why the late call?

98
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,455
Well, we call it a Red Ball.

99
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,332
With crimes of passion there's
no premeditation,

100
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,583
so they show up late.

101
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,877
Most of our scrambles are flash events,
like this one.

102
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,338
We rarely see anything with
premeditation anymore.

103
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,632
- People have gotten the message.
- Uh..huh.

104
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,050
Oh, this is good.

105
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,928
I show a match for Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

106
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,554
He did two dozen houses in D.C.

107
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,890
- Time Horizon, 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes.

108
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

109
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,651
Look at this kid. In this one, he's on
the left side of the man in the suit.

110
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,654
- Yes, so?
- This one he is on the right.

111
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,590
Merry-go-round.

112
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,592
It's a park!

113
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,724
Tell me there's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

114
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,226
Two in Georgetown, one in Barnaby Woods.

115
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,352
The other's in Woodley.

116
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,229
Woodley's all Victorian. It's gotta be
Barnaby Woods.

117
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,855
- Evanna, flight time?
- The way I drive,

118
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,983
three minutes after wheels up.

119
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,665
- Clear.
- Clear.

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,103
Time Horizon, six minutes.

121
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,350
Let's go to bed.

122
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,935
Let's do it in here.

123
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,357
- The bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

124
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,113
Shit!

125
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,533
Which one is it?

126
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,790
- Don't stop!
- Not the bed!

127
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,752
- Come on, come on.
- I don't want to be on the bed!

128
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,967
Time Horizon, one minute. Chief, we're
catching up to the future.

129
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,802
Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

130
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,555
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

131
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,558
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

132
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,018
Did Marks close the front door?

133
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,778
Front door.

134
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,367
I didn't want to be on the bed.

135
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,749
Negative. The front door is open.

136
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,752
- The front door is open.
- Time Horizon, 30 seconds.

137
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,971
- I forgot my glasses.
- Oh, Howard!

138
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,520
No, no, no, Howard.

139
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,027
You know how blind I am without them.

140
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,905
Howard, don't cry.

141
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,740
Marks!

142
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,928
Look at me. Look at me.

143
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,643
Positive for Howard Marks.

144
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,980
Mr. Marks, by mandate of the District
of Columbia Precrime Division,

145
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,148
I'm placing you under arrest

146
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,858
for the future murder of Sarah Marks
and Donald Dubin

147
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,946
that was to take place today,
April 22nd, at 0804.

148
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,823
No! I didn't do anything.

149
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,659
- Sarah!
- Give the man his hat.

150
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,788
Oh, God. Don't put that halo on me!
Sarah!

151
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,332
- Put your hand on your head!
- Help me!

152
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,334
I wasn't gonna do anything!

153
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,504
Officer Scott, I'm with the Precrime
Trauma Response Unit.

154
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,965
I want you to sit here a minute
and listen to me.

155
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,176
Your husband is being arrested
by officers from Precrime.

156
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,053
Oh, God, Howard, no!

157
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,183
Howard, don't cry.

158
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,480
Howard, please don't cry.

159
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,524
Oh, God. Oh, God.

160
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,613
I thought they stopped the murder.

161
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,409
Well, that's just an echo, a Precog
déjà vu, if you will.

162
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,288
The really bad ones, the Precogs
see them over and over again.

163
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,415
Wally, erase the incoming.

164
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,224
Imagine a world without murder.

165
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,519
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.

166
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,729
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my father.

167
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,813
I lost my wife.

168
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,524
Just six years ago, the homicide rate
in this country

169
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,610
had reached epidemic proportions.

170
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,738
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

171
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:11,326
But instead of one miracle, we were
given three, the Precognitives.

172
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,245
Within just one month under
the Precrime program,

173
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,041
the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90%.

174
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,500
They were gonna be waiting for me
in the car.

175
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,585
He was gonna rape me.

176
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,253
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

177
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:27,216
Within a year, Precrime
effectively stopped murder
in our nation's capital.

178
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,428
In the six years we've been conducting
our little experiment,

179
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,014
there hasn't been a single murder.

180
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,600
And now Precrime
can work for you.

181
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,769
We want to make absolutely certain

182
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,856
that every American can bank on the utter
infallibility of the system,

183
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,903
and to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.

184
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,115
- Precrime, it works.
- It works.

185
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,575
- It works.
- It works.

186
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,619
- It works.
- It works.

187
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,580
- Precrime, it works!
- Precrime, it works!

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,460
On Tuesday, April 22nd, vote yes on
the National Precrime Initiative.

189
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,341
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

190
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,642
- I just need a little clarity.
- True, true, true, true, that.

191
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:22,897
You want the customary clarity or the
new-and-improved kind of clarity?

192
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,649
Just give me the new stuff.

193
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,403
New and improved. New and improved
clarity, clarity, clarity.

194
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,488
Yes, indeed, clarity.

195
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,323
Come on, come on.
I just want a hit.

196
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,449
Look, don't bust my balls.

197
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,868
You just gave me four, and
some of these are duds.

198
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,829
Sweet dreams, Chief.

199
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,126
Don't worry none, your secret's safe
with me.

200
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,004
Besides, I could use a little juice
on my side.

201
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,297
What do you think you know, Lycon?

202
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,718
It's like my daddy used to say,

203
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,303
<i>In the land of the blind,</i>

204
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,517
<i>the one-eyed man is king.</i>

205
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,874
I'm home.

206
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,842
Overhead.

207
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,858
Wall screen.

208
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,951
- Sean!
- Hi, Daddy.

209
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,370
Can you teach me how to run faster?

210
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,040
'Cause all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

211
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,459
No. That's good.

212
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,419
Look, keep your knees up.

213
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,171
Keep your knees up like that. Good.

214
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,297
Like that. Like that.

215
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,883
Like that. High. High. Like that.
Like that. High.

216
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,095
See, you're a natural runner.
Gotta keep running!

217
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,390
Gotta keep running.

218
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,975
You gotta keep running.

219
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,476
You gotta keep running.

220
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,187
Will I be as fast as you someday?

221
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,231
Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

222
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,566
You're gonna beat everybody.

223
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,943
I think you'll beat everyone someday.

224
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,363
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

225
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,700
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips!

226
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,619
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

227
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,038
Yeah. Alright, alright, alright.

228
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,498
I love you.

229
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,419
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

230
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,165
It reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

231
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,126
Remember?

232
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,171
Yeah, we had those...
we had $20,

233
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:19,926
and waiting in the van so the sun
would shine on our vacation.

234
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,931
John! John.

235
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,268
John, put the camera down. Look, I'm...
I'm all ready for bed.

236
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,562
What...what is this? No.

237
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,565
Put it away. It's time to put
the camera to sleep,

238
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,568
and time to come and take care
of your wife.

239
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,907
Sweetie, why don't you
put the camera down

240
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,326
and come and watch the rain with me?

241
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,456
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

242
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,256
Look, put the camera down, or you're
not getting anything tonight.

243
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,550
A gentleman at Justice wants
to take all this away from us.

244
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,136
You understand a week from now
people are going to vote

245
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,013
on whether or not what we've been
doing down here

246
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,390
has been some noble-minded
enterprise,

247
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,351
or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

248
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,437
- I understand, sir.
- John.

249
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,398
Watch this Danny Witwer,

250
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,860
- the observer from Justice.
- Yes, I met him yesterday.

251
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,488
You can let him look around, answer
his questions, but watch him.

252
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,240
- Yes, sir.
- And if there's any problem,

253
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,242
- make sure we know about it first.
- I understand.

254
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,661
When the Precogs declare
a victim and a killer,

255
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,621
their name is embedded
in the grain of wood.

256
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,374
Since each piece is unique, the shape
and grain is unique.

257
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,668
The shape and grain is
impossible to forge.

258
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,005
I'm sure you all understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

259
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,048
Here we go again.

260
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,258
Look, I'm not with the ACLU
on this, Jeff.

261
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,343
But let's not kid ourselves.

262
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,178
We are arresting individuals
who have broken no law.

263
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,180
- But they will.
- The commission of the crime itself

264
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,306
is absolute metaphysics.

265
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,516
The Precogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

266
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,937
But it's not the future if you stop it.
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

267
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,606
Yes, it is.

268
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,817
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

269
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,032
- Why'd you catch that?
- Because it was going to fall.

270
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,617
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,119
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

272
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,039
The fact that you prevented it
from happening

273
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,124
doesn't change the fact that
it was going to happen.

274
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,418
You ever get any false positives?

275
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,963
Someone intends to kill his boss or
his wife, but they never go through
with it.

276
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,965
How do the Precogs tell the difference?

277
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,844
The Precogs don't see what you intend
to do, only what you will do.

278
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,931
Then why can't they see rapes?
Or assaults or suicides?

279
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,392
Because of the nature of murder.

280
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,436
<i>There's nothing more destructive to
the metaphysical fabric that binds us</i>

281
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,398
<i>than the untimely murder of one
human being by another.</i>

282
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,982
Somehow, I don't think
that was Walt Whitman.

283
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,401
It's Iris Hineman.

284
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,196
She developed the Precogs, designed
the system and pioneered the interface.

285
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,990
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

286
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,326
- To Hineman?
- To them.

287
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,455
Cops aren't allowed
inside the temple.

288
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,624
Really? You've never been inside?

289
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,420
We keep strict separations so that no
one can be accused of tampering.

290
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,172
So, I'll be the first one to go in, then?

291
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,092
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority...

292
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,012
No, there is no question.
You don't have any.

293
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,559
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

294
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,739
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

295
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,122
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel

296
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,082
is being conducted under
the direct supervision

297
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,086
and express permission from the Attorney
General of the United States.

298
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,130
I'm here as his representative,

299
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,301
which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

300
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,683
Seems you've been left out
of the loop, John.

301
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,070
Alright, we're ready. Let's go.

302
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,120
Hold it right there. Hold it.

303
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,414
Not cleared for access.

304
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,710
Eye-dent, John Anderton.
Approved.

305
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,594
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

306
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,012
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

307
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,264
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

308
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,349
I can't touch you.

309
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,601
- Don't touch him or anything else.
- John, you can't be in here...

310
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,771
I understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

311
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,855
Tell me how...

312
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,944
- They're sleeping.
- Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

313
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,739
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient
supply and a liquid conductor.

314
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,450
It enhances the images that
each of them receive.

315
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,246
We call the female Agatha. The twins
are Arthur and Dashiell.

316
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,374
We scan by way of optical tomography.

317
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,210
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length of
the headgear,

318
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,755
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

319
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,925
In other words, we see what they see.

320
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,511
They don't feel any pain.

321
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,264
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

322
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,184
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

323
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,979
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

324
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,939
They can't be kept too awake, either.

325
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,150
It's better if you don't think
of them as human.

326
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,987
No. They're much more than that.

327
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,784
Science has stolen most
of our miracles.

328
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,040
In a way, they give us hope, hope
of the existence of the divine.

329
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,044
I find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

330
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,255
The Precogs are pattern-recognition
filters, that's all.

331
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,758
- Yet you call this room <i>the temple.</i>
- Just a nickname.

332
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,052
The oracle isn't where
the power is, anyway.

333
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,762
The power's always been
with the priests,

334
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,515
even if they had to invent
the oracle.

335
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,478
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

336
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,065
Well, come on, Chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all,

337
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,277
I mean, we're more like clergy
than cops.

338
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,112
- Jad?
- Yeah?

339
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,781
Go to work. All of you.

340
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,209
Sorry. Old habit.

341
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,713
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

342
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,548
My father was very proud.

343
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,425
What does he think of your
chosen line of work?

344
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,594
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15

345
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,263
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

346
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,058
I know what it's like to lose
someone close, John.

347
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,393
Of course, nothing is like
the loss of a child.

348
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,686
I don't have any children of my own,

349
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,106
so I can only imagine what
that must have been like.

350
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,652
To lose your son in such
a public place like that.

351
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,528
At least now you and I have
the chance to make sure

352
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,155
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

353
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,907
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me

354
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,493
- exactly what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

355
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,661
There hasn't been a murder in six years.

356
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,329
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is...

357
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:49,249
Perfect. I agree. If there's a flaw,
it's human.

358
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,002
It always is.

359
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,463
John.

360
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,966
Wally.

361
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,933
Can you see?

362
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
John, what the hell just happened?

363
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,511
Her ACTH levels just shot
through the roof!

364
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,764
- What did you do to her?
- She grabbed me.

365
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,183
Grabbed you? That's impossible. The
Precogs aren't even aware of us.

366
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,019
- In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.

367
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,145
It could have been a nightmare.

368
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,105
Sometimes they dream
about the old murders.

369
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,191
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

370
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,528
- What'd she say?
- <i>Can you see?</i>

371
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,718
You the Sentry?

372
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,221
Yes, sir! I'm Gideon.

373
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,724
You're Chief Anderton.

374
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,602
The music relaxes the prisoners.

375
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,729
Say, I don't ever see any of you
Precops down here.

376
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,565
- I'm not in trouble, am I?
- Not yet.

377
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,153
- I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?

378
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,739
- Drowning.
- That narrows it down.

379
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,366
Not too many in here for that one.

380
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,119
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

381
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,956
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got planned for tomorrow.

382
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,791
Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?

383
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,959
Stop.

384
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,922
Roll back.

385
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,008
There.

386
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,763
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

387
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,308
This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

388
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,772
That's right! A combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

389
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,983
Just show me Agatha's data stream.

390
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,317
For that,

391
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,779
we go for a ride.

392
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,430
My God. I'd forgotten
there were so many.

393
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,768
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

394
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,564
Look at them. Look at how peaceful
they all seem.

395
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,942
But on the inside, busy, busy, busy.

396
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,989
Okey-pokey! Now that
is one bad man.

397
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,784
He drowned a woman named Anne Lively
out at Roland Lake.

398
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,121
The killer's a John Doe.
Never identified.

399
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,306
Why is he still a John Doe?

400
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,475
Why wasn't he ever ID'd
from the eye-scan?

401
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,602
On account of those
are not his eyes.

402
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,563
He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

403
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,609
You can get it done on the street for
a few thousand bucks these days.

404
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:29,655
Okay, so you want just
the female prevision.

405
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,198
That's right.

406
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,790
We don't seem to have her data.

407
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,043
Try again.

408
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,546
This is odd.

409
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,300
See? We have the two previsions.

410
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,428
We got what Art saw, we got
what Dash saw,

411
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,472
but Agatha's isn't here.

412
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,394
Probably just a glitch.

413
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,772
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

414
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,152
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

415
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,572
but I show an address history that
includes the Beaton Clinic.

416
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,242
So she cleaned up. So where's she now?

417
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,746
I guess glitches come in twos.

418
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,336
You finally crawl your way out of
one hole just to fall into another.

419
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,968
No.

420
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,763
I can't let you take that
out of here, Chief.

421
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,683
It's against the rules.

422
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,270
Anything else going on in here
that's against the rules?

423
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:53,321
Careful, Chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

424
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,872
And then you said the third prevision was,
what, kind of fuzzy or something?

425
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:06,126
No. No, the third prevision, Agatha's
prevision, wasn't there.

426
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,045
That's not all. I spent a few hours
down there,

427
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,048
and there are a dozen more cases
with missing previsions.

428
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,302
You'd think we'd have found a cure
for the common cold by now.

429
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,763
- It's stress.
- What's this?

430
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,557
Herbal tea with honey.

431
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,727
I hate herbal tea, almost as much
as I hate honey.

432
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,772
Just drink it before I pour it
in your lap.

433
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,775
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you, Celeste.

434
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,904
Witwer's scheduled for a Containment...
Tour of Containment tomorrow.

435
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,198
Yeah, give him a tour.

436
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,451
- Lara called me.
- What?

437
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,288
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

438
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,083
I'm fine.

439
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,836
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl.

440
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,341
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night?

441
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,718
What if Danny Witwer came
to you right now

442
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,263
- and insisted on a full chem run?
- Lamar, I'm fine.

443
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,474
You understand, John,

444
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,977
the minute Precrime goes national, they're
going to take it away from us.

445
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,312
We won't let them.

446
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:11,983
No? How's an old man and a cop on
the whiff ever going to stop them?

447
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,821
My father once said to me,

448
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,033
<i>You don't choose the things you
believe in. They choose you.</i>

449
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,327
There's a reason you are here, John.

450
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,871
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

451
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,375
the loss you and Lara suffered
would have been prevented.

452
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,252
Remember the eyes...

453
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,841
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

454
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,802
And we both know I'm not the generation
anyone listens to.

455
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,887
But people trust you, John.

456
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,057
When you speak of your absolute
belief in Precrime,

457
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,645
they know it's a belief born of pain, not
politics. I always understood that.

458
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,315
And I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

459
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,029
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

460
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,704
They're not gonna take it away from us.

461
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,414
I won't let them.

462
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,196
Bingo.

463
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,377
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, little buddy.

464
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,546
I made up a club.
Yeah?

465
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,217
We're called the Crescos.
The Crescos.

466
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,136
We made up a soccer team...
Yeah.

467
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,804
And we practice at school.

468
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,181
Yeah?
Do you practice with Connor?

469
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,683
Daddy's in a lot of trouble, Sean.

470
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,377
Wait.

471
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,175
Jad, how come you're not out there
with Father Witwer?

472
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,928
We're in motion on something.
Now, from what I can see,

473
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,598
we got a white male victim, about 5'10",
approximately 170.

474
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,059
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

475
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,103
- Red Ball?
- Nope, Brown Ball.

476
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,105
- This one's premeditated.
- Amazing.

477
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,899
There's someone within 200 miles actually
dumb enough to still do that.

478
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,404
Well, the victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109.

479
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,781
Time of occurrence, Friday, 1506 hours.

480
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,409
Start a location run and a contact search
for future victim, Leo Crow.

481
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,120
Case number 1109, previsualized
by the Precogs,

482
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,747
recorded on holosphere by
Precrime's q-stacks.

483
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,791
My fellow witnesses for
case number 1109

484
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,335
are Dr. Katherine James and
Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

485
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Good morning.

486
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,504
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

487
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,798
Are the witnesses ready to preview
and validate number 1109?

488
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,883
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

489
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,392
Oh, I love this part.

490
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,229
I've got no address, last known
or otherwise,

491
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,648
no tax returns for the last five years.

492
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,318
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.

493
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,739
And send a protection team as soon
as we lock location.

494
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,786
Looks like federal housing. Concrete,
glass, egg crates.

495
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,706
Ouch. About 1,000 of those
in the District.

496
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,253
Fractured images coming in.
Numbers nine...

497
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,632
Nine and six.

498
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,641
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

499
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,394
She's laughing.

500
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,274
Okay, now inside a room.

501
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,028
Window panes, aluminum extrusion.

502
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,615
Two figures resolving in the room.

503
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,201
Wait!

504
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,832
Looks like we got a third party,

505
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,419
wearing sunglasses, just out
of the window.

506
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,214
You're not gonna kill me.

507
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,510
Goodbye, Crow.

508
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,600
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me.

509
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,395
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait!

510
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,317
Wait. Wait.

511
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,612
- You say something, Chief?
- No.

512
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,493
I'll get this one.

513
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,995
We got time on this one, Jad.

514
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,124
Mind going down and getting me a piece
of cake they're eating down there?

515
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,251
- I'm starving.
- Sure, Chief.

516
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,087
I think I'll get one for myself
while I'm at it.

517
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,713
Take your time.

518
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:46,651
Chief Anderton, what is this
that I'm seeing?

519
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,528
I'm confused about...

520
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,728
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

521
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,646
Wait! Anderton, wait!

522
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,609
Anderton, wait!

523
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,910
I like you, Chief. You've always
been nice to me.

524
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,082
I'll give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

525
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,850
Hold that, please.

526
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,144
Thanks.

527
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,943
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

528
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,530
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff
you've been doping on all night.

529
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,033
- Easy. Easy.
- Seems I found a flaw.

530
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,954
What are you gonna do?

531
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,207
Possession alone will cost you six months,
not to mention your badge.

532
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,793
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

533
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,380
Now, put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

534
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,987
Lamar? Lamar?

535
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,950
- Lamar?
- John, what the hell is happening?

536
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,827
- It's Witwer! He set me up!
- What the hell is happening?

537
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,078
- He set me up.
- Stop. Just wait.

538
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,122
- Who...
- He set me up. Witwer. It's Witwer!

539
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,790
Yeah, who's the victim?

540
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,126
- Somebody.
- Who?

541
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,919
- Somebody. Leo Crow.
- Well, who is he?

542
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,172
I have no idea! I've never heard of him!

543
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,758
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

544
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,303
Ah. But how could Witwer have
access to case files?

545
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,929
Can you fake a cerebral output?

546
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,306
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

547
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,058
- Well, I doubt it very much.
- Well, would Hineman know?

548
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,144
- Listen. Come in.
- What?

549
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,771
Well, I'll keep you safe until we get
to the bottom of this, John.

550
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,856
No, Lamar, listen to me. Listen.

551
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,941
Talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

552
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,862
Then ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents
into the analytical room.

553
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,406
Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

554
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,200
Security lockdown enabled. Revised
destination, office.

555
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,368
Lamar, they found me.

556
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,878
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

557
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,838
- No. No. No.
- No?

558
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,383
I'll meet you anywhere you say. You can
come to my house, John.

559
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,470
You know I can't. They'll get me there.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

560
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,763
You can't run, John.

561
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,515
Everybody runs.

562
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,855
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

563
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,997
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

564
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,628
Don't worry, sir. I'll bring him in,
unharmed.

565
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,547
Actually, Gordon, you're
not gonna do that.

566
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,716
- I'm taking control of the team.
- What?

567
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,136
Witwer, Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run.

568
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,723
If you want, you can observe. Do it.
Find him.

569
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,099
Yes, sir.

570
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,896
He came to see you the other day,
right before he was tagged.

571
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,607
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

572
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,068
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster this year,

573
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,654
- and I'm inclined to agree.
- Why are you protecting him?

574
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,740
You knew he was doping, yet you
did nothing about it.

575
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,744
- The man lost a child, for Christ's sake.
- Six years ago.

576
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,246
- What did you two talk about?
- None of your damn business.

577
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,582
Oh, it's all my damn business now,
Lamar.

578
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,126
Investigation of a supervising officer
for a capital crime

579
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,461
falls under federal jurisdiction,

580
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,630
so as to rule out any possibility
of conspiracy.

581
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,091
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

582
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,634
Shall we call the Attorney General?

583
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,928
I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify
the issue for you.

584
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,514
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

585
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,728
I'm gonna enjoy working here.

586
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,275
A road diverges in the desert.

587
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,985
Lexus.

588
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,822
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less traveled.

589
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,414
Good evening, John Anderton.
John Anderton.

590
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,126
John Anderton!

591
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,962
You could use a Guinness
right about now.

592
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,174
Stressed out, John Anderton?

593
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:49,138
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

594
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,033
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.

595
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,786
The train makes two stops,
at 20th and 33rd.

596
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,329
Send units to each location.

597
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,373
- They'll never make 20th.
- Have faith.

598
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,957
Fire them up!

599
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,066
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

600
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,611
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,863
- You have to work on that.
- It's that old, shit knee of mine.

602
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,823
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

603
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,367
Hey, don't do this.

604
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,829
John? Don't run.

605
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,999
You don't have to chase me.

606
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,959
You don't have to run.

607
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,796
- Everybody runs, Fletch.
- You know we'll catch you.

608
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,966
Everybody runs.

609
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,347
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

610
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,266
Get your sick-sticks ready.

611
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,436
Everybody runs, Fletch.

612
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,856
Slow down, Chief. Just take it easy.

613
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,403
No sudden moves, Chief.

614
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,032
John, it's okay.

615
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,034
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, Chief.

616
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,899
- Got a grip? Got a grip?
- Yeah.

617
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,094
Chief! Chief, no! Chief!

618
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,097
Anderton!

619
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,088
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

620
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,092
Get that thing out of my house!
Get out of my house! Get out!

621
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,389
Anderton, stop!

622
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,225
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

623
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,354
Do something! Try to get them
out of here! What's the matter with you?

624
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,446
John! Stop! Get out
of my house now!

625
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,469
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division,

626
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,429
I'm placing you under arrest...

627
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,639
Go to sleep.

628
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,286
Just stay with me.

629
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,142
Dr. Hineman?

630
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,062
You're trespassing. I don't have visitors.

631
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,821
Oh, I'm afraid that would be from
the Doll's Eye, the vine.

632
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,698
The baneberry that scratched you during
your illegal climb over my wall.

633
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,993
It's not a true Doll's Eye, of course.
It's a little hybrid of my own design.

634
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,746
It's quite something. Once the poison
gets into your bloodstream,

635
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,498
you will start to see what
I can only describe

636
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,627
as the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

637
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:08,215
This just isn't your week, is it,

638
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,176
Chief Anderton?

639
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,305
I'm not a killer.

640
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,604
You better drink this.

641
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:27,025
Soon you won't be able to swallow, and
then you'll be totally buggered.

642
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,945
All of it.

643
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,031
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

644
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:38,537
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

645
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,419
You can tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

646
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,713
How would I know that?

647
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,798
Because you invented Precrime.

648
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,094
What's so funny?

649
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,890
If the unintended consequences
of a series of genetic mistakes

650
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,726
and science gone haywire
can be called invention,

651
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,811
yes, then I invented Precrime.

652
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,897
- You don't seem all that proud.
- I'm not.

653
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,733
I was trying to heal them, not turn them
into something else.

654
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,817
Heal who?

655
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,278
The innocents we now use
to stop the guilty.

656
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,364
You're talking about the Precogs.

657
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,284
You think the three in the tank
come out of a test tube?

658
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,995
They are merely the ones who survived.

659
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,498
I was doing genetic research
at the Woodhaven Clinic,

660
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,957
treating children of drug addicts.

661
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,336
This was 10 years ago, when neuroin
first hit the streets.

662
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,964
It was an impure form of the drug,
not the engineered cocktail

663
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,426
that became so popular among
the more educated.

664
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,263
All of these kids were born with
severe brain damage.

665
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,016
Most died before the age of 12.

666
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,102
Those few, those precious few who
survived, they had a gift.

667
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,689
I call it a gift. For them, it was more
like a cosmic joke.

668
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,442
They would wake up in the night, curled up
in the corner of their rooms,

669
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,361
screaming, clawing at the wallpaper.

670
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,865
Because when these little children, you
see, closed their eyes at night,

671
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,745
they dreamt only of murder, over
and over, one after the other.

672
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:05,082
And it didn't take long for us to
realize that the real nightmare

673
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,293
was that these so-called dreams
were about to come true.

674
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,963
These murders were actually happening.

675
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,094
You say some of the children died.

676
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,430
So many of them, despite
what we did for them.

677
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,893
Or maybe because of what we did
to them. But it doesn't matter.

678
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,521
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

679
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,400
I'm not going to commit murder.

680
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,694
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

681
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,696
And yet a chain of events has started,

682
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,240
a chain that will lead you inexorably
to his murder.

683
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,408
Not if I stay away from him.

684
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,909
How can you avoid a man
you've never met?

685
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,077
So you won't help me?

686
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,999
I can't help you. Nobody can. The Precogs
are never wrong.

687
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,461
But occasionally,

688
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,172
they do disagree.

689
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,050
What?

690
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:02,097
Most of the time, all three Precognitives
will see an event in the same way,

691
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:06,143
but once in a while, one of them will see
things differently than the other two.

692
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,688
Jesus Christ. Why didn't I know
about this?

693
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,610
Because these minority reports are
destroyed the instant they occur.

694
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,944
Why?

695
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,196
Obviously, for Precrime to function,

696
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,782
there can't be any suggestion
of fallibility.

697
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,244
After all, who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

698
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,205
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

699
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,460
Are you saying I've haloed
innocent people?

700
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:35,339
I'm saying that every so often
those accused of a Precrime

701
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,342
might, just might, have
an alternate future.

702
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,888
Does Burgess know about this?
About this minority report?

703
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,266
I used to joke with Lamar that we were
the mother and father of Precrime.

704
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,061
Well, in my experience, parents
very often see their children

705
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,021
as they want them to be, not as they are.

706
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,606
Answer my question.

707
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,443
Does Lamar Burgess know about
the minority report?

708
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,612
Yes, of course, he knew.

709
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,656
But at the time, he felt, we both felt,

710
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,950
that their existence was
an insignificant variable.

711
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,786
Insignificant to you, maybe,

712
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,998
but what about those people that I
put away with alternate futures?

713
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,459
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance...

714
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,544
The system would collapse.

715
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,882
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

716
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,092
You want to bring it down.

717
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,179
You will bring it down, if you
manage to kill your victim.

718
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,516
Why, that will be the most
spectacular public display

719
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,893
of how Precrime didn't work.

720
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:33,146
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

721
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,523
Why should I trust you?

722
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,358
You shouldn't. You shouldn't
trust anyone.

723
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,569
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

724
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,698
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

725
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,617
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

726
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,746
Don't trust anyone. Just find
 the minority report.

727
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,626
You said the minority report's
destroyed.

728
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,171
The record is destroyed. The
original report still exists.

729
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,049
I designed the system so that
whenever a report occurred,

730
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,010
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

731
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,054
What safe place is that?

732
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,224
The safest place there is.

733
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,018
Where is it?

734
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:18,233
Inside the Precog who predicted it.

735
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:27,325
All you have to do is
download it, darling.

736
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,288
That's all, huh?

737
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,753
Just walk right into Precrime,
get in the temple,

738
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:42,424
somehow tap into these Precogs, and
then download this minority report.

739
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,218
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

740
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:50,140
Actually, I think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

741
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,184
You're insane.

742
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,020
Or you think I am.

743
01:02:55,813 --> 01:03:01,026
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times before
I get within 10 miles of Precrime!

744
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:06,072
Sometimes, in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

745
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,451
As a policeman...oh, excuse me,
as a former policeman,

746
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,037
I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people

747
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,706
who can help you out in this regard.

748
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,674
It's funny how all living organisms
are alike.

749
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,762
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on,

750
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:33,266
every creature on the face of the Earth
is interested in one thing

751
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,060
and one thing only.

752
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,230
Its own survival.

753
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,526
Find the minority report.

754
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,492
How do I even know which one has it?

755
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,453
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

756
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,207
Which one is that?

757
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:01,753
The female.

758
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,716
Alright, here's where we're at.

759
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,885
Three men in a room.
The victim is here.

760
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,807
John is here. And this unidentified male,
out the window.

761
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,934
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

762
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,811
but I can't make out the location,
which means...

763
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,312
There's thousands of units like this one.

764
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah, they're everywhere.

765
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,149
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

766
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,401
Excuse me, this is Chief Anderton's space.

767
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,527
Casey, he's okay.

768
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,112
- You can't sit in his space.
- He's not here anymore.

769
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,530
- He'll be back.
- I doubt that.

770
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,781
- What happened to you?
- It's okay.

771
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,950
In the meantime, I'm betting he's
somewhere in the sprawl.

772
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,077
Anderton's smart enough to go
where electronic billboards

773
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,829
and other media can't ID him
to pick his pockets.

774
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,415
There's fewer consumers there, which
means fewer scanners to target him.

775
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,043
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

776
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,131
We concentrate on the sprawl.

777
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,384
Do flyovers in shifts with two
spyder teams on the ground.

778
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:53,763
Thermal scan the entire area,
read anything with eyes and
a heartbeat.

779
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,822
Where is she?

780
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,393
This damn cold!

781
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,480
Don't worry.

782
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:46,483
You see, I could cut open your chest
and sew a dead cat in there,

783
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,692
you would never get an infection.

784
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,488
Not with the spectrum of antibios
I'll be shooting into you.

785
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,031
That's comforting.

786
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:56,618
You do understand I can't
just give you new irises.

787
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,119
Please don't touch.

788
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,790
Because the scanners will read the new
scar tissue, alarms will go off,

789
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,668
and large men with guns will appear.

790
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,674
What was that? What was that?

791
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,969
It's anesthesia. It's all gonna
be downhill from...

792
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,804
You always sneak up on your patients
like that?

793
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:19,391
You wouldn't break the hand of a
violinist before the concert.

794
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,892
Please, relax.

795
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:30,610
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have
to remove your eyes completely.

796
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,737
I know.

797
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,323
And I'll have to replace them
with new ones.

798
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,492
I know that, but I wanna
keep the old ones.

799
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,660
Why?

800
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,871
Because my mother gave them to me.

801
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,082
What's it to you? They're no good
in the secondary market anyway.

802
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,584
Whatever you say. It's your money.

803
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,971
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant,
Miss Van Eyck.

804
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:23,955
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

805
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,466
What did you give me?

806
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,845
Smile medicine. Tell you what,
since you and I go way back,

807
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:43,141
why don't I just give you my<i>old pal</i>
discount? What do you say?

808
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,435
You don't remember me, do you?

809
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,104
- We know each other?
- Oh, yes, we do.

810
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,566
From where? D.C.?

811
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,777
- Baltimore. East side.
- Baltimore?

812
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,362
- Yeah.
- How do we go way back?

813
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:00,533
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D. I was
a plastic surgeon.

814
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:05,121
You remember? I specialized in
burn victims, mostly women.

815
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,084
- I put you away.
- Oh, yeah. You did.

816
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,338
You made those tapes.

817
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,508
They were performance pieces.

818
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,679
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out!

819
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:26,851
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

820
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:34,526
The future is so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

821
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:41,032
Miss van Eyck, I'm afraid
she's already smitten.

822
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,121
She only has eyes for you.

823
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,459
I know what you're thinking, John.
How can I do what I do now?

824
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:56,297
Well, let's say that I did spend an awful
lot of time in the prison library.

825
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,465
Now that was a great way

826
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,970
to avoid some of the more unpleasant
aspects of prison life.

827
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:05,098
Confinement was a real education,
a real

828
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,810
eye-opener.

829
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:18,194
I mean, for true enlightenment, there's
nothing quite like, well, let's say,

830
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,573
taking a shower while this large felon
with an attitude

831
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,324
you can't even knock down
with a hammer

832
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,202
whispers in your ear, <i>Oh, Nancy.
Oh, Nancy.</i>

833
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,662
Now, that was a lot of fun.

834
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,914
Thank you so very much, John,
for putting me there.

835
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,041
Thank you so very much for
giving me the opportunity

836
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,169
to get to know myself so much better.

837
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,421
And now, to return the favor.

838
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,602
- This your work?
- Yes.

839
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,563
I like it.

840
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,024
Thanks. You take anything
in your coffee?

841
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,693
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.

842
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,737
Just sugar, then. You and John
ever come here?

843
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:04,199
- We used to, every summer.
- He's not here now, is he?

844
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,952
I had to ask.

845
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,498
You know, I don't have
any sugar, either.

846
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,750
Thank you.

847
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:17,212
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

848
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,881
You ever heard him mention
the name Leo Crow?

849
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,884
No, but then I don't talk to John
that much anymore.

850
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,011
So you haven't seen his apartment?

851
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,847
- That was our apartment.
- Have you been there recently?

852
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,100
It's full of these. How long
has he been doping?

853
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:36,439
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.

854
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,609
It was nobody's fault.

855
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:45,490
But John was with him
at the public pool.

856
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,743
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

857
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,078
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

858
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,247
- I regret ever saying that.
- Then what was it?

859
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,583
The FBI found something that belonged
to my son, a sandal.

860
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,586
Anyway, John was upset. He...

861
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,588
He took out his gun and sat down
and watched his home movies.

862
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,966
- He shot...
- This is all in your statement, Lara.

863
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,551
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling.
So what?

864
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,846
You lose your son, let's see
how well you handle it.

865
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,557
Lamar Burgess thinks you left John

866
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,185
because he lost himself in
Precrime instead of you.

867
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:20,108
I left him because every time I looked
at him, I saw my son.

868
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:24,862
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

869
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,907
That's why I left him.

870
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,327
And now you can leave.

871
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,332
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

872
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:46,009
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

873
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,014
In the fridge there's milk, and Greta
made you a sandwich.

874
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,474
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

875
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,602
How do I find the bathroom?

876
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,397
The bathroom? Now that's
your right hand.

877
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,819
The kitchen is your left.

878
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,241
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

879
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,995
Seeing as we're being old pals and all,
I'm going to give you a bonus.

880
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,788
It might come in handy.

881
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,874
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.

882
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,293
You're gonna shoot this baby up there,
right under your chin.

883
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,336
What is this?

884
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,713
It's gonna turn your pretty face
into mush.

885
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,466
People won't even recognize you, okay?

886
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,092
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again,

887
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,054
but it's gonna hurt like nothing
you've ever felt before.

888
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:36,267
Gonna put this in your goodie bag,
together with your leftovers.

889
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,023
I'm setting up a timer. When
it rings tomorrow,

890
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,567
you can take off the bandages
and get the hell out of here,

891
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:48,654
- but not before then, or you'll...
- Go blind, I know.

892
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,406
Don't scratch.

893
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,912
A little something from a
mutual friend of ours.

894
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,785
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

895
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:41,290
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

896
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:05,440
25.16 seconds. That's a new record.

897
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,941
Is that a world record?

898
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:10,611
Is it a world record? It's a
personal best.

899
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,572
Okay, now I want to time you.

900
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,698
You wanna time me? You gotta
be kidding.

901
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:17,076
'Cause there's no possible way
I can beat 25.16 seconds.

902
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,996
How long can a whale hold
its breath underwater?

903
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,415
A whale can hold its breath for
about 20 minutes.

904
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,168
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

905
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,380
We gotta beat the whale.

906
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,134
Here you go. Now, that's gonna
be 20 minutes.

907
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,052
You sure you don't want to go for
an ice cream or something?

908
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,471
- No.
- Because you know,

909
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,848
- you know I'm going to beat that whale.
- Yeah.

910
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:40,641
- Okay, give me the count.
- Ready?

911
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,352
- Give me the count.
- Three, two, one, go.

912
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,888
Sean?

913
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,047
Sean!

914
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,427
Sean?

915
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,138
Have you seen...

916
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,391
Sean! I'm looking for my son.

917
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,228
Have you seen a boy
in a red bathing suit?

918
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,021
Sean!

919
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,816
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

920
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,001
Sean!

921
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,410
Sean...

922
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,344
Jad, we are now in position and
ready to begin thermal scan

923
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,638
on all residences on North Powell.

924
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,266
I'm thinking you must really like me,
don't you, Fletcher?

925
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,227
That's why you asked to partner with
me on this little sortie, isn't it?

926
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,854
I think you're swell company, Knott.

927
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,982
It's not that you don't trust me to
be alone with the Chief, is it?

928
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,401
That you think I might futz with him
if I had the chance?

929
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,112
No, I just want to watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

930
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,823
That's all, Jeff. Evanna, go.

931
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,952
I show 27 warm bodies.

932
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,538
Roger that. Confirm 27 warm bodies.

933
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,832
What do you think? Four spyders?
One per floor?

934
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,251
Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

935
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,187
Residents of 931 Powell,
residents of 931 Powell.

936
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,856
This is Officer Fletcher
of D.C. Precrime.

937
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,859
Under authority P.C. Section 6409,

938
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,362
we are deploying spyders
into your complex.

939
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:24,615
- Go, go, go, baby.
- Mom, I'm scared.

940
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,368
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

941
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,704
Come on, it's gonna scan you. Keep
your eyes open. Just stay still.

942
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,373
Stay still, baby. Open your eyes.
It's okay.

943
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,834
- I don't like it.
- Stay still, stay still.

944
01:18:57,107 --> 01:19:00,443
Come on! You can't just come barging
in here like that! Come on!

945
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,778
You have stepped out on me
for the last time.

946
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,905
I told you where I was!
Now get off my back!

947
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,659
You're a no good liar! I know you
was with that ho last night.

948
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:15,666
- Leave me alone!
- Get out of here!

949
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,036
We lost one.

950
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:38,082
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping
through a window or something.

951
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,168
- That's an awful big cat.
- Fletcher.

952
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,463
I'll go check it out.

953
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,628
They're crying their eyes out.

954
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,755
You terrified them. They're absolutely
terrified right now!

955
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,174
You don't want your kids to know terror,
keep them away from me.

956
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,442
Wait a minute. The big cat's back.

957
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:49,069
What do you guys think, a drunk,
maybe can't wake up?

958
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,322
Yeah, some guy who doesn't
want to get read.

959
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,241
Folks, please be quiet. Close your doors.
Go back inside.

960
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,421
Be quiet and close the door!

961
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,764
We got an ID. It's not him.

962
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:19,934
Standing down.

963
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,226
Let's eat.

964
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,354
Anderton, wait!

965
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:37,201
Fletcher, take a look.

966
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,289
There's four people in this room,
not three.

967
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:46,460
Four? There's Anderton, there's Crow and
there's the man with sunglasses.

968
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:49,380
Here's the man with sunglasses
outside the window.

969
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,178
There's also someone here,
in the mirror.

970
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,889
Yeah. Definitely female.

971
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:04,395
The Precrime Program began in the year
2046 with a federal grant.

972
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,689
And now, nine years later,

973
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,817
the District of Columbia is the safest
city in America.

974
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,486
Why? Because Precrime works.

975
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:16,073
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives,

976
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:17,825
so most of what happens now

977
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:20,869
is the verification and the protection
of the future victim.

978
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,329
Can we see the Precogs?

979
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,165
Well, the Precogs have
such a powerful gift

980
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,001
that they have to be kept
in peaceful seclusion

981
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,420
so as not to be distracted
from the outside world.

982
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:33,924
But this display is to give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

983
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:38,804
The Precogs get over eight million
pieces of mail every year,

984
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:40,806
more mail than Santa Claus gets.

985
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:44,351
Each Precog has their own bedroom,
television and weight room.

986
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,895
It really is wonderful to be a Precog.

987
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,131
My mom's new boyfriend came
over again last night.

988
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,217
He's just not a very intelligent person.

989
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,053
My mom wouldn't let me go upstairs
and eat in my room.

990
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,721
She made me sit down there
the entire time,

991
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:23,474
having to listen to him go on
and on and on.

992
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:35,069
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

993
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:54,671
Eye-dent, John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

994
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,342
I want to get a new dog.

995
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,594
Which I told her I should be able to do

996
01:25:00,678 --> 01:25:02,221
because I'm so good at taking care
of you guys.

997
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:06,058
But she thinks that I'll be irresponsible,
which is ridiculous.

998
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:14,525
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

999
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,154
No, no, no, no!

1000
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,949
Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1001
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,284
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you? Who are you?

1002
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,247
I like you, Wally. So, I don't want
to have to kick you or hit you with
anything hard,

1003
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,499
but only if you promise to help me.

1004
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,710
Hi, John.

1005
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,680
Who does that look like to you?

1006
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,766
I don't know.

1007
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,814
It's Agatha.

1008
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,066
He's coming here to get her.

1009
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:01,864
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

1010
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,827
I don't need to see all these. Just
take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1011
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:08,495
I'm looking. They're not coming out
in any order.

1012
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,414
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1013
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,086
Can you see?

1014
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,352
- He's inside.
- He's got some kind of mask on.

1015
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,979
He sealed the door from the inside.

1016
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:36,190
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1017
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,942
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1018
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,153
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

1019
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,031
John, move away from the tank!

1020
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,617
Move away from the tank, John!

1021
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:58,253
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1022
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:02,466
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1023
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,303
- What does he want with the Precog?
- What do you think?

1024
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:09,765
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1025
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:11,475
But there's still the other two.

1026
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,062
Wally! Wally! The other two
can still function, right?

1027
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,064
You don't understand.
They're a hive mind.

1028
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:20,609
It takes all three for their predictive
abilities to work.

1029
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,280
Are you telling me they can't
see murders anymore?

1030
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,450
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1031
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:31,578
She's the one they listen to, the one
with the most talent.

1032
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,497
She takes care of the other two.

1033
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,791
Jesus. Agatha.

1034
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,209
Please, bring her back.

1035
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:39,836
Find out where that pipe leads. I want
every team underground, now!

1036
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,046
It doesn't matter, he wins.

1037
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,257
No, no. I'll send my men to EVAC.
We'll stop him in the reservoir.

1038
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,759
Gordon, she's in the room with him
when he kills Crow.

1039
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,095
She's already a part of his future.

1040
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,305
Jad, put everything you've got
into finding that room,

1041
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,598
and we stop a murder.

1042
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:56,812
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got 51 minutes, 30 seconds.

1043
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,108
You cold?

1044
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:04,987
Can you understand me? Are you cold?

1045
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:07,447
The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

1046
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,116
It should wear off soon.

1047
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:13,036
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.

1048
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,205
I need to know how to get at it.

1049
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:19,626
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
Can you tell me if...

1050
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,628
- Is it now?
- What?

1051
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,088
Is it now?

1052
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:28,176
Yes, this is all happening right now.

1053
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,680
We've gotta take you
some place in public,

1054
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:34,474
which means I've gotta get you
something else to wear.

1055
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,811
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

1056
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,821
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto, welcome back
to the Gap!

1057
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:50,365
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

1058
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,744
Mr. Yakamoto?

1059
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,000
Hey, Miss Belford, did you come back

1060
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:02,753
for another pair of those
Shimmy Lace Ups?

1061
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,853
If he's ransoming her, where's
the damn note?

1062
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:21,938
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1063
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,192
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1064
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:28,737
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1065
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,281
But he can't download her without
a lot of technical support.

1066
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,076
Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff

1067
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,203
because it's been assembled
and scrounged

1068
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,413
from spare parts made to order.

1069
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,627
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

1070
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,847
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

1071
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,060
What's your pleasure?
We got it all here.

1072
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:01,436
We got sports fantasies.

1073
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:04,022
We got what I like to call <i>Look, Ma,
I can fly</i> fantasies,

1074
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,066
which encompasses everything
from bungee jumping

1075
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,360
to soaring like an eagle over
the Grand Canyon.

1076
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:10,570
We got guys coming in wanting to
experience sex as a woman.

1077
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,739
We got women coming, wanna get laid
by their favorite soap star.

1078
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:16,952
Or just some good, clean fun.

1079
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,330
Yeah.

1080
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,417
It's a big rush, but you come out the
other side without a heart attack.

1081
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,169
I want to kill my boss.

1082
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,672
Uh..huh. Okay.

1083
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,425
You got some images I can work with?

1084
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,135
Rufus!

1085
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,097
Yeah, being concert master for the
Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra

1086
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,723
is one of our most popular choices.

1087
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,767
No, no, no. I want to kill my boss.

1088
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,102
You sick bastard!

1089
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,355
You're the kind of person that makes
this a terrible world to live in!

1090
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,190
Detective, nice of you
to come down here,

1091
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,443
seeing how every cop in the world
is looking for you right now.

1092
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:50,694
I need your help.

1093
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,154
Why did you have to come
all the way down here?

1094
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,156
Chief, I make house calls.
You know that.

1095
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,409
- I need your help with her.
- Well, hello there, honeypie.

1096
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,578
I'm impressed, Anderton.
You're on the lam,

1097
01:30:59,662 --> 01:31:03,748
and you still have the time and energy
to slice off a little jerky for yourself.

1098
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:08,753
- She's a Precog.
- Yeah. Okay. She's a Precog.

1099
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,718
You brought a Precog here.

1100
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:30,734
Jesus Christ.

1101
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,779
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

1102
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:35,947
I'm sorry for whatever
I'm going to do,

1103
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,783
and I swear I didn't do
any of that stuff I did.

1104
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:46,374
She's got information inside of her.
I need you to get it out.

1105
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,836
No way, man. No. I wouldn't
even know where to begin.

1106
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,715
Those thoughts about my cousin Elena,
they were just thoughts.

1107
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:55,425
You've been busted twice
for felony hacking.

1108
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,345
- So?
- So, I need you to hack into her.

1109
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,809
I tell you what. I do this,

1110
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:07,312
I get to keep whatever images
I get from her head.

1111
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:09,105
They don't belong to anybody.

1112
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,607
Take her to Radio Shack.

1113
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,110
Rufus, you gotta help me.

1114
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:24,829
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's going to happen to me.

1115
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,707
And then we'll go.

1116
01:32:42,014 --> 01:32:45,350
- Wow. She works.
- Slow it down.

1117
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,021
How do I slow this down? I should
hit her on the head?

1118
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,239
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

1119
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,491
Yeah, recording.

1120
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,895
I know this already.
Come on, move on.

1121
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:38,111
Goodbye, Crow.

1122
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,705
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1123
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,373
- What happened?
- I...

1124
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,792
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

1125
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:58,214
Where's my minority report?

1126
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,761
Do I even have one?

1127
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,894
- Do I have one?
- No.

1128
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,814
- What?
- No.

1129
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:26,534
What? Agatha, what?

1130
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,580
- Can you see?
- See what?

1131
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:48,223
Anne Lively.

1132
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,275
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively.

1133
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,194
Are you recording this?

1134
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,571
Yeah, but look, it's pouring out
of her backwards.

1135
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,122
I like my life. Everything is good.

1136
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:25,260
They're inside.

1137
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,262
Who?

1138
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,223
All your old teammates.

1139
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,143
Get in, left chamber.

1140
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:35,520
- Hey, close the door!
- Negative!

1141
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,231
- Negative!
- Negative!

1142
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:39,733
Thank you, I don't deserve that.
I'm gonna cry.

1143
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:40,942
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

1144
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:42,110
- No, you are the man.
- You are the man.

1145
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,327
Can you see the umbrella?

1146
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,206
Take it!

1147
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,171
A man in a blue suit.

1148
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:03,673
He drops his briefcase.

1149
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:15,351
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

1150
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,354
Turn in here.

1151
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:26,738
Let's go.

1152
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,453
Wait.

1153
01:36:33,537 --> 01:36:36,039
- No, we can't stop here.
- You see the balloon man?

1154
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,518
Wait.

1155
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,258
What are we waiting for?

1156
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,765
Wait. Wait.

1157
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,892
Wait.

1158
01:36:56,685 --> 01:36:58,937
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- Alright.

1159
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,608
Wait.

1160
01:37:08,447 --> 01:37:10,073
Thank you.

1161
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,826
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

1162
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,160
- Negative.
- Negative.

1163
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,162
Alright. Scott, Ramos,
take the east end.

1164
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,331
Everyone else, follow me.
Let's go.

1165
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,804
He knows. Don't go home.

1166
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:42,897
We've got eyes on.

1167
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:45,733
They're working, but they're
standing on it.

1168
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:50,405
- Please! Please! Have you got a coin?
- Drop some money.

1169
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,327
Can't you put it in my hand?

1170
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,080
May the Lord bless you.

1171
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:02,792
May God take care of you.

1172
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:23,813
Damn!

1173
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:56,220
That's the guy. The man in the window.

1174
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,694
Hey. Hey.

1175
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:15,782
- Rooms are $95 a night, plus tax.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

1176
01:39:15,866 --> 01:39:17,784
Yeah, I mind.

1177
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,286
How about now?

1178
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,205
Help yourself.

1179
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,637
He's here.

1180
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,847
Anderton, leave.

1181
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:50,108
You have a choice. Walk away.
Do it now.

1182
01:39:50,192 --> 01:39:53,403
I can't. I have to know. I have to find
out what happened in my life.

1183
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:55,029
Please.

1184
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:59,242
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

1185
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:01,577
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1186
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:05,331
Come on. Come on.

1187
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,662
Wrong room.

1188
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,361
Leave. Leave.

1189
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:56,836
Oh, God.

1190
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:05,303
This is Sean, my son.

1191
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:14,478
Every day for the last six years, I've
thought about only two things.

1192
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:20,526
The first is what my son would look like
if he were alive today,

1193
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:25,489
if I would recognize him if I saw him
on the street,

1194
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:32,872
and second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1195
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,462
You're right.

1196
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:42,840
I'm not being set up.

1197
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,720
You have to take me home.

1198
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:50,640
No. No.

1199
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:57,772
You said so yourself. There is
no minority report.

1200
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,566
I don't have an alternate future.

1201
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:04,362
I am going to kill this man.

1202
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:11,577
You still have a choice. The others
never saw their future.

1203
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,746
You still have a choice.

1204
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,917
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1205
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,800
Six years ago, Baltimore,
you grabbed up a kid

1206
01:44:25,884 --> 01:44:28,386
at Francis Public Pool in the West End.

1207
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:31,639
Did I? I don't know.

1208
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:34,392
I don't remember anything
about that place.

1209
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:42,066
Who am I? Who am I? Do you know
who I am?

1210
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:45,695
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1211
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,573
Sean!

1212
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:52,451
I told him I was a policeman.
I told him I needed his help.

1213
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,871
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1214
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,957
I bought him a pretzel.

1215
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,626
He was happy. He was happy.

1216
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:03,879
Is he alive? He's alive. Where
have you got him?

1217
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,008
Is he alright? Tell me, you fuck,
where is he?

1218
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:10,511
I put him in a barrel. I sunk him
in the bay.

1219
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,682
He floated back up.
I took him out.

1220
01:45:14,766 --> 01:45:17,184
I was gentle.
I was gentle.

1221
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,563
I was gentle.

1222
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:29,238
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1223
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:33,326
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

1224
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,456
How could you do that to my...

1225
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:03,731
I'm sorry.

1226
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:13,381
You can choose.

1227
01:46:37,307 --> 01:46:40,351
You have the right to remain silent.

1228
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:44,563
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

1229
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,858
You have the right to an attorney,

1230
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:51,946
now and during any further questioning.

1231
01:46:52,697 --> 01:46:55,741
If you can't afford an attorney,

1232
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,954
we will appoint one.

1233
01:47:01,706 --> 01:47:04,125
Do you understand these rights?

1234
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,711
You're not gonna kill me?

1235
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:14,176
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1236
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:21,392
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1237
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:25,354
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1238
01:47:27,482 --> 01:47:29,817
He? Who's he?

1239
01:47:29,901 --> 01:47:33,154
I don't know. He called me in my cell.

1240
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,322
He told me I'd be released
if I went along,

1241
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:40,578
- and my family would be taken care of.
- If you did what? If you did what?

1242
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:45,749
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1243
01:47:47,502 --> 01:47:49,712
If you killed my kid?

1244
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:53,549
Look, you don't kill me, my family
gets nothing. Okay?

1245
01:47:54,217 --> 01:47:56,510
What about the pictures?

1246
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:00,931
They're fake. He gave them to me.
Okay?

1247
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:04,143
Now, listen to me. You...

1248
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:07,688
You tell me, who was it that set this up?

1249
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:10,274
I don't know.

1250
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:13,068
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again.

1251
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:16,197
- Who was it that put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1252
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,324
I tell you who it was, and my family
gets nothing.

1253
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:20,451
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1254
01:48:20,535 --> 01:48:21,994
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1255
01:48:22,078 --> 01:48:24,079
- Kill me. Kill me.
- Give me the gun.

1256
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,582
Leo, let go of the gun.

1257
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:29,251
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1258
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,757
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1259
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,636
You're not gonna kill me.

1260
01:48:39,429 --> 01:48:41,472
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a...

1261
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:48,646
No!

1262
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:58,072
Hey, did you see it?
Stay back!

1263
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,324
What's happening down there?

1264
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:04,870
Murder!

1265
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:08,666
It doesn't make sense.

1266
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:10,918
If you were a child killer, you took
these pictures,

1267
01:49:11,002 --> 01:49:12,878
would you leave them on the bed
for anyone to find?

1268
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:15,214
They may have been put away. Anderton
might have found them.

1269
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:18,050
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent. Eight years.

1270
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:19,510
This would be your first
actual murder scene?

1271
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:20,553
Yeah.

1272
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:22,221
I worked homicide before I went federal.

1273
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:24,765
This is what we call an orgy of evidence.

1274
01:49:24,849 --> 01:49:27,142
Know how many orgies I had
as a homicide cop, Gordon?

1275
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:29,853
- How many?
- None.

1276
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:37,486
This was all arranged.

1277
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:41,448
Today we saw the first murder in the six
years of the Precrime experiment.

1278
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:45,494
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1279
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:49,081
The protection team simply didn't get
there in time to stop the murder.

1280
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:54,295
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Precogs predicted it would.

1281
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:58,132
I think that today's event put a human
face on the Precrime system.

1282
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:02,261
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1283
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,724
Lamar?

1284
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:15,107
- What?
- Lamar, there's something

1285
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:17,443
terribly wrong. We're chasing
the wrong man.

1286
01:50:17,527 --> 01:50:18,569
What?

1287
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:20,237
I don't wanna say over the phone.

1288
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:22,072
Meet me at Anderton's.

1289
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:25,534
We recovered that from
Leo Crow's hotel room.

1290
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:34,877
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1291
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:37,546
Please, sir.

1292
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,426
Tell me what you have.

1293
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:50,100
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1294
01:50:51,936 --> 01:50:55,981
Yeah, John told me about this. You got
this from Containment?

1295
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,984
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1296
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,070
Agatha's stream was missing.

1297
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:05,449
Now this one is from
the cyber parlor.

1298
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:10,079
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1299
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:16,835
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1300
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:23,092
Look at the surface wind across
the water. Watch the ripples.

1301
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:26,428
Moving away from shore.

1302
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:29,306
Now the second image.

1303
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:32,476
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1304
01:51:33,144 --> 01:51:34,853
Watch the water.

1305
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:40,651
The wind's changed. The ripples
are moving the other way.

1306
01:51:42,737 --> 01:51:45,948
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1307
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:48,158
According to the Sentry, Anderton
was watching this

1308
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,868
at Containment right before
he was tagged.

1309
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,038
Well, I know. He came to me, told me
about the missing data stream.

1310
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,998
He was concerned that
you might find it.

1311
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:58,961
Well, he was right. I did find it. It was
inside of Agatha the whole time.

1312
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:03,632
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1313
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,970
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1314
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,807
I'm thinking someone got away
with murder.

1315
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:13,475
How?

1316
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,270
Well, Jad told me that sometimes
the Precogs see

1317
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:17,896
the same murder more than once.

1318
01:52:18,314 --> 01:52:22,568
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it <i>Precog déjà vu.</i>

1319
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:26,613
Well, we teach the techs to
identify them and disregard.

1320
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:32,453
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1321
01:52:32,537 --> 01:52:33,912
What if what he was really looking at

1322
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,749
was a completely different murder
altogether?

1323
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:39,168
I don't understand.

1324
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,670
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively,

1325
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,257
someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1326
01:52:45,341 --> 01:52:47,968
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1327
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:53,682
halos the killer, takes him away. But
then, right then, someone else,

1328
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:57,102
having reviewed the prevision and
dressed in the same clothes,

1329
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,689
commits the murder in exactly
the same way.

1330
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:06,487
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

1331
01:53:11,701 --> 01:53:13,202
Of course, it would have to be someone

1332
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:16,121
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1333
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,498
Someone fairly high up.

1334
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,836
Do you know what I hear?

1335
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:28,383
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1336
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:32,179
No hovercraft out the window. No
clickety-click of little spyders.

1337
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:34,139
Do you know why I can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1338
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,726
Because right now, the Precogs
can't see a thing.

1339
01:54:02,627 --> 01:54:05,254
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1340
01:54:06,297 --> 01:54:09,424
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1341
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:19,101
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1342
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:21,645
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1343
01:54:23,147 --> 01:54:25,691
- Is he there?
- Yes.

1344
01:54:26,609 --> 01:54:28,861
Has he got the Precog with him?

1345
01:54:31,072 --> 01:54:34,616
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1346
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,745
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1347
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,957
I won't say a word.

1348
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:47,129
You just don't let John leave, alright?

1349
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:50,173
He's no killer, Lamar.

1350
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,384
I know.

1351
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:05,272
It's cold.

1352
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:12,905
Lara, this is Agatha.

1353
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:23,332
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1354
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:31,340
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1355
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:36,219
I gotta sit down.

1356
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:42,517
I gotta figure this out.

1357
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,558
They used Sean.

1358
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:28,230
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

1359
01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:31,066
But he didn't.

1360
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:34,194
He didn't.

1361
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:38,407
Why would they set you up?

1362
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:48,625
Because I found out about her.

1363
01:56:49,752 --> 01:56:51,837
About who?

1364
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:55,632
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1365
01:56:56,926 --> 01:56:58,760
Anne Lively.

1366
01:57:01,472 --> 01:57:02,931
Agatha.

1367
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:12,357
Dr. Hineman once said, <i>The dead don't die.
They look on and help.</i>

1368
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,610
Remember that, John.

1369
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:19,281
- Agatha.
- Sean.

1370
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:28,749
He's on the beach now, toe in the water.

1371
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
He's asking you to come in with him.

1372
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:37,716
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1373
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:42,012
There's so much love in this house.

1374
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:49,144
He's 10 years old.

1375
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:53,815
He's surrounded by animals.

1376
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,527
He wants to be a vet.

1377
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:03,992
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1378
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,704
He's in high school.

1379
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:10,999
He likes to run, like his father.

1380
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:14,669
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.

1381
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:18,006
He's 23.

1382
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:21,343
He's at a university.

1383
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:25,180
He makes love to a pretty girl
named Claire.

1384
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:27,724
He asks her to be his wife.

1385
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:31,520
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1386
01:58:33,689 --> 01:58:39,194
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1387
01:58:40,029 --> 01:58:44,199
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

1388
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:49,037
He sees his daddy. He wants
to run to him.

1389
01:58:51,207 --> 01:58:55,168
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1390
01:58:56,003 --> 01:58:58,380
And the other man is so fast.

1391
01:59:02,593 --> 01:59:05,262
There was so much love in this house.

1392
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:08,557
I want him back so bad.

1393
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:13,019
So did she.

1394
01:59:13,855 --> 01:59:15,522
Can't you see?

1395
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:21,945
She just wanted her little girl back.

1396
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:26,700
But it was too late.

1397
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:31,079
Her little girl was already gone.

1398
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:33,582
She's still alive.

1399
01:59:35,084 --> 01:59:39,004
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1400
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,632
Agatha?

1401
01:59:45,219 --> 01:59:48,388
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1402
01:59:49,932 --> 01:59:51,975
Who killed Anne Lively?

1403
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:58,607
I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna
have to run again.

1404
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:00,483
What?

1405
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:03,612
Run!

1406
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:20,003
I love you.

1407
02:00:20,796 --> 02:00:22,631
- Okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

1408
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:25,550
- You'll be fine with them.
- No, no.

1409
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:26,885
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1410
02:00:26,969 --> 02:00:29,054
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1411
02:00:46,989 --> 02:00:48,531
John Anderton.

1412
02:00:49,825 --> 02:00:52,702
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division,

1413
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:57,874
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murders of Leo Crow
and Danny Witwer.

1414
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:02,587
That's it.

1415
02:01:03,172 --> 02:01:04,839
That's my girl.

1416
02:01:07,009 --> 02:01:09,511
I was so worried about you.

1417
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,766
Did he hurt you?

1418
02:01:18,187 --> 02:01:20,063
I missed you so much.

1419
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:23,984
It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here.

1420
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:33,910
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.

1421
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:39,958
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1422
02:01:40,042 --> 02:01:46,256
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1423
02:02:03,607 --> 02:02:05,608
This is all my fault.

1424
02:02:06,944 --> 02:02:09,446
There was nothing anyone could do.

1425
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:13,408
Lara...

1426
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,786
I thought you might want to have those.

1427
02:02:23,002 --> 02:02:27,464
I haven't worn this in years. I just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1428
02:02:27,548 --> 02:02:29,215
You look great.

1429
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,470
I knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet I did nothing about it.

1430
02:02:33,554 --> 02:02:36,181
Excuse me. The guy from USA Today
is here.

1431
02:02:36,265 --> 02:02:37,307
Tell him not now.

1432
02:02:37,391 --> 02:02:40,602
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1433
02:02:43,397 --> 02:02:47,067
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1434
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:52,113
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

1435
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:56,785
This is John's legacy as much
as it is my own.

1436
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,955
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

1437
02:03:01,582 --> 02:03:05,335
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

1438
02:03:05,419 --> 02:03:09,923
But maybe you can find some closure
in the fact that

1439
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:12,926
John finally found the man
who killed your son.

1440
02:03:16,305 --> 02:03:18,056
Who's Anne Lively?

1441
02:03:20,309 --> 02:03:22,769
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1442
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:27,065
John was talking about her right
before they took him.

1443
02:03:27,149 --> 02:03:29,150
I don't know who that is.

1444
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,907
John said something about him being set up
because he found out about her.

1445
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:41,079
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1446
02:03:41,163 --> 02:03:43,915
And Witwer? He was killed
with John's gun

1447
02:03:43,999 --> 02:03:46,584
- inside John's apartment.
- Lamar, do you know the reason

1448
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:50,046
why John came here to work for you?

1449
02:03:50,131 --> 02:03:51,589
- Sean.
- Yes.

1450
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:55,760
He came here to work for you
because he thought

1451
02:03:55,845 --> 02:04:00,515
if he could just stop that kind
of thing from happening...

1452
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:04,394
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1453
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:09,023
Sir, they wanna start the press conference
in two minutes.

1454
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:13,736
Lara, John was the best cop
I ever knew,

1455
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:17,115
and, in some ways,
also the best man.

1456
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:19,784
But the scars he carried around...

1457
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:25,415
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the
good things we remember about him.

1458
02:04:25,499 --> 02:04:28,293
And I also know why he married you.

1459
02:04:28,377 --> 02:04:30,712
You're as stubborn as he is.

1460
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:32,297
Lamar...

1461
02:04:32,381 --> 02:04:35,633
Lara, do you know how
to tie one of these?

1462
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:39,721
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, you see.

1463
02:04:48,063 --> 02:04:50,982
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1464
02:04:51,066 --> 02:04:55,487
First thing Monday, I'll look over
the Witwer evidence.

1465
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:59,365
And I'll have Gideon run
the Containment files,

1466
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:02,494
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1467
02:05:02,578 --> 02:05:04,871
What did you say her name was?

1468
02:05:07,416 --> 02:05:09,167
Anne Lively.

1469
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:12,170
But I never said she drowned.

1470
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:36,611
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1471
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:43,952
We'll talk about this later.

1472
02:05:44,828 --> 02:05:48,831
Perhaps tomorrow I'll come
by the cottage.

1473
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:28,538
I'd like a word with my husband.

1474
02:06:29,498 --> 02:06:31,833
You're not authorized.

1475
02:06:32,626 --> 02:06:34,836
How did you get in here?

1476
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:45,430
Thank you.

1477
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:50,518
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1478
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,191
On behalf of your staff, we would
like to present you with this.

1479
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:00,695
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1480
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:03,781
How did you get this?

1481
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:05,908
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1482
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:11,456
Revolvers like this one

1483
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:16,169
were given to generals at the end of
the Civil War by their troops.

1484
02:07:17,171 --> 02:07:21,132
The cylinders were loaded with
five gold-plated bullets

1485
02:07:21,216 --> 02:07:24,052
to symbolize the end of the destruction
and death

1486
02:07:24,136 --> 02:07:27,138
that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1487
02:07:27,222 --> 02:07:30,933
Ladies and gentlemen, with
Precrime going national,

1488
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:34,812
maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us

1489
02:07:34,897 --> 02:07:38,316
will have to discharge another firearm
ever again.

1490
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:44,072
Now enjoy yourselves. Enjoy yourselves!
That's an order.

1491
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:50,787
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1492
02:07:50,871 --> 02:07:52,163
I hope so.

1493
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,335
Hello. Yes. Right away.

1494
02:07:58,796 --> 02:08:01,130
Excuse me. Excuse me. So sorry.

1495
02:08:02,132 --> 02:08:03,841
- Sir?
- Yes.

1496
02:08:03,926 --> 02:08:05,843
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1497
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,762
Alright. Thank you.

1498
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:10,348
Yes, this is Burgess.

1499
02:08:10,432 --> 02:08:14,310
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to
congratulate you. You did it.

1500
02:08:15,187 --> 02:08:17,772
You created a world without murder.

1501
02:08:17,856 --> 02:08:20,983
Sir, everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these for us?

1502
02:08:21,068 --> 02:08:23,611
And all you had to do was kill someone
to do it.

1503
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:29,283
A- room. Jad.

1504
02:08:30,285 --> 02:08:33,538
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1505
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:35,081
I don't know what you're talking about.

1506
02:08:35,165 --> 02:08:38,793
I'm talking about Agatha's mother,
Anne Lively.

1507
02:08:38,877 --> 02:08:41,546
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up.

1508
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:45,925
But surprise. She cleaned herself up and
she wanted her daughter back.

1509
02:08:46,009 --> 02:08:47,677
She wanted Agatha.

1510
02:08:50,931 --> 02:08:52,223
Jad, you getting this?

1511
02:08:52,307 --> 02:08:55,143
It's a single stream from the female only
with no time or incident data.

1512
02:08:55,269 --> 02:08:57,770
Whatever this is, it isn't the future.
It already happened.

1513
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:01,566
The problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.

1514
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:04,110
She's always been the strongest
of the three.

1515
02:09:04,194 --> 02:09:06,404
You knew without Agatha,
you had nothing.

1516
02:09:06,488 --> 02:09:08,489
Without her, you wouldn't
be where you are now,

1517
02:09:08,574 --> 02:09:11,200
standing there, signing autographs.

1518
02:09:20,169 --> 02:09:21,169
Jad, what are you doing?

1519
02:09:22,045 --> 02:09:23,463
Jad. Jad, what are you doing with that?

1520
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:24,756
What you up to, big man?

1521
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:27,258
Jad, Jad, let's think before
you send that.

1522
02:09:27,342 --> 02:09:28,342
Slow down.

1523
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:52,283
So now you had to get rid of Anne Lively.
You had to shut her up,

1524
02:09:52,367 --> 02:09:53,910
which presented a problem.

1525
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:57,622
How can you kill her without
the Precogs seeing it?

1526
02:09:57,706 --> 02:10:02,126
Simple. Use a system you control
against her.

1527
02:10:02,211 --> 02:10:04,212
So you hired someone to kill her for you,

1528
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:07,507
knowing full well the Precogs
would see that murder.

1529
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:10,927
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake

1530
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:14,889
with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter.

1531
02:10:59,768 --> 02:11:01,727
Where's my daughter?

1532
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:10,236
Where?

1533
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:13,656
Run.

1534
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:18,119
Run!

1535
02:11:29,965 --> 02:11:33,301
And then, when you were all alone,
you killed her yourself,

1536
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:37,221
in the same way the Precogs predicted
your John Doe would kill her.

1537
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:40,057
You made the real murder
look like an echo,

1538
02:11:40,142 --> 02:11:44,645
knowing the tech would do what he
was trained to do. Disregard it.

1539
02:11:51,069 --> 02:11:54,989
Anne Lively became just another
missing person.

1540
02:11:56,199 --> 02:11:58,701
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1541
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:02,079
What are you gonna do?

1542
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:15,092
We got a Red Ball!

1543
02:12:20,849 --> 02:12:26,270
Think about the lives that little girl
has saved.

1544
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:31,442
Think about all the lives she will save.
That little girl could have saved Sean.

1545
02:12:31,526 --> 02:12:34,028
Don't you ever say his name!

1546
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:39,533
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1547
02:12:39,743 --> 02:12:42,787
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up!

1548
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:45,790
That was the one thing you knew
that would drive me to murder.

1549
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,377
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1550
02:12:49,711 --> 02:12:51,504
- How are you gonna...
- Shut me up?

1551
02:12:51,713 --> 02:12:53,756
Forgive me, John.

1552
02:13:02,432 --> 02:13:04,100
Forgive me, John.

1553
02:13:15,821 --> 02:13:18,406
Lamar, it's over.

1554
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:24,870
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1555
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,636
No doubt the Precogs
have already seen this.

1556
02:13:41,138 --> 02:13:42,680
No doubt.

1557
02:13:44,182 --> 02:13:46,350
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1558
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:51,313
If you don't kill me, Precogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1559
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:56,318
If you do kill me, you go away,

1560
02:13:56,403 --> 02:14:00,322
but it proves the system works.
Precogs were right.

1561
02:14:07,205 --> 02:14:10,041
So, what are you gonna do now?

1562
02:14:11,835 --> 02:14:13,627
What's it worth?

1563
02:14:14,504 --> 02:14:16,338
Just one more murder.

1564
02:14:19,926 --> 02:14:24,555
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people
will still believe in Precrime.

1565
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,309
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1566
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:37,401
Except you know your own future,

1567
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:40,905
which means you can change it
if you want to.

1568
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:46,619
You still have a choice, Lamar,
like I did.

1569
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:54,794
Yes, I have a choice.

1570
02:14:56,296 --> 02:14:57,922
And I made it.

1571
02:14:59,216 --> 02:15:00,883
Forgive me, John.

1572
02:15:02,844 --> 02:15:04,303
Forgive me.

1573
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:11,685
Forgive me, my boy.

1574
02:15:30,205 --> 02:15:31,539
Lamar!

1575
02:15:43,051 --> 02:15:47,596
In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1576
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:58,649
All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released,

1577
02:15:58,733 --> 02:16:03,195
although police departments kept watch
on many of them for years to come.

1578
02:16:50,952 --> 02:16:56,040
Agatha and the twins were transferred
to an undisclosed location,

1579
02:16:57,959 --> 02:17:01,545
a place where they could find relief
from their gifts.

1580
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,257
A place where they could live out
their lives in peace.

1581
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:30,000
