1
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,240
 So how long's this been going on for?

2
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,559
 l don't know.

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,079
 A few weeks?

4
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
 - A long time.
 - A year?

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,999
 l suppose so.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,639
 A whole year?

7
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 You've taken your time to come
 and see me, haven't you?

8
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,479
 You think it's going to stop, don't you?

9
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,319
 l'll just take your blood pressure.

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,319
 Can you pop your arm on the desk
 for me?

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,639
 There you go.

12
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,640
 lf you straighten it up
 and push up your sleeve...

13
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 Are you dozing in the daytime?

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,759
 Sometimes.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,359
 So, l just need something
 to help me sleep.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,079
 l know. How much sleep
 are you getting at night?

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,199
 l'm not getting any. That's why l'm here.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,759
 l understand, sweetheart.

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 OK. lt's just going to go tight.

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
 (puffing)

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 (hissing)

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 Have you got any particular worries
 at the moment?

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,319
 No financial problems?

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 No. l don't know
 what that's got to do with it.

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,599
 What about at home?

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 How are things with husband?

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,360
 OK, if you just lean forward and take a
 few deep breaths, in through your mouth.

28
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 And again.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 lt's lovely and clear.

30
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,760
 - Have you got any kids?
 - Yes.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,960
 - Are they still at home with you?
 - Son is, works with his father.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,919
 Daughter's left, only see her
 when she wants something.

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 And how about you?
 Have you started your menopause?

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,039
 Yes.

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,040
 Everything OK?

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,999
 So, will you give me some sleeping tablets?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,399
 Maybe, but it might not solve your problem.

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,759
 Give me a night's sleep, though,
 wouldn't it?

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,760
 - How much alcohol are you drinking?
 - l don't drink. My husband drinks.

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,519
 ls it a problem?

41
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,519
 No.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
 Are you taking any drugs, medication?

43
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,279
 How about coffee?

44
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,399
 Are you drinking a lot to keep awake?

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,799
 Coffee, yes.

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,919
 - Tea?
 - Yes.

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 Well, we might have to look at that,
 mightn't we?

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,439
 OK.

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,440
 Your blood pressure is slightly up,
 but l'm not overly concerned about that.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 But l do want you to have a blood test,
 to check your thyroid.

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,199
 You can make an appointment at reception.
 All right?

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,359
 Yes.

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 Now, l will give you something to help
 you sleep but just enough for a week.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,479
 - What good's that?
 - lnsomnia isn't a disease.

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,480
 Sleeping tablets won't make it go away.
 We need to find the cause.

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,880
 Now, you're obviously anxious,
 and a little depressed.

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
 So l want you to come back
 and speak to our counsellor.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
 - What for?
 - l think she'd be able to help you.

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,839
 But you'll give me the prescription now?

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
 Yes, but will you see the counsellor?

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 l think it will do you some good.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,359
 You think about it for a moment.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 (tapping of keyboard)

64
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,599
 Tom!

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
 Give us it.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 (sighs)

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,439
 - Don't do your back in.
 - l know.

68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 lt doesn't get any easier.
 Job for a younger man, this.

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,799
 Joe used to love it here.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,359
 Did you speak to my son and heir?

71
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,559
 l left him a message on his answerphone.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,519
 (panting)

73
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 lt's going to rain again.

74
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,240
 (machinery whirs)

75
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,159
 - Now, then.
 - Hello, boss.

76
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,959
 - What you got?
 - You hit rock, then?

77
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
 Yeah, we just gone through.
 This is the fourth, so l reckon, what, 1 71/2?

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,479
 Give or take.

79
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
 - 1 71/2? lt's got to be a scour hollow.
 - Probably.

80
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,079
 - All right, Mick?
 - All right.

81
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
 Hello.

82
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,959
 How long will it take us to get back?

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,719
 - 25, with traffic. Are you hungry?
 - l am.

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,999
 Good.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,719
 There you go.

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,799
 Yes, London clay. Thank you.

87
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,559
 - Thanks, Andy. See you.
 - Cheers.

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 Ta-ta.

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,639
 - Dusting of mica.
 - Let's have a look.

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
 Hmm, it's quite nice.

91
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,679
 (chuckles)

92
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,680
 Very nice.

93
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 - lt's just a dusting, isn't it?
 - Yeah.

94
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
 What would you say was the happiest
 moment in your life?

95
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,919
 What do you mean?

96
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 Your nicest memory.

97
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
 Have a think.

98
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 When your children were born?

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
 - Your wedding day?
 - l don't know.

100
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,799
 Take your time.

101
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,559
 l can't remember.

102
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,399
 - Can't or won't?
 - Mm?

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,039
 Can't or won't remember?

104
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,959
 Don't know what l'm doing here.
 l didn't want to come.

105
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,239
 Don't want to talk about my family.
 Why should l?

106
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,079
 None of your business.
 All l need is a good night's sleep

107
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
 and nobody's helping me.

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,840
 Janet, l want to help you.
 That's why we're here.

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 l know it's not easy
 to talk about personal things.

110
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 Suppose the boot was on the other foot,
 and someone came to you,

111
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 say, your daughter, and said,
 ''l haven't been sleeping for months.''

112
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,839
 What would you say to them?

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,799
 ''Go to the doctor.''

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 What else would you say?

115
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,519
 l don't know.

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,520
 What would you ask her?

117
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 ls she eating all right?
 l don't know, something like that.

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,679
 Good.

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,680
 Anything else?

120
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,119
 That a couple of months of proper sleep
 would sort it out.

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,799
 Sort what out?

122
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,559
 The sleeping.

123
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,560
 OK.

124
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 On a scale of one to ten...

125
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,199
 ..how happy
 would you say you are, Janet?

126
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,079
 - One.
 - One.

127
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,080
 l think there's room for improvement there,
 don't you?

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
 What is the one thing that would improve
 your life, apart from sleep?

129
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
 - A different life.
 - A different life.

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720
 Change is frightening, isn't it?

131
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 Nothing changes.

132
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,999
 Hope to see you next week, Janet.
 Same time.

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,639
 l'll be here, but it's up to you. No pressure.

134
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,319
 Bye.

135
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 (sighs)

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 - Bye-bye, Sam.
 - Bye.

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,439
 Look at you!

138
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,159
 You look like you're fit to burst.

139
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,999
 l am fit to burst.
 Big boy's wrestling his way down.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,159
 lf he pops out, give me a shout.

141
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 Sweetheart, l'll do more than shout.

142
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,399
 - Hi, Gerri.
 - Hello, Mary.

143
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,919
 You're a sight for sore eyes.

144
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 - Can you process these for me?
 - Oh, well, seeing as it's you.

145
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,719
 - How are you?
 - l'm snowed under, to be honest,

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
 and l've got a headache.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,559
 - Have you seen the doctor?
 - (laughs)

148
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,879
 Hello, Gemma.

149
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,679
 Do you fancy a drink tonight?

150
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,319
 - l'd love one.
 - Great. Are you sure?

151
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,319
 - l've only got an hour.
 - That's all right.

152
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,519
 - Tom's cooking supper.
 - Oh, lovely.

153
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,520
 - l'll see you later.
 - Yeah.

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
 (rain pouring)

155
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
 (buzz of conversation)

156
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,199
 Do you know, Gerri, l've never been with
 a man who could cook.

157
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,079
 - Haven't you?
 - No.

158
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,839
 - They could do other things.
 - That doesn't get you fed.

159
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,279
 No, it keeps a girl happy, though.
 (laughs)

160
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,719
 - And you can't cook.
 - No. Well, l can a bit.

161
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,279
 - But it's not really my thing.
 - No, it's not.

162
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,599
 Oh, no, don't remind me about that,
 Gerri.

163
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,719
 (laughs)

164
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,159
 You could put an ad in the paper
 ''Chefwanted''.

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
 Yeah. ''Chef/boyfriend
 required for gorgeous girl.''

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,759
 No, ''Mature woman with cat.''

167
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,679
 (laughter)

168
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
 No, ''Maturish''.
 We don't want to put them off, do we?

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,799
 lt's lovely the way you and Tom
 do everything together.

170
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 - We're very lucky.
 - Yeah. You are, but you deserve it.

171
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 - You're both such lovely people.
 - Oops, my halo's slipping.

172
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,199
 Yeah, Saint Gerri.

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 No, but l'm really comfortable
 with where l am in my life, as you know.

174
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,279
 l've got my lovely little garden flat,
 a good job.

175
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,280
 l've got my health, touch wood,
 l've got my independence.

176
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,199
 l mean, don't get me wrong, it's not all rosy.

177
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 l have good days and bad days
 like everyone else, but, hey!

178
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
 Are you going to do something
 about your garden?

179
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,719
 Oh, don't remind me!
 l'm really guilty about that.

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,159
 - l've neglected it, haven't l?
 - Yes, you have.

181
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 But yesterday l was brushing my teeth
 and l looked out the window

182
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 and l saw these two daffodils
 peeping over the top ofthe grass.

183
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,079
 l must get it cut.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,039
 - Get yourselfthat lawn mower.
 - l know.

185
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,719
 Couldn't l just get a man in?
 lt wouldn't cost much.

186
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 - Hmm. ''Gardener/chef/ boyfriend.''
 - Yeah! (laughs)

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
 But l don't want to spend too much money
 because l'm going to get myself a little car.

188
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,239
 - Are you?
 - Yeah, l've decided it's about time.

189
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,639
 - lt's a big step.
 - l know. lt's exciting, isn't it?

190
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,559
 l mean, l've got a little bit of money.
 Not a lot, but enough.

191
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,919
 But l'll have to cut back on, you know,

192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,519
 shoes, clothes, jewellery,
 my knick-knacky things.

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 But that's OK because l've got loads of
 clothes. My wardrobe isn't big enough.

194
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 ln fact, l'm not doing anything this
 weekend, so l'll get up really early,

195
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,080
 sort my winter clothes into plastic bags
 and shove them under the bed.

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,559
 - Can l top you up?
 - No, l'm going now, Mary.

197
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,559
 - Won't you help me finish it?
 - No, really.

198
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,560
 - Oh, all right. Well, l think l'm going to
 stay for a little while.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,799
 How's Joe?
 Have you heard from him this week?

200
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,319
 - No, but l'm sure he's fine.
 - Still no girlfriend?

201
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,279
 l've no idea.

202
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
 He must have something on the go,
 a good-looking boy like him.

203
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,159
 - See you on Thursday.
 - Oh!

204
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,879
 You're coming for supper on Saturday.

205
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,599
 Oh, lovely. Thank you, Gerri.
 Give my love to that lovely Tom.

206
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
 - l will. You take care.
 - Yeah.

207
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,560
 Sorry l'm late. l'm sorry.

208
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,879
 What's for supper?

209
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,399
 Arrabbiata. Are you hungry?

210
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,039
 l'm starving.

211
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,599
 Hello.

212
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,639
 Have a taste.

213
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,479
 l hope it's not too hot.

214
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 You can never tell with chillies.

215
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,439
 - No.
 - No?

216
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,399
 Oh, it's coming out my ears.

217
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 Good. Glass ofwine?

218
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,039
 No, l've had a couple.
 Oh, go on, just a smidgeon.

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
 That's the spirit.

220
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 - How was your day?
 - Good.

221
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
 l was out and about, getting my hands dirty.

222
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,079
 - How about you?
 - Disappointing.

223
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,159
 Pass me the parsley.

224
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,519
 No breakthroughs?

225
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,919
 l had my alcoholic tutor in again.

226
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,279
 Yeah?

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 - He was pissed as a fart.
 - Really?

228
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,479
 lt was very upsetting, actually.

229
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,119
 How did you handle it?

230
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,719
 l bought him a double Scotch.
 No, l had to challenge him.

231
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,879
 l told him it was up to him.

232
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,759
 How did he take that?

233
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,759
 Well, l don't know. We'll have to see.

234
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,079
 - Well, at least he came.
 - Hmm.

235
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,599
 - Have we heard from Joe?
 - No.

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,519
 But l haven't checked my e-mails.

237
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,199
 l'll ring him later. l'd love to see him.

238
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
 He's all right.

239
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,959
 Mr Gupta?

240
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,719
 Joe Hepple, nice to meet you.

241
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,519
 - l just came with him.
 - Ah, good.

242
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
 Just follow me this way, please.

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
 This way.

244
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,279
 Excuse the mess.

245
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,280
 You sit there, Mr Gupta,
 and...l'll pop you there.

246
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,640
 OK, now we've opened all these letters,

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and l've seen all l need to see
 for the time being.

248
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,359
 Obviously, it's a sizeable correspondence

249
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
 and, understandably, Mr Gupta hasn't
 exactly been in a position to open them,

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,239
 seeing as he's been in hospital
 for the past ten weeks.

251
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
 But, you're looking fit and raring to go,
 Mr Gupta.

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,959
 Huh?

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 (mouths)

254
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,879
 WOMAN: Excuse me.
 - Hm?

255
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,199
 - How long will this take?
 JOE: Not too long.

256
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,159
 lt's just l have to get back to work.

257
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,559
 What do you do?

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,559
 Er, l'm... Restaurant family business.

259
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,559
 Oh, tasty.

260
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,479
 OK.

261
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 Erm...it's important for Mr Gupta
 to understand that at this point

262
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,799
 he's in no danger of being evicted.

263
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 (speaks Hindustani)

264
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,599
 Acha?

265
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 (continues in Hindustani)

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,239
 OK?

267
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,999
 l'll take you briefly through
 what is going to happen in court.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Erm...l'll be representing Mr Gupta
 on the day.

269
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,239
 We'll put the case to the judge...

270
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,879
 - (phone rings)
 - ..and...

271
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 he will agree to adjourn which will then
 give us time to sort things out, OK?

272
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,839
 So, l'll... Excuse me.

273
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,840
 Hello?

274
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
 (knocks on door)

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,239
 - l'll get it!
 TOM: All right.

276
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,839
 - Hello, Mary.
 - Hi, Gerri.

277
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,999
 - lt's stopped raining, thank goodness.
 - l know.

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,679
 - Welcome.
 - Oh, thank you.

279
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,439
 l bought you a little present, some thyme.

280
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,519
 - That's lovely. Thank you.
 - lt's nothing much.

281
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,959
 - Oh, there he is.
 - Hello, love.

282
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,599
 Hello, Tom.

283
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
 Oh! l'm sorry, l just had to have a cigarette

284
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,039
 - and l know you don't like the smell.
 - Don't be daft.

285
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,439
 - l'm trying to give up, aren't l, Gerri?
 - Oh, are you?

286
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,559
 Only l've just had a bad experience
 on the tube.

287
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,599
 - What happened?
 - There was this man.

288
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,839
 - What did he do?
 - Well, he was looking at me.

289
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
 l mean, every time l looked up,
 he was looking at me.

290
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,839
 - Oh, dear.
 - lt was a bit unsettling, to be honest.

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,359
 Well, you're here now.

292
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 Exactly, and l'm very happy
 to be here with both of you.

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,079
 This is for you, Tom.

294
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,759
 - Ah!
 - lt's nothing special.

295
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,999
 Buenos Aires.

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Yeah, because l thought you went there,
 didn't you, the two of you, Argentina?

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,399
 - No, we didn't, no.
 - No.

298
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,759
 - Didn't you?
 - No.

299
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,999
 Tom's been to Brazil, digging his holes.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 - Yeah.
 - Oh, l'm so stupid sometimes.

301
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,159
 - That's all right.
 - Oh, honestly,

302
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,359
 Pow! What are you going to do with me,
 eh?

303
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 l'm just going to run upstairs.
 ls that all right? l won't be a minute.

304
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,960
 - l haven't seen you since Christmas.
 - Really?

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,919
 - Oh, it's just the three of us tonight?
 - Yes.

306
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,079
 - l did tell you.
 - Did you?

307
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,759
 - Mm.
 - We wanted you all to ourselves, Mary.

308
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
 Oh, thank you, Tom.
 That's what all the boys say.

309
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,479
 No, l wasn't sure what to wear.

310
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,279
 l didn't know if it was going to be
 one of your big dinner parties,

311
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
 - or just us, you know, casual.
 - l think you got it just about right, Mary.

312
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,479
 - You look lovely.
 - Oh, thank you, Gerri.

313
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,480
 - (yawns) Oh...sorry.
 - Did you have a late night?

314
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960
 Oh! l stayed up watching the film.

315
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,599
 l couldn't wake up this morning.

316
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,839
 No, but it was lovely having a lie-in
 on my day off.

317
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,199
 - We stayed in.
 - Did you?

318
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
 - We listened to some music.
 - Amongst other things.

319
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,879
 - l thought Joe might be coming.
 - l don't think so.

320
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 - He's coming tomorrow.
 - Oh, that's a shame. l won't see him.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,119
 Did Gerri tell you about me getting a car, Tom?

322
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,119
 Yes.

323
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,759
 - What do you think?
 - Exciting. What are you going to get?

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
 Oh, well, l don't know.
 Something small and...red.

325
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,919
 Small and red?
 Well, that narrows it down.

326
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,159
 - Yeah.
 - l hope you're hungry.

327
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,919
 - l'm starving, Gerri, you know me.
 - We'll have to fatten you up.

328
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,199
 Oh, it's lovely having your dinner cooked
 for you.

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,559
 You don't really bother
 when you're by yourself.

330
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,239
 - You look well.
 - Oh, thank you, Tom.

331
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,799
 You're nice and slim.

332
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,759
 Am l?
 Well, l've always been slim, haven't l?

333
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,719
 - Unlike me. Middle-aged spread.
 - Shut up.

334
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,479
 You're perfect. Gorgeous in every way.

335
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
 And you know it.

336
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 Sit yourself down, Mary.
 Help yourselfto another drink.

337
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,319
 How is that dressing coming along?

338
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 As well as can be expected.

339
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,959
 l hear you're going to the Emerald lsle again,
 Tom.

340
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,959
 That's correct. Rent a cottage, take the car.

341
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,879
 - Put the tent in the back.
 - And the sleeping bags.

342
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 - lf it's nice we might do a bit of camping.
 - Oh, no.

343
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 l wouldn't fancy sleeping in a tent,
 thank you very much.

344
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
 No, l never had you down
 as one of nature's Girl Guides, Mary.

345
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,839
 No, Tom.

346
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
 But l am always prepared.

347
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,199
 - Yes, but what for?
 - For anything, Gerri.

348
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,079
 - You know me.
 - Yes, l do.

349
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,519
 (laughter)

350
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,520
 l'm not going to get a holiday this year.

351
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 But then l never do, do l, Gerri?
 Because l haven't got anyone to go with.

352
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,319
 lt's all right for you two,
 you've got each other.

353
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 We're going to the Ring of Kerry.

354
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,279
 The what?

355
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,319
 - The Ring of Kerry. lt's an area.
 GERRl: Tralee,

356
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,279
 - Dingle Bay.
 - Oh, lovely.

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,119
 You've been there before, haven't you?

358
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,239
 - That was Donegal.
 - Oh.

359
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,439
 The geologist stands on the beach

360
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,159
 with his back to the sea and looks at the cliffs

361
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
 whilst the geologist's wife stands on the beach

362
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
 with her back to the cliffs
 looking at the sea.

363
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 You see, l can't afford to buy my car
 and have a holiday.

364
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,080
 But, if l had more money,
 then l could do both.

365
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,240
 But when you've got your car, Mary,
 you'll be able to go wherever you want,

366
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,799
 - very reasonably.
 - Exactly, Tom.

367
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,039
 That's exactly why l'm getting it.

368
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 You see, l like just taking off
 and escaping, don't l, Gerri?

369
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,839
 Hm.

370
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 l feel like l'm being somebody else.

371
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 - Really? Who's that, then?
 GERRl: Tom!

372
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 l like to get on the train...

373
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
 But, you see,
 the car is cheaper than the train, isn't it?

374
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 GERRl:
 Not environmentally.

375
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,319
 Oh, what you mean...?
 (bangs feet on floor)

376
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,439
 (laughs)

377
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,039
 Those are my carbon footprints, Gerri.

378
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 - Yes, l know.
 - (giggles drunkenly)

379
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
 Financially, cars are cheaper.
 That's why there's no incentive to go by train.

380
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,279
 Well, what about the airlines?

381
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,280
 No government wants to increase
 the duty on aviation fuel.

382
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,679
 No.

383
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,159
 And this government
 won't invest in the railways,

384
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,999
 so anything we do is a piss in the ocean.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,159
 Absolutely.

386
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,279
 And then there's the big corporations,

387
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,999
 who keep their lights on all night
 in empty office blocks.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
 We're all expected to do our bit with eco bulbs.

389
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,559
 l know.

390
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
 Should l stop recycling, then, Gerri?

391
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,879
 - No.
 TOM: You've got to set an example.

392
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,759
 - Yeah.
 - Plant a few tomatoes.

393
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
 And courgettes.

394
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,680
 l am very environmentally friendly, actually.

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,799
 - Are you?
 - Yeah.

396
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,279
 l don't fly.

397
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 l don't live in a house
 that's more than l need.

398
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,199
 l don't cook.

399
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,079
 - Other people cook for you, though.
 - Who?

400
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,719
 You get takeaways, don't you?

401
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
 That doesn't count.
 Everybody gets takeaways.

402
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 You've built whole motorways, Tom.

403
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,279
 How environmentally friendly is that?

404
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,439
 Exactly!

405
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,440
 More cars! More cars!
 At least l'm buying an old car.

406
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,999
 - Recycled.
 - Yeah.

407
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Yet we're constantly told that
 the measure of a thriving economy

408
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,559
 is the sale of new cars.

409
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,119
 Yes, but, Tom...

410
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
 ..if l buy a new car...

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,959
 ..that's another car.

412
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 You're absolutely right, Mary.

413
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
 And would you like some coffee?

414
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,839
 No, thank you.

415
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 l'd like my usual.

416
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,239
 Are you all right, Gerri?

417
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,319
 Yes, Mary, l'm fine.

418
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 How are you?

419
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,159
 l'm happy.

420
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,160
 Good.

421
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
 l just wanted to say...

422
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 ..that if you ever need to share anything...

423
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,960
 ..l'm here for you.

424
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,799
 l'm a very good listener.

425
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,639
 Thank you, Mary, but l'm fine.

426
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 Yeah, l know.

427
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
 lt's very kind of you, Mary.

428
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 Oh, Gerri.

429
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 Everybody needs someone to talk to,
 don't they?

430
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
 Yes, Mary, they do.

431
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,680
 Oh, well, onwards and upwards.

432
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,439
 You'd better stay the night.

433
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,199
 No. No.

434
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,919
 Well, l think you should.

435
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,879
 All right, Gerri, you're the boss.

436
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,879
 We'll find you a T-shirt again.

437
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 Will you?

438
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,679
 l've found you a toothbrush.

439
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,680
 l sometimes wonder what he's doing.

440
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,919
 lf he thinks about me. l bet he does.

441
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 GERRl:
 How old was he?

442
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,679
 He'll be 64 now.

443
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,159
 TOM: 64?
 Blimey, he's older than me.

444
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,559
 - Almost a pensioner.
 TOM: He'll be past it now, Mary.

445
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,479
 - Give us your hand.
 - Oh, no, Tom.

446
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,039
 He was lovely.

447
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,239
 Well, we all grow old.

448
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,240
 Oh, no, but he was very, very, sexy, Gerri.
 Do you know what l mean?

449
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,079
 TOM:
 Too much information.

450
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,080
 l bet he regrets it deep down.

451
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
 l hope he does.

452
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
 He was my big love...

453
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 ..but he was married.

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,399
 Well, what can you do, Tom?

455
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
 You can't walk around
 with a label saying,

456
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 ''Don't fall in love with me,
 l'm married,'' can you?

457
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,839
 Some people wear a ring.

458
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,679
 He didn't.

459
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,680
 But he wasn't a bad person.

460
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,039
 He loved me.

461
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
 Sounds to me
 like he was a duplicitous shit.

462
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,120
 GERRl:
 Tom?

463
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,679
 Do you think it was my fault, Tom?

464
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,399
 No, l don't, Mary.

465
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,799
 Honest.

466
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,119
 lt takes two to tango.

467
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,839
 Oh, so you think it was my fault, Gerri?

468
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 - l didn't say that.
 - No, l know you didn't, really.

469
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,639
 l blame my big heart.

470
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 Well, we all have to make choices,
 don't we?

471
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
 Why do l always get it wrong, Gerri?

472
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,440
 l mean, look what happened
 when l got divorced from that shit.

473
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 l let him palm me offwith 5,000...
 nothing pounds

474
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,839
 and what am l left with now?

475
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,559
 Sod all.

476
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
 l'm living in a poky rented flat when
 l should have my own home at my age.

477
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 lt's not fair.

478
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 Bastard.

479
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,079
 My goodness.

480
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,679
 Hm?

481
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
 - She gets worse.
 - l know. Desperate.

482
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,839
 l feel a bit guilty.

483
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,479
 What?

484
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,119
 Well, you know.

485
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
 No.

486
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,920
 No. You're right.

487
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 l don't think l really enjoyed history at school.

488
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,719
 Didn't you?

489
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,720
 Maybe l did.

490
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,520
 lt's just that the older you get,
 the more relevant it seems.

491
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
 Hm.

492
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
 To state the bleeding obvious.

493
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,359
 We'll be part of history soon.

494
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
 Exactly.

495
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,519
 - Aha!
 - Aha!

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,039
 What are you doing riding
 on the pavement, young man?

497
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,679
 l'm breaking the law, officer.

498
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,839
 - 'Ey up.
 - Hiya.

499
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,559
 - How long did it take?
 - About an hour.

500
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,319
 - Are you knackered?
 - l'm ready for bed.

501
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,159
 - Late night?
 - Hangover.

502
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,879
 - Do you want a hand?
 - Yes, please.

503
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 - l'll stick this away.
 - All right.

504
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,719
 Oh, he's back. That was quick, Tom.

505
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,679
 - Didn't you get the manure?
 TOM: Compost.

506
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,879
 - Here's Joe!
 - Hi, Mary.

507
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,519
 Hello, Joe, what a surprise.

508
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,599
 - Are you all right?
 - l'm great. How are you?

509
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 - Oh, continental! He's all sweaty.
 - l've been riding all morning.

510

00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,559
 Another capital city brought to its knees.

560
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,479
 Well, we'll try and leave it as we find it.

561
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,879

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,720
 No, still quiet on that front.

571
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,960
 Sorry, love. Excuse me.

 (knocking on door)

573
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,079
 Who's that a-knocking on my door?

574
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,439
 MAN:
 lt's only me!

575
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,239

583

 Thanks, mate.

584
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,959
 - Ooh, Gerri.
 - Careful, Ken.

585
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,079
 - Would you like a beer?
 - Oh, l'd love one, ta.

586
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,119
 Hup! Ha, ha, ha!

587
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,120
 (chuckles)

588
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,279
 - Maniacs.
 - Oh...

589
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,280
 Mm.

590
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,479
 Mm.

591
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,959

 - Thank you.

592
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,079

594
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,079

595
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,639

596
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,159

 Cheers.

599
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,360
 (laughter)

600
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,879
 - Mm.
 GERRl: So how's your flat, Ken?

601
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,479
 Oh, same old, same old.

602
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,799
 You employed a cleaner yet?

603
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,759
 lf l got a cleaner in, she'd turn round,
 walk straight out again.

604
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,559
 lt might give her a purpose in life.

605
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,519
 - Bit of a mess, but it suits me.
 GERRl: Yeah.

606
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,199
 Five minutes walk to work.

607
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200
 l usually get the bus, but if l'm late,
 l have to leg it, if l miss the bus.

608
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,160

 ifthey haven't got any iced buns.

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,359
 Cup oftea.

611
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,039
 l have to smuggle it in.

612
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,439
 Just because ofthat Steve.
 He's a right fascist.

613
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,599
 TOM: That's your boss, isn't it?
 - Yeah, my boss.

614
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,159
 My supervisor.

615
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,159
 - ls he still there?
 KEN: Oh, yeah.

616
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,399
 He's only been with us three...

 Bloody graduate.

618
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,759
 - You're a graduate.
 - We're all graduates, aren't we?

619
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,279
 - Oh, yeah, so we are!
 GERRl: You forgot.

620
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,999
 Would you like some salad, Ken?

621
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 - No, no. l'm all right, ta.
 GERRl: Sure?

622
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,040
 l mean, you spend nearly 40 years trying to get
 people out ofthe dole queue and into jobs.

623
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,399
 What thanks do you get? l'm sick of it!

624
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,279
 At your age, you can walk away, can't you?

625
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,119
 Hm. l don't know.

626
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,120
 You've got a good retirement package.
 lndex linked pension.

628
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,959
 - lt's not that easy, is it?
 - lsn't it?

629
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
 What would you do with your time
 if you retired, Ken?

630
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,439
 Pub.

631
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,440
 Eat, drink, be merry.

632
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,440
 l don't know.

633
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,839
 How's Joe?

634
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,199
 - He's fine. You'll see him on Sunday.
 TOM: He's well.

635
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,519
 Oh, great. Has he got a girlfriend?

636
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,519
 GERRl: No, l don't think so.
 TOM: Not that we know of.

637
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,199
 Who else is coming to the barbeque?

638
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,599
 Jack and Janey.

639
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,399

640
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,959

 - Oh, Mary.

641
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,199
 ls she?

642
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,119
 Then, of course, there's yourself, sir.
 The guest of honour.

643
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,399
 Hooray!

644
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
 l don't know about that.

645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,359
 TOM:
 What else you been up to?

646
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,839
 Oh, nothing much.

647
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,999
 Mm! Oh, no, hey.

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,919
 Guess where l went the other week.

649
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,719
 - Where?
 - Hull versus Derby.

650
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,479
 - Ho, ho, ho! Who'd you cheer for?
 - Derby, of course.

651
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,119
 l had to keep quiet,
 l got stuck with the home mob.

652
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,120
 - Was there owt worth cheering?
 - No, it were crap.

653
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,719
 l don't think my brother
 ever missed one home game.

654
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 No. Me and my dad used to stand
 with him on the terraces.

655
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,400
 You used to leave Carl at your mum's
 on a Saturday afternoon. Remember?

656
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,039
 Oh, yeah.

657
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,519
 You could hear the roar ofthe crowd
 from the front room.

658
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,639
 Of course you could.
 lt was three streets away.

659
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,119
 Our house used to shake.

660
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,439
 TOM:
 Ours did. They all did.

661
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,440
 During the Clough glory years, we were
 at the centre ofthe footballing universe.

662
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,759
 - You never went.
 - l did occasionally.

663
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,760
 l wasn't manic, like him.

664
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
 l don't think Ronnie can afford to go now,
 the price of season tickets.

665
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,999
 How is Ronnie?
 l haven't seen him for years.

666
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,999
 - He's 70 now, you know.
 KEN: ls he?

667
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,759
 - Carl's 41 .
 KEN: Bloody hell.

668
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,760
 - Linda's still working.
 GERRl: She's kept him all his life.

669
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,959
 - She's worn out, poor woman.
 KEN: ls Carl the same?

670
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,679
 As far as we know.

671
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,359
 Very sad.

672
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,999
 Linda's heartbroken.

673
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,479
 TOM: So's Ronnie.
 - He's cut himself off.

674
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,039
 l used to have a drink with Ronnie.

675
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,040
 When my dad was in the home, l'd
 go to Derby, he was always in the pub.

676
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,159
 Yep, that's one ofthe advantages

677
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
 of being free from the tyranny
 of regular employment.

678
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,439
 - He never bought a round.
 - Are you accusing my brother

679
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,559
 - of being a mean bastard?
 - Yeah, l am.

680
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,439
 - You're right, he is.
 - l know.

681
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,440
 Mm.

682
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,680
 l mean, l...

683
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,040
 You get to a certain age...
 l can't go to the places l used to.

684
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,999
 They don't like old fogies.

685
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,039
 - You don't have to go.
 KEN: They're my pubs.

686
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,399
 Not any more, they're not.

687
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,119
 Except they're not like pubs now,
 they're all poncy bars.

688
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,279
 TOM:
 Exactly, things change.

689
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,280
 When l started at work,
 we'd all socialise together.

690
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,480
 On a Friday night, everybody would go
 to the pub for a drink, go for a curry.

691
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,079
 But now...

692
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,080
 lt's hard, isn't it?

693
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,880
 l mean, who would l go on holiday with?

694
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,120
 There's nobody, let's face it.

695
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,400
 The only time l went on holiday
 was with Pam.

696
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,839
 Spain. Nightmare.

697
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,359
 Didn't you go away with Andrea?

698
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,719
 No, she went offwith her sister.
 You remember?

699
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,079
 Oh, yeah.

700
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,679
 Stood me up, the bitch.

701
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,680
 TOM:
 lt leaves a nasty taste, doesn't it?

702
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,560
 Girls in bikinis covered with suntan oil.

703
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,840
 Boys flexing their muscles on the beach.
 No, it's not for me.

704
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,479
 Oh, l don't know.

705
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,319
 Sounds nice.

706
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,320
 - (laughs)
 - You could try a cultural holiday.

707
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,079
 No, l'm not one for culture.

708
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,679
 Pub culture.

709
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
 Young people, young people.
 Everything's for young people.

710
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,120
 These bars, you know, they're full of
 young people shouting about nothing.

711
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,919
 l seem to remember you got banned
 from a number of pubs in Hull

712
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,719
 for shouting about nothing,

713
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,519
 when you were a young person.

714
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,759
 Right.

715
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,559
 (laughs)

716
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,399
 ''Ken, we like you.

717
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,559
 You're a good bloke,
 you're good on the darts,

718
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,560
 but if you talk about politics again,
 you're barred.''

719
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,480
 No, but these kids,
 they're just bloody noisy.

720
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,919
 lsle of Wight Festival, 1 968.

721
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,039
 We were noisy, weren't we?

722
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,199
 - We weren't, he was.
 - You were noisy.

723
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,200
 - You were noisy.
 - l know l was noisy.

724
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,399
 Remember Plastic Penny?

725
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,559
 Plastic Penny.

726
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
 - Where are they now?
 - You fancied Plastic Penny.

727
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
 lt's the young person's prerogative to be noisy.

728
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,199
 Yeah, l know, l know.
 lt's all my own fault.

729
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
 l'm not meeting the right people.
 l'm stuck in a rut.

730
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,279
 lt's not your fault, Ken.

731
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,279
 You are stuck in a rut.
 That's why you can't face retirement.

732
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,280
 KEN:
 Yeah, l know.

733
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,919
 l'm dreading getting on that train
 Sunday night. l always do.

734
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
 - Why?
 - l know what l'll be thinking.

735
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,679
 There's nothing for me in Hull any more.

736
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,479
 Except my job.

737
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,439
 Most of my friends have gone.

738
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,919
 Hit you hard when Gordon died, didn't it?

739
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,159
 And his wife.

740
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,879
 ls she gone?

741
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,999
 Yes.

742
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 KEN:
 Oh, yeah, they're both gone now.

743
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,680
 Funnily enough, l was thinking about him
 on the way down.

744
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
 l looked out the windows
 when we were in Lincolnshire,

745
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,800
 l saw this fucking tree.

746
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,160
 lt rem...

747
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,799
 lt reminded me of his funeral.

748
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,159
 (sobs)

749
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,160
 Oh, Ken.

750
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,639
 Ken.

751
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,199
 Ken.

752
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,919
 Come on.

753
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,239
 (sobs) Gerri, l'm sorry.

754
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,240
 lt's all right.

755
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,880
 l'm sorry, Tom.

756
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,039
 How you doing?

757
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,279
 - l feel like shit.
 - You look like shit.

758
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,039
 l know.

759
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,719
 - Apart from that, how are you doing?
 - l still feel like shit.

760
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,720
 (laughs)

761
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,559
 l'll race you to the top.

762
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,799
 - What?
 - Snake Pass, l'll race you.

763
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,479
 Oh, yeah.

764
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,399
 When was the last time you sat on a bike?

765
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,839
 1 896, penny-farthing.

766
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,840
 (laughs)

767
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,399
 l tell you what.

768
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
 You and me, we'll walk from Edale
 to Matlock Bath.

769
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,279
 Take as long as it takes.

770
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,239
 Stay in nice pubs along the way.
 What do you reckon?

771
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,759
 l'll tell you what.

772
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,559
 l'll stay in the pubs, you do the walking.

773
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,399
 Bugger that, you're carrying the bags.

774
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,400
 (chuckles)

775
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,440
 How about it?

776
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,560
 Serious, we'll go in the autumn.

777
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,560
 What are we going to do with you, then,
 eh?

778
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,800
 You can't go on like this, that's for sure.

779
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,319
 So, is it every man for himself
 or are we having teams?

780
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,479
 Teams.

781
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,480
 lf l might make so bold, l would suggest
 that the best plays with the worst, Jack.

782
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,679
 - Good idea.
 - ln other words, you're with Ken.

783
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,359
 - Thanks.
 - lt's me and you, Ken.

784
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,239
 - ls there anything on it?
 - Bottle ofwine.

785
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,479
 You're on.

786
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,279
 - Are you ready?
 - Yeah. Yeah, go on.

787
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,879
 - lt's you!
 - Ah, right!

788
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,759
 - Shall l kick off?
 - You take the honour.

789
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,719
 So, this father and son team.

790
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,720
 - The double Hepple.
 - Yes, take on these unknown mavericks.

791
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,519
 - That's us, Ken.
 - Good luck, Tom.

792
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,239
 And good luck to you, Mo.

793
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,240
 Can l just say what a great pleasure it is
 to be playing with you once again?

794
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,119
 Yep, yeah. Watch and learn, Ken.

795
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,759
 There's wine on it.

796
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,399
 Right.

797
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,400
 Offwe go.

798
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,879
 - At-choo!
 - l knew it!

799
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,119
 - l knew you were going to do that!
 - Ha, ha, ha!

800
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,959
 All my life l've had to put up
 with this nonsense from you

801
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,960
 and l'm not going to have it any longer!

802
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,239
 JOE:
 Don't scare the wildlife, Ken.

803
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,319
 TOM:
 How many times a night do you go?

804
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,279
 l lose count.

805
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,439
 JACK:
 You gotta get it sorted out, Ken.

806
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,440
 TOM:
 Yeah.

807
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,359
 - Oh, what a beauty.
 - Lovely.

808
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,839
 Good shot, partner?

809
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840
 - Oh, sorry. Good shot, Jack.
 - Thank you.

810
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,599
 - Are you all right?
 - Yeah.

811
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,399
 - You want it out, Joe?
 - Yep.

812
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,039
 TOM:
 Good luck, partner.

813
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,040
 JOE:
 lt's all down to this.

814
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,720
 (Ken coughs)

815
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,359
 JOE:
 Looks good.

816
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,199
 ALL:
 Oh!

817
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,479
 TOM:
 Ho, ho, ho, ho!

818
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,480
 TOM: My partner.
 JOE: Oh, yes.

819
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,120
 (knocks on door)

820
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,919
 Gerri!

821
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,479
 - Tom!
 - Here she is.

822
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,519
 - Hello, Mary.
 - Sorry l'm so late.

823
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,199
 - What happened?
 - lt's taken me three hours to get here.

824
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,200
 l left home at two. l had to ask
 a policeman in the end, l got so lost.

825
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,959
 - You got lost?
 - Yeah, l'm really sorry.

826
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,799
 - You've been here loads oftimes.
 - l know.

827
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,199
 - You know the way.
 - Yeah, but l came in my car, Gerri.

828
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,639
 - Oh, God!
 - What's happened?

829
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,399
 Oh, l'm so stupid.
 Why do l always spoil everything?

830
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,839
 - l wanted it to be a surprise.
 - You've bought a car?

831
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,359
 - Yeah!
 - God help us.

832
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,759
 l got it ever so cheap.
 l was really chuffed with myself

833
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,760
 because they wanted 700,
 but l offered 600, but we settled at 650.

834
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,719
 They were a nice couple of guys.
 l think they were brothers.

835
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,519
 - One ofthem had a gold tooth.
 - Did he?

836
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,319
 Yeah. But, they wanted cash.

837
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,320
 So l had to go to the cash point on
 Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.

838
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,879
 So, l couldn't collect it till after work on Friday.

839
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,599
 But they rang on Friday morning

840
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,039
 to find out what time l was going
 to go round with the money.

841
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,040
 And had l sorted out the insurance?
 Well, that hadn't even crossed my mind!

842
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,400
 So, l spent the whole of my lunch break
 on Friday sorting that out

843
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,760
 and it was really expensive
 because l haven't driven since 1 984.

844
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,280
 But l didn't tell you on Thursday, Gerri,
 because l knew l was coming here today

845
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,359
 and l wanted to surprise you all.

846
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,319
 lt is a surprise.
 Shall l take that from you?

847
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,959
 - Yeah, thanks, Tom.
 - Thank you.

848
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,639
 Oh, Tom, sorry.

849
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,519
 - Can l have a little glass, please?
 - Sure?

850
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,279
 You shouldn't drive if you're drinking.

851
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,280
 l know, Gerri, but you're allowed
 a couple of glasses, aren't you, Tanya?

852
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,679
 - Small ones.
 - Yeah, yeah. ls that all right, Tom?

853
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,159
 Yeah.

854
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,799
 - Hi, Gerri.
 - Hi.

855
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,559
 - l'm really sorry.
 - Oh, don't be daft.

856
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,279
 - Hi, Tanya.
 - Hello.

857
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,439
 Oh, we really miss you at work,
 don't we, Gerri?

858
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,079
 - Sweetheart.
 - When are you back off maternity leave?

859
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,799
 - Give us a chance. (laughs)
 - Oh, yeah.

860
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,359
 - Hi, Joe.
 - Hi.

861
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,879
 - Oh, it's really lovely to see you.
 - You too.

862
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,719
 - Hi, Ken. Are you all right?
 - Yeah.

863
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,959
 - Come and sit down, Mary.
 - Have a seat, Mary.

864
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,879
 - ls anyone sitting here?
 - No.

865
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,679
 - No.
 - Oh, this is lovely. Hiya, Jack.

866
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,679
 l thought you were going to miss me out, Mary.

867
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,319
 Oh, sorry. Where's Janey?

868
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,399
 She's a bit under the weather
 this afternoon.

869
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,559
 Oh, sorry to hear that. Oh, l'm starving.

870
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,399
 Oh, the baby!

871
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,719
 - Oh, yeah, the baby.
 - l'm sorry, Tanya.

872
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,799
 - That's all right.
 - Oh, hello, little lsaac.

873
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,879
 Say hello. Don't mind the funny lady.

874
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,679
 Oh, l'm sorry, l didn't recognise him.

875
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,359
 Oh, he's asleep.

876
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,199
 Oh, hasn't he grown?
 He's got ever so big.

877
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,919
 - They do that.
 - Here you are.

878
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,920
 - Oh, thanks, Tom.
 - l'll give him to you.

879
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,840
 - Where do you want him?
 - Oh, that's better.

880
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,879
 Are you OK?

881
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,399
 We've saved you some food, Mary.

882
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,119
 - l hope it's still warm.
 - Oh, thanks, Gerri. That will be fine.

883
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,119
 - l'll do you some fresh, if you like.
 - Oh, no, don't worry about me.

884
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,519
 - So you didn't get arrested, Mary?
 - No, l didn't, Joe.

885
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,159
 He was very kind to me, actually.

886
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,160
 What CC is your car?

887
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,999
 - What do you mean?
 - How big's the engine?

888
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 Oh, l don't know.

889
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,359
 lt's about this big, l think.

890
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,360
 (laughter)

891
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,319
 - What's so funny?
 GERRl: Don't be cruel.

892
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,239
 TOM: He means, how powerful is it, Mary?
 How many cubic centimetres?

893
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,799
 - Oh.
 - You should know that.

894
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,079
 On the back there's numbers,
 like 1 .6 or 1 .9.

895
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,039
 Oh, yeah, l know, yeah.
 Well, that's boys' stuff, isn't it?

896
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,039
 - lt's not important.
 - No, Tanya.

897
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,679
 l think l'm gonna have a cigarette
 before l eat this.

898
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,159
 - l'll get out your way.
 - Shall we take lsaac over there?

899
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,160
 Oh, well, l thought you wouldn't mind
 cos we're outside.

900
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,399
 - We don't, Mary. You carry on.
 - You're all right.

901
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,879
 - You're all right.
 TANYA: lt's OK. l fancy a swing.

902
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,559
 (laughs)

903
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,560
 - Have one ofthese, Mary.
 - lt's all right. l've got my own, thank you.

904
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,160
 - Here.
 - Oh...

905
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,879
 Thanks.

906
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
 l'll have a smoke with you.

907
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,239
 Well, l don't really smoke, normally.

908
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,240
 l just have the occasional one or two.

909
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,399
 How are you doing?

910
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,400
 Yeah, l'm really well, thanks, Ken.

911
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,999
 Still on your own, are you?

912
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,319
 Yeah, l am and l like it like that, you know.

913
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,320
 You're like me.

914
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,199
 He's good.

915
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,959
 He's great.

916
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,919
 - He's a hungry bugger.
 - ls he?

917
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,479
 Just like his dad.

918
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,079
 ls he a good dad?

919
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,039
 Yeah.

920
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,759
 ls he a nappy changer?

921
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,039
 lsh.

922
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,959
 l expect you're too capable.

923
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,679
 - Oh, l am.
 - Like Gerri was.

924
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,279
 Like Gerri was what?

925
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,280
 - Mind your own business.
 - We're talking about you, not to you.

926
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,600
 Hey, thanks for popping round on Friday.
 Janey really appreciated it.

927
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,239
 - How is she?
 - Not good.

928
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,239
 No.

929
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,240
 lt's exhausting all the time, just getting up
 and down the stairs, knocks her out.

930
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,439
 l noticed.

931
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,440
 She could do with losing a few pounds,
 but she's not getting any exercise, so...

932
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,279
 - How are you doing?
 - Oh, l'm all right.

933
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,239
 We stay cheerful, you know?
 We don't let things get us down.

934
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,240
 That's the spirit.

935
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
 No, it's all right, Ken. l can pour my own wine,
 thank you very much.

936
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,239
 Sorry.

937
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,159
 Look at the food in this fridge.

938
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,039
 l haven't got anything in mine.

939
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,040
 l'll see you later, all right?

940
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,519
 Here she comes.

941
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,759
 - Can l come in the middle?
 - Of course you can.

942
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,760
 Never come between a mother and her son.

943
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,079
 Oh, this is my second one, Gerri.

944
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,239
 - Are you sure?
 - Yeah, and then that's it.

945
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,239
 This could be the making of you, Mary.

946
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,279
 Yeah.

947
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,839
 l think so, Gerri.

948
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,840
 l mean, just driving here today,
 l felt like a whole person.

949
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,439
 - Did you?
 - Yeah, a free spirit.

950
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,440
 l mean, even though the journey
 was a complete nightmare,

951
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,680
 from beginning to end - it was awful,
 people were getting so cross with me.

952
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,639
 lt's a lovely little car.

953
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,719
 l want you to come out and see it later.

954
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,720
 l feel really good behind the wheel,
 really special.

955
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
 - You looked so lovely holding that baby.
 - He's delightful.

956
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,520
 l expect you're looking forward
 to being a grandmother.

957
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,319
 Hm, you should ask my son about that.

958
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,079
 lt's got nothing to do with me.

959
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,679
 He's great, isn't he?

960
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,680
 You should come out and have a drink
 with us sometime, me and your mum.

961
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,719
 Yeah?

962
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,519
 - Yeah, why not? We often go, don't we?
 - Occasionally, yes.

963
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,519
 - Yeah, l know you do.
 - lt doesn't even have to be your mum.

964
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,519
 - lt could be just us.
 - Just you and me?

965
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,520
 Yeah, well, we've known each other a while,
 haven't we? We're old friends.

966
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,919
 Could you get me a refill, Joe?

967
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,920
 - Yes, Mummy.
 - Thank you.

968
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,319
 - Are you all right?
 - Yeah.

969
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,320
 - Can l get you a drink?
 - Got one somewhere.

970
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,520
 Oh, here comes Ken.

971
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,360
 - Everything all right?
 - Yes.

972
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 - He's a good lad.
 - Yes.

973
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,879
 He could be quite good-looking,
 if he wanted to.

974
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,359
 How's it going?

975
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,919
 He's got a nice clean bum.

976
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,920
 MARY: He should lose a couple of
 stone, shouldn't he?

977
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,519
 He was a good-looking man
 when he was young.

978
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,399
 - Was he?
 - Mm.

979
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,400
 He's got a good heart.

980
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,239
 Life's not always kind, is it?

981
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,240
 No, it isn't, Gerri.

982
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,040
 (low chatter)

983
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,280
 l don't mind the grey hair.

984
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,880
 l think that can look quite distinguished
 on a man of his age, but...

985
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,920
 You know.

986
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,880
 - l'll give you a ring in the week.
 - We'll have a proper game next time.

987
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,080
 - Ta-ta.
 - See you.

988
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,079
 Hi, Joe.

989
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,359
 Hi.

990
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,319
 - Have you come back to me?
 - l have.

991
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,599
 - They all come back in the end.
 - Do they?

992
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,359
 - ln my nightmares.
 - Oh, it's as bad as that, is it?

993
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,479
 Oh, let's not open that can ofworms.

994
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,480
 - No, let's leave that closed.
 - Not today, anyway.

995
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,199
 Oh, how are you, Joe?

996
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,200
 - ls life treating you kind?
 - Can't complain.

997
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,759
 - Really?
 - Yes.

998
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,679
 Nothing you want to share with me?

999
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,159
 No, l don't think so.

1000
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,879
 Because you know that you can talk to me.

1001
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,599
 Any time you like.

1002
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,479
 Well, l'll come and find you if l need you.

1003
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,639
 Yeah. Yeah.

1004
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,640
 l like to feel that l'm always there for you.

1005
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,599
 Thanks, Mary.

1006
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,600
 How are you?

1007
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,479
 Yeah, l'm all right.

1008
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,039
 No, l'm great, actually.

1009
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,999
 - Well, you look well.
 - Do l?

1010
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,279
 Oh, thank you.

1011
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,759
 l suddenly feel...

1012
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,199
 really liberated.

1013
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,639
 - Well, you're a free spirit now.
 - l know.

1014
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,640
 You're your own woman.
 The world's your oyster.

1015
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,599
 lt's so exciting, isn't it?

1016
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
 l feel like Thelma and Louise.

1017
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,760
 This little car is going to change my life.

1018
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,279
 Well, let's hope so.

1019
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,280
 l do feel a bit guilty, though,
 but at the end ofthe day...

1020
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,439
 ..so what?

1021
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,199
 lt's my little present to me.

1022
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,679
 - That's fair enough.
 - Yeah.

1023
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,680
 Because if l don't treat myself,
 nobody else is going to, are they?

1024
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,079
 What are you going to call this car?

1025
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,759
 Ooh, l don't know.
 Why? Do you give names to things?

1026
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,079
 - l've got names for everything.
 - Really?

1027
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,639
 - Like what?
 - Well, my nose is called Roger.

1028
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,399
 - Oh, you mean...
 - (giggles)

1029
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,959
 ..your body parts!

1030
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,960
 Yeah, l'm not going to introduce you
 to everyone though.

1031
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,439
 What, not even little Percy?

1032
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,440
 You've already met my knee, then?

1033
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,199
 Oh, Joe, we must go out
 and have a drink one night.

1034
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,159
 - We have such a laugh.
 - Yeah, we do.

1035
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,160
 You see, the thing about you and me is
 that we've always just sort of clicked.

1036
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,399
 - Haven't we?
 - Yeah.

1037
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,400
 Yeah.

1038
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,040
 lt's nice when that happens, isn't it?

1039
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,759
 Do you remember
 when you showed me your little box?

1040
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,519
 Yes.

1041
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,279
 You wouldn't tell me what was in it.

1042
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,879
 l'm still not going to tell you.

1043
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,079
 l know.

1044
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,439
 What?

1045
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,399
 l'm not telling you.

1046
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,999
 l still think about that.

1047
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 We had a barbeque that day, didn't we?

1048
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,999
 Oh! lt still smells the same.

1049
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,599
 lt's messy, isn't it?

1050
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,600
 Your kids will enjoy playing in here, won't they?

1051
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,640
 One day.

1052
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,199
 So, is there anyone special in your life
 at the moment, Joe?

1053
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,439
 - No.
 - Oh, good.

1054
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,440
 No, what l mean is, that's all right.
 You're comfortable with that.

1055
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,799
 - Aren't you?
 - Am l?

1056
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,800
 Well, the thing is, Joe, you're young.
 You still want to be out there, don't you?

1057
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,839
 What, sowing my wild oats?

1058
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,199
 Well, yeah.

1059
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,200
 Live life while you can.
 Don't think about tomorrow.

1060
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,839
 Well, a lot of my friends
 are getting married.

1061
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,840
 Oh, but, yeah,
 you wanna be careful, Joe, because...

1062
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,920
 See, l got married in my 20s
 and, granted he was the wrong man,

1063
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,999
 but l was too young.

1064
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,679
 l couldn't handle it.

1065
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,680
 But when l was in my 30s,
 l met the right man and l was mature.

1066
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,080
 l was ready for it.

1067
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,400
 l mean, he left me, but...

1068
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,840
 What can you do?

1069
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,639
 lt's never too late, Mary.

1070
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,599
 Oh, no, l know it isn't, Joe,

1071
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
 and, you know me, l'm very much
 a glass-half-full kind of girl.

1072
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,799
 But it's tricky, because...

1073
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,800
 l meet these older men,
 who want somebody younger,

1074
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,920
 and that's great, because l fit the bill.

1075
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,559
 But...

1076
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,560
 when they find out that...

1077
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,319
 ..you know, l'm not as young
 as they thought...

1078
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,320
 they don't want to know.

1079
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,880
 My looks work against me.

1080
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,040
 How old do you think l look, Joe?

1081
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,719
 60?

1082
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,919
 70?

1083
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,920
 Oh, stop it.

1084
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,319
 Oh, it's all right.
 You don't have to answer that.

1085
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,479
 So, when are we going to have this drink?

1086
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,639
 l don't know. l'll have to check my diary.

1087
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,559
 - Yeah. You do that. Give me a call.
 - l will.

1088
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,560
 - Promise.
 - l promise.

1089
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,320
 Mate, got to get your train. We should get
 cracking. l'll run you to the station.

1090
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,759
 You've had too much to drink, Tom.

1091
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,439
 - No, l haven't.
 - l think you have.

1092
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,519
 - l'm all right.
 - We can get him a mini cab.

1093
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,479
 - No, l'll be fine on the tube.
 - You don't want to get a mini cab.

1094
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,159
 lt might take 20 minutes to turn up.
 We haven't got time.

1095
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,439
 l had a really bad experience
 in a mini cab once.

1096
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,879
 - You're going on the tube, aren't you?
 - Of course.

1097
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,880
 Don't go on the tube, Joe. l can give you a lift.
 You can be my navigator.

1098
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,519
 - Ooh, that sounds fun.
 - Yeah.

1099
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,039
 You can give them both a lift.
 All in the same direction.

1100
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,040
 - l'm not sure Mary can manage that.
 - Of course l can. Oh, l don't know.

1101
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,599
 - l'll be fine on the tube, honest.
 - lt's a great idea.

1102
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,600
 - l don't know how to get to King's Cross.
 - l do. We can all go together.

1103
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,639
 - Great. ls that all right with you, Mary?
 - Yeah, of course it is.

1104
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,239
 lt'll be good practice for me.

1105
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,679
 l'm going to run upstairs
 before we go on the journey.

1106
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,279
 l'm not sure about this.

1107
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,719
 lt'll be fine.

1108
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,279
 Better pack my bag.

1109
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
 - Tom.
 - What?

1110
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,439
 What do you think, Tom?

1111
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,759
 Well, it's small and red.
 lt's what you asked for.

1112
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,279
 JOE: What have you done, Mary?
 - lt's great, isn't it?

1113
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,239
 - Nice bit of parking, Mary.
 - Oh.

1114
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,799
 Oh, God, l didn't lock it.

1115
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,800
 lt's a good job it didn't get pinched, isn't it?

1116
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,879
 By the way, Mary, it's a 1 .4.

1117
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,879
 Oh.

1118
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,880
 You must come again.
 Now you don't know the way.

1119
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,240
 Oi, where are you going?

1120
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,119
 Oh, God, Joe.

1121
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,479
 - What am l going to do without you?
 - You'll be fine.

1122
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,679
 Can't you stay just till we get to King's Cross?

1123
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,680
 - We'll be all right, Mary.
 - Ken! You don't even know London.

1124
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,639
 lt'll be signposted.

1125
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,640
 lt's so lovely having you next to me, Joe,
 telling me where to go and what to do.

1126
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,639
 lt's been a pleasure, Mary.

1127
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,559
 Oh, please, l'll take you anywhere you want.
 l'll take you home.

1128
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,039
 Just here will do.

1129
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,040
 Oh, God. All right. Let me pull in.

1130
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,079
 Oh, bye, then. But lovely to see you.

1131
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,159
 - Don't forget to give me a ring.
 - No, l won't.

1132
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,519
 - Bye, Joe.
 - Yeah, take care.

1133
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,319
 - See you soon.
 - Look after yourself.

1134
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,239
 - Oh, Joe, where do l go?
 - Straight ahead.

1135
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,279
 - Left round the one-way system.
 - Yeah. OK.

1136
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,839
 - Bye, then. Bye.
 - Yeah.

1137
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,719
 - l'll get in the front now.
 - Oh, no, Ken.

1138
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,319
 We haven't got time for this.

1139
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,320
 Oh, for God's sake.

1140
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,440
 Oh! No need to slam the door.

1141
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,759
 - You better hurry up.
 - Yeah, l'll run.

1142
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,479
 Yeah, l'll see you soon, then.

1143
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,039
 - Goodbye, Mary.
 - Bye.

1144
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,279
 Bye, Ken.

1145
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,119
 - l like you, Mary. Can l phone you?
 - No, Ken. No.

1146
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,120
 - l could come down and see you.
 - Take your hand off of me, please, Ken!

1147
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,279
 Sorry.

1148
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,039
 l'm going to have to be honest with you.

1149
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,040
 l just don't have those kind offeelings
 for you, Ken. l'm really sorry.

1150
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,320
 Right.

1151
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,039
 Oh!

1152
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,039
 Sorry, l got carried away.
 l didn't mean to.

1153
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,599
 lt's all right. Hurry up.
 Your train is going in a minute.

1154
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,600
 - Thanks for the lift.
 - Yeah, all right. Bye.

1155
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,440
 God Almighty!

1156
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,920
 - l'll put the kettle on.
 - The sooner the better.

1157
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,519
 - Ohh!
 - Ohh!

1158
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,919
 What are you doing here, you daft bugger?

1159
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,479
 l've come to surprise you.

1160
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,479
 Joe!

1161
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,199
 - You certainly did that.
 - lt's lovely to see you.

1162
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,159
 Ohh!

1163
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,199
 Hello!

1164
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,159
 Sorry. He made me hide behind the door.

1165
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,799
 - You frightened the life out of me.
 - So, who's this, then?

1166
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,479
 - Mum, Dad, this is Katie.
 - Hello.

1167
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,480
 - This is Tom and Gerri.
 - Tom and Gerri? That's brilliant!

1168
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,039
 Yeah, well...

1169
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,279
 We've learnt to live with it over the years.

1170
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,239
 - So, what's your name again?
 - Katie.

1171
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,239
 Katie.

1172
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,359
 - So have you been at the allotment?
 - Yes.

1173
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,759
 Gathering the last ofthe season's harvest.

1174
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,919
 We've brought back some lovely tomatoes.

1175
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,679
 - Yeah.
 - Sounds gorgeous.

1176
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,599
 - We were going to have a sandwich.
 - Are you both hungry?

1177
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,359
 - l'm starving.
 - She's starving.

1178
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,359
 - l'll just go and change.
 - Let me get out ofthis filthy clobber.

1179
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,360
 - You go on through, Joe.
 - All right.

1180
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,239
 KATlE:
 This is a lovely big kitchen, isn't it?

1181
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,199
 - lt's gigantic.
 - Shut up!

1182
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,039
 - Thank you for the flowers, Katie.
 - Glad you like them.

1183
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,919
 - They're lovely.
 - They're all right.

1184
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,879
 - Sit yourself down.
 - Thank you.

1185
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,880
 - So how did you two meet?
 - Our eyes met across a crowded bar.

1186
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,039
 We'd both been stood up by our dates.

1187
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,959
 - Ah, the bonding ofthe jilted.
 - Something like that.

1188
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,559
 - Pretty much.
 - When was this?

1189
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,079
 - Oh, about three months ago, wasn't it?
 - Yeah.

1190
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,359
 - You never told us.
 - Master of discretion.

1191
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,919
 - l didn't know he had it in him.
 - My enigmatic son.

1192
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,879
 - You know me.
 - Must be important.

1193
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,880
 - Oh, he's a dark horse.
 - l wanted to keep you a secret.

1194
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,920
 - You son's a weirdo!
 - Yes, we know. He's having treatment.

1195
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,879
 Help yourself. Tuck in.

1196
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,719
 - Whatever you want.
 - Thank you.

1197
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,599
 - My mum and dad know all about you.
 - Do they now?

1198
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,879
 - And what do they do, Katie?
 - Oh, my dad's a postman

1199
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,599
 and my mum works
 on a make-up counter.

1200
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,239
 - Oh, yeah?
 - What do you work at?

1201
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,119
 - l'm an occupational therapist.
 - Oh, are you? Where do you work?

1202
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,199
 - At the Royal Free.
 - That's a great hospital.

1203
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,599
 - lt's pretty good.
 - Do you specialise?

1204
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,039
 Yeah. Care ofthe elderly
 and stroke rehab.

1205
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,999
 What's straight rehab?

1206
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,479
 Stroke rehab.

1207
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,039
 You are going deaf.

1208
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,959
 Oh, stroke rehab.
 l thought you said straight rehab.

1209
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,519
 What's straight rehab?

1210
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,919
 What, for gay men who are on the turn?

1211
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,920
 Or straight men, who tried being gay,
 but want to be rehabilitated into straight.

1212
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,920
 - Joe tells me you're a counsellor, Gerri.
 - Yes, l am, for my sins.

1213
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,360
 But it's great to come home and feel like
 you've made a contribution, isn't it?

1214
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,799
 Yes, of course.

1215
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,519
 Or not, as the case may be.

1216
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,399
 Oh, l'm sure you contribute.

1217
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,159
 Not me. l'm talking about you lot
 in the caring professions.

1218
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,719
 - l don't care.
 - We know.

1219
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,959
 Hard man.

1220
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,960
 And l know you're a geologist, Tom,
 but what exactly do you do?

1221
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,480
 Ah, yes. Strictly speaking, l'm actually
 an engineering geologist.

1222
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,639
 - Which means that l...
 - He digs holes.

1223
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,679
 - l investigate...
 - You dig holes.

1224
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,119
 All right. l dig holes.

1225
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,799
 That's just calling a spade a spade,
 isn't it?

1226
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,319
 - l always call it a shovel.
 - You call it a fork.

1227
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,320
 l call it a trailer-mounted-tripod
 cable-percussive boring unit.

1228
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,999
 And that's why l love him.

1229
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,119
 No, l investigate
 the ground beneath our feet

1230
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,120
 to test the feasibility of various
 engineering and building projects.

1231
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,919
 lt sounds amazing. What are you
 working on at the moment?

1232
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,920
 Ah, yes. Well, right now, the main project
 is an eight-metre-diameter tunnel,

1233
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,760
 which is going to alleviate the pressure
 on London's Victorian sewage system.

1234
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,559
 Blimey.

1235
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,519
 Eight metres? That's big.

1236
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,520
 Oh, yeah. And it'll follow the path
 ofthe Thames for 20 miles,

1237
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,479
 up to 80 metres underground.

1238
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,799
 And that's just for this household.

1239
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,639
 TOM:
 So, it's quite a big number.

1240
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,239
 l'm not doing it on my own.
 There's a few of us.

1241
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,919
 - lt won't be finished till after l'm dead.
 - Oh, no.

1242
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,920
 You'd better get a move on.

1243
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,039
 Help yourself.
 ls there anything you want?

1244
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,439
 - Some ham?
 - Oh, no, thanks. l'm a veggie, actually.

1245
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,719
 - Are you?
 - Mm.

1246
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,799
 This cheese is gorgeous, though.
 Thank you.

1247
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,559
 - Help yourself.
 - Thank you.

1248
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,839
 - What have you got planned later?
 - Ah, yes.

1249
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,279
 - We're having a visitation.
 - Sounds ominous.

1250
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,639
 - Mary's coming for tea.
 - Oh, l was right.

1251
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,999
 - Who's Mary?
 - She's a friend from work.

1252
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 - Oh, right.
 - Yes, she's... Yes.

1253
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,879
 She's something else.

1254
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,880
 l won't ask.

1255
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,199
 - Ta-da!
 - Oh, Joe!

1256
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,159
 How lovely to see you.

1257
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,159
 This is a surprise. How are you?

1258
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,079
 - l'm good.
 - Oh, you look great.

1259
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,080
 - So do you.
 - Oh, thank you.

1260
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,760
 Hello, Mary.
 l'm Tom. l'm his father. l live here.

1261
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,159
 Oh, Tom.

1262
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,919
 My two favourite men.

1263
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,399
 ln you go.

1264
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,319
 - You never rang me.
 - l'm sorry.

1265
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,320
 Whatever happened to that drink
 we were gonna have?

1266
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,319
 - l've got a surprise for you.
 - Oh, Joe, you shouldn't have.

1267
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,599
 - Hello.
 - Katie, this is Mary. Mary, this is Katie.

1268
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,599
 - Hello, Mary. lt's nice to meet you.
 - Oh, hi.

1269
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,999
 GERRl: This is Joe's girlfriend.
 - l like your jacket.

1270
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,879
 Your mum gave me a pot of basil. Smell that.

1271
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,959
 - She's going to make him some pesto.
 - Lovely.

1272
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,319
 - Shall l take your jacket, Mary?
 - Yeah, thanks, Tom.

1273
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,959
 - How are you, Mary?
 - Yeah, l'm really good, thanks, yeah.

1274
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,960
 - How was your journey?
 - lt was all right.

1275
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,839
 - Oh, no, it wasn't actually.
 - Didn't get lost again, did you?

1276
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,840
 Oh, no, the journey was all right.
 lt's the car.

1277
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,679
 TOM: ls it OK?
 GERRl: What happened?

1278
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,519
 - lt wouldn't start.
 - Oh, no.

1279
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,159
 Yeah, it's a nightmare.
 l had to come on the tube.

1280
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,119
 And it got broken into last night.

1281
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,079
 - Oh, sorry to hear that.
 - Oh, no.

1282
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,999
 Yeah, l did my big weekly
 supermarket shop yesterday,

1283
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,919
 which is great, l couldn't do that
 before l had the car.

1284
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,920
 l went nice and early,
 so it wouldn't be dark when l got back.

1285
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,080
 l brought three bags in, but l must have
 left the fourth one on the front seat.

1286
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,639
 l got in. l thought, that's great, that's done,

1287
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,559
 l can chill out now
 and have a nice little glass ofwine.

1288
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,599
 l had a really nice evening, actually.

1289
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,599
 Er...

1290
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,600
 But then, this morning,
 l'm in the bathroom, l'm sitting on...

1291
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,399
 Cos it's the toilet roll that l've left in the car.

1292
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,839
 So, l rush out
 and my window's been smashed.

1293
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,799
 There's glass everywhere

1294
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,999
 and all my toilet rolls have been stolen.

1295
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,319
 - lt's probably kids.
 MARY: l think you're right.

1296
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,479
 Are you insured, Mary?

1297
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,479
 - Yeah, of course l'm insured.
 - Well, that's something, isn't it?

1298
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,799
 You can't drive a car without insurance.
 lt's illegal.

1299
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,359
 l know. At least you'll be able
 to claim for your window.

1300
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,639
 l know.

1301
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,640
 Anyway, l'm... l'm sick of it. l just left it.
 lt's just a car. What does it matter?

1302
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,639
 GERRl:
 Go on. Sit yourself down, Mary.

1303
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,640
 - Put the kettle on, Tom.
 - Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

1304
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,479
 lt's given me a lot of stress, Tom.

1305
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,319
 This car's been a catalogue of disaster, hasn't
 it?

1306
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,519
 l know.

1307
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,279
 Cut your losses, Mary. Get rid of it.

1308
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,079
 But l've spent so much on it, Tom.
 l can't just sell it now.

1309
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,599
 But if you keep it,
 it's only going to get worse.

1310
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,079
 - Well, you know what l think, Mary.
 - Yeah, yeah.

1311
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,359
 l'm fed up with it, to be honest, Tom.

1312
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,279
 l've had three punctures.

1313
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,959
 - Three punctures?
 - Yeah.

1314
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,919
 My exhaust has fallen off. l had to get
 a new one. My carburettor went.

1315
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,039
 You can't take it back
 to the guys you got it from?

1316
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,040
 No. They'd guarantee the labour for three
 months, but not the parts. Bastards.

1317
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,639
 Other way round, isn't it?
 Parts for three months, not labour.

1318
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,759
 No.

1319
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,399
 Oh, yeah, that's right.

1320
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,400
 Oh, l don't know. Anyway...
 my windscreen wiper got ripped off.

1321
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,839
 l got three points for speeding, at £60 each.

1322
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,239
 So, l've got nine points on my driving licence.

1323
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,599
 - Haven't l, Gerri?
 - Yes.

1324
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,159
 lt keeps making funny noises.

1325
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,160
 l got towed away and l wasn't even
 parked on a double-yellow line.

1326
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,400
 l've got seven parking tickets...
 no, nine parking tickets.

1327
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,239
 And then...

1328
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,039
 l broke down on the motorway
 on the way to Brighton

1329
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,999
 and l got towed to Crawley,

1330
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
 which is the last place l want to go,
 because l grew up there and l hate it.

1331
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,440
 So, l had to get the train home and then
 the train back to Crawley the next day

1332
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,919
 and the guy kept trying to touch me up.

1333
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,920
 lt cost me nearly £500 and l never even
 got my weekend in Brighton.

1334
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,199
 That was supposed to be my summer holiday.

1335
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,079
 Yes.

1336
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,879
 - lt's not fair, is it?
 - No.

1337
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,559
 - Well, never mind.
 - Come and sit down, Mary. Relax.

1338
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,560
 - Yeah, thanks, Joe.
 - At least you're here now, eh?

1339
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,919
 - What did you say your name was?
 - Katie.

1340
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,239
 MARY:
 Oh.

1341
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,240
 Well, the good news is, Mary,
 l've made a cake in your honour.

1342
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,759
 Oh, thanks, Gerri.

1343
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,119
 TOM: She knew you were coming,
 so she baked a cake!

1344
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,039
 - Don't forget to give me the recipe.
 - No, l won't forget, Katie.

1345
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,319
 - You haven't tasted it yet.
 - Oh, it smells nice.

1346
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,320
 Yeah, l wouldn't mind having the recipe
 for that. l've never baked a cake before.

1347
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,319
 - Of course you can.
 - You can have a cake-off!

1348
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,039
 Oh, l don't think so.
 l tried making a fruit cake once.

1349
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,559
 Everything sank to the bottom.
 lt was horrible.

1350
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,199
 You're a good cook.

1351
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,200
 Thank you.

1352
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,680
 - What about these two, then, Mary?
 - Such a surprise.

1353
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,720
 This monster hid this young lady
 behind the sitting-room door.

1354
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,320
 - Made me jump.
 - l nearly gave poor Tom a heart attack.

1355
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,799
 She passed the test.

1356
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,800
 Surprised you passed the test.
 l'd have got rid of you on the spot.

1357
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,879
 A terrible way to treat someone.

1358
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,880
 KATlE: Yeah.
 - We had absolutely no idea.

1359
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,959
 - My big secret.
 - Oh, thanks very much.

1360
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,919
 lt's obviously serious.

1361
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,920
 Still, it's been really good to meet you both,
 though, and we had a lovely lunch.

1362
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,719
 You didn't say you were having lunch.

1363
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,720
 - We have lunch every day.
 - l know you have lunch every day, Joe.

1364
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,639
 Bread and cheese.

1365
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,279
 - Nothing special.
 - l thought it was special.

1366
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,280
 We had some tomatoes from Tom
 and Gerri's allotment. Have you tasted them?

1367
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,760
 Loads oftimes. Gerri's always giving me
 stuff, aren't you, Gerri?

1368
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,719
 - l'll give you some to take home, Mary.
 - Oh, great.

1369
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,720
 Oh, yeah, l can take them on the tube.

1370
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,919
 So, what is it you do, then, Jackie?

1371
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,519
 KATlE:
 Katie.

1372
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,520
 - Katie.
 - Don't worry. An occupational therapist.

1373
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,719
 Oh.

1374
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,720
 GERRl: She looks after stroke victims
 and the elderly.

1375
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,760
 And...l grew up just down the road
 from you, in Croydon.

1376
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,440
 - l only went to college in Croydon.
 - Oh, right. Which college?

1377
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,319
 Croydon College.

1378
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,239
 The aptly named.

1379
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,319
 So which course did you do? Secretarial?

1380
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,320
 What makes you think l'm a secretary?

1381
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,559
 Well, you are, aren't you?

1382
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,560
 - Gerri said...
 - Yes.

1383
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,839
 Well...

1384
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,999
 l got my diploma. l look after the doctors.

1385
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,479
 Oh, brilliant.

1386
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,039
 So have you two worked together
 for a long time?

1387
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,319
 Ooh, about 20 years, haven't we, Mary?

1388
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,319
 Yeah.

1389
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,279
 - Mary's known Joe since he was ten.
 - No way!

1390
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,959
 l bet you've got some embarrassing stories.

1391
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,959
 l've got some really nice stories, actually.

1392
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,799
 Joe and l have shared some really
 special moments, haven't we?

1393
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,639
 - Yes, Mary.
 - lt'll just have to be our secret, won't it?

1394
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,279
 She's almost like an auntie to him.

1395
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,639
 l wouldn't say that.

1396
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,439
 Well, we think of you as his auntie.

1397
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,879
 Auntie Mary.

1398
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,879
 l think that's really sweet.

1399
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,880
 - Right. Who wants some cake?
 - Yes, please.

1400
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,599
 Auntie Mary.

1401
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,199
 Thanks, Joe.

1402
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,759
 Thanks, Mum.

1403
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,079
 lt must be really boring looking after old people.

1404
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,719
 No, l love it.

1405
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,720
 You get to know them really well
 and, well...

1406
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,919
 ..we're all going to be old, one day,
 aren't we?

1407
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,479
 Touch wood.

1408
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,480
 TOM: Some of us already are.
 - (Katie giggles)

1409
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,359
 We look after old people, don't we, Gerri?

1410
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,360
 No, not in the same way.

1411
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,919
 Amazing cake.

1412
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,920
 Thank you, Katie.

1413
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,479
 TOM:
 Right.

1414
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,239
 We'll see you when we see you.

1415
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,639
 - Soon. Hopefully.
 - And you'll never know when.

1416
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,640
 - Probably find you hiding in the shed.
 - Or lurking in the bathroom.

1417
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,439
 - Or down the toilet.
 - Oh, nice!

1418
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,639
 - You must come to supper.
 - Yes, please.

1419
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,239
 l hear you're both excellent cooks. No pressure.

1420
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,519
 - Tom makes a mean curry.
 - Oh, l love curry.

1421
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,520
 - Well, there's been no litigation to date.
 - l'll take my chances, then.

1422
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,759
 - l'll speak to you later.
 - Bye.

1423
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,439
 - See you, boy.
 - Bye-bye. Take care.

1424
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,679
 - Thank you so much.
 - Thank you for the flowers.

1425
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,839
 - A pleasure. Lovely to meet you.
 - You, too.

1426
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,959
 Bye, Mary. Really nice to meet you.

1427
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,919
 Hope you get your car sorted out.

1428
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,519
 - Bye, Katie.
 - Bye.

1429
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,479
 TOM: Bye.
 KATlE: See you soon.

1430
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,479
 TOM: Yeah. Safe journey. Bye.
 - Bye.

1431
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,199
 (front door closes)

1432
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,959
 How about that, then?

1433
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,959
 - That's a turn-up for the books.
 - You're not kidding.

1434
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,759
 - Excuse me, l've got a bit ofwork to do.
 - All right.

1435
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,760
 l was going to bring you some flowers, Gerri.
 l just couldn't find anywhere open.

1436
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,800
 Don't be silly.

1437
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,679
 Gerri?

1438
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,959
 What?

1439
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,960
 - What do you think of her?
 - She's lovely, isn't she?

1440
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,919
 Well, l don't know.

1441
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,479
 Joe likes her.

1442
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,239
 Yeah, but, you know.

1443
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,239
 They seem to connect.

1444
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,279
 Well, he's only young, isn't he?

1445
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,280
 He's 30 years old, Mary.

1446
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,680
 No, but what l mean is,
 he doesn't want to rush into anything.

1447
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,679
 He's only known her for five minutes.

1448
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,680
 l think Joe knows what he's doing, actually.

1449
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,480
 Well, l hope so.

1450
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,759
 Don't forget your tomatoes, Mary.

1451
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,760
 No, l won't.

1452
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,080
 l should have brought a bottle ofwine.

1453
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,680
 - l might head off in a minute.
 - All right, then, Mary.

1454
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,479
 - Thank you for coming, Mary.
 - Thanks, Gerri.

1455
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,199
 - l'll see you on Tuesday.
 - Yes.

1456
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,999
 Yeah.

1457
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
 - Bye, then.
 - OK, bye.

1458
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,799
 Very sad.

1459
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,359
 Really upsetting.

1460
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,359
 Yeah.

1461
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,399
 - Are you surprised?
 - Of course l am.

1462
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,959
 No, l'm not, actually.

1463
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,959
 No.

1464
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,519
 lt's disappointing.

1465
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,520
 So, when are you inviting her round next?

1466
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,279
 Did you see this?

1467
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,280
 lt's extraordinary.

1468
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,159
 - l like whatshername.
 - Katie?

1469
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,160
 - Yeah, she's a laugh, isn't she?
 - She's lovely.

1470
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,800
 He is a dark horse, our son.

1471
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,600
 l think you'll find that we men are.

1472
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 Can you take that for me?

1473
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,920
 (clink of bottles)

1474
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,680
 Hasn't changed much, has it?

1475
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,120
 Hello, mate.

1476
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,360
 How are you, Ron?

1477
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,719
 Hi, Ronnie.

1478
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,720
 TOM: Do you recognise Joe?
 - l've grown a bit.

1479
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,919
 How are you managing, Ronnie?

1480
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,879
 l'll be glad when this is over.

1481
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,880
 - This is the hardest day.
 - Yeah.

1482
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,239
 - She was a lovely person.
 - She was.

1483
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:43,240
 Very kind.

1484
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,239
 Have you been eating
 over the weekend, Ronnie?

1485
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,839
 l had some beans.

1486
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,279
 Need a bit more than that, though, don't you?

1487
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,239
 Do you want something now?

1488
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,239
 Nah.

1489
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,199
 - Are you sure?
 - Yeah.

1490
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,200
 - We brought a load of sandwiches, Ron.
 - Some beers.

1491
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,759
 So where's Carl?

1492
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,519
 l told him when and where.

1493
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,439
 The question is, if he'll turn up.

1494
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,199
 Well, that's up to him.

1495
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,200
 He'd bloody better.

1496
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,719

1517
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,720
 but he doesn't appear
 to have turned up yet.

1518
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,640
 Right, well, we'd...best be started.

1519

 Thank you.

1524
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,680
 ''l am the resurrection and the life,''
 says the Lord.

1525
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,200
 ''Those who believe in me,
 even though they die, will live.

1526
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,400
 Everyone who lives and believes in me
 will never die.''

1527
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,840
 l am convinced that neither death,
 nor life, nor angels, nor rulers,

1528
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
 nor powers, nor things present,
 nor things to come,

01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,200
 nor height, nor depth,
 nor anything else in all creation

1530
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,640
 will be able to separate us from the love
 of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

1531
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,320
 We have entrusted our sister,
 Linda Margaret, to God's mercy,

1532
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,360
 and we now commit her body to be cremated.

1533
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,280
 Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
 dust to dust,

1534
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
 in sure and certain hope
 ofthe resurrection to eternal life,

1535
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,079
 through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1536
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,399
 who will transform our frail bodies

1537
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,400
 that they may be conformed
 to his glorious body,

1538
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,920
 who died, was buried
 and rose again for us.

1539
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,399
 To him be glory forever.

1540
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,639
 Amen.

1541
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,640
 May God give you his comfort
 and his peace, his light and his joy,

01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,479
 in this world and the next.

1543
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,479
 And the blessing of God Almighty...

 Thank you. God bless you.

1555
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,759
 Unbelievable.

1556
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,359
 Why couldn't you wait?

1557
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,239
 There's another one coming up behind us.
 You can't wait.

1558
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,919
 - They can't wait five minutes?
 - No. We asked them.

1559
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,879
 - Outrageous.
 - What happened to you?

1560
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,759
 - Motorway was fucked up.
 - Should have taken that into account.

1561
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,359
 - l did.
 - Obviously not enough.

1562
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,959
 l'll never forgive you for this.
 You know that, don't you?

1563
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,759
 - Don't blame me.
 - lt's not his fault.

1564
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,760
 l might have known
 you'd pull a stunt like this.

1565
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,879
 - Carl.
 - What?

1566
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,439
 lt's Joe.

1567
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,440
 Oh, yeah. All right?

1568
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,879
 Carl, l'm really sorry.

1569
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,199
 We're going back to the house,
 to your mum's.

1570
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,679
 lf you want to come...

1571
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,680
 - l gotta go back there, any road, so...
 - All right. We'll see you there.

1572
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,759
 Hello, l'm Tom. Ronnie's brother.

1573
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,519
 - We're going back to the house.
 - Are you friends of Linda?

1574
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,520
 How long have you worked with her?
 Are you coming back to the house?

1575
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,680
 - Good. We'll see you there.
 - Do you have transport?

1576
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,319
 Do you know the way?

1577
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,320
 We'll see you there, then.

1578
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,480
 Carl said he is going back.

1579
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,839
 When was the last time you saw Carl?

1580
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,399
 A couple of years ago.

1581
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,559
 Just turns up out ofthe blue, doesn't he?

1582
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,519
 When he can be bothered.

1583
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,519
 When did we last see him?

1584
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,959
 TOM: l can't remember.
 Five, ten years ago?

1585
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,719
 lt was the year your mum died.

1586
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,839
 - Was it?
 - Mm.

1587
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,439

 TOM:

01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,199
 Don't know.

1591
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,079
 JOE: So, hang on.
 When did he stay with us in London?

1592
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,639
 - That was in the '80s.
 - You were nine.

1593
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,599
 He always wore black, didn't he?

1594
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,599
 Mm.

1595
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,959
 lt's tragic.

1596
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,960
 He was such a lovely kid, full offun.

1597
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,880
 Was he?

1598
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,759
 Hi. Come on in.

1602
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,559
 - You find it all right?
 - Aye, aye. No problem.

1603
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,560
 - Shall l take your coat?
 - Er...no, you're all right, duck, thanks.

1604
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,919
 Shall l take your coats, ladies?

1605

 Yeah.

1608
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,879
 lt was a very nice service.

1609
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,880
 lt was, wasn't it? Simple, straightforward.

1610
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,279
 That's what you wanted, wasn't it, Ronnie?
 Nothing fancy.

1611
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,280
 No.

1612
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,799
 - Good job it didn't rain.
 - (others laugh politely)

1613
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,800
 - lt's a nice spot that, isn't it?
 - Mm.

1614
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,599
 We've seen a few offfrom there,
 haven't we?

1615
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,879
 - Aye, we have over the years.
 - Aye.

1616
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,679
 Have you worked with Linda for long?

1617
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,799
 About ten years.

1618
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,799
 How about you, Maggie?

1619
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,919
 Not as long as that, no.

1620
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,439
 She was a lovely lady.

1621
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,440
 - She was, yeah.
 - We weren't that close.

1622
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,840
 - She'll be much missed.
 - lt was such a shock.

1623
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,119
 Be a big change for you, Ronnie,

1624
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,039
 having to look after yourself.

1625
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,919
 You get used to it though, Ronnie.

1626
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,959
 - Eight years for me, now.
 - ls it?

1627
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,199

1630
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,079
 All right, Carl?

1631
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,080
 - 'Ey up, Carl.
 - Excuse me, mate.

1632

 - You got tea, beers...

1633
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,759
 ..couple of bottles ofwine.

1634
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,760
 Sort myself out, ta.

1635
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,360
 - Are you local, then, Frank?
 - Aye, aye, l'm just a few streets down.

1636
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,879
 - You know, Palmer's Street.
 - Oh, yeah.

1637
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,919
 l haven't lived in Derby for 40 years.

1638
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,599
 - How are you, Carl?
 - All right. You?

1639
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,199
 We're all fine.

1640
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,359
 This must have been
 a bit of a shock for you.

1641
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,239
 l'll say.

1642
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,319
 - Where are you living?
 - Up in Yorkshire.

1643
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,320
 - Are you working?
 - Don't need an interrogation.

1644
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,239
 There's food out here
 when you want it.

1645
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,240
 WOMAN:
 lt's all changed.

1646
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,119
 - No post for me, then?
 - No.

1647
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,959
 None from you, either.

1648
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,639
 - Eh?
 - There's none from you.

1649
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,640
 Not lost your sense of humour, then?

1650
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,799
 Who sorted all this lot out?

1651
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,479
 - We did.
 - We brought it with us.

1652
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,079
 - From London?
 - Yeah.

1653
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,999
 Nice.

1654
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,919
 You didn't get your arse in gear, Ronnie?

1655
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,239
 - He didn't need to, we offered.
 - Did you?

1656
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,240
 - Yeah.
 - lt's his responsibility, though, in't it?

1657
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,039
 Don't underestimate
 the shock he's had, Carl.

1658
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,040
 Yeah, l know.
 Very fragile, in't he, your brother?

1659
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,520
 - His wife's just died.
 - His wife.

1660
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,959
 Didn't much care for her
 when she was alive.

1661
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,519
 - Did you?
 - l beg your pardon?

1662
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,319
 - Did you care for her, Carl?
 - Tom?

01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:25,280
 Got a son.

1839
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,720
 ls he married?

1840
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:32,280
 Don't know.

1841
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,879
 You got kids?

1842
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,880
 No.

1843
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,920
 Unfortunately.

1844
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,919
 Have you got to go back soon?

1845
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,920
 Yeah. Got a few things to sort out.

1846
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,879
 l don't suppose your son will help you.

1847
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,880
 Nah.

1848
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:23,080
 l could come up and give you a hand,
 if you like.

1849
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,199
 Have you got to move?

1850
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,200
 No.

1851
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,960
 l could take a few days offwork.

1852
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:39,120
 Are you warm enough?

1853
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,879
 Oh, l'll be all right.

1854
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,880
 We'll just finish these.

1855
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,919
 Oh, do you know Ken?

1856
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,639
 Ken?

1857
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,159
 Yeah.

1858
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:02,160
 Yeah. Did he go to the funeral?

1859
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,559
 No.

1860
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,560
 He's a bit weird, isn't he?

1861
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,600
 ls he?

1862
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:23,280
 l don't really smoke.

1863
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:29,120
 l had too much to drink last night.

1864
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,799
 l had a bit of a bad day.

1865
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,800
 My car broke down.
 lt had to be towed away.

1866
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,120
 They said it wasn't worth repairing.
 They gave me 20 quid for it.

1867
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,440
 - That's not much.
 - No. What can you do with 20 quid?

1868
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,039
 l bought myself a bottle of champagne.

1869
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,719
 Yeah?

1870
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,720
 Yeah.

1871
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,760
 Did you finish it?

1872
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,359
 Yeah, l did.

1873
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,999
 Huh.

1874
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
 (Mary sniffles)

1875
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,480
 l might have to have a little bit of a lie down.

1876
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,960
 lt's really lovely
 to have someone to talk to.

1877
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,440
 Yeah.

1878
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:37,440
 lt's peaceful here.

1879
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,200
 l might move away somewhere else.

1880
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:51,160
 Start again.

1881
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:56,120
 l used to work in Majorca.

1882
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
 They'll be back soon.

1883
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,600
 Oh, yeah.

1884
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
 - There you go.
 - Thank you.

1885
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,360
 (low conversation, door opens)

1886
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,719
 (laughter)

1887
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:46,359
 - Hello, Ronnie.
 - We're back.

1888
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,359
 Hi, Gerri.

1889
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,319
 - Hello, Mary.
 - Bloody hell!

1890
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,320
 - Hi, Tom.
 - What are you doing here?

1891
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:58,160
 Well, l just thought l'd...

1892
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,440
 Just get my boots off.

1893
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,599
 - Where'd she spring from?
 - Bloody nuisance, especially today.

1894
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,600
 You're not kidding.

1895
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,319
 (sighs)

1896
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:22,320
 - Are you all right, Gerri?
 - Yes, Mary, l'm fine.

1897
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,719
 Did you drive?

1898
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,679
 Oh, no. l came on the tube.

1899
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:33,680
 Did you?

1900
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,399
 lt might have been nice
 if you'd phoned first, Mary.

1901
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,400
 Oh, l'm really sorry.

1902
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
 - Joe and Katie are coming.
 - Yeah, Ronnie said.

1903
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,560
 All righty.

1904
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:02,880
 TOM: Tea, Ronnie?
 - Yeah.

1905
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:11,640
 GERRl: Come and sit yourself down, Mary,
 and have a cup oftea.

1906
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,160
 (motor racing on TV)

1907
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:25,520
 (channels change)

1908
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,839
 How's it going?

1909
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,839
 lnexorably.

1910
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,840
 - l don't know what to do.
 - Well, if you don't, l don't.

1911
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,919
 l can't just chuck her out.

1912
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,839
 - Can't you?
 - No.

1913
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,840
 - Look at the state of her.
 - l know. Poor woman.

1914
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,679
 Joe and Katie will be all right.
 They can handle her.

1915
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,239
 l know. l've got enough food for her.

1916
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:03,240
 - That's all right, then.
 - Oh, well, here goes.

1917
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:10,480
 (approaching footsteps)

1918
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,200
 - Do you want me to give you a hand?
 - No, thank you, Mary.

1919
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,119
 Would you like to stay for a bite to eat?

1920
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,039
 No, it's OK. l don't want to be in the way.

1921
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:31,040
 You won't be. We've got plenty offood.

1922
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,759
 Are you still angry with me?

1923
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,760
 Mary, l wasn't angry with you.
 l just felt you'd let me down.

1924
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:41,680
 Oh, Gerri.

1925
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,760
 l'd never want to do that.

1926
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,279
 l'm really sorry.

1927
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,280
 Yes, and l know you apologised.

1928
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:59,200
 l miss you.

1929
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,399
 l mean, l know l see you at work,

1930
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:04,400
 but we don't seem to talk to each other
 any more.

1931
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,480
 - l feel terrible.
 - This is my family, Mary.

1932
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,719
 You've got to understand that.

1933
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,720
 (sobs):
 l do.

1934
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,440
 Oh... Come here.

1935
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,840
 (Mary sobs)

1936
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,399
 You have to take responsibility
 for your actions.

1937
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,400
 l know.

1938
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:50,680
 Now, listen, Mary.

1939
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,239
 You need to talk to somebody.

1940
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:57,239
 Oh, no, l don't want to do that.

1941
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,240
 - Well, l think it would help you.
 - l just want to talk to you.

1942
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,079
 Why don't l have a word
 with one of my colleagues?

1943
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,719
 As long as we're friends,
 then l'm all right.

1944
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:09,720
 Well, that's beside the point. You need
 independent, professional help.

1945
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:13,720
 You'd be much happier.

1946
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,759
 Let's talk about it on Tuesday.

1947
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,439
 - Yeah.
 - And you have a think.

1948
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,399
 Yeah, we could have a drink.

1949
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,400
 Why don't you help me lay the table?

1950
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,880
 He's really nice Ronnie, isn't he?

1951
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,479
 Hello. l saw you through the window.

1952
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:56,999
 - Hello.
 - Hello, how are you?

1953
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,759
 - l'm fine, how are you?
 - l'm good.

1954
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:01,639
 - Katie, lovely to see you.
 - Ahh, lovely to see you.

1955
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,159
 - How are you?
 - Fine.

1956
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,119
 (mouths):
 Mary's here.

1957
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,799
 - Hello!
 - Aha!

1958
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,199
 - We brought you some chocolates.
 - Good. Ha-ha!

1959
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,679
 - Oh, no, give them back!
 - You'll never see them again.

1960
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,799
 - Can l take your things?
 - Yeah, cheers.

1961
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,800
 (chuckles)

1962
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,799
 TOM:
 Dear, dear.

1963
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,479
 l've got the longest scarf in the world.
 Sorry.

1964
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:26,039
 - And a tea cosy on my head.
 - Come and meet Ronnie.

1965
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,879
 - Oh, great.
 - Mary's here.

1966
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,839
 Oh!

1967
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,559
 - Hi, Katie.
 - Hi, Mary. How are you?

1968
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,119
 - Good, thanks.
 - Excellent.

1969
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,359
 - Hi, Joe.
 - Hi.

1970
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,599
 Hi, you must be Ronnie.
 l've heard a lot about you.

1971
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,519
 - lt's lovely to meet you.
 - Hello.

1972
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,079
 - This is Katie.
 - My big brother.

1973
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:42,199
 - Ah, brilliant.
 - What are we having to drink?

1974
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,799
 - l'll have what everyone else is having.
 - Red wine for me.

1975
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,479
 - We're having fish.
 - l'll have white.

1976
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,879
 - l'll have white wine as well, please.
 - Beer, Ronnie?

1977
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,399
 - Yeah.
 - White wine, Mary?

1978
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,079
 - Yeah, please, ifthat's all right?
 TOM: l'll do that, Gez.

1979
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,319
 JOE:
 l'll get you a beer, Ronnie.

1980
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:58,039
 So, l hear you're a massive Derby fan, Ronnie.

1981
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,959
 - Er...yeah.
 - Great club.

1982
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,439
 l'm a Palace supporter myself, for my sins.

1983
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,440
 l still hope we might crash back through
 to the Premiership, at some point.

1984
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,839
 What do you reckon
 to Derby's chances?

1985
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:10,840
 - l don't know, not so bad.
 - Well, fingers crossed.

1986
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,439
 TOM: We met on our first day
 at university in Manchester.

1987
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,479
 Oh, your first day!

1988
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,359
 We were in the same halls of residence.

1989
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:28,039
 GERRl: We met on the stairs.
 - Yeah.

1990
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,079
 l was falling down them,
 she was going up them.

1991
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:33,080
 - l was falling up them.
 TOM: Things haven't changed, then.

1992
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,680
 And Tom's first job, when we left uni,
 was abroad for two years.

1993
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:42,239
 - Did you try not to take it personally?
 - (laughter)

1994
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,759
 We came down to London, didn't we?
 For about nine months.

1995
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:47,760
 l got my first geologist's job
 in Western Australia in the outback.

1996
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,439
 Right.

1997
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,399
 lt was him
 and a load ofAustralian cowboys.

1998
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:54,400
 - lt was like the Wild West out there.
 - Yeah, all cork hats and beers.

1999
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,480
 - You've worked in Australia, Katie.
 - Yeah, l worked in Sydney for a year.

2000
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:01,720
 l had a wonderful time. They know
 how to enjoy themselves, the Aussies.

2001
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,639
 - Yes.
 - Oh, yeah.

2002
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,640
 And you came out and visited,
 didn't you, my first Christmas holiday?

2003
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,679
 Yeah.
 We spent Christmas on the beach.

2004
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,359
 - Barbie on the beach?
 - Yeah.

2005
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,360
 And when Tom had finished after
 two years, l joined him again and we...

2006
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,839
 - You went on your grand tour.
 - ..we came back overland.

2007
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,039
 Yeah. lt took us seven months, l think.

2008
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,719
 We got the boat
 from Fremantle to Singapore

2009
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,599
 and then Singapore to Malaysia
 and then onto Thailand.

2010
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,799
 GERRl: Thailand. Burma.
 JOE: And to lndia.

2011
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,199
 - l'd love to go to lndia.
 - We went trekking in Nepal.

2012
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,200
 TOM: Nepal, trekking in Nepal.
 The beach at Goa.

2013
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:35,360

 TOM & GERRl: Turkey.

2015
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:40,719
 - Over to the Greek lslands.
 - Greek lslands.

2016
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,720
 The wonderful thing was, because
 l'd been in... two years working in Australia,

2017
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,120
 and earning relatively good money,
 and nothing to spend it on, really.

2018
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:50,720
 So, we didn't have to do it
 on a really tight budget.

2019
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:54,039
 Some people could just hitch,
 but we could get buses and trains.

2020
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,679
 - Yeah, yeah.
 KATlE: lt must have made a difference.

2021
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,680
 TOM: You've been to the Greek lslands,
 haven't you, Mary?

2022
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,679
 - Yeah.
 - Which island was it?

2023
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:04,519
 - Corfu.
 - Yeah.

2024
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,520
 - What were you doing on Corfu?
 - Oh, l only ran a bar on the beach.

2025
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,399
 JOE: You were a cocktail waitress?
 - Yeah.

2026
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,759
 (laughter)

2027
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,760
 GERRl: When are you going to Paris?
 KATlE: Oh, a week on Friday.

2028
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,079

 - Have breakfast by the Seine.
 TOM: Have you got your hotel booked?

2033
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,039
 KATlE: Yeah, we've got a lovely hotel.
 TOM: Very nice, yeah.

2034
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,439
 KATlE: Beautiful. ln the Marais area.

02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,399
 lt will be brilliant for Christmas shopping.

2036
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,999

 KATlE: On Sunday.

2037
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,599
 - Short weekend.
 - Not enough time to do all the things.

2038
