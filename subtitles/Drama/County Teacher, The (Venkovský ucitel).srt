<font color=#11A8E1>Beverly Weston: </font><i>...“Life is very long...”</i>

2
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:24,307
TS Eliot.

3
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,302
Not the first person to say it,

4
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,267
certainly not the first person to think it.

5
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:33,969
But he’s given credit for it because
he bothered to write it down.

6
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:41,248
Now, if you say it,
you have to say his name after it.

7
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:45,297
<i>“Life is very long:”</i> TS Eliot.

8
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:48,534
Absolutely, goddamn right.

9
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:54,138
Violet.

10
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:56,891
My wife.

11
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,158
She takes pills,

12
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,691
sometimes a great many.

13
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:06,933
The facts are:

14
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,420
my wife takes pills and I drink.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
That’s the bargain we’ve struck, a
little paragraph of our marriage contract...

16
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:15,831
Rather than..

17
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:19,654
once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed.

18
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:25,591
I’ve chosen to turn my life over
to a Higher Power..

19
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,631
and join the ranks of the Hiring Class.

20
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,993
It’s not a decision with
which I’m entirely comfortable.

21
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,095
I mean, I know how to launder my..

22
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,904
...dirty undies. Done it all my life,

23
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,578
but I’m finding that
it’s getting in the way of my drinking.

24
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,670
<font color=#11A8E1>Violet:</font> Bev?

25
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,900
Yes.

26
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,339
Did...

27
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,050
..you..?

28
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,157
Oh, goddamn it!

29
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:07,130
Are the police here?
- Could you come here?

30
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,572
Oh. Hello.

31
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,650
Johnna, the young woman
I told you about.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,544
You tell me she’s a woman.

33
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,169
Wo-man. Wo-man.

34
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,369
Whoa-man.

35
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,664
That I’m hiring --
- Oh,

36
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,206
you hire women’s now the thing.

37
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:34,886
I thought you meant the other.

38
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:37,987
To cook and clean,
carry you to the clinic..

39
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,720
Hello.
- Hello.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,838
I’m sorry.

41
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,371
Like this.

42
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:48,571
Yes, ma’am.

43
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,090
You’re very pretty.

44
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,290
Thank you.

45
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,472
Are you an<i> Injun</i>?

46
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:01,048
Yes, ma’am.

47
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,424
What kind?
- Cheyenne.

48
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,882
Do you think I’m pretty?

49
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,082
Like this?

50
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:17,336
Like..
- Careful...Careful...!

51
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,160
I’m sorry,
I took some...

52
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:30,583
medicine for my mumm...

53
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,002
for my mus...

54
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,885
My muscular.

55
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:40,224
..for my muscular.

56
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,557
Why don’t you go back to bed,
sweetheart?

57
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,464
Why don’t you go fuck
a fucking sow’s ass?

58
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,514
All right.

59
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,125
Oh..

60
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,498
I’m sorry.

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,201
I’ll be sickly sweet.

62
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,526
sickly sweet.

63
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,791
I’m soooooooo sweet.

64
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:21,914
I’m soo..

65
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,201
In-el-a...

66
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:28,999
In-el-abrially sweet.

67
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,905
We keep unusual hours here.

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,519
My wife has been diagnosed with a touch of..

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,102
cancer and she’ll need to be driven
to Tulsa for her final..

70
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,953
chemotherapy treatments.

71
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,125
What kind of cancer?

72
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,133
Ah, My God, I nearly neglected
the punch line:

73
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:50,675
mouth cancer.

74
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:53,841
Do you have any questions?

75
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,430
What pills does she take?
- Ohhh..

76
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,460
Valium. Vicodin.

77
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,920
Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan,
Percocet..

78
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:06,524
Xanax for fun.

79
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,356
OxyContin in a pinch.

80
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:14,845
And of course, Diluadid.
I can’t forget Diluadid.

81
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,212
My last refuge, my books..

82
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,319
simple pleasures,

83
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,920
like finding..

84
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:32,368
wild onions by the side of a road,
or requited love.

85
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:35,847
Oh here..

86
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:39,144
Here, TS Eliot.

87
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:42,541
Read it or not.
It's not a job requirement

88
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:46,839
just for your enjoyment.

89
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:57,393
Here we go, round the prickly pear...

90
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,175
Prickly pear prickly pear...

91
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,809
ere we go, round the prickly pear...

Mom...!

97
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,361
You didn’t hear the phone?

98
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,454
If it’s your father,
tell him to fuck off.

99
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,211
It’s Aunt Ivy,

from <font color=#11A8E1>O</font>klahoma.

..what’s wrong?

103
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,286
..When...?

104
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,028
What’d you tell Barb?

105
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,973
I told her Dad was missing.

106
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:37,491
Goddamn your father,
for putting me through this.

107
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,962
Seen that office of his?

108
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:44,441
He hired this Indian for some goddamn
reason and now I have a stranger in my house.

109
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,654
What’s her name?

110
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:47,854
Johnna.

111
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,014
I can’t handle this all by myself!

112
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,676
I called Karen.

113
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,072
Oh..

114
00:08:56,272 --> 00:09:00,463
Yeah, What did she say?
- She said she’d try to get here.

115
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:02,751
She’ll be a big fat help,

116
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:04,867
just like you.

117
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:10,477
I need Barb.

118
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,919
What’s Barb going to be able to do?

119
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,212
What did you do to your hair?

120
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,661
I had it straightened.
- Why would anybody do that?

121
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:24,413
I just wanted a change.

122
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:26,013
You’re a pretty girl.

123
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,353
Why don’t you wear makeup?

124
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:29,553
Do I need makeup?

125
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:32,313
Every women needs makeup.

126
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,591
Don’t let anybody tell you different.
The only woman..

127
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:38,934
pretty enough to go without makeup
was Elizabeth Taylor.

128
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:41,506
and she wore a ton.

129
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,407
Your shoulders are slumped
and your hair’s all straighten out..

130
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,346
..and you don’t wear makeup.
You look like a lesbian.

131
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:47,546
Mom.

132
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:50,098
You could get a decent man
if you spruced up.A bit,

133
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,282
that’s all I’m saying.

134
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:54,985
I’m not looking for a man.

135
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,615
How many was that?

136
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:09,159
I wasn’t counting.

137
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,513
Is your mouth burning?

138
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:22,992
Like a son-of-a-bitch.
My tongue is on fire.

139
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,763
Are you supposed to be smoking?

140
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,888
Is anybody <i>supposed</i> to smoke?

141
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:38,974
Are you scared?

142
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:49,817
Course I’m scared.

143
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:56,985
And you are a comfort, sweetheart.

144
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,130
Thank God one of my girls stayed
close to home.

145
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,393
In my day..

146
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,277
family stayed together.

147
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,802
Aunt Mattie Fae’s here.
- She means to come in here..

148
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,632
..and tell me what’s what.

149
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,282
I don’t know how Uncle Charlie
puts up with it.

150
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,092
He smokes a lot of grass.

151
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,347
He does?

152
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,644
He smokes <i>a lot</i> of grass.

153
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:32,384
I told Vi, “Take all those goddamn books
 he’s so fond of..

154
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,227
..and make a big pile in the front yard
and have yourself a bonfire.”

155
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,418
You don’t burn a man’s books.

156
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:39,592
You do, if the situation calls for it.

157
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,394
The man’s books didn’t do anything.

158
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:48,223
You get any ideas about just up and taking off,
Charlie Aiken, you better believe..

159
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,423
..that i'd have your..
- I’m not going anywhere.

160
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,640
I’m saying if you did,

161
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,219
I’ll give you two days to get your head straight.
Then it’s all going up in a blaze of glory.

162
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,730
Not that, you have any books lying around.

163
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:01,907
I don’t think I’ve ever seen you
read a book in my life.

164
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,750
That bother you?

165
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,910
What’s the last book you read?

166
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,300
Beverly was a teacher;

167
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:10,696
teachers read books,
I’m in the upholstery business.

168
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,896
Ah, sweeheart.

169
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,723
Your daddy’s done this before.

170
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,374
Just takes off, no call, nothing.

171
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:19,985
I told your mother,

172
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:23,638
“You pack that son-of-a-bitch’s bags and have
‘em waiting for him on the front porch.”

173
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:25,372
Where’s your mother?

174
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:26,876
Upstairs.

175
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:38,531
He’ll come back again,
I know he will,

176
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,128
he always does.

177
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,237
Beverly is a very complicated man.

178
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:44,433
Kind of like Charles.

179
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:48,006
Little Charles isn’t complicated,
he’s just unemployed.

180
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,204
You don’t think that Little Charles and

181
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,441
Beverly share some kind of...

182
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,113
..complication.

183
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,156
You have to be smart to be complicated.

184
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,428
Are you saying our boy isn’t smart?

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,739
Yes, that’s what I’m saying.

186
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,694
I’m sweating.

187
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,037
Why is it so dark in here?

188
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:12,067
Are you sweating?

189
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,046
Hell, yes, I’m sweating,

190
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,830
it’s ninety degrees in here.

191
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,464
Feel my back.

192
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:23,664
I don’t want to feel your back.

193
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:25,856
Sweat is just dripping down my back.
- I believe you.

194
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,056
Feel it.
- No.

195
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,941
Come on, put your hand here.
- Goddamn it --

196
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,531
Sweat’s just dripping...

197
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:40,911
Ivy, when did this start?

198
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,181
This business with taping the shades?

199
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,852
Been a couple of years now.

200
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,604
Do you know its purpose?

201
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:52,055
You can’t tell if it’s night or day.

202
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,950
I think that’s the purpose.

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,633
What were these people thinking...

204
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,865
The jokers who settled this place.

205
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:11,265
Who was the asshole, looked at flat hot
nothing and planted his flag?

206
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,145
I mean..

207
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,530
we fucked the Indians for this?
- Well, genocide,

208
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,311
always seems like such a good idea
at the time.

209
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,825
Right, you need a little hindsight.

210
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,826
If you want me to explain the creepy
character of the Midwest,

211
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,922
Please, the Midwest.

212
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:27,680
This is the Plains.

213
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,137
A state of mind,
A spiritual affliction, like the Blues.

214
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,725
Don’t.

215
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:58,078
What are you doing?

216
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:04,155
‘Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you
for another beer?

217
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,238
Goddam it, she’s not a waitress.

218
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,494
I'll get it.

219
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,623
I know that.

220
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,145
Then, get your own beer.

221
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,423
I don’t believe you.

222
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:19,992
Watchin’ a ball game, drinkin’ beers.

223
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,519
You have any sense of
what’s going on around you?

224
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,835
Am I supposed to sit here like a statue?

225
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,409
You’re drinking whiskey.

226
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,500
I’m having a cocktail.

227
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:34,547
You’re drinking straight whiskey!

228
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:35,747
Just...

229
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,471
Have a little class.

230
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

231
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,106
You’ve encouraged that.

232
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,038
I haven’t encouraged anything.
- You admire her for getting hooked at fourteen,

233
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,628
makes her seem even more mature.

234
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,110
Goddamn, it’s hot.

235
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,635
Suppose your mom’s turned on
the air conditioner?

236
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,139
You kidding?
Remember the parakeets?

237
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,511
The parakeets?

238
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:14,936
I didn’t tell you about the parakeets?

239
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:20,353
She got a parakeet, for some insane reason
 and the little fucker croaked after two days.

240
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,748
So, she went to the pet store
and raised hell,

241
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,328
and they gave her another one.
That one died after a day.

242
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,008
Then, she went back and they gave her
a third parakeet. That one died too.

243
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,566
So, the chick from the pet store came out here
to see just what in the hell

244
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,253
this, serial parakeet killer was doing
to bump off these birds.

245
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,453
And?

246
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:39,653
The heat.

247
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,612
It was too hot.
They were dying from the heat.

248
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:43,812
Jesus.

249
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,012
These are tropical birds, all right?

250
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,585
I mean, They live in the fucking tropics!

251
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:49,785
Mom?!

252
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:50,985
It's Barbara..it's Barb.

253
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,185
Barbara!

254
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,620
Oh my gosh!

255
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
You.

256
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,230
Come give me some sugar.

257
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,996
Bill, look how skinny you are!

258
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,700
Will you look at this one?

259
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,010
Come here and give your Aunt Mattie 
Fae some sugar!

260
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,210
Hi, Charlie.
- Hey Bill,

261
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,547
you've dropped some weight, haven't you?

262
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,400
Look at her boobs! - Last time i saw..
<i>- How was the flight from Denver? </i>

263
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
you looked like a little boy!

264
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Barbara?

265
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,640
Hey, Mom. I’m here!

266
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,553
Barb...Barb..Barb..
- It’s okay, Mom.I’m here. 

267
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,530
Saturday morning.

268
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,885
The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy.
We ate some,

269
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,110
he walked out the door,
this door right there.

270
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,580
That was it.

271
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,510
He just left...?

272
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,870
uh, huh.

273
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,690
I went to bed Saturday night,

274
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,190
got up Sunday mornin'

275
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,430
... still no Beverly.

276
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,040
I didn’t make much of it,

277
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,830
thought he’d gone out on a bender.

278
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,940
Why would he do that?
When, he can drink at home.

279
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,538
Unless, you were riding his ass.
- I never said a word to him..

280
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,439
about his drinking, I didn't.
I never got on him about it.

281
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,639
So, Sunday,

282
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,350
still no sign of him...
- That’s when I got worked up about that,

283
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,030
safety deposit box. Because..

284
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,703
We kept an awful lot of cash in that box,
some expensive jewelry.

285
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:27,903
I had a..

286
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,569
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars.

287
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,020
Wait, wait, wait,
I’m missing something.

288
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,120
Why do you care about a safety
deposit box?

289
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,190
Your father and I had an arrangement.

290
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,610
If something were to ever happen to one of us,
the other one would go empty that box.

291
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,990
Vi, you sure there wasn’t some incident
that triggered his leaving, some event.

292
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,800
like a fight?
- Yeah. - No.

293
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,405
And we fought enough...
you know... but no.

294
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Maybe he needed some time away from you.

295
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,532
Oh, That’s nice of you to say.

296
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,350
Hey, it's no crime.

297
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,071
Marriage is hard.

298
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,634
Under the best of circumstances.

299
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,300
So..

300
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,650
Nothing? No,<i> 'see you later,
I'm taking a walk'</i>?

301
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,620
Mmmmhm.

302
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,790
Good old unfathomable Dad.

303
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,270
Oh. That man. Oh..

304
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,470
What I first fell in love with,
you know, was his mystery.

305
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,950
I thought it was sexy as hell.

306
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,960
You knew he was the smartest one in the room,
knew if he just said something...

307
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,458
knock you out.
But No, he’d just stand there,

308
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,120
little smile on his face...

309
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
not say a word.

310
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,698
Sexy.

311
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,940
You can’t remember anything unusual --

312
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,640
He hired this woman.

313
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:09,370
He didn’t ask me, just hired this woman
to come live in our house. Few days before he left.

314
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,826
You don’t want her here?

315
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,440
I have an <i>Indian</i> in my house.

316
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,240
You have a problem with Indians, Violet?

317
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,830
I don’t know what to say to an Indian.
- They’re called Native Americans, Mom.

318
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,785
Who makes that decision?
- It’s what they like to be called.

319
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:23,969
They aren’t any more native than me.
- In fact,

320
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,304
..they are.
- What’s wrong with Indian?

321
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,839
Why can't you call people
what they wanna be called?

322
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,213
Let’s just call the dinosaurs “Native Americans”
while we’re at it.

323
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,887
She may be an Indian, but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

324
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,760
He hired a cook.
It makes no sense. We don’t eat.

325
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,498
And now you get biscuits and gravy.
Kind of nice, huh?

326
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:46,850
That is nice.

327
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,325
Nice for you, now.

328
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,303
But, soon you’ll be gone,

329
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:52,664
never to return.

330
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,530
When was the last time you were here?

331
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,933
Don’t get started..
- Alright!

332
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,133
I don’t care about you two.

333
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,225
But, I’d like to see my granddaughter
every now and again.

334
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,425
Well, you’re seeing her now.

335
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,121
But your father.
You broke his heart when you moved away.

336
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,951
That is wildly unfair! <font color=#11A8E1>-You know you were Beverly’s favorite;
</font><i>- Am I going to have to separate you two?</i>

337
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,595
<font color=#11A8E1> ..don’t pretend you don’t know!</font>

338
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:14,743
I’d prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally.

339
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:23,500
I’m sure you’d prefer to think that Santy Claus
brought you presents at Christmas, too.

340
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,740
If you’d had more than one child, you’d know

341
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,470
a parent always has favorites.

342
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,120
Mattie Fae was my mother’s favorite. Big deal.
I got used to it.

343
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,710
You were your Daddy’s favorite.

344
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,251
Broke his heart.

345
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,350
What was I supposed to do?!

346
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,985
Colorado gave Bill twice what he's making at TU.
- Why are we even getting into this?

347
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:47,428
You think Daddy wouldn’t have jumped
at an opportunity like that?

348
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:51,043
You’re wrong there. You never would’ve gotten
Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.

349
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,243
He gave me his blessing.

350
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,600
That's what he told you. Yeah..

351
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,940
And now, you’re going to tell me the true story,
some terrible shit he said behind my back?

352
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Alright, everybody’s on edge..

353
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,871
Beverly didn’t say terrible things behind your back
- Vi, come on!

354
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:07,733
He just told me he’s disappointed in you
because you settled.

355
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,980
He thought you had talent,

356
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,431
..as a writer.

357
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,857
Daddy never said anything like that to you.

358
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:17,850
What a load of absolute horseshit.

359
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,140
horseshit.

360
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,370
Horseshit? Oh, horseshit,
let’s all say horseshit.

361
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,272
Say horseshit, Bill.

362
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,293
Horseshit.

363
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,214
Are you high?
- Excuse me.

364
00:22:42,414 --> 00:22:43,414
I mean literally.
You taking something?

365
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,547
A muscle relaxer.
- You listen to me. I'll not go through this with you again.

366
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:50,747
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

367
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,260
These fucking pills? Calls at three AM
about stars in your backyard?

368
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,730
This isn't..it isn't same thing.

369
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,070
I didn’t have reason then.

370
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,007
So, it’s okay to get hooked now
because you have a reason.

371
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,207
I’m not hooked on anything.

372
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,483
I don’t want to know if you are or not,

373
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:11,370
I’m just saying.. I'm not gonna
go through it again.

374
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,133
I’m not. I’m in pain!

375
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,740
Because of your mouth?

376
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,590
Yes, because my mouth burns.

377
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,790
I have got..

378
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,550
Cancer in my mouth.

379
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,980
And it burns, look.

380
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Look.

381
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,380
And it burns like a... bullshit.

382
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,304
And Beverly’s disappeared and
you’re yelling at me.

383
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:40,504
I’m not..

384
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,926
You know, you couldn’t come home
when I got cancer.

385
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,210
Beverlys disappeared..

386
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,993
you rushed right back.

387
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,760
I’m sorry.

388
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:19,904
I’m sorry...

389
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,464
You know where I think he is?

390
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,140
I think he..

391
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,690
I think he got some whiskey,
a carton of cigarettes, and

392
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,750
a couple of good spy novels...and..

393
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,130
I think he got out on the boat.

394
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,820
and steered it to a nice spot,
close to shore like he likes em.

395
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,010
and he’s fishing, and reading
and drinking,

396
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500
maybe even writing a little.

397
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,100
And, I think..

398
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,250
he’s gonna walk through that door..

399
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,415
...any time.

400
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,450
Mom?

401
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,490
Mom, the sheriff's here.

402
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,690
What? Wha...

403
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,570
Hey, sweetheart.
Go back to bed.

404
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,500
What about Aunt Ivy?

405
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:04,930
I guess we’ll stop on the way.

406
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,392
Christ, I have to call Karen too.

407
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,260
Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

408
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,994
Izza story.

409
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,316
Barely’s back.

410
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:36,986
Gizza cig...

411
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,575
cigezze?  Cig-zezz, cig-zizz... 
- Ma’am?

412
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,599
Gizza cig... 

413
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,099
Cig-zezz, cig-zizz... 
some cigezze?

414
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,385
Cigz, cig-aa.. 

415
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,784
archa-tex?

416
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,070
I’m Inna bottom of them.

417
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,010
It's good beat, right?

418
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,385
Barb..!

419
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,560
From the day I..

420
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:29,375
..the day..

421
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:40,870
Beverly..

422
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,455
and then..

423
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:49,430
and then you’re here..

424
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,669
And Barbara, you’re here, and Beverly,
and then you’re here, and then..

425
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:00,090
..you’re here..

426
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:09,021
I used to go out with that boy.

427
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:13,410
That man.
- What man? The Sheriff?

428
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,330
In high school. He was my prom date.

429
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:21,195
You’re kidding.

430
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,563
Day of the prom, his father got drunk
and stole his car,

431
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,386
stole his own son’s car,

432
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:28,750
went somewhere, Mexico.

433
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:33,561
Deon showed up at the house.
He’d been crying.

434
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,083
Confessed he didn’t have a way
to take me to the prom.

435
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:40,538
So, we got a six-pack..

436
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:44,605
..and broke into the chapel, stayed up
all night talking and kissing.

437
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,216
And, now here he is,

438
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,830
..showing me.

439
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,470
It’s so surreal.

440
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:59,240
Thank God we can’t tell the future.
We’d never get out of bed.

441
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,106
Listen to me.

442
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,160
Die after me, all right?

443
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,620
I don’t care what else you do,

444
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,674
where you go, how
you screw up your life, just...

445
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,660
Survive.

446
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,357
please.

447
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,560
Holy shit, that’s Karen.

448
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,556
Do you remember your Aunt Karen?
- Kind of...

449
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:22,064
That must be this year’s man.

450
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:09,779
I spent so much time in our bedroom,

451
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:12,112
pretending my pillow
was my husband..

452
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:16,392
..and did he like the dinner I just made
and where were we going that winter on vacation..

453
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:20,291
..and then, he’d surprise me with tickets
to Belize and we’d kiss.

454
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,560
I mean I’d kiss my pillow!

455
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,457
and then I’d say that
I’d been to the doctor that I am..

456
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:28,657
maybe, I was pregnant.

457
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,980
I know how pathetic that sounds now,
but it was innocent enough.

458
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,424
Then real life kicks in,

459
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,924
Things don’t work out like you planned.

460
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:41,060
They never do..and then,

461
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:44,950
That pillow was a better husband
than any real man I’d ever met;

462
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:50,375
And you punish yourself and tell yourself
it’s your fault you can’t find a good one.

463
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,344
I don’t know how well you remember Andrew.
You remember Andrew?

464
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:54,544
No, I remember him.

465
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:57,204
I loved him.. so intensely,

466
00:33:57,205 --> 00:34:01,135
so, the things he did wrong, were just
opportunities for me to make 'em right.

467
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,189
When he'd cheat on me or called me a cunt,

468
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,170
I’d say, <i>“No, love is forever,</i>

469
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,891
<i>this is just an opportunity for me,</i>

470
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:12,763
<i>..to make an adjustment in the way
that I view the world.”</i>

471
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:16,448
And thank God, one day I looked
in the mirror and said, “Moron,”

472
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,396
and I walked out.

473
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:20,485
But, one day..
finally I said,

474
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:22,270
“It’s me.

475
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,425
It's just me.

476
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:28,575
I don’t need anything else,
I can live my life with myself.”

477
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:33,809
 And, that's how I got my license, I
threw myself into my work, sold a ton of houses,

478
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:35,009
..and that’s how I met Steve.

479
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,189
That’s how it works, Barb.

480
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,389
Ah, he's ten years older,

481
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:43,547
but he is such a thinker,

482
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:44,747
 ..and he’s such a good man.

483
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:48,210
He’s such a good heart
and he’s good for me.

484
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,840
I guess, the best thing
about him, for me,

485
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,880
...is that now..

486
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
..what I think about is now.

487
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,930
I live now.

488
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,580
My focus, my life, my world is now.

489
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,920
And you can’t plan the future.
You just can't. Cause as soon as you do,

490
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,790
something happens, some..

491
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,350
terrible thing happens..
- Like your father drowning himself.

492
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,040
That’s exactly what I mean.

493
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,370
You take it as it comes,
here and now!

494
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,510
Steve had a huge presentation today
for some big-wig government guys who could be..

495
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,450
..really important for his business
and he’s put together for months now,

496
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,200
But.. as soon as we found about Daddy,

497
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,350
he just cancelled his meeting.

498
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,340
He has his priorities straight.

499
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,250
And, you know what the kicker is?

500
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,350
Do you know what the kicker is Barb?

501
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,466
What’s the kicker?

502
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:48,066
We’re going to Belize on our honeymoon!

503
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,534
Is it always this hot?

504
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,670
Usually, it’s hotter.

505
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,130
That's hard to imagine.

506
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,227
How old are you, about,
seventeen?

507
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,512
Fourteen.

508
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:28,712
Fourteen, right...

509
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,470
You know what I was doing
when I was fourteen?

510
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,930
Cattle processing.

511
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,000
Know what that is?
- It doesn’t sound good.

512
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,160
Slaughterhouse sanitation.

513
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
That’s disgusting.

514
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,280
I wouldn’t recommend it.

515
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,200
But hey. Put food on the table.

516
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:53,944
Get it?

517
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,180
What’s that smell?

518
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,740
I don't know?

519
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,590
It's probably, that stop thrash can
over there?

520
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,980
Nah, that’s not what I’m smelling.

521
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,950
What are you doing?

522
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,174
Do I smell what I think I smell?
- I don't know,

523
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:15,374
What do you smell?
- Is that... pot?

524
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,505
You smoking pot?

525
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,469
No.
- You can tell me.

526
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:22,880
You a little dope smoker?
- No!

527
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,040
Then you are in luck.

528
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,190
Because, I happen to have some
really tasty shit.

529
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,060
Here we go!

530
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,447
No Pinots, but they had some decent
California Merlots.

531
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,533
Ahh! Look at me! Look at me.
- You’re beautiful, Mom.

532
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,370
I was beautiful.

533
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,340
Hah..

534
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,829
Not anymore.
- Oh, now --

535
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:51,029
You’re still beautiful.

536
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,280
One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.

537
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,730
Women are beautiful,
when they’re young and not after.

538
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,910
Men can still preserve their sex appeal
into old age.

539
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,360
Not those men like you see with shorts,

540
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,550
and little purses around their waists.
- Lord..lord.

541
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,780
Some men can maintain a weary masculinity.
Women just get old..

542
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,240
..and fat and wrinkly.

543
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,030
I beg your pardon?
I'm still very sexy.

544
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,756
Thank you very much.
- Yeah, you’re about as sexy

545
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,040
as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae.

546
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,718
you and me both.

547
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:36,624
Look, wouldn’t we be better off all of us,
if we stopped lying about these things,

548
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:38,472
..and told the truth?

549
00:38:38,672 --> 00:38:40,872
“Women aren’t sexy when they’re old.”

550
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:43,772
I can live with that.
Can you live with that?

551
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:46,251
What about Sophia Loren?

552
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,695
What about Lena Horne?
She stayed sexy till she was eighty.

553
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:51,895
The world is round.

554
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,890
Get over it.

555
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,460
Hey, try this dress on.

556
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
I’m sorry, I won’t.

557
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,453
You don’t know how to attract a man.
I do.

558
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:03,653
That’s something I always..

559
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,458
We just buried my father,
I’m not trying to attract a man.

560
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:07,658
I’m not talking about today, dummy,
I'm just saying..

561
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,044
this is something..
- I have a man. All right?

562
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,244
I have a man.

563
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:14,136
You said, you weren’t looking for a man.

564
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,710
And I’m not.
Because I have one.

565
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,370
Now will you leave it alone?
- No, I won’t leave it alone. <i>- No, let’s not leave it alone.</i>

566
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,120
I wish you both could see,

567
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,698
..the brainsick looks on your faces.

568
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:25,898
Who is it?
- Nobody. Forget it..

569
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,949
Tell us, is he someone from school?
How old is he, what’s he do?

570
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,149
I’m not telling you anything..

571
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,673
You have to tell us something!
- No, I really don’t.

572
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:38,450
Are you in love, Ivy?
- I...I don’t...I’m...

573
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,848
No, we maintain the accounts offshore,
just until we get approvals.

574
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,917
- What..to get around approvals?

575
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,948
To get around approvals
until we get approvals.

576
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,944
There’s a lot of bureaucracy, red tape..
I don’t know how much you know about Florida,

577
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,144
 Florida politics.

578
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,960
Only what I read and that’s..
- Right, right, this kind of business in particular.

579
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,480
...Charlie?
- Picking up Little Charles.

580
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,570
Give. Me. The wine.

581
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,630
Is that what you were in such a
hurry to get home for?

582
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,900
What the hell’s on TV
that’s so important you?

583
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,706
<i>Phantom of the Opera,</i> 1925.

584
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,810
They’re showing it with the scene
in color restored.

585
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,910
Cool.

586
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,390
Let me make sure I’ve got this.
when you threw a fit..

587
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,630
about going to the store with your dad...
Hey, look at me.

588
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,859
And you were so distraught over the
start time of your Grandpa’s funeral.

589
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:08,059
Was this your concern? Huh?

590
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,768
Getting back here in time to watch
Phantom of the Fucking Opera?

591
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:15,071
I guess.

592
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,345
Christ.

593
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,210
Phantom of the Opera, huh?

594
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,740
Huh-uh.
- Hi, doodle.

595
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,680
Doodle.

596
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,120
Hey, baby.

597
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,400
I want to show you our old fort.

598
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:48,170
Man, the air in here
just doesn’t move.

599
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,270
I'll hook you up, later.

600
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,400
I’m sorry, Dad.

601
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,380
No need to apologize.
- I know, Mom’s mad at me.

602
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,600
Don’t worry about her.
- What did she say?

603
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,324
Your mother,
she says what she says.

604
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:21,524
I set the alarm. I did.

605
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,880
I know you did.
- I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.

606
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,770
Just stop, apologizing.

607
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,420
I missed his funeral!

608
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,760
Ah, its..

609
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,550
It’s a ceremony.

610
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,600
It’s ceremonial.

611
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,520
It doesn’t mean anything compared to..

612
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,340
what you have in your heart.

613
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,330
Hold on,

614
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,030
comb your hair.

615
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,520
Uncle Bev, must be disappointed in me.

616
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,870
Your Uncle Bev has got
bigger and better things ahead of him.

617
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,410
He doesn’t have time for spite.

618
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,500
He wasn’t that kind of man, anyway.

619
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,770
Hey,

620
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,100
hey..It’s okay.

621
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:31,418
Just...

622
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,490
I know how things are.
I know how  they..

623
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,840
..think about me;

624
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,630
and something like this...
you want to be there for people,

625
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,220
I’m sorry I let you down, Dad.
- Hey, You haven’t let me down.

626
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,840
You never let me down.

627
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,690
Now listen...

628
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,530
you’re wrong about these people, they love you.

629
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,760
They love you.

630
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,550
Some of them,

631
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,040
haven’t gotten a chance to see
what I see.

632
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,560
A fine man,

633
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,340
very loving,

634
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,470
..a with a lot to offer.

635
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,760
Now take this

636
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,960
Give me my comb.

637
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,770
I love you, Dad.

638
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,006
Love you too, son.

639
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,210
Phantom of the Opera?

640
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,080
You don’t remember
what it was like to be fourteen?

641
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,314
She’s old enough to exhibit a little character.

642
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:53,452
But, that’s something you normally
learn from your parents.

643
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:56,097
That’s a shot across my bow, right?
I missed something.

644
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:57,410
Really? Instilling character.

645
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,360
Our burden as parents.
- I got that part.

646
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,454
And you really haven’t
been much of a parent lately,

647
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:03,654
..so it’s tough to..
- Just because you and I are..

648
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:06,853
..struggling with this Gordian knot
It doesn’t mean..

649
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:09,630
..but her fourteen-year-old
self might view it differently.

650
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,170
might consider it “abandonment”

651
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,530
Oh, come on, she’s a little more sophisticated
than that, don’t you think?

652
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,146
Pretty fucking sophisticated,

653
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,744
the restored whatever from Phantom of the Opera,
I know that makes your dick hard..

654
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,588
Barbara --
- Precocious little shit.

655
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:23,942
I’m not defending her.
- I am not blaming her.

656
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,021
I'm on your side.
- ..selfish sonofabith!

657
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:31,734
Be a father! Help me!
- I am her father, goddamn it!

658
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:35,006
Her father in name only!
- I have not forsook my responsibilities!

659
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:36,206
It’s “forsaken,” big shot!

660
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:38,588
Actually, “forsook” is also an
acceptable usage.

661
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:40,560
Oh, “forsook” you and the horse
you rode in on.

662
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,430
You don’t fight fair.

663
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,390
I’ve seen where that gets me!

664
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,925
GROW UP! while you’re dyeing your hair
and going through your fifth puberty,

665
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,274
the world is falling apart
and your kid can’t handle it!

666
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,456
Our kid is just trying to deal with this
goddamn madhouse you’ve dragged her into.

667
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:56,656
This madhouse is my home.

668
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:58,984
Think about that statement
for a second, why don’t you?

669
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,184
Jean is here with me because..

670
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:02,772
..this is a family event.
- Jean’s here with you because she’s a buffer..

671
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:05,615
between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother.

672
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:07,859
Y’know, you’d have a lot more credibility
if you had any credibility.

673
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:09,059
You’re a easy mark.
- You’re so goddamn self-righteous,

674
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:11,487
..you know that? You’re so..
- Surely you must’ve realised..

675
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,071
when you started porking Pippi Longstocking
you were due for a little self-righteousness,

676
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:18,967
..just a smidge of indignation on my part.
- Maybe, I split because of it!

677
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,930
Is this your confession, then,

678
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,500
when you finally, unload all? Hmm?

679
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,410
You’re thoughtful, Barbara,
but you’re not open.

680
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,760
You’re passionate, but you’re hard.

681
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,900
You’re a good, decent, funny,
wonderful woman, and I love you, but..

682
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,800
You’re a pain in the ass!

683
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,424
One for me.

684
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,680
One for the girls.

685
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,100
Mom’s casserole.

686
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,100
They said you overslept.

687
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,480
Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept.
I don’t know.

688
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,723
I’m so sorry.
- Please.

689
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,310
I know you had one of the worst
days of your life and..

690
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,430
I’m sorry that I wasn't there.
- We don’t have to do that with each other.

691
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,470
You’re breaking our rule.

692
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,910
They’re on to me.
Not us, just me.

693
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,670
I told them I was seeing someone.

694
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,070
I didn’t tell them who.
I just wanted you to know,

695
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,667
in case it came up.

696
00:48:20,707 --> 00:48:22,058
What?

697
00:48:26,142 --> 00:48:27,833
Charles...

698
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,080
I adore you.

699
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,040
Pass the casserole, please?

700
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
My casserole’s coming.

701
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,140
I’ll eat some of yours, too.

702
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,630
Mom?! Let’s eat!

703
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,650
Oh, There he is.

704
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,157
I wanted to put you at a kid’s table
but they wouldn’t let me.

705
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:49,650
Where do you want me to put this?

706
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,390
Hi, Little Charles.
I want you to meet my fiance Steve.

707
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:58,505
Goddamn it --! O-pah!

708
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,070
You goddamn clumsy goofball!

709
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,000
Mom, I’m so sorry.
- All right, nobody’s hurt.

710
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,745
What about me? I’m hurt.
- It's not a party, until somebody spills something.

711
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:08,945
That’s my casserole!

712
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,700
Let it go, Mattie Fae.
- I’m so sorry.

713
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,576
Who wants chicken?

714
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:16,240
Jean, you didn’t get any chicken.

715
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
I don’t eat meat.

716
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
You don’t eat meat.

717
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,210
Okay.
Mom!

718
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,248
Just put it on his plate for him or he’s liable
to burn the house down.

719
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,638
All right, Mattie Fae.

720
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,700
Barbara...

721
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,140
..will you put this?

722
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,330
Over there.
- Yeah, sure.

723
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,400
<font color=#11A8E1>MATTIE FAE:</font> That’s so nice.
<font color=#11A8E1>KAREN:</font> So, sweet.

724
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,035
I see you gentlemen have all stripped
down to your shirt fronts.

725
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:51,540
I thought we were having a
funeral dinner,

726
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,080
not a cockfight.

727
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,490
Someone should probably say grace.

728
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Barbara?

729
00:50:25,278 --> 00:50:27,680
Uncle Charlie should say it.
He’s the..

730
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,970
patriarch around here now.

731
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,830
I am?
- By default.

732
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,900
Okay.

733
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,070
<i>Dear Lord...</i>

734
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,590
<i>We ask that you..</i>

735
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,210

00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,140

00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,210

00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,960

00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:02,880
<i>..grace.</i>

741
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,227
I gotta to take this.

742
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,320
Work..it's very important.

743
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,460
...in Oklahoma. Yeah..

744
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,790
<i>We ask that you watch over..</i>

745
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,700
<i>Beverly, too, as he...</i>

746
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,510
<i>as he...</i>

747
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,440
<i>as he makes his journey.</i>

748
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,330
<i>We thank thee, O Lord,
that we are able to join together,</i>

749
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,990
<i>to pay tribute to this fine man.</i>

750
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,370
<i>in his house, with his..</i>

751
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,050

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,430
<i>We are truly blessed in our fellowship,</i>

753
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,140

754
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,820
<i>fellowship.</i>

755
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,490
<i>We thank thee for the food,
O Lord, that we can..</i>

756
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,630
<i>share this food...</i>

757
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,480
<i>and replenish our bodies with...</i>

758
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,000

00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,190

00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,890

761
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,470
<i>Be better people.</i>

762
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,320
<i>We recognize now more than ever

763
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,010

764
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:47,404
<i>We ask that you bless and watch
over this family. Amen.</i>

765
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:51,353
Amen. So, sorry folks.
- Let’s eat.

766
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,730
Barb, you have any use
for that sideboard?

767
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,010
That sideboard there,

768
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,160
you have any interest in that?

769
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:05,738
It's so pretty.

770
00:53:05,938 --> 00:53:08,346
No. I mean, why?

771
00:53:08,546 --> 00:53:12,202
I’m getting rid of a lot of this stuff and I thought
you might want that sideboard.

772
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,840
No, Mom, I...I wouldn’t have any
way to get that home to Colorado.

773
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:17,530
Maybe, Ivy’ll take it.

774
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,130
I have something like that, remember.
- Clearing all this out of here.

775
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,600
It's really pretty.
- I want to have a brand new everything.

776
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,805
I guess I’m just sort of...
not prepared to talk about your stuff.

777
00:53:30,111 --> 00:53:31,447
Suit yourself.

778
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,129
The food is just spectacular.

779
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,129
Johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.

780
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,890
It's what she’s paid for.
Y’all did know she’s getting paid, right?

781
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,530
Jean,

782
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,520
so..I’m curious,

783
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,740
when you say you don’t eat meat,
you mean, you don’t eat meat of any kind?

784
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,940
Right.

785
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,970
Is that for health reasons, or...?

786
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,392
When you eat meat,
you ingest an animal’s fear.

787
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:06,592
Ingest what?

788
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,809
It’s fur?
- Fear.

789
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:13,108
I thought she said --

790
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:17,773
How do you do that?
You can’t eat fear.

791
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:18,973
Sure you can. I mean..

792
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,200
What happens to you,
when you feel afraid?

793
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,481
Doesn’t your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions?

794
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:24,681
I don't know..
Does it?

795
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:25,881
It does.
- Yes.

796
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:27,081
Adrenaline, and, and --

797
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:30,613
Your body goes through a whole chemical process
when it experiences fear.

798
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:33,392
..and cortisol.
- Don’t you think an animal experiences fear?

799
00:54:33,592 --> 00:54:34,592
You bet it does.

800
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,970
I used to work at a
cattle processing plant,

801
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,905
lots of fear flying around that place.

802
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:41,105
So, when you eat an meat,

803
00:54:41,305 --> 00:54:45,978
you’re ingesting all that fear
it felt when it was slaughtered to make food.

804
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,270
You mean I’ve been eating fear, what,

805
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,920
 three times a day for..

806
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,790
..sixty years?

807
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,089
This one won’t have a meal

808
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:01,010
that doesn't meat in it.
- I guess it’s the way I was raised,

809
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,160
but, somehow it just doesn’t seem like a legitimate meal
‘less it has some meat somewhere.

810
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,299
If I make a pasta dish of some kind,
he’ll be like,

811
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,799
<i> “That’s fine for an appetizer,
but where’s the meat?”</i>

812
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,299
Isn’t that some TV commercial,

813
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,130
the old lady says, “Where’s the meat?”

814
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,590
“Where’s the beef?”

815
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,068
"Where’s the meat?!” "Where’s the meat?!”

816
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:26,851
"Where’s the meat?!”
"Hey, Where’s the meat?!”

817
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,710
That’s pleasant.

818
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,089
I thought, the services were lovely.

819
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,266
Yes, weren’t they?
- Preacher did a fine job.

820
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,875
I give it a...Ehhhhh!
- Really? you thought so?

821
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:44,873
Great, now we get some dramatic criticism.

822
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:47,988
Too much talk about poetry and teaching.

823
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,750
He hadn’t written any poetry,

824
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,310
to speak of since ‘65

825
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,630
He never liked teaching worth a damn.
Nobody talked about the good stuff.

826
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,600
Man was a world-class alcoholic,
more’n fifty years.

827
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:05,100
Nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner...

828
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,920
Drank a whole bottle of
Ron Bocoy White Rum,

829
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,450
don’t know why I remember that,

830
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,740
and got up to give this talk,

831
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,690
and he fouled himself!

832
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:24,483
Comes back to our table with this great..
- Yeah, I can’t imagine why no one told that story.

833
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:28,211
Well, he didn't get invited back to
anymore TU alumni dinners.

834
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:29,411
I can tell you that.

835
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,990
I don’t know much about poetry, but..

836
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,010
I thought his poems were extraordinary.

837
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,190
And your reading was very fine.

838
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,310
Thank you.

839
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,470
Who are you?

840
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,490
This is my fiance, Steve,
you met him at the church.

841
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,440
Steve Heidebrecht.

842
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,030
Hide-the-what?
- Heidebrecht.

843
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,880
Hide-a-burrr...It's German.
- Well, German-Irish, really..

844
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,080
That’s peculiar, Karen,

845
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,750
to bring a date to your father’s funeral.

846
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,140
I know the poetry was good, but I really
wouldn’t have considered it date material.

847
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,114
He’s not a date, he’s my fiance.

848
00:57:12,314 --> 00:57:15,034
We’re getting married on New Years, in Miami,

849
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,240
And, I would love it,
if you can make it.

850
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,850
I don’t really see that happening, do you?

851
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,670
Steve.

852
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,180
That right? Steve?

853
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,050
Yes, ma’am.

854
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,670
You ever been married before?

855
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,010
Yes, ma’am, I have.

856
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,800
More then once?

857
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,830
Three times, actually,
three times before this.

858
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,640
You should pretty much
have it down by now, then.

859
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,350
Right,
right..

860
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,060
I had that one pegged. Didn't I?

861
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,590
I mean, look at him,
you can tell he’s been married.

862
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:55,492
I went outside to show Steve the old fort
and it’s torn down!

863
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:58,068
That’s been gone for years.
- I was so sad!

864
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:00,124
What is this now?
- Our old fort, where we used to play..

865
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,260
Cowboys and Indians.
- Daddy said rats were getting in there.

866
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,460
Karen! Shame on you!

867
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,190
Don’t you know not to say
Cowboys and Indians?

868
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,010
You played Cowboys and Native Americans,

869
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,190
right Barb?

870
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,050
What are you taking?
What pills?

871
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,037
Oh, Leave me alone.

872
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:24,850
Uh-oh!

873
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,850
What is it?

874
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,370
What is it?

875
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,240
What’s the matter?
- You okay, Uncle Charles.

876
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,890
UH-OH!
I got a big bite of fear!

877
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,830
Fear never tasted so good.

878
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,710
It’s pretty good once
you get used to the taste.

879
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,600
I’m shakin’ in my boots!

880
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:59,070
I do catch her eating a cheeseburger
every now and again.

881
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,850
No, you don't!
- Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.

882
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,050
Mom, you are such a liar!

883
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,250
No stop. You are!

884
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,578
Y’know, if I ever called my mother a liar?

885
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,878
She would’ve knocked my goddamn
head off my shoulders.

886
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,320
You girls know there’s a will.

887
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
Mom...

888
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,690
We took care of it some time back.

889
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,953
We don’t want to talk about it.

890
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:32,440
I want to talk about it.
What about what I want to talk about?

891
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,880
Does that count for anything?

892
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,655
Bev made some good investments,
believe it or not,

893
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,840
We had money for you girls
in his will, but..

894
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:47,274
we talked it over 
after some times passed

895
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,659
and decided to change things,
leave everything to me.

896
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:55,843
We didn't get around to
taking care of it legally, but..

897
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,570
you should know he meant
to leave the money to me.

898
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:05,831
Okay.

899
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,066
Okay.

900
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:11,266
Okay?

901
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,117
Okay.
Karen, Okay?

902
01:00:15,317 --> 01:00:17,482
Yeah, Okay.
- Okay.

903
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:20,598
But now some of this furniture,
some of this old shit you can just have.

904
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,900
I don’t want it, got no use for it.

905
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,780
Maybe, I should have an auction.

906
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,650
Sure, an auction’s a fine idea.

907
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,580
Some things, though, like the silver,
that’s worth a pretty penny.

908
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,730
But, if you like I’ll sell it to you,
If you like.

909
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,820
For cheaper’n I might get in an auction.

910
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,090
Or you might never
get around to the auction,

911
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,188
and then we can just have it
for free after you die.

912
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:44,388
Barbara...

913
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,440
You might at that.

914
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,080
Bill? I was wondering,
You reading those poems..

915
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,020
Which ones did you..

916
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:58,889
..choose in the end to read?
- Well I..

917
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,256
Bill, Where are you living now?

918
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,090
You want this old sideboard?

919
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,830
I beg your pardon.
- You and Barbara are separated, right?

920
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,680
Or, are you divorced already?

921
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,670
No, we’re separated.

922
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,980
You thought you could slip that
by me, didn’t you?

923
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,320
Nobody slips anything by me.

924
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,170
I know what’s what.

925
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,810
Your father thought he’s slipping
one by me too, right?

926
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,710
What is the matter with you?
- I’m sorry you two’re having trouble,

927
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,480
maybe you can work it out.

928
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,980
Bev’n I separated a few times,

929
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,220
course we didn’t call it that.

930
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,590
Help us, with an illustration
from your storybook marriage.

931
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,314
Truth is, you just can’t compete
with a younger woman.

932
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,828
It's just one of those unfair
things in life.

933
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,050
Is there a younger woman involved?
- You’ve said enough on this topic.

934
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,430
Yes. There’s a younger woman.
- Well, Y’see?

935
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,550
Odds’re against you there, babe.

936
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,740
Mom believes women don’t grow
more attractive with age.

937
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,930
Oh, I disagree, I..
- No..

938
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,900
I didn’t say they
“don’t grow more attractive,”

939
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,740
I said they get ugly.

940
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,991
And it’s not really a matter
of opinion, Karen dear.

941
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:22,771
You’ve only just started
to prove it yourself.

942
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,300
You’re in rare form today, Vi.

943
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,100
Well, The day calls for it, doesn’t it?

944
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,240
What form would you have me in?

945
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:32,950
Hmm?

946
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,680
I just don’t understand
why you’re so adversarial.

947
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,910
I’m just truth-telling.

948
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,060
Some people are
antagonized by the truth.

949
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,490
Everyone here loves you, dear.

950
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,870
You think you can shame me, Charlie?

951
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,690
Blow it out your ass!

952
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,580
Three days ago...
I had to identified my father’s corpse.

953
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,100
Now I’m supposed to sit here and listen
to you viciously attack,

954
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,000
every member of this family.
- Attack my family?!

955
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,370
Have you ever been attacked..

956
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,890
in your sweet spoiled life?!

957
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,369
Tell her ‘bout attacks, Mattie Fae.

958
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,025
Tell her what an attack looks like!
- Settle down, Mom.

959
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,965
Don't tell me to settle down, goddam it!

960
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:13,640
I’m not a goddamn invalid!
Am I to be abided now.

961
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,030
Have I been passed over?!

962
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,020
C'mon, Honey..
- This woman..

963
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,370
came to my rescue when
one of my dear mother’s many..

964
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,679
gentlemen friends was attacking me,
with a claw hammer!

965
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,510
This woman has..

966
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:32,440
dents in her skull,
fro hammer blows.

967
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,450
What do you know about

968
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,080
..life on these Plains?
What do you know..

969
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,030
..about hard times?

970
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,867
We know you had a
rotten childhood, Mom.

971
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:45,735
Who didn’t?
- You DON’T know! You do NOT know!

972
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,977
None of you know,
‘cept this woman right here.

973
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:51,519
And that man we buried today!

974
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,480
Sweet girl, sweet Barbara,

975
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,580
my heart breaks for every time,

976
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,866
you ever felt pain.
I wish I coulda shielded you from it.

977
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:06,066
But if you think,

978
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,749
you can fathom
for one solitary second..

979
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,655
the pain that man endured
in his natural life,

980
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:14,187
you got another think coming.

981
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,810
Do you know where your father lived
from age four till about ten?

982
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,320
Do you?

983
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,660
Do you?

984
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:22,860
No.

985
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,250
In a Pontiac Sedan.

986
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,881
With his mother, his father,
in a fucking car!

987
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:31,081
Six fucking years in a car!

988
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,520
Now, what do you want to say about
your rotten childhood?

989
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
Jesus.

990
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,920
That’s the crux of the biscuit.

991
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
We lived too hard..

992
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,745
and then rose too high.
We sacrificed everything!

993
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:43,945
We did it all for you.

994
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:48,654
Your father and I were the first in
our families to graduate high school.

995
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,250
And he wound up,
an award-winning poet.

996
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,970
You girls, just..

997
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,010
given a college education,

998
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,440
taken for granted, no doubt.
Where did you wind up?

999
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,160
What did you do?

1000
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,310
What did <i>you</i> do?

1001
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,100
Who are you?

1002
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,300
Jesus!

1003
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,650
Jesus, you worked as hard as us,
you’d all be President.

1004
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,737
You never had real problems.

1005
01:05:12,937 --> 01:05:14,987
So, you got to make all
your problems yourselves.

1006
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:16,187
Why are you screaming at us?

1007
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,790
Just time we had some truth’s
told ‘round here.

1008
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,710
Damn fine day,
to tell the truth.

1009
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,200
Well, the truth is...

1010
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:29,920
I’m getting full.
- Amen.

1011
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,090
There’s dessert, too.

1012
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,890
She baked pies.
They look so lovely.

1013
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,090
I got a truth to tell.

1014
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:38,630
It speaks.

1015
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,850
What is it, son?

1016
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,430
I have a truth.
- Little Charles...?

1017
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,415
I..
- Charles, not like this, please...

1018
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,520
The truth is...

1019
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,310
I forgot to set the clock.

1020
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,948
The power didn’t go out,
I I...forgot to set the clock.

1021
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:10,148
Sorry, Mom.

1022
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,700
I’m sorry, everyone.

1023
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:16,570
Excuse me...I...just..

1024
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,360
Scintillating.

1025
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,120
I gave up a long time ago...

1026
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,690
Little Charles is your project now.

1027
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,020
Charles.

1028
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,000
His name is Charles.

1029
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,060
Poor Ivy.

1030
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,360
Poor baby.
- Please, Mom...

1031
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,601
She's always had a feeling
for the underdog.

1032
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:46,233
Don’t be mean to me right now, okay?
- I am not..

1033
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,133
Everyone’s got this idea..

1034
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:51,466
I’m mean all of a sudden.
- Please, momma.

1035
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:53,540
I’m just telling the truth.
- You’re a drug addict.

1036
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,570
That is the truth!
That’s what I’m getting at!

1037
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,670
Hey, everybody.
Everybody listen...

1038
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,530
I am a drug addict.

1039
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,610
I love drugs.

1040
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,790
Specially, pills,
specially downers.

1041
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,200
Y’see these little blue babies?

1042
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,420
These are my best fucking friends,

1043
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,439
..and they never
let me down.

1044
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,640
Try to get ‘em away from me;

1045
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,660
I’ll eat you alive.

1046
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,956
Gimme those goddamn pills..
- I’ll eat you alive, girl!

1047
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:25,071
Holy shit!

1048
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:33,167
Barbara, stop it.

1049
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,860
Hey, now, c’mon!

1050
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,580
Give that to me!

1051
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,630
Goddamn you...

1052
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,520
goddamn you..

1053
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,160
Sit down.
- Okay. Pill raid.

1054
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,400
Remember this?
Remember how it goes?

1055
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,820
Search everything!
Every closet...

1056
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,333
Every drawer, every shoebox.

1057
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,040
Karen, call Dr. Burke.

1058
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,490
You can’t do this!
This is my house!

1059
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:16,000
This is my house!

1060
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,630
You don’t get it, do you?

1061
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,830
You don’t get it.

1062
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:23,510
I’M RUNNING THINGS NOW!

1063
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,340
Why’d Dr. Burke write her so many
prescriptions?

1064
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,100
Didn't he know?

1065
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,659
It’s not just him.
She’s got a doctor in every port.

1066
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:41,780
And you knew,
 this was going on again?

1067
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,250
I'm sorry about you and Bill.

1068
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:06,230
Me too, Barb.

1069
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,280
You think, it's temporary or..

1070
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:14,202
Who knows?

1071
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,230
We've been married a long time.

1072
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,290
Now what?

1073
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,856
<font color=#11A8E1>DR. BURKE:</font> The chemotherapy and radiation,

1074
01:09:31,056 --> 01:09:32,056
coupled with the overuse of..

1075
01:09:32,438 --> 01:09:34,038
pain medications.
- Right..

1076
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,374
and without the benefit of more
thorough testing,

1077
01:09:36,574 --> 01:09:37,574
an MRI or CT scan,

1078
01:09:40,003 --> 01:09:43,075
I believe your mother is suffering from
Mild Cognitive Impairment.

1079
01:09:43,275 --> 01:09:44,275
- Mild Cognitive Impairment?

1080
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:45,475
Brain damage.

1081
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,554
It may be time to consider placing her
in a long term care facility.

1082
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:55,186
I know i'd feel more comfortable If I know,
she was receiving that level of supervision.

1083
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:56,386
And, where would you have us put her?

1084
01:09:56,586 --> 01:09:58,626
A psychiatric hospital?

1085
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,820
Well, Beverly’s gone.

1086
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,940
Well, not so much as “gone”
as “dead,” but I see your point.

1087
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,140
Legal guardianship, for you and your
sisters, with my recommendation..

1088
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,485
So you’re thinking, if the three of us
cooperated with this,

1089
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,330
commitment end-around,
we’d be less likely to sue your ass?

1090
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,950
I’m sorry?
- “Mild Cognitive Impairment?”

1091
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

1092
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,040
All right?

1093
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:24,760
Know whose name is on these bottles?

1094
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:28,033
Do you?
- Your mother's a very sick person.

1095
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:30,827
We've a whole bucket of these
with your name on it.

1096
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,027
Evidence for the medical board.

1097
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:39,210
Let's go.
I thing we're done.

1098
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,535
Pull the car over.

1099
01:10:55,735 --> 01:10:56,735
We’ll be home in a minute.

1100
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,595
Pull the car over.

1101
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,780
I’m going to be sick.

1102
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,387
Mom. Mom?

1103
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,367
Mom?!

1104
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,857
Mom!

1105
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:16,435
Mom!

1106
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,539
Mom! Wait!

1107
01:12:27,732 --> 01:12:29,185
Mom!

1108
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,987
What are you doing?

1109
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:38,579
Where the fuck are you going?

1110
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:47,677
There’s no place to go.

1111
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:57,830
I’m sorry.

1112
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,910
Honey, please?
- No, it’s important I say this.

1113
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,110
I lost my temper at dinner
and went too far.

1114
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,450
Barbara.

1115
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,910
The day, the funeral...

1116
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,770
the pills. I was..

1117
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,470
spoiling for a fight and you
gave it to me.

1118
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:25,575
So... truce?

1119
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,930
Truce.
Yeah, sure.

1120
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,920
Now, what?

1121
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,240
How do you mean?

1122
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,790
Don’t you think you should consider
going back to a rehab center?

1123
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,540
I can't go through that again.

1124
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,490
I can do this.

1125
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,620
You've..

1126
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,268
You took all my pills, right?

1127
01:13:54,468 --> 01:13:55,682
All that we could find.
- Well...

1128
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:58,865
I don’t have that many hiding places.
- Now..Mom, come on.

1129
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,768
You wanna search me?
- No.

1130
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:10,497
If the pills are gone, I’ll be fine.

1131
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:16,126
I just need a few days
to get my feet under me.

1132
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,180
I want you to know, you’re not alone.
If you need any help.

1133
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,450
I don’t need help.

1134
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,940
I wanna help.
- I don’t need your help.

1135
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,199
Mom?
- I don’t need your help.

1136
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,992
I’ve gotten myself..

1137
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,830
I know how this goes.

1138
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,820
Once all the talking’s through,

1139
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,000
people go back to their own..

1140
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,530
...nonsense.

1141
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,150
I know that. So,

1142
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,440
Don’t worry about me. I’ll manage.
I get by.

1143
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,669
Remember when we checked her
in the psych ward, that stunt she pulled?

1144
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:08,869
Big speech..

1145
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,569
she’s getting clean, making this incredible
sacrifice for her family,

1146
01:15:12,769 --> 01:15:14,460
she’s let us down but now
she’ll prove she’s a good mother.

1147
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,040
She smuggled Darvocet
into the psych ward..

1148
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,820
...in her vagina.

1149
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,924
There’s your Greatest Generation for you.

1150
01:15:22,124 --> 01:15:23,124
She's giving this speech
to us while she was..

1151
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,920
..clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch.

1152
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,906
I’ve never heard this story.

1153
01:15:29,106 --> 01:15:30,106
Did you just say “cooch”?

1154
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,170
The phrase “Mom’s pussy” seems gauche.

1155
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,680
You’re a little more comfortable
with “cooch,” are you?

1156
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,286
What word should I use to describe
our mother’s vagina?

1157
01:15:37,486 --> 01:15:39,509
I don’t know, Barb.
- “Mom’s beaver”?

1158
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,590
 “Mother’s box”?
- Oh God, Barbara!

1159
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,940
One thing about Mom and Dad.

1160
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:53,311
You have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long.

1161
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,299
Karen. He killed himself.

1162
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,106
We don't know that, for sure.

1163
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,656
Is there something going on between
you and Little Charles?

1164
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:09,254
I don’t know that I’m comfortable
talking about that.

1165
01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:11,708
Because, he’s our first cousin. You know.
- Give me a break.

1166
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:13,940
You know you shouldn’t consider children.

1167
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,573
I can’t anyway,
I had a hysterectomy last year.

1168
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,960
Why?
- Cervical cancer.

1169
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,909
I didn’t know.
- Neither did I.

1170
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:26,109
I didn’t tell anyone except Charles.

1171
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,870
That’s where it started between us.

1172
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:32,577
Why not?
- And hear it from Mom the rest of my life?

1173
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,710
She doesn’t need another excuse to treat me
like some damaged thing.

1174
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,940
You might have told us.

1175
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,650
You didn’t tell us about you and Bill.
- That’s different.

1176
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,850
Why?

1177
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,125
Because it’s you, and not me?

1178
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:49,545
ecause divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat.

1179
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:52,006
Cancer’s fucking cancer,
you can’t help that.

1180
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,572
We’re your sisters.

1181
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,620
I don’t feel that connection very keenly.

1182
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,250
I feel very connected, to both of you.

1183
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,720
We never see you, you’re never around,

1184
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:05,410
you haven’t been around...
- I still feel that connection!

1185
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:08,905
I can’t perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore.

1186
01:17:09,105 --> 01:17:11,410
We’re just people, some of us accidentally
connected by genetics,

1187
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:13,733
a random selection of cells.

1188
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,970
When did you get so cynical?
- That’s funny, coming from you.

1189
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,910
Well, Bitter, Yes, but
“random selection of cells?”

1190
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,196
Maybe my cynicism came with
the realization that the responsibility,

1191
01:17:27,396 --> 01:17:30,003
of caring for our parents was mine alone.

1192
01:17:30,203 --> 01:17:31,845
Don’t give me that. I participated.

1193
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:36,181
Till you had enough and got out,
you and Karen both. I’m not criticizing.

1194
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:38,308
Do what you want.
You did, Karen did.

1195
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:39,508
And if you didn’t, that’s not my fault.

1196
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,260
That’s right, so don’t lay this sister
thing on me, all right?

1197
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,267
When I leave here I won’t feel
any more guilty than you two did.

1198
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,240
I can’t believe
your world view is this dark.

1199
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,050
You live in Florida.

1200
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,010
You’re thinking of leaving?

1201
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,210
Yeah.

1202
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,189
Charles and I are going to New York.

1203
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,220
What are you going to do in New York?

1204
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,680
We have plans.

1205
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,390
Like what?
- None of your business.

1206
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,250
What about Mom?
- What about her?

1207
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:13,610
You feel comfortable leaving her here?
- Do you?

1208
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,370
You’re going back to Miami, right?
- Yes. I can't stay.

1209
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,857
There you go, Barb.

1210
01:18:24,057 --> 01:18:26,985
You want to know what we’re
doing about Mom? Karen and I are leaving.

1211
01:18:27,185 --> 01:18:31,269
You want to stay, that’s your decision.
But nobody gets to point a finger at me.

1212
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:34,193
Nobody.

1213
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,580
My three girls,

1214
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,290
all together.

1215
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:59,330
Hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling.

1216
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,830
You had a bath?
- Yeah.

1217
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,432
You want something to eat?
Some coffee?

1218
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,040
I’m fine. Honey, thank you.

1219
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:19,519
I'll bet, this house must have heard
a lot of Weston girl secrets.

1220
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,432
I get embarrassed
just thinking about it.

1221
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,930
Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about.

1222
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,045
Secret crushes, secret schemes.

1223
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:35,990
I can’t imagine anything more
delicate, or bittersweet.

1224
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:40,923
Some part of you girls
I always identified with...

1225
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:43,614
no matter how old you get,

1226
01:19:43,814 --> 01:19:49,411
a woman’s hard-pressed to throw off
that part of herself.

1227
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,890
That smells so good.

1228
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,400
It’s apple. You want some?

1229
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,909
Sure, I do.

1230
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:09,323
Hey, did I ever tell you
the story of Raymond Qualls?

1231
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,370
That's a Boy I had a crush on
when I was thirteen or so.

1232
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,560
Rough-looking boy,

1233
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:22,118
beat-up jeans and messy hair.

1234
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,670
Terrible underbite.

1235
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,250
But he had these
beautiful cowboy boots,

1236
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,650
shiny chocolate leather.

1237
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:35,810
He was so proud of those boots,
you could tell, the way..

1238
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:41,610
he’d strut around, all arms and elbows,
puffed up and cocksure.

1239
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:51,547
I convined myself that
I needed to get a girly pair of those boots;

1240
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,190
and I was sure if I did that
that he’d ask me to go steady.

1241
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:03,324
You know, He’d see me in those boots and say
“That's the gal for me.”

1242
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:05,730
Oh, gosh!

1243
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:15,719
So, I found the boots
in a window downtown,

1244
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,850
And, I just went crazy!

1245
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,040
Praying for those boots,
I'm rehearsing the..

1246
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,453
conversation that I’d have with Raymond
when he saw me in my boots.

1247
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:34,710
Must’ve asked my momma a hundred times
if I could get those boots.

1248
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,590
“ Vi, What do you want for Christmas?” 

1249
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:42,175
“Momma, I’ll give all of it up just to have
those boots.” Bargaining..

1250
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:49,312
So, She started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree..

1251
01:21:51,312 --> 01:21:54,090
she had wrapped up,
about the size of a boot box,

1252
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,190
Real nice wrapping paper.

1253
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:00,650
“Now, Vi, don’t you cheat

1254
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:04,020
 and don't you go in there
before Christmas morning.”

1255
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,466
Little smile on her face. 
Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy,

1256
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:12,790
 under the tree,
I was tearing the paper...

1257
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:33,228
There were boots in there,
men’s work boots,

1258
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:38,074
holes in the toes, chewed up laces and..

1259
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:39,840
caked in mud..

1260
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:44,795
Caked in mud and dog shit.

1261
01:22:51,876 --> 01:22:53,779
Lord,

1262
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:59,290
my momma laughed for days.

1263
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:07,890
Please, don’t tell me
that’s the end of the story.

1264
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,120
Oh, no. That..

1265
01:23:13,593 --> 01:23:15,106
That’s the end.

1266
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:17,910
You never got the boots?

1267
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:22,067
No, huh-uh.

1268
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,960
My momma was a mean..
nasty-mean old lady.

1269
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,120
I suppose that’s where I get it..

1270
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,860
..from.

1271
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,706
You’re not nasty-mean.
You’re our mother and we love you.

1272
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,920
Is the coast clear?

1273
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,390
Never very.

1274
01:25:29,268 --> 01:25:30,322
What are you watching?

1275
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,880
Television.

1276
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:35,311
Can I watch it with you?

1277
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:36,630
I wish you would.

1278
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:47,340
Are you mad at me?
- Nope.

1279
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,770
I was trying to be brave.

1280
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,650
I know.

1281
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,485
I just... I want everyone to know that
I got what I always wanted.

1282
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:07,434
And that means... I’m not a loser.
- Hey.  Hey.

1283
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,040
You’re my hero.

1284
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,832
I wrote this for you.

1285
01:26:24,032 --> 01:26:25,032
Sit down.

1286
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:42,509
<i>Well, I've never been a</i>

1287
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:46,030
<i>man of many words.</i>

1288
01:26:48,992 --> 01:26:54,125
<i>And, there's nothing I could say
that you haven't never heard.</i>

1289
01:26:56,996 --> 01:27:03,411
<i>But, I'll sing you love songs
till the day I die.</i>

1290
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:09,999
<i>The way I'm feeling,
I can't keep it inside.</i>

1291
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:17,658
I'll sing a sweet serenade whenever
you're feeling sad.

1292
01:27:20,271 --> 01:27:25,665
<i>And, a lullaby each night
before you go to bed.</i>

1293
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:34,660
<i>I'll sing to you for the rest of your life..</i>
- Liberace!

1294
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,590
You beter get yourself together,

1295
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,970
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs.

1296
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:41,170
They’ve probably eaten
the drapes by now.

1297
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:45,579
I’m sure the house is fine.
- Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has got the TV on.

1298
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:47,760
This one watches so much television,

1299
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,825
it’s rotted his brain.
- I’m sure that’s not true.

1300
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:51,030
What was it I caught you
watching the other day?

1301
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,330
I don’t remember.
- You do so remember,

1302
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,420
..some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives.

1303
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,620
I don’t remember.

1304
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,891
Too bad there isn’t a job where
they pay you to sit around watching TV.

1305
01:28:03,091 --> 01:28:06,267
C’mon, Mattie Fae..
- Y’know he got fired from a shoe store?

1306
01:28:06,467 --> 01:28:07,467
Mattie Fae.

1307
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,560
we’re gonna get in the car and go home.

1308
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,600
And if you say one more mean
thing to that boy..

1309
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:16,164
I’m going to kick your fat Irish ass..

1310
01:28:16,364 --> 01:28:18,428
onto the highway.
- What the hell did you say to me?

1311
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:21,192
You kids go outside, would you please?

1312
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,780
I don’t understand this meanness.

1313
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:31,880
I look at you and your sister..

1314
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:35,200
and the way you talk to people
and I don’t understand it.

1315
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:39,130
I can’t understand why
folks can’t be

1316
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:40,950
respectful of one another.

1317
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,690
I don’t think there’s any excuse for it.

1318
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,319
My family didn’t treat each other that way.
- Maybe that’s because your family...

1319
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,330
You had better not say anything
about my family right now. I mean it.

1320
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,630
We buried a man I loved very much.

1321
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:00,310
And whatever faults..

1322
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,910
he may have had,

1323
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,030
he was a good, kind,

1324
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:05,830
decent man!

1325
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,910
And to hear you tear into your own son.

1326
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,960
not even a day later that
dishonors Beverly’s memory.

1327
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,780
We’ve been married thirty-eight years.

1328
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,620
And I wouldn’t trade them
for anything.

1329
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,130
ut if you can’t find a
generous place in your heart

1330
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,270
for your own son,

1331
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,876
We’re not going to make
it to thirty-nine!

1332
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:02,960
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.
I froze.

1333
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,160
That’s --

1334
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:10,820
you have a cigarette, hon?

1335
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,230
No, I quit years ago.

1336
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:16,070
So did I.
Just sounded good to me.

1337
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,710
I thought at dinner...

1338
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,030
at that horrible dinner seemed like,

1339
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:28,010
something might be going on between
Ivy and Little Charles.

1340
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,033
Do you know if that’s true?

1341
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:34,520
I’m not sure..
- just.

1342
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,170
Is it true?

1343
01:30:40,317 --> 01:30:42,468
Yes. It’s true.

1344
01:30:42,668 --> 01:30:43,668
Okay.

1345
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,910
That can’t happen.

1346
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,160
This is going to be difficult,

1347
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,500
 uh... Ivy and Little Charles have always

1348
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,451
 marched to their own...
and I’d expect this to be toughest on you..

1349
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:55,651
Barb...?
- They’re in love.

1350
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,506
They think they are. I know it’s
unorthodox for cousins to get together,

1351
01:30:59,706 --> 01:31:00,706
 ...at least these days.
- They’re not cousins.

1352
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,170
Beg pardon?

1353
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,995
Little Charles is not your cousin.
He’s your brother.

1354
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,950
He’s your blood brother.

1355
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,010
Half brother.

1356
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,410
He’s your father’s child.

1357
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,710
Which means that he is Ivy’s brother.

1358
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:25,256
Do you see?

1359
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,340
Go away.

1360
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,780
We’re just going to...
- Go away!  NOW!  GO AWAY!

1361
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:30,980
All righ..alright.

1362
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,290
You and Dad.

1363
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:39,590
Who knows this?

1364
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,620
I do. And you do.

1365
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:45,200
Uncle Charlie doesn’t suspect?
- We’ve never discussed it.

1366
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,901
What?
- We’ve never discussed it. Okay?

1367
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,210
Did Dad know?

1368
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,410
Yes.

1369
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,482
Y’know, I’m not proud of this.
- Really.

1370
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,820
You people amaze me.

1371
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:01,000
What, were you drunk? Was this just some..
- I wasn’t drunk, no.

1372
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,849
Maybe it’s hard for you to believe,
looking at me, knowing me the way

1373
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:09,420
you do, all these years. I mean, I know to you,
I’m just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae.

1374
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,420
I’m more than that, sweetheart,

1375
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:17,164
there’s more to me than that.

1376
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:23,267
I don’t know why Little Charles
is such a disappointment to me.

1377
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,770
Maybe he,

1378
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,670
well, I don’t know why.

1379
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:36,157
I’m disappointed for him,
more than anything.

1380
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,986
I made a mistake, a long time ago.

1381
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:50,267
Okay? I paid for it.

1382
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:53,130
But the mistake ends here.

1383
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,160
If Ivy found out, it would destroy her.

1384
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,120
I’m sure as hell not gonna tell her.

1385
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:04,287
You have to find a way to stop it.

1386
01:33:04,487 --> 01:33:08,674
You have to put a stop to it.

1387
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,860
Hold it.

1388
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,630
Don’t let it out.

1389
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,010
That’s a kick, huh?

1390
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:17,247
If you won’t look,
there’s no point in showing them to you.

1391
01:34:17,447 --> 01:34:18,990
Okay, okay.
I'll look.

1392
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,700
You’re gonna get us both in trouble.

1393
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,660
I’m white and over thirty.
I don’t get in trouble.

1394
01:34:29,074 --> 01:34:30,267
Oh my God...

1395
01:34:30,467 --> 01:34:31,467
Oh, my God!

1396
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,180
Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

1397
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,180
Stop! Stop!

1398
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,920
What is wrong with you?

1399
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,720
Steve!

1400
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,650
What happened?

1401
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,785
She was messing with Jean?

1402
01:34:47,985 --> 01:34:48,985
Baby are you okay?

1403
01:34:49,185 --> 01:34:51,996
Jean, what are you doing up?

1404
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:53,196
Do I need to call a doctor?

1405
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,700
I don’t know.

1406
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,520
Johnna, what’s going on?

1407
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,714
He was messing with Jean,
so, I tuned him up.

1408
01:34:59,914 --> 01:35:00,914
Messing with, what do you mean,
messing with?

1409
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,793
He was kissing and grabbing her.

1410
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,475
I’ll murder you, you prick!

1411
01:35:05,675 --> 01:35:06,675
You know how old that girl is?

1412
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:11,440
She's fourteen years old!
- I didn’t do anything!

1413
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,589
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- Just back off, Barbara!

1414
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:16,400
That son-of-a-bitch is a sociopath!

1415
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,399
What is the matter with you?
Will you please stop freaking out?

1416
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,330
Why don’t you start at the beginning?

1417
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,860
What are you even doing up?
- Sweetheart, we need to know what went on here.

1418
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,890
Nothing “went on.”

1419
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:33,310
Nothing, okay? Can we not turn
everything a federal case here? okay..

1420
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,810
I came down smoked a little pot.
Smoked a little pot and..

1421
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:41,045
we were just goofing around
and then everything just got a little bit crazy.

1422
01:35:41,245 --> 01:35:43,772
What have I told you about smoking that shit?!
- Then Johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel?

1423
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,623
Just tell me what he did!
- He didn’t do anything!

1424
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,456
What’s the big deal?
- The big deal, Jean,

1425
01:35:50,656 --> 01:35:51,656
is that you’re fourteen years old.

1426
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,440
Just a few years younger than
you like ‘em.

1427
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,304
I hate you!

1428
01:36:00,504 --> 01:36:03,404
What’s the matter with you?

1429
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,770
Jean.

1430
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,532
I can do without a speech.
- Where is he?

1431
01:36:17,732 --> 01:36:20,601
Out at the car. We’re leaving.
Back to Florida, tonight, now.

1432
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,560
Me and Steve, together.

1433
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,144
You wannna give me some grief about that?
- Now you wait goddamn it.

1434
01:36:26,344 --> 01:36:29,128
You better find out from Jean
exactly what went on..

1435
01:36:29,328 --> 01:36:30,328
before you start pointing fingers.

1436
01:36:30,528 --> 01:36:34,067
Because, I doubt Jean’s
blameless in all this.

1437
01:36:34,267 --> 01:36:36,659
And I’m not saying that I blame her..

1438
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:40,744
just cause I said she’s not blameless,
It doesn’t mean I’ve blamed her.

1439
01:36:40,944 --> 01:36:45,021
I’m saying she might
share in the responsibility.

1440
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,580
It’s not cut and dried,

1441
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:51,226
It lives where everything lives,
somewhere in the middle.

1442
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,069
Where the rest of us live,

1443
01:36:53,269 --> 01:36:55,216
everyone but you.
- Karen--

1444
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:56,850
I'm no angel myself.

1445
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:59,590
I’ve done some things
I’m not proud of.

1446
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:02,560
Things you’ll never know about.

1447
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:06,040
And, I may even have to do some things
I’m not proud of again.

1448
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:12,045
Cause, life puts you in a corner that way.

1449
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,537
Anyway..
You have your own hash to settle.

1450
01:37:17,737 --> 01:37:21,387
Before you start making
speeches to the rest of us.

1451
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:26,142
And, Come January...
I’ll be in Belize.

1452
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:32,628
Doesn’t that sound nice?

1453
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,284
I’m taking Jean with me,
heading back to Colorado in the morning.

1454
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,400
You're never coming back to me,
Are you, Bill?

1455
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,720
Never say, never.

1456
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:11,150
But no.

1457
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,680
And I’ll probably never really
understand why, am I?

1458
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,600
Probably not.

1459
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,360
Where are Bill and Jean going?

1460
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,980
Karen, left too?

1461
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:11,970
Yeah.

1462
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:14,050
Is mom clean?

1463
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:19,289
She’s moderately clean.
- Moderately?

1464
01:39:19,489 --> 01:39:20,772
You don’t like moderately?
Then let’s say..

1465
01:39:20,972 --> 01:39:21,972
...tolerably.
Is she clean, or not?

1466
01:39:22,172 --> 01:39:23,172
Back off.
- I'm nervous.

1467
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,130
Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.
- I have to tell her, though.

1468
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,050
We’re leaving for New York tomorrow.

1469
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,440
I don't think, it's a good idea.
For you and Charles to take this any further.

1470
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,507
Where is this coming from?

1471
01:39:34,707 --> 01:39:35,669
There's lot of fish in the sea.

1472
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:39,311
Surely you can rule out the one single man
in the world you’re related to.

1473
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:40,511
I love the man I’m related to.

1474
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:43,762
Fuck love, what a crock of shit.
Love..

1475
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:48,232
People can convince themselves
they love a painted rock.

1476
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:51,580
Looks great. What is it?

1477
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,780
Catfish.

1478
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,231
Bottom feeders, my favorite.

1479
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:59,339
You’re nearly fifty years old, Ivy,
you can’t go to New York, you’ll break a hip.

1480
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:03,267
Here, Eat your catfish.
- Oh, you're infuriating..

1481
01:40:03,467 --> 01:40:05,951
I'm not the one,
who's fucking my cousin.

1482
01:40:06,484 --> 01:40:08,090
I have lived in this town,
year in and year out,

1483
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:10,320
hoping against hope someone
would come into my life..

1484
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,651
Don’t get all Carson McCullers on me.

1485
01:40:12,851 --> 01:40:18,227
Now, wipe that tragic look off
your face and eat some catfish.

1486
01:40:25,435 --> 01:40:27,305
Howdy, Mom.
- What’s howdy about it?

1487
01:40:27,505 --> 01:40:29,453
Look, catfish for lunch.
Johnna!

1488
01:40:29,653 --> 01:40:32,369
You hungry?
- Ivy, you should smile. Like me.

1489
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:34,757
Mom needs her lunch, please.

1490
01:40:34,957 --> 01:40:36,420
I’m not hungry.

1491
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,833
You didn’t eaten anything today.
You didn’t eat anything yesterday.

1492
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,033
I’m not hungry.

1493
01:40:40,233 --> 01:40:42,379
You're eating, do what I say.

1494
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:44,524
Everyone do what I say.

1495
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:48,439
Why aren’t either of you is dressed?

1496
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,330
It's not like we're sitting here naked.

1497
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,820
Right, we are dressed.
Or, should we be dressed up?

1498
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,940
Right, cos you're coming over for fish?

1499
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,530
I'll eat in my room.
- That's fine, thank you.

1500
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:01,774
Eat.
- No.

1501
01:41:01,974 --> 01:41:02,974
Eat it, Mom.

1502
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:05,270
Eat it.
- No.

1503
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:07,550
Eat it, you fucker.
Eat that catfish.

1504
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:08,750
Go to hell.

1505
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:11,755
That ain’t cutting fucking ice with me.
Eat that fucking fish.

1506
01:41:11,955 --> 01:41:12,955
Mom, I have something to talk to you about.
- No you don’t.

1507
01:41:13,155 --> 01:41:15,357
Barbara--
- No you don’t. Shut up.

1508
01:41:15,557 --> 01:41:16,557
Shut the fuck up.

1509
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,240
Please--
- What’s to talk about?

1510
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,393
Forget it. Eat that fucking fish.
- I’m not hungry.

1511
01:41:22,593 --> 01:41:23,720
EAT THE FISH, BITCH!

1512
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,920
Barbara...!

1513
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,921
Okay, fine, fuck it,
do what you want.

1514
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:35,080
I have to tell you something.

1515
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:38,408
Ivy’s a lesbian.
- Barbara--

1516
01:41:38,608 --> 01:41:40,630
No, you’re not.
- No, I’m not--

1517
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:42,321
Yes, you are.
Did you eat your fish?

1518
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:43,521
Barbara, stop it!

1519
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:45,967
Mom, please.
This is important.

1520
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:49,368
Eat your fish. Eat your fish.
Eat your fish.

1521
01:41:49,568 --> 01:41:51,349
What the fuck!

1522
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:54,440
I have something to say.
- Are we breaking shit now? huh?

1523
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:56,280
‘cause I can break shit!

1524
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,520
Hey, see, we can all break shit.

1525
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,069
Charles and I..
- You don’t want to break shit with me,

1526
01:42:02,269 --> 01:42:03,269
muthah-fuckah..
- Charles and I

1527
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,570
Johnna?! Little spill in here!

1528
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,770
Barbara, stop it!

1529
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:10,710
Mom, Charles and I..

1530
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:13,386
Little Charles.
- Barbara --

1531
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,361
You gotta say Little Charles or she
is not gonna know who you’re talking about.

1532
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,210
Little Charles and I...

1533
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:22,100
Little Charles and I are --

1534
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:25,450
Little Charles and you
are brother and sister.

1535
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:27,690
I know that.

1536
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,140
What? No,

1537
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:33,620
Little Charles and I..

1538
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,330
I’ve always known that.

1539
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:39,770
I told you, nobody slips anything by me.

1540
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,132
Mom --
- Don’t listen.

1541
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:45,540
I knew the whole time
Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on.

1542
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:49,562
Charlie should have known too,
if he wasn’t smoking all that grass.

1543
01:42:49,762 --> 01:42:51,310
It’s the pills talking.
- Pills can't talk.

1544
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:54,360
Your father tore himself up over it,

1545
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:57,193
thirty some-odd years, but..

1546
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,350
Beverly wouldn’t have been Beverly
if he didn’t have plenty to brood about.

1547
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,582
Mom, what are you about?

1548
01:43:04,782 --> 01:43:07,751
Better you girls know now though,
now you’re older.

1549
01:43:07,951 --> 01:43:10,908
You never know when someone
might need a kidney.

1550
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,932
Why in God’s name
did you tell me this?

1551
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,270
Hey, what do you care?

1552
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:22,490
You’re monsters.

1553
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:24,970
Come on now!
- Monsters...

1554
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:29,826
Who’s the injured party here?

1555
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:35,050
Ivy, listen...
- You will never see me, again.

1556
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:38,155
Mattie Fae told me,
I didn’t know what to do.

1557
01:43:38,355 --> 01:43:39,355
I was trying to protect you.

1558
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:41,543
We’ll go anyway,
we’ll still go away.

1559
01:43:41,743 --> 01:43:44,866
This is not my fault.
Mom told you! It wasn’t me, it was Mom!

1560
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,850
There’s no difference.

1561
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:13,390
Ivy..Ivy!

1562
01:44:23,788 --> 01:44:25,676
Ivy!

1563
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:05,709
We couldn’t let Ivy run off
with Little Charles.

1564
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,060
Just wouldn’t be right.

1565
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,650
She’ll be back.

1566
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:18,586
She’s a sweet girl, Ivy,
and I love her to death. But..

1567
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,620
she isn’t strong.

1568
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,640
Not like you.

1569
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:26,610
Or me.

1570
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:31,278
You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?

1571
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:32,990
Oh sure.

1572
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,190
Sure.

1573
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:36,230
But, I never told them I knew.

1574
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:38,740
But your father knew.
He knew I knew.

1575
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:42,100
But, we never talked about it.

1576
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:47,919
I chose the higher ground.

1577
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:51,562
If I’d had the chance,
there at the end,

1578
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,762
I would’ve..

1579
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:57,158
I would’ve told him,
“I hope this isn’t about Little Charles,

1580
01:45:57,358 --> 01:46:00,000
cause you know I know all about that.”

1581
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:03,433
If I’d reached him at that motel,
I would’ve said,

1582
01:46:03,633 --> 01:46:04,633
“You’d be better off if you quit

1583
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:08,180
sulking about this ancient history.”

1584
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:11,930
..what motel?

1585
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:14,360
I called over there on Monday

1586
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:18,390
after I got into that safety deposit box.
But it was too late,

1587
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,436
he’d checked out.

1588
01:46:21,636 --> 01:46:23,493
How did you know where he was?

1589
01:46:23,693 --> 01:46:28,969
The note. He said I could call him
over at the Country Squire Motel.

1590
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,230
He left a note?

1591
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:35,187
And I did, I called over there on Monday.

1592
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,560
After you got your money,

1593
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:38,900
out of your safety deposit box...

1594
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:43,780
We had..

1595
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:46,640
..an arrangement.
You have to understand,

1596
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,460
for people like your father and me,

1597
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:53,340
who never had any money,
ever, as kids,

1598
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:58,398
people from our generation,
that money is important.

1599
01:46:58,598 --> 01:46:59,598
If you could’ve stopped Daddy

1600
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:06,287
from killing himself, you wouldn’t have
needed to get into your safety deposit box.

1601
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:11,080
Well, hindsight’s always twenty
twenty, isn't it?

1602
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:14,210
Did the note say he was
going to kill himself?

1603
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,540
Mom?

1604
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:22,190
If I had my..

1605
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,660
wits about me, maybe
I might’ve done it different. But..

1606
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,620
I was,

1607
01:47:29,730 --> 01:47:30,740
your father and me both,

1608
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:33,540
we were...
- You were both fucked-up...

1609
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,950
You were fucked-up...

1610
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:39,166
You are fucked-up.

1611
01:47:39,366 --> 01:47:45,030
You’d better understand this,
you smug little ingrate.

1612
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:49,940
There’s only  one reason Beverly
killed himself and that’s you.

1613
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:54,729
Think there’s any way he would’ve done
what he did if you were still here?

1614
01:47:54,929 --> 01:47:55,929
No,

1615
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:00,770
just him and me,
in this house, alone in the dark,

1616
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:04,747
abandoned, wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort.

1617
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:05,920
Oh, yes..

1618
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:11,186
You stick that knife of judgment in me,
go ahead, but make no mistake,

1619
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:14,310
his blood is just as much on your hands
as it is on mine.

1620
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,920
He did this though,

1621
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:20,070
This is his doing, not ours.

1622
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,830
Can you imagine anything more cruel,
to make me responsible?

1623
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:29,030
Why?

1624
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:33,012
Just to weaken me,
make me prove my character?

1625
01:48:33,212 --> 01:48:37,307
So, No. I waited, I waited to get my hands
on that safety deposit box.

1626
01:48:37,507 --> 01:48:39,075
But, I would have waited anyway.

1627
01:48:39,275 --> 01:48:42,089
You want to show who’s stronger, Bev?

1628
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:45,873
Nobody’s stronger than me, goddamn it.
When nothing is left,

1629
01:48:46,073 --> 01:48:48,416
when everything is gone
and disappeared,

1630
01:48:48,616 --> 01:48:51,048
I’ll be here.

1631
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,700
Who’s stronger now,
you son-of-a-bitch?!

1632
01:49:01,965 --> 01:49:03,546
You’re right, Mom.

1633
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:07,601
You’re the strong one.

1634
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,160
Barbara?

1635
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:28,300
Barbara?

1636
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,040
Oh, Barb?

1637
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:34,590
Barbara?!

1638
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:40,380
Barbara?

1639
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:46,220
Barbara?!!

1640
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:02,170
Ivy?!

1641
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,580
Ivy, you here?!

1642
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:14,030
Johnna?!

1643
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,160
Johnna?!

1644
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,030
Johnna?!

1645
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:58,922
And then you’re gone, and Beverly,

1646
01:54:20,675 --> 01:54:24,292
