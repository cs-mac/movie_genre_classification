170
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,020
This isn't the same.

171
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:02,401
I mean ... why would kids were
lookin' to kill a baby?

172
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:03,527
I don't know.

173
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,327
But he did ...
He said they come lookin' for her.

174
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:08,968
Who did?

175
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,191
The priest.

176
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:13,076
Tommy ...

177
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:17,298
I know he's all we've got,
but that man is messed up in the head.

178
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,942
He helps out at the hospice,
you know what the nurses call him?

179
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,262
I don't care
what they say.

180
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:25,970
- He knew they'll come looking for her.
- Yeah, but they didn't come looking for Elsa.

181
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,871
The cart upstairs was overturned,
the whole room was ransacked.

182
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,941
So was down here, Tommy.

183
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:34,579
Look, I know this is no less frightening,
but you were burglared.

184
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,301
No. .. No, they would ...

185
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:39,238
Tommy, these kids have nothing
to do, nowhere to go..

186
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:40,592
They can quiet, easy, been looking for money ...

187
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:43,569
You think I'm so messed up
I'm just imagining all this?

188
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,089
Tommy, I'm just
trying to help.

189
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,440
I know what I saw.

190
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,179
Tommy ...

191
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:08,394
<i>- I didn't mean ...
 - I need to see that priest. </i>

192
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:10,574
what would about the bus?

193
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:13,816
I need to see him.

194
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,555
Ok..let's go together.

195
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,711
I can't leave the house, Marie.

196
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,835
Yeah you can.

197
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:40,378
In ...
2, 3, 4.

198
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:45,582
Out ...
2, 3, 4.

199
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:47,219
That's it, Tommy.

200
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,439
One step at a time, ok?

201
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,849
You're doing so well.

202
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:54,926
Here you are...

203
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:58,914
Are you okay?

204
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:06,189
Here you are.
Right..

205
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,010
You got this, Tommy.
You got it.

206
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,358
Come on ...

207
00:32:15,582 --> 00:32:16,632
That's it.

208
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:19,588
That's great.
you got out.

209
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,803
You're doing so well, Tommy.

210
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:23,561
Control your breathing.

211
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:27,515
In ...
2, 3, 4.

212
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:32,097
Out ...
2, 3, 4. That's it.

213
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,990
Try looking up.

214
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,179
All right, it's ok.
I got you.

215
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:45,393
Try looking down.

216
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,690
Hello!

217
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:25,124
Hey, there!

218
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:38,918
- Excuse me, Father ...
- Fuck's sake!

219
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,636
Jesus Christ!

220
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,076
Who gave you permission to come in here, huh?

221
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,201
At the time you said they would
come looking for my daughter.

222
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:48,280
- Get out!
- They came last night.

223
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,868
Well they didn't get out, did they?

224
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,950
If you don't mind, fuck it off!
I'm very busy.

225
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,695
Please, I need to know
what you know.

226
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,140
You see their faces?

227
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,382
Tell me about those kids.

228
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,335
You wanna know something?

229
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:28,535
I will show you.

230
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,058
This is insane.

231
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,196
Alone.

232
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,625
To be safe out at the hospice.

233
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,655
I don't have all day! 

234
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:06,967
He's blind.

235
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:10,178
Right.

236
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:12,098
What's his name?

237
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:14,614
Ask him.

238
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,310
Hey pal ... what's your name?

239
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:25,323
You gonna tell him your name?

240
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:27,998
His name is Danny.

241
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,208
He's shy with new people.
You, son?

242
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,129
Wait ...
Where are we going?

243
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,096
No, no, no, no.
You can't!

244
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,944
Please ...

245
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,660
For God's sake, stop the car!

246
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,428
Just stop the fucking
car, please!

247
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,465
This is where the scums are coming from.

248
00:35:57,632 --> 00:35:59,132
North east tower block.

249
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,734
I need to go back now.

250
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:06,848
Get out.

251
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:09,127
What?

252
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,786
- Get out!
- No fucking way of me to get out.

253
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,436
Get out!

254
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:25,332
Act like a man!
It's a building, for Christ sake!

255
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:26,973
Look at it!

256
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,650
I see ...

257
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,981
You wanna know why they're after you?

258
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,125
Because you fear them.

259
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:45,488
You fear them.

260
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:47,568
They see it.

261
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,586
They can see fear.
Sense it. Smell it.

262
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:56,408
Otherwise, they mostly blind
of anything else.

263
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:59,312
- What are you talking about?
- Fear!

264
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,934
that's what they born into attracts them.

265
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:06,332
To the victims, they thrive on it
and they draw you and your fear..

266
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:11,093
..they're attracted to,
and consequently Elsa.

267
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:16,487
Shit! Jesus Christ!
Some of them're watching us.

268
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,151
Oh they see you, Tommy.

269
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,748
They see you very
fucking clearly.

270
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:29,718
- Please, quick, the door!
- There's more others than before.

271
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,620
This could end before
it's too late.

272
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:35,084
Before they fuck spread somewhere else.

273
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:37,955
- Please, quick, the door!
- You're going to help me, Tommy.

274
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:40,053
- Open the door!
- Will you help me?

275
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:41,673
How can I help you?

276
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:47,697
If we open the gas flank on the floors,

277
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:51,332
blow them in riser,
we can torch that fucking place.

278
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,452
So the kids there..
the kids ...

279
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,205
Kids?
I don't see any kids!

280
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,356
Do they look like kids to you?

281
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:01,486
Get a hold to yourself!

282
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:06,723
<i>- Jesus!
 - Useless fuck up! </i>

283
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,772
Go on, get out.

284
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:36,356
- You want to torch the building?
- Condemned.

285
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:40,099
- Infected.
- I used to live there.

286
00:38:41,308 --> 00:38:44,958
We wait for the last vestige
of humanity to leave.

287
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:46,596
Now it's the time.

288
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,262
Let me ask you something.

289
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:56,163
What would you have done,

290
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:59,733
if the lift door had opened that day?

291
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:03,419
What would you have done,

292
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,770
to protect your wife?

293
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,924
You gotta fucking kill them!

294
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:18,076
Let's candle these fuck ass!

295
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:20,335
Tommy?

296
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,757
You know what?
She's right about you.

297
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:26,384
You are insane.

298
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:29,553
I suggest you take a look at the mirror, pal.

299
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:32,517
I have a condition.

300
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,256
You certainly fuckin do.

301
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,471
<i> Help yourself </i>

302
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:58,568
Hey, Marie ...

303
00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:02,488
Thanks for letting me stay.

304
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:13,718
Marie, you were right.

305
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,529
You were right
about the priest.

306
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,583
He must think I'm an idiot.

307
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:24,753
I just got upset the thought someone
took advantage of you. That's all.

308
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:28,439
And yeah,... you are an idiot.

309
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:34,237
To be honest, I thought you'd
run away, leaving me with the baby.

310
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,718
So, what 'happened?

311
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,229
Did he know who these kids were?

312
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,187
Actually Ted convince me that
they're not even human.

313
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,442
What?
That's outrageous!

314
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:46,662
Honestly,

315
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:50,038
and so easy to demonize these kids
"they're not even human".

316
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,311
If people have that man,
have their way,

317
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:55,981
they would lock 'em up in the building
and burn it to the ground.

318
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:00,268
I worked with a lot of socially deprived kids,

319
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:02,528
and most of them is just unloved

320
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:05,998
one of waste from broken homes.
What they need is all symphaty.

321
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,470
Legs first.

322
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:20,147
Let me help you.

323
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:26,446
Wait..

324
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,383
That's good.

325
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:32,535
Okay.

326
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:35,655
Here, first the legs ...

327
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:39,988
Here we are.

328
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,985
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?

329
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:49,837
She cries everytime I pick her up.

330
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:52,963
Well, baby can sense fear.

331
00:41:57,706 --> 00:41:58,606
Tommy ...

332
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,967
Do you ever try talking to Elsa?

333
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:08,236
She's a whole special person all by herself.

334
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:12,342
Not just the result of what happened to Joanne.

335
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,929
- Suede ...
- What is?

336
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:27,263
Joanne used to make me dance
to this song.

337
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:30,756
I don't like dancing,

338
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,111
It made her smile.

339
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,939
You made her smile.

340
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:50,554
Stand up!

341
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:55,480
Marie ... I don't know...

342
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,670
Stand up!

343
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:15,609
Try closing your eyes.

344
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:57,206
It's ok..

345
00:43:58,713 --> 00:43:59,763
It's ok..

346
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:09,114
<i> "Tommy, help yourself to the kitchen.
Will be back in time to help you to the bus. "</i>

347
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:26,596
Elsa.

348
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:34,259
Are you okay?

349
00:45:47,066 --> 00:45:49,016
You know, you're looking a lot better.

350
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,518
I still feel lost, though..

351
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:53,178
How can you feel lost?

352
00:45:53,298 --> 00:45:55,203
Didn't you deliver the post around
here?

353
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:57,299
I worked in a post office.

354
00:45:57,419 --> 00:46:00,969
Besides, it's all the same to me, every city street.

355
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,033
What?

356
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:06,049
Well, I'm afraid to tell you that
I actually requested more time here.

357
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,381
You're crazier than the priest.

358
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:12,497
Yes she , she question me.

359
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,000
- Is the bus almost there?
- They're there.

360
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,208
No way.

361
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:21,859
I'm not going down that fucking line.

362
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,079
The bus stop is just three vent,
like 30 seconds.

363
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,770
<i> Look, we'll have to go all the way around,
we'll miss the bus. </i>

364
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,889
I go this way to work every single day.

365
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:37,569
It's fine.

366
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:38,901
Come on ...

367
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:57,362
Here we are.

368
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:03,251
- Shit!
- Tommy.

369
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,102
For fuck sake!

370
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:09,764
- We should go back the other way.
- You can practically see the bus!

371
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,784
- It's too fuck dangerous!
- That's not fair.

372
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:18,934
Okay, look, I'm gonna show you
there's nothing to be afraid of, ok?

373
00:47:21,295 --> 00:47:22,195
Marie ...

374
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:24,644
Marie, please..

375
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:14,704
Fuck! 

376
00:48:15,794 --> 00:48:16,594
Fuck!

377
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,874
Must ... I must ...
must help me!

378
00:48:59,376 --> 00:49:01,986
Some kids ...
Help me!

379
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:05,583
Please help me.
Please, no, no!

380
00:50:12,953 --> 00:50:14,103
<i> Jesus' Christ </i>

381
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,291
<i> For the love of God,
what ... </i>

382
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,208
No!
No, no! No!

383
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:05,078
Elsa! No!
Elsa!

384
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,563
Hello?

385
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:18,051
Someone there?

386
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:12,148
Father!
Father!

387
00:53:12,268 --> 00:53:14,282
They've got her!
They've got her!

388
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:16,283
They've got her!
They've got her!

389
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,740
- I know ... I know.
- They killed Elsa.

390
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,853
Tommy, she's not dead.

391
00:53:22,755 --> 00:53:26,005
That's what the bastards do.
They take children.

392
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:29,262
What? Jesus!
We should go ...

393
00:53:29,382 --> 00:53:32,526
- Don't go anywhere
- We need to get to the towers!

394
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,534
We need to get there tonight
please!

395
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:36,832
- Tommy, would you listen to me ...
- No, I need to get there..

396
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:40,052
- I need to get there tonight!
- We can't!

397
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,400
Get off me!
Get off me!

398
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,593
What do you think you're doing?

399
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:14,384
- I'll go on my own.
- We can't go tonight!

400
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:15,776
There's a blackout!

401
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:18,465
They'll scum you out of the tower on the prowl.

402
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:21,735
- We'll go tomorrow night.
- I don't care, I'm going tonight!

403
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:31,898
I know where she is.

404
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:34,941
If I help you,

405
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:39,514
Will you help me
start the fire?

406
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:44,508
I need you to follow my lead to trust me.

407
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:47,882
No one knew we will get through this.

408
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:50,417
Sermon hiddden .

409
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:54,769
- How do we do that?
- They can see fear.

410
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,073
Don't let they do it.

411
00:54:57,193 --> 00:55:00,705
Partly, sense all,
they smell it other...

412
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:05,114
the secrete, hormone,
cortisol ...

413
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:06,886
But Danny ...

414
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:09,751
Danny doesn't.

415
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,674
They don't see him.

416
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,030
You stay close to Danny,

417
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:16,724
No one see you.

418
00:55:18,556 --> 00:55:19,656
I don't understand.

419
00:55:25,328 --> 00:55:26,728
Don't be afraid, Tommy.

420
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:28,589
Have faith.

421
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,231
How come he has the hands?

422
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:36,620
I found him in the tower.
It was becoming one of them.

423
00:55:40,762 --> 00:55:43,362
Danny could've been with them
for a very long.

424
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:44,909
He's still healthy.

425
00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:47,802
He understood,
when I spoke to him.

426
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:52,051
The others ... Tower
done something to them.

427
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,520
Poisoned them.

428
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:58,325
I never know who they was,
where they came from.

429
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:00,717
He doesn't remember none of it.

430
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:03,638
Will Elsa become one?

431
00:56:04,649 --> 00:56:06,099
No, if we find her.

432
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,270
Home made plastic explosives.

433
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,188
I saw their faces.

434
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,639
What are they?

435
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:24,235
Demons.

436
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:27,502
Demons?

437
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:33,295
Fuck sake.

438
00:56:33,572 --> 00:56:36,122
Your believe'd just a bit error
right now, wouldn't you?

439
00:56:41,723 --> 00:56:43,223
<i> There was a girl ... </i>

440
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,866
<i> junkie.
Dolores.</i>

441
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:50,307
<i> She was a beautiful girl.
Tragic.</i>

442
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:55,556
So.. in '72, she was found
dead at the bell of that Tower.

443
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:59,190
She died of unidentified infection.

444
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:03,746
But what people didn't know
was that before Dolores died,

445
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:06,285
she gave birth on the..

446
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:08,494
Twins.

447
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:13,422
Junkies squatter used to talk
of dumb children.

448
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:15,728
Brother and sister.

449
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:16,898
Abe and Matt.

450
00:57:21,531 --> 00:57:26,421
They are into bred, raise the spawn,
they will make the new heir.

451
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:33,196
So, they are children?

452
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:36,474
Don't think of them as humans..

453
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:38,365
..or it can be saved.

454
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,450
I tried.

455
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:43,212
I got this.

456
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:47,562
Like cancer.

457
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:51,773
Cutting the hands must the best small thing you can do.

458
00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:44,688
Fuck! Fuck!

459
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:48,690
Danny?

460
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,669
Can not see you, Tommy.
Can not see you.

461
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,460
They can't see you.

462
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:59,304
They can't see you.

463
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:14,689
How did you do that?

464
00:59:15,604 --> 00:59:16,804
I told you.

465
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:20,188
He can hide your fear from them.

466
00:59:21,054 --> 00:59:23,254
Can you see fear like they do?

467
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:26,135
What does fear look like?

468
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:28,691
A red is.

469
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:31,785
How do I look?

470
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,750
Scarlet.

471
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:55,484
Yeah.

472
00:59:57,451 --> 01:00:00,831
There's a fuse.
Set the charge the plastic.

473
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:03,625
Pass the cable.

474
01:00:05,032 --> 01:00:07,811
We tie this to the ignition plug.

475
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,236
Would you look?

476
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:15,762
One of us has gonna have to do this.

477
01:00:16,562 --> 01:00:20,573
Come dawn, I'll hold to the fell fuck I'm gonna
come back to the Tower.

478
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:23,702
- Once you're inside ...
- Turn the key and ...

479
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:25,872
- ..start the engine.
- Yeah.

480
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,437
Right ... let's go.
Follow me.

481
01:00:28,979 --> 01:00:30,529
Hold on to Danny.

482
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,688
If you let go, we're fucked.

483
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:36,194
We're at you, Tommy.

484
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,901
Do you still believe in all that?

485
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:44,762
You don't?

486
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:47,946
Punishment come right out to this world.

487
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:49,573
As a salvation.

488
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:52,205
We got ourselves to believe in, Tommy.

489
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:55,025
That how we got our fuckin' hope.

490
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:29,391
This may gas pipe of the building.

491
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:32,661
When we turn the key
the gas are gonna blow 3 floors.

492
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:36,214
- How did you learn to do this?
- Past life ...

493
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,112
Do you know it will work?

494
01:01:39,232 --> 01:01:41,782
Let's just say
in the past I have done it.

495
01:01:44,712 --> 01:01:45,462
Right.

496
01:01:46,862 --> 01:01:48,512
Now, we open the gas.

497
01:01:56,974 --> 01:01:57,774
Here..

498
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,865
Try this.

499
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:46,351
This is the first one.

500
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,778
Break it there.
Be careful.

501
01:02:54,201 --> 01:02:56,577
- Right.
- Open the valve.

502
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:02,911
Now, we climb.

503
01:03:16,131 --> 01:03:18,795
The stairs continue on
the other side.

504
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:20,825
Come on.

505
01:03:49,124 --> 01:03:50,776
They can't see us.

506
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,590
What are they doing?

507
01:03:55,145 --> 01:03:57,110
I don't know what their shit is ...

508
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,230
All towers are infected with it.

509
01:04:00,025 --> 01:04:02,125
We gotta keep moving.

510
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:05,176
You'll be safe with Danny.
Believe me.

511
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:07,678
Just stay quiet,
follow me.

512
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:12,717
Close your eyes, Tommy.

513
01:04:16,754 --> 01:04:18,204
Trust yourself.

514
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:55,977
You can open your eyes now.

515
01:04:57,428 --> 01:04:59,432
<i> Quickly, this way. </i>

516
01:05:07,685 --> 01:05:09,995
- Just one more, right?
- Yeah.

517
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,882
Then we're after ...

518
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:17,962
- Sound like a baby.
- Stay focus, Tommy.

519
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,180
- We knew where they are ...
- It's her.

520
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,050
- It's Elsa!
- Tommy!

521
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:24,970
Get back here!

522
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,955
- Tommy!
- Danny, please!

523
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,591
The Father says no!

524
01:05:43,032 --> 01:05:44,455
I'm here, Elsa!

525
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:51,227
Idiot!

526
01:06:51,694 --> 01:06:53,344
If you try something like that..

527
01:06:53,587 --> 01:06:56,137
- I want your fuckin baby drown..
- Fuck you!

528
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,787
- Why can't you tell me where she is?
- What do you think?

529
01:06:59,907 --> 01:07:03,261
Only a screaming baby is
gonna fake the job with you

530
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:07,946
We do this fast, right?

531
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:23,488
If you don't like it dad,
hold my hand.

532
01:07:35,474 --> 01:07:37,775
Tommy ...

533
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:44,009
<i>- We need to go up..
 - It's  dawn. </i>

534
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:46,527
<i> We went too high, dumbo. </i>

535
01:07:48,058 --> 01:07:50,048
We just need to break this ...

536
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:00,002
- Are you alright?
- Christ, not now!

537
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,054
Not here, damn it!

538
01:08:04,884 --> 01:08:05,684
Father!

539
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:07,762
I'm alright, Danny.

540
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:09,936
I see you.

541
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:13,554
- What?
- I see you.

542
01:08:15,398 --> 01:08:16,948
So did they ...

543
01:08:20,957 --> 01:08:22,757
I can barely breathe.

544
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:24,876
for feeling's on time.

545
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:29,829
Listen to me.

546
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:32,533
Fuck the burnt..

547
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:35,564
Go find your daughter
and leave.

548
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,366
She's in the basement.

549
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:41,944
Leave this in our place.

550
01:08:42,638 --> 01:08:45,289
- Father, where are you going?
- Danny!

551
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:48,150
You stay close to Tommy,
right?

552
01:08:53,837 --> 01:08:54,637
You know ...

553
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,215
They ...

554
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:00,482
They were mine.

555
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:03,671
What are you talking about?

556
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:06,810
The twins.

557
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:10,871
I've abandoned.

558
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:18,313
I've abandoned ...
this whole fucking place.

559
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:19,960
Jesus ...

560
01:09:22,562 --> 01:09:24,412
I won't find forgiveness, Tommy.

561
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:27,907
But, I can let the ...

562
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:29,795
drift die with me.

563
01:09:34,053 --> 01:09:35,803
Go find your daughter.

564
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:37,766
No, wait.

565
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:41,005
- Danny can hide us. He can hide the both of us.
- Danny ...

566
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:43,548
can't hide anyone!

567
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,602
<i> Go! Run!</i>

568
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,173
Come on, you bastards!

569
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:21,902
Shit!

570
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:24,855
Where's the stairs?

571
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,680
The noise ...

572
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,030
It's a lift.
The power's back.

573
01:10:56,348 --> 01:10:57,148
Tommy?

574
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,840
What is it?

575
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:25,310
Tommy! Tommy?
Tommy, what's' wrong?

576
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,184
Tommy!

577
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,828
Danny?

578
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:51,754
Danny?

579
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,337
I'm Tommy.
It's ok.

580
01:13:05,457 --> 01:13:06,878
It's ok.

581
01:13:06,998 --> 01:13:09,638
- It's ok.
- We lied to you.

582
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:12,383
- I can't ...
- I know, it's ok.

583
01:13:15,843 --> 01:13:17,793
I'm so scared, Tommy!

584
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:21,597
It's ok to be scared.

585
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:24,153
You're not alone, pal.

586
01:13:24,354 --> 01:13:25,754
Father's order.

587
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:29,306
Yeah.

588
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:33,489
But we're gonna make it.

589
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:35,962
What?

590
01:13:39,501 --> 01:13:40,651
You don't believe me?

591
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:43,951
No.

592
01:13:44,936 --> 01:13:47,534
How else do we get pass them before?

593
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,928
I don't want to die here.

594
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:53,437
I'm not gonna let you die, Danny.

595
01:13:55,157 --> 01:13:59,181
I don't care if we scared.
We're gonna make it through this.

596
01:14:03,603 --> 01:14:04,849
I'm here now.

597
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:07,156
And I'm not gonna let you go again.

598
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:09,958
I promise.

599
01:14:13,314 --> 01:14:14,214
Come on.

600
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:15,872
Come here.

601
01:14:33,866 --> 01:14:35,422
It's bright out here.

602
01:14:40,404 --> 01:14:41,754
It 's almost dawn.

603
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,330
They'll be back soon.

604
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:14,365
I know the smell.

605
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:54,346
What is this place?

606
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,485
Elsa! Elsa!

607
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:23,931
It was you! It was you.

608
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:28,738
I was here!
I was here!

609
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:31,331
I was here! I was here!

610
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,329
I was here!
I was here!

611
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,136
- Danny, Danny! It's ok!
- I was here!

612
01:16:41,485 --> 01:16:42,896
It's alright.

613
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,222
Elsa.

614
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:54,998
Danny, hear...

615
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:56,518
Danny, hear...Elsa!

616
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:24,744
She's ok. She's ok.

617
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,511
My God...,ok..

618
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:30,758
I got you, I got you.

619
01:17:58,293 --> 01:17:59,143
Oh, no!

620
01:18:00,477 --> 01:18:02,462
Tommy!
Tommy!

621
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:13,125
They're not gonna see us.

622
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:14,772
What?

623
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,037
They're not gonna see us,
Danny.

624
01:18:24,128 --> 01:18:25,428
They won't see us.

625
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,219
I can't see, Tommy.

626
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:33,615
I'm right at you, believe me.

627
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:35,398
Close your eyes.

628
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:38,447
They won't see us.

629
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,597
They won't see us.

630
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:03,842
<i> Are they gone?</i>

631
01:20:05,457 --> 01:20:06,857
They're gone.
