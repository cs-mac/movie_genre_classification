FROM VERY DISTURBED
BACKGROUNDS,

689
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:21,298

DID YOU GET
MARRIED?

716
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:26,596
I WOULD HAVE,
BUT HE DIDN'T
WANT TO MARRY ME

717
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,531
BECAUSE I, UM--

718
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,733
HE WAS A VERY
WEALTHY MAN,

719
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,134
BUT HE HAD SOME
CHARACTER FLAWS.

720
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:34,838
SOME CHAR--WELL,
LIKE, WHAT KIND
OF CHARACTER FLAWS?

721
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,040
HE LIKED
REALLY YOUNG WOMEN.

722
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,744
I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM
FINDING SOMEONE
MORE YOUNGER

COME WITH ME TODAY,

730

MIGHT BE WORRIED
THAT HE'S NOT HERE,

IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

2042
01:57:57,771 --> 01:58:00,305
AND HARRY WAS ONE OF THEM.

2043
01:58:00,606 --> 01:58:03,075
HE WAS THE BEST, MAN.

2044
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:08,847
THAT SHIT'S GONNA
KILL YOU, BOY.

2045
01:58:08,849 --> 01:58:10,649
HOPE SO.

2046
01:58:14,687 --> 01:58:16,421
WANT TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

2047
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,156
SURE.

2048
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:22,727
YOU KNOW, I'LL GIVE
THAT OLD JEW ONE THING.

2049
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:23,695
HOPE TO GOD
WHEN I'M THAT OLD,

2050
01:58:23,697 --> 01:58:26,131
I STILL LOVE PUSSY
LIKE HE DOES,

2051
01:58:26,133 --> 01:58:30,168
EVEN IF I'VE GOT
TO USE BINOCULARS
TO SEE IT.

2052
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:34,306
Bobby: HAVE YOU
EVER SANG?

2053
01:58:34,308 --> 01:58:38,844
YEAH, LIKE IN PUBLIC,
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE?

2054
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:40,779
YEAH, A LONG TIME AGO.

2055
01:58:40,781 --> 01:58:42,447
YOU DID?

2056
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:44,616
DID YOU
GET NERVOUS?

2057
01:58:45,651 --> 01:58:47,219
YEAH.

2058
01:58:47,221 --> 01:58:48,520
YEAH,
BECAUSE, UH,

2059
01:58:48,522 --> 01:58:50,355
JESSIE'S GOING
OVER TO DIMPLES
THIS AFTERNOON.

2060
01:58:50,357 --> 01:58:52,757
YOU KNOW, THE PLACE
OVER IN BURBANK--
KARAOKE--

2061
01:58:52,759 --> 01:58:55,260
AND, UH, A BUNCH
OF THE GIRLS
ARE GOING,

2062
01:58:55,262 --> 01:58:56,161
SO, UM--

2063
01:58:56,163 --> 01:58:57,295
WHAT, OUR GIRLS?

2064
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,431
JESSIE SAID
EVERYBODY CAN SING,

2065
01:58:59,433 --> 01:59:00,832
SO I THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW,

2066
01:59:00,834 --> 01:59:01,766
WHAT THE FUCK?

2067
01:59:01,768 --> 01:59:03,201
OUR GIRLS CAN SING?

2068
01:59:03,203 --> 01:59:04,402
YEAH.

2069
01:59:04,404 --> 01:59:06,805
GODDAMN.

2070
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:11,276
THIS RUSSIAN
MOTHERFUCKER GOT SHOT...

2071
01:59:11,511 --> 01:59:12,377
AND SOME SHOT.

2072
01:59:12,379 --> 01:59:14,479
RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART,

2073
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:18,250
IN THE WINDOW OF HIS HOUSE
OVER IN WOODLAND HILLS.

2074
01:59:18,718 --> 01:59:19,584
DAMN!

2075
01:59:19,586 --> 01:59:21,520
QUICK WAY TO GO.

2076
01:59:21,522 --> 01:59:23,522
SO, I THOUGHT,
IF YOU WEREN'T
DOING ANYTHING,

2077
01:59:23,524 --> 01:59:27,192
IF YOU DROP BY,
WE COULD, LIKE,

2078
01:59:27,194 --> 01:59:28,927
DO IT TOGETHER,
LIKE A DUET,

2079
01:59:28,929 --> 01:59:30,495
A FRANK AND SAMMY
KIND OF THING.

2080
01:59:30,497 --> 01:59:31,663
WHAT TIME IS THAT?

2081
01:59:31,665 --> 01:59:32,631
3:00.

2082
01:59:32,633 --> 01:59:35,233
NO, MAN.

2083
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:37,369
I'LL BE ASLEEP.
