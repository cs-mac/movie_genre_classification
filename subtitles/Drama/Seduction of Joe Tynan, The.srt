00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,437
Okay.

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,345
Are you ready?

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,447
Oh Ji-young, Psychiatrist

9
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,416
Broke up with boyfriend a month ago

10
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,411
Sleeping pilIs (Trazodone, Zolpidem)

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,716
And even cigarettes...

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,026
Mr. Suh Min-jun?

13
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,931
A business-like voice
yet high pitched

14
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,632
Physically sensitive, I bet!

15
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,941
Sometimes a proactive start
works well

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,946
Since her death a year ago,

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,616
I haven't slept well.

18
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,218
- There's a sleeping pilI I'd recommend...
- Trazodone?

19
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,424
Zolpidem?

20
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,122
Tried 'em, but no use.

21
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,134
KilI him with my pretty face...

22
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,832
I was just trying to drive on

23
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,738
when this huge truck
passed me by so fast

24
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,037
that I nearly jumped and...

25
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,547
Wrap up with extra cutesiness!
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Okay...

26
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,619
She said to me,

27
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,225
Don't get mad at me.

28
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,629
30 Won

29
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,924
is burning at your fingertips.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,131
Are you hurt?

31
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,340
Oh no.

32
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,039
- Oh no.
- I'm okay.

33
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,442
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,418
Doctor.

35
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:38,017
You can erase the traces
but not the memories.

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,928
- Gosh, I'm terribly sorry
- That's okay. The car's just fine.

37
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,839
Ah, well, no problem at all.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,217
Yeah, sometimes even I think
I'm too much

39
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,521
Anyhow, mission accomplished!

40
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,428
I'lI see you next time.

41
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,429
You're a great doctor.

42
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,739
Seduction is not a technique.

43
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,734
It's a science.

44

47
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,931
Give me name-tag, in my heart.

48
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,034
Give me true love, in my soul.

49
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,115
If you truly, honestly
love me ,

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,708
Just hold me tight.

51
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,313
Let go and it breaks

52
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,518
Love is pain

53
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,423
Baby!

54
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,427
Gave my love, my heart

55
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,927
- Yes, come in.
- Good morning, Ms. Han!

56
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,831
You have an appointment
with Mrs. Park tomorrow at 3 p.m.

57
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,942
And as always Mr. Kang
has sent you flowers.

58
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,213
And as always throw them out.

59
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,711
Mr. Bong from Gangwon Province
is waiting outside.

60
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,219
Gangwon...

61
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,825
Bong?

62
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,025
That hick loaded with cash?
I mean, Mr. Bong?

63
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,929
Yes, he's been waiting for an hour.

64
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,833
Mi-jin, telI him I have

65
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,431
- urgent business to tend to
- Uh, well, he's...

66
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,645
Ji-won

67
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,807
Bong Bong Industries

68
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,917
You could've just wired the money.

69
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,516
Shouldn't take such trouble coming here.
You live so far away.

70
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,028
Nah, it's not too far
I get here in a jiffy on a chopper.

71
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,629
Here's the 300 million Won
I promised.

72
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,331
Stayed up alI night
countin' the bilIs twice.

73
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,236
How'd you bring
alI this money in cash?

74
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,743
And why is there soil?

75
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,713
Oh, I buried the money
in the potato field and dug it up.

76
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,812
The land is honest, you know.

77
00:05:55,655 --> 00:06:00,422
- But I don't know what to say
- Why? Not feeling well, Ji-won?

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,020
No, just that the fund's rules have changed
to 1 billion Won minimum

79
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,928
Why do the rules change so often?

80
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,730
I came with 300 million
'cause you told me so last time.

81
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,532
I'm so sorry, sir.

82
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:18,133
I won't keep you from transferring
your account to another bank.

83
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:22,338
Oh, don't say that
I'm staying where you are.

84
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,610
- So, is 1 billion enough?
- Yes.

85
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,721
I'lI bring 1 billion next time
Don't you worry.

86
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,915
Just wait for me
I'lI have 1 billion ready.

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,616
WilI it be in cash again?

88
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,423
Yeah, it took three days
digging up 300 million.

89
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,428
So, 10 days for 1 billion.

90
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,728
You know, I keep my money
buried in my potato field.

91
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,827
How large is the field, may I ask?

92
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:54,536
Well, somebody told me
it's the size of a smalI city.

93
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,815
- Ji-won, you should come visit some time.
- Uh?

94
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,621
Of course! I will!

95
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:10,528
I'd love to see it
The field you've worked so hard on.

96
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,227
I'lI wait for you.

97
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,634
Well, Mr. Bong.

98
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,013
How is it?
WilI I'lI be alright?

99
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,412
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,422
You should prepare yourself.

101
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,234
You have a month, perhaps?

102
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,534
First, transfer this house

103
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:59,234
and the stocks to Ms. Jung's name.

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,743
Yoon-ho, I don't want it.

105
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,509
I don't need them, Yoon-ho
Don't need anything.

106
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,815
Sorry, but to my knowledge your house
is already put up for auction,

107
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,517
and your stocks in the company
went bankrupt last month.

108
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,923
They're not listed anymore.

109
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,826
There must be something eIse.

110
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:27,031
Your reaI estate took a bad turn
and it's worth nothing.

111
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,537
Oh yeah
I aIso saw in your mailbox

112
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,538
that the utilities bill

113
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,011
is five months overdue.

114
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,313
They'lI be cutting off gas
unless you pay the bilIs. I'm sorry.

115
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,821
Damn it
My life is worthless.

116
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:49,121
Yoon-ho, don't worry!
I'm here at least!

117
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,924
You have me, Yoon-ho!

118
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,426
I'lI stay by your side tilI the end.

119
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,832
Please, don't do this
He needs to rest.

120
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,028
Yoon-ho!

121
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,835
- I don't know what to do, Yoon-ho
- Please, he needs to relax.

122
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,219
I've been a doctor, an undertaker
I've been everything for you.

123
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,624
You should act your age.

124
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,427
- What did you say?
- I mean.

125
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,321
Dad, your heart is stilI young
It beats like a young man's.

126
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,933
Of course, boy
When you're my age,

127
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,832
heaIth is everything.

128
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,835
Yup, you have too much of it.

129
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,337
Anyway, I don't know what to do
with that woman.

130
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,940
Is she nuts or what?

131
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,048
Told her I'm broke and wilI die soon
but she stilI clings on.

132
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,913
- Because you're so sexy
- Cute, kid.

133
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,719
She looks okay
Why not just marry her?

134
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,623
I told you I've got you
from my marriage and that's enough.

135
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,729
I told you time and again.

136
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,832
When alI eIse faiIs
honesty works best.

137
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,629
Then she'lI get hurt, dummy.

138
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,129
You need to have
some respect for women.

139
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,038
Don't know if in your days such hoax
is considered respect,

140
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,736
but for our generation
honesty is respect.

141
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,442
I'm gonna go and take a shower.

142
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,110
Now that's my boy.

143
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,223
Ji-young, baby.

144
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,225
What are you doing
my lovely goddess?

145
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,336
Oh, Min-jun, please stop.

146
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,835
- Why? It's because I love you
- You're too much.

147
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,739
- My goddess, sleep tight
- You, too.

148
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,142
I'lI come to you in your dreams.

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,408
- Dream about me
- I'lI wait for you, sweetie.

150
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:56,317
She's loving every bit of it
Yeah, I'm stilI good.

151
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,922
Dad!

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,528
We're done, ma'am
- Thank you.

153
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,132
Min-jun!

154
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,530
Just a minute. I'lI be right out.

155
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,135
Okay.

156
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,442
- Is the director here?
- Yes, ma'am.

157
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,721
- Hey, who's that cutie outside?
- Not again. Not again.

158
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,326
I dunno, he comes here often
with different girIs.

159
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,432
I think he's a big player.

160
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,328
Yeah?

161
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,329
He's so hot
I'd like a bite of him.

162
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:51,739
Guess you're finished
with your new boyfriend Do-chul.

163
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,439
You know, he's handsome
And he's a rich doctor.

164
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:01,713
You should be gratefuI for having him
What's the problem now?

165
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,618
You won't believe it
Last night at dinner,

166
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:09,023
he kept calling his mom and sisters
asking them what they ate.

167
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,527
I just found out
he has six older sisters.

168
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:16,033
- And he has no younger sister?
- Of course he does.

169
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:21,037
His battery ran out before he could
ask her what she had for dinner.

170
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,232
Should've seen
how disappointed he was.

171
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,646
Oops, sorry.

172
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,905
Rotten girl.

173
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,321
Hey! It stinks!

174
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,622
- What did you eat for lunch?
- Spicy noodles.

175
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,427
I was starving and ate two bowIs
Guess that troubled my boweIs.

176
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,636
Keep sniffing and numb your nose.

177
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,543
She had salmon salad?

178
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,645
Maybe I should have some, too.

179
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,514
Mom, I'lI calI you back in a minute.

180
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,921
Almost done, honey.

181
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,615
I just wanted
to introduce you to my friend.

182
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,921
Sorry you had to get
an expensive faciaI 'cause of me.

183
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,725
1. Don't worry. I'm rich
Don't worry. I'm rich.

184
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,231
2. It's okay. Your friend is my friend
Besides, your friend is my friend.

185
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,036
3. Don't say that. I'lI get mad!
So don't say that. I'lI get mad.

186
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,331
4. Do you want one, too?
Hey, why don't you get one, too?

187
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,936
No thanks.

188
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,523
Noh Do-chul, age 31
and owner of S Plastic Surgery.

189
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,823
Kang Sung-mo, age 31
Shinsung Securities' HR Director.

190
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,023
What are you?
My father or something?

191
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,633
Why are you meddling in my business?

192
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,532
I can forgive you for dating casually
before our marriage.

193
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,830
You know me
I'm an open-minded person.

194
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,144
Really?

195
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,410
Honey, close your eyes.

196
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,926
Like this?

197
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,521
Honey.

198
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,026
- Come here and lay down
- Lay down?

199
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,936
- But this is... No, no, I won't.
- Don't open your eyes.

200
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,836
But, don't you think
this is too risque for the daytime?

201
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,741
And this place...
This is naughty.

202
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,745
Ji-won, you're a bad girl.

203
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,220
Relax, relax.

204
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,123
Hope you walk out of that room
a changed man.

205
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,930
Ji-won... Ji-won.

206
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,743
- Yes?
- Cut the deck, girlie!

207
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,741
Yes...

208
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,218
You!

209
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,415
- Very good! Very nice!
- Really? That good?

210
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,324
You're like a baby
who after ten starving days

211
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,022
has found his mother's breast.

212
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,233
You are in luck!
You're a good-luck talisman.

213
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,031
So keep her with you.

214
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,837
I told you we're perfect
for each other.

215
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:48,139
No, that's not it.
He's very lucky

216
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,805
- But you, girlie, no good.
- Sorry?

217
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,215
You've done him many wrongs
in your previous life.

218
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,115
But if this relationship
is good for him,

219
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,318
then shouldn't it be
good for me, too?

220
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,121
Yeah, you're smart, ain't ya?

221
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,423
Did 'you' come here
to do the fortunetelling?

222
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:11,325
While he's with you, he's gonna
strip you of everything.

223
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,429
That's your karma. Yup
Look. See this card?

224
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,236
It's alI black. That's your fate.

225
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,641
And you know
this card counts for double.

226
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,947
Double the bad luck.

227
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,216
It's sad. I feeI for you.

228
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:30,414
Listen, if you stay with him
you won't last tilI forty.

229
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,424
- I'lI die?
- Yup, before forty. Uh-huh.

230
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,526
This toad here is getting empty.

231
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,725
He's lost weight
His cheeks have shrunk.

232
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,234
What a loss.

233
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,607
But can't go on like this.

234
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,316
Good work, Doctor.

235
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,621
I'm so sorry
The surgery took too long.

236
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,726
- You must be tired of waiting
- No, it's okay.

237
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,123
Honey, I wanna take you somewhere.

238
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,232
Where?

239
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,144
Darling, let's pray.

240
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:37,918
Holy Mother, we kneeI before you
to make a vow of love.

241
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:44,521
We wilI love each other
no matter what hardships we face.

242
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:52,026
Let his eyes go blind
so that he sees no other women.

243
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,438
I wilI love him though he be blind.

244
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,746
I fear he may speak
sweetly to other women.

245
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,015
Let him go dumb.

246
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,818
I fear he may touch others.

247
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,619
Sever his two arms, dear Mother.

248
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:22,924
Break his two legs, Mother
so that he may stay by me forever.

249
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,831
Allow alI this to come true, Amen!

250
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,539
God is my sanctuary

251
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,309
Only one I can rely on

252
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,212
What hardships there may be
Do you believe?

253
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,722
I have peace in me

254
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,226
Our souI so barren

255
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,729
Give us new life

256
00:18:53,866 --> 00:19:01,034
Grant us eternaI rest in you, My Lord

257
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,040
Together!

258
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,633
God is my sanctuary

259
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,906
Only one I can rely on

260
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,908
This is getting boring.

261
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,233
Let's be friends.

262
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,313
Love is no game

263
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,615
Love is truth

264
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,931
What the hell?

265
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:32,114
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I was just trying to pass by,

266
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,715
but this huge car
suddenly zipped by me.

267
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,729
I nearly jumped and...
I'm terribly sorry.

268
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,631
1. Don't worry, I'm fine.
2. Are you hurt anywhere?
3. It's my fauIt for parking here.
4. How about a drink instead?

269
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,235
A huge car?

270
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,338
When?
When?

271
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,436
Anyway, I'm very busy
Give me your business card.

272
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,628
Ms. Han Ji-won?

273
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,427
You know SeouI Hospital, right?
See you there at lunchtime.

274
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,536
Ah, sure.

275
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,326
To be honest,

276
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:47,724
my parents passed away
when I was a child.

277
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,836
Must I do this?

278
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,941
No, I'lI just pay up.

279
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,533
No way I'm doing this for money
darn it.

280
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,618
- You're here
- Yes.

281
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,021
You don't look so well.

282
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,821
Yes, I had to work late to make money.

283
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,525
Anyway, are you feeling better?

284
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,132
I got up in the morning,

285
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,929
and ouch
it does ache here and there.

286
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,038
But nothing terrible, I suppose.

287
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,436
Luckily, my friend works here
and I signed up for a check up.

288
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,244
Your friend?

289
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,904
Car accidents are like that.

290
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,211
You may seem fine now
but worse symptoms can come later.

291
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,711
What's invisible is the scariest.

292
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,924
ShalI we go?

293
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,037
Ms. Han Ji-won?

294
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,837
Here!

295
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,441
- Ms. Han
- Yes?

296
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,243
Go on in.

297
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,946
Go on in? Me?

298
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,409
Yesterday,

299
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,610
you seemed so out of your wits
to see if you were hurt.

300
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,512
So go on in. I've asked the doctor
to take good care of you.

301
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,125
So it's not you

302
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,423
but me getting a check-up?

303
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,133
I'm fine
Being too heaIthy is my problem.

304
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,339
Private banker?

305
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,606
This is uncharted territory
Interesting.

306
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,408
A famous architect?

307
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,011
Attractive. Quite a dish.

308
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,022
- The food is okay?
- Yes.

309
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,427
Excuse me.

310
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,032
Hello?

311
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,425
Hey, you promised me a birthday party
What's keeping you?

312
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,932
Oh, it's you, Yoon-ho.

313
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,738
How dare you calI your father
by the first name?

314
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,444
Ah, so you're with a woman.

315
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,411
Yeah, I'lI be there in awhile.

316
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,813
Hurry, boy! The girIs here are hot!

317
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,618
Okay, but be a good boy.

318
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,320
Don't drink
more than two bottles, okay?

319
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,324
You little prick. Okay, I got ya.

320
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,519
Bye, Yoon-ho.

321
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,932
I love you. Bye.

322
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,435
Yoon-ho's a physically-challenged kid
We're like brothers.

323
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,036
I used to visit him once a week
But lately I've been too busy.

324
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,841
- He really looks up to me as a brother.
- I see.

325
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:28,510
Physically challenged?
You're dead meat if you're lying.

326
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,231
Death to liars!

327
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,017
- Ah, yes.
- Hello?

328
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,125
It's me, Soo-jin.

329
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,628
Oh gosh, it's been so long.

330
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,121
You crazy bitch.

331
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,427
I saw you yesterday
What do you mean 'long'?

332
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,536
And what's with the fake voice?

333
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,834
I'm fine, too
So what made you call?

334
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,137
Anyway, where's the The Hot Motel?

335
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,746
Um...

336
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,307
Near Don't TelI Mama, the club.

337
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,115
How could you forget?
I told you a hundred times.

338
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,416
Come on, I can't find it!

339
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,819
Walk out the back door
of Don't TelI Mama.

340
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,418
Turn to the right at BY Motel
There's a karaoke bar, remember?

341
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,428
No? It used to be the Pegasus Motel.

342
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:53,036
Yeah, walk straight up the side street
and you'lI see The Twins'.

343
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,334
Next to that is the moteI with a sign
that says Love Chair Available.

344
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:00,433
Oh, my! A chair?
Doing it on a chair?

345
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,016
My friend
wants to try cross-stitching.

346
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,917
I gave her the directions to a place
but she can't find it.

347
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,523
I see.

348
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,725
Yeah right, cross-stitching?

349
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,424
Cut the hoax!

350
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,835
Playing the good girl!

351
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,125
Nah-nah.

352
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,137
What would you like for dessert?

353
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,109
- I'm quite full.
- I'm okay as well.

354
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,813
- ShalI we leave?
- Yes.

355
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,232
What's this?

356
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,232
Thank you for this evening.

357
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,844
One.

358
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,406
Two...Three!

359
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,711
- Ms. Han, just a sec!
- I knew it.

360
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,416
Yes?

361
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,614
I hope you won't think me rude
for saying this.

362
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,122
No, what is it?

363
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,719
I think you're wearing
your skirt backwards.

364
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,725
It was designed like this.

365
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,928
This is the latest fashion
Didn't you know?

366
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,640
Is that so?

367
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,738
That's strange
It looks very uncomfortable.

368
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,718
- Well, take care
- Yes, you, too.

369
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,022
How humiliating.

370
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,232
Mr. Suh Min-jun
so you want to put up a fight, huh?

371
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,033
I accept the challenge.

372
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,942
Suh Min-jun!

373
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,412
Born in 1976.

374
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,220
Graduated from Columbia
with a B.A. in Architecture.

375
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,324
Currently
CEO of his own construction firm.

376
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,423
- Phone number...
- So what?

377
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,926
Why are you harassing me
at my workplace?

378
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,224
Relax. Relax.

379
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,427
But, you know already.

380
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,032
That I'm very open-minded.

381
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,243
By the way
I have something to give you.

382
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,413
What?

383
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,022
Regardless...

384
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,725
She's adorable.

385
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,027
Come in.

386
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,931
I apologize.

387
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,431
My place is a mess.

388
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,830
No, it's quite nice.

389
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,139
Wow. You have a library here.

390
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,344
Come on, a library?

391
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,240
I had too many books,

392
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,009
and threw out most of them
when I moved here.

393
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,614
I'm addicted to reading.

394
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,713
I get nervous
when I'm not reading something.

395
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,824
I'lI just go
and get changed in a minute.

396
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,119
Sure.

397
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,437
Very impressive.

398
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,143
Simatiga
He actually reads this stuff?

399
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,243
Prince of Red Tea

400
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,846
Doolie's Book RentaI Shop

401
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,309
Yeah, yeah, I knew it.

402
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,423
What is alI this crap? It's alI fake.

403
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,230
What?

404
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,929
You really went out of your way.

405
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,109
Ji-won
I'lI be done in a sec.

406
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,613
Okay.

407
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,118
Today's special, Spaghetti Carbonara.

408
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,233
You might faint after taking a bite.

409
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,735
I haven't seen a woman who hasn't.

410
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,308
Min-jun.

411
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,417
By any chance
did you put apple vinegar in this?

412
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,623
Yes, what's the matter?

413
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:54,220
I knew it
I'm allergic to apple vinegar.

414
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,629
Allergic to apple vinegar?

415
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,736
I'm okay with persimmon vinegar.

416
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,531
Do I look that easy?

417
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,332
I can't believe this girl.

418
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,636
Is that so?
I didn't know that.

419
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,744
I'lI make you another one.

420
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:13,112
No, it's okay
I'lI just have the salad.

421
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,419
This is really good!

422
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,930
- Ji-won?
- Yes?

423
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,128
I put apple vinegar
in that salad, too.

424
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,813
It's okay when I eat it with veggies.

425
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,324
Excuse me.

426
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,328
Where are you, honey? I'lI wait untiI you come.
Your darling, Sung-mo!

427
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,732
What is it?
Is there something wrong?

428
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,438
It's nothing.

429
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,632
Nothing really. Excuse me.

430
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:17,915
Send me another message, you ass
and I'lI crack your skull!

431
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,638
I placed an order in India
to get this tea.

432
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,907
Imported tea usually lose their aroma

433
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,712
during the long distribution process.

434
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,921
Hot! Hot!

435
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,826
In Europe they say if you stir red tea
with a silver spoon

436
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:11,025
on a fulI moon night
a lovely fairy wilI appear.

437
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,134
But it seems tonight
that magic wilI not happen.

438
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,843
Since I already have

439
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,643
a lovely fairy next to me.

440
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,918
Min-jun.

441
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,221
Yes?

442
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,224
You must really love comics.

443
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,223
I've aIso read Prince of Red Tea.

444
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,925
And you borrow books
from Doolie's, it seems.

445
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,733
Looks like stainless steel
not silver.

446
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,410
The tea smelIs really nice.

447
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,318
Doesn't it?

448
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,211
But I'm really sorry.

449
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,813
I don't sleep welI on caffeine.

450
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,525
I'm a bit of an insomniac.

451
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,632
Do you have anything decaf?

452
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,415
Insomnia?

453
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,217
Come on
people would think I drugged you.

454
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,926
She said to me,

455
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:08,139
Don't be angry. 30 Won is burning
at your finger tips right now.'

456
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,208
What a bummer!

457
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,213
That woman was really uptight, huh?

458
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,219
So what happened next?
What did you say to her?

459
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:21,714
Well, then I just gave her
a knuckle rub on the head.

460
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,022
Good work. She deserved that.

461
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,620
Anyhow, she really sounds dull.

462
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,738
It's really nice
looking out at the sea.

463
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,110
Well, the problem
is getting back home.

464
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,217
I've stood up
two nights straight working.

465
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,423
Of course you can't drive
While being drowsy is dangerous.

466
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,631
- You think so too, huh?
- Of course.

467
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,710
That place looks alright
ShalI we relax just for two hours?

468
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,838
Be careful.

469
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,838
Ji-won, it's been so long
I almost forgot your face.

470
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,505
Thank you so much, Mr. Bong.

471
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,608
What's there to thank?
Your mother being ilI and all.

472
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,914
I only found out
a couple of hours ago.

473
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,415
And that man over there
Is he that famous?

474
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,027
The best cardiologist in Korea
Dr. Kim Sung-il.

475
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,328
I had a hard time getting him here.

476
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,133
Anyway, your mother

477
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:20,232
seems so ilI alI the time
it really breaks my heart.

478
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,505
And you, Ji-won
you're really a caring daughter.

479
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,616
It is only natural
for a daughter to do so.

480
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,112
My mother is waiting
I must go to her.

481
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:36,420
- I wilI give you a calI later
- Yes, I'lI be waiting.

482
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,329
Good-bye.

483
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,732
Dr. Kim Sung-il, come sit here.

484
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,341
Why are you sitting down there?

485
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,343
I'm fine here.

486
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,007
The bath and spa in that hotel
was superb, wasn't it?

487
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,616
Look, my skin's so soft.

488
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,209
- The men's wasn't so excellent
- No, you're too modest.

489
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,222
Your face is simply glowing.

490
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,419
By the way
do you always carry that gown?

491
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,722
It's my friend's.

492
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,924
I may not have a friend with a chopper
but I have many friends with gowns.

493
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,746
Ji-won, press the button

494
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,119
Ji-won, you know me.

495
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,423
I've always wanted to propose to you
in a speciaI way.

496
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,031
Please marry...

497
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,537
Kang Ji-won

498
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,318
You clean it up, you bastard!

499
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,918
What a nutcase!

500
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,729
Five.

501
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,631
Six.

502
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,133
Seven.

503
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,936
Eight.

504
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,539
Nine.

505
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,339
- Hello?
- Hi, Min-jun.

506
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,740
Hey, Ji-won. Just a sec.

507
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,104
No, not there!
Yeah, put it right there!

508
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,408
Okay, good!

509
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,317
Hello?

510
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,315
No, not busy at all.

511
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,818
Go on.

512
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,120
There's going to be a lingerie party
Can you come?

513
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,228
Pardon?

514
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,332
You sound surprised.

515
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,433
Surprised? No.

516
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,731
I've been to one in New York.

517
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,932
Don't worry. It'lI be mostly couples.

518
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,643
Sounds like fun.

519
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,745
Okay, sure.

520
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,816
Bye.

521
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,820
Suh Min-jun
How much are you worth?

522
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,230
I'lI buy you.

523
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,315
Hi, Min-jun.

524
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,822
How do you like it?
Pretty cool, huh?

525
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:11,425
Yeah, well...
But I only see women.

526
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,533
I know
It was supposed to be for couples.

527
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,139
But I guess Korean men
aren't ready for this kind of thing.

528
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,935
Sad, don't you think?

529
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,315
I should be thankfuI for the chance.

530
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,313
But, there is a problem.

531
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,611
What do you mean?

532
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,815
There aren't many things to put up
for the auction later.

533
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,828
Can you help out?

534
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,126
Is it something I can help with?

535
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:45,226
What kind of auction is it?
For personaI treasures or something?

536
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,337
Well, you see...

537
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,740
It's a slave date auction.

538
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,642
Slave?

539
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,609
Don't worry. It's for a good cause.

540
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,516
The proceeds wilI alI go to children
with heart disorders and...

541
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,021
I'lI make sure to buy you.

542
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,718
Up to 3 million Won.

543
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:12,928
3 million?

544
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,134
It'lI begin in ten minutes. Over there is a room.
You can wait there.

545
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,931
You promised to buy me.

546
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,639
Trust me.

547
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,136
This isn't right.

548
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,011
Min-jun, wait.

549
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,313
Have you been exercising?

550
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,121
You have such muscles.

551
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,317
Nothing to brag about really.

552
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,226
Maybe I should go to the ATM
and get more cash. I'm worried.

553
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:51,130
Nah, there are a lot of guys
with muscles like these.

554
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,637
- Over there?
- Good luck!

555
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,420
Great! Sold for 1 .5 million Won!

Have a great night!

580
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,330
Cutie.

581
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,033
How old are you?

582
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,630
Thirty, ma'am.

583
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,733
That's not good.

584
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:16,043
You calI me ma'am and it puts
such distance between us, no?

585
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,808
CalI me Ji-sook instead.

586
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,117
We've just met,

587
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,917
but I feeI so comfortable.

588
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:31,516
Could we have been lovers
in our previous life?

589
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,036
My, you are so adorable.

590
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,931
So very very adorable.

591
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,043
How could you be so cute?

592
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:53,108
What's your name, cutie pie?

593
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:58,119

- Suh Min-jun?

594
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,722
Yes.

595
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,131
Do you by any chance know Tae-hoon?

596
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,242
Lim Tae-hoon?

597
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:22,445
You're Tae-hoon's mom, aren't you?

598
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,012
Uh-huh.

599
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,912
Remember me?

600
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:33,022
I came over
and you cooked us dumplings.

601
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,421
They were really good.

602
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,122
Were they?

603
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:44,225
Well, dumplings is my best dish.

604
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,314
Min-jun.

605
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,214
- I beg you, please
- Don't worry, Mrs. Park!

606
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:07,221
I won't say a thing to Tae-hoon!

607
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,525
Okay.

608
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,820
Mr. Lee. Let's go.

609
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,722
Good-bye, Mrs. Park!

610
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,241
Han Ji-won.

611
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,141
Suh Min-jun

612
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,114
It's him again.

613
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:39,215
I'm totally screwed
If he catches me, I'm dead meat.

614
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,224
I might be sold off
to a shrimp-fishing boat.

615
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,917
What if he does?

616
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,524
You wench!
This is funny to you, huh?

617
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,431
Come on, wouldn't you laugh
if you were in my shoes?

618
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,934
Anyway,

619
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:58,131
could he have gone alI the way
with that hag?

620
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,442
I dunno. Probably.

621
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,310
Mrs. Park stopped calling me
and closed her account.

622
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,916
I'm dead.

623
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:13,516
You really like him, don't you?

624
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,027
Why?

625
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,923
If I don't like him
you want a shot at him?

626
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,925
No, not exactly that, but...

627
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,435
Hey! Give it up.

628
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,935
Our daily event at Tribeca!

629
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,807
Let's go nuts.

630
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,414
The Sexy Dance Contest!

631
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,614
Get off the stage! Out!

632
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,225
Look at her go.

633
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:58,323
What are they doing?
So vulgar. Lunatics.

634
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,334
What if their parents knew?
So disgraceful.

635
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,631
Why? It looks like fun.

636
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,608
Today's contestants are pretty bad!

637
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,707
Anyone eIse
who would like to take a shot?

638
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,818
Your prize is a flight to Europe.

639
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,420
What? Europe?

640
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,625
- I'm going!
- Again?

641
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,127
Do I have to do it for her again?

642
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,545
You dummy
you're trembling like a wet dog.

643
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,909
Satisfied now?

644
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,516
Wouldn't you be?

645
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,322
Ji-won!

646
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,026
It's Min-jun. I'm sick, okay?

647
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,922
What brings you here?

648
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,135
Got drowned or something?

649
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:17,729
No, I'm sweating
because I'm very ill.

650
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:22,834
She told me she was sick
but I dragged her here for a beer,

651
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:25,504
and she got even sicker.

652
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,916
How could you let her get so ill?

653
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,717
She could die from dehydration!

654
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,624
Ji-won! Ji-won!

655
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,330
She's losing it.

656
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,826
I'm taking her to the hospital!

657
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,435
What?

658
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,436
Ji-won! Ji-won!

659
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,439
Hang on! Ji-won!

660
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,515
Oh, my back.

661
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,422
Han Ji-won.

662
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,722
Ji-won! Ji-won!

663
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,126
Ji-won! Wake up!
Ji-won, wake up! Ji-won!

664
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,632
Yeah, you bastard
Just kilI me, wilI ya?

665
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,835
Ji-won, please wake up!

666
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,236
Ji-won, please wake up! Ji-won!

667
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,741
Please, calm down first!

668
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,505
- Check her blood pressure
- Doctor, please save her!

669
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,013
- 190/140! It's very high!
- 40.2 degrees.

670
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,317
But why is there so much water
on the patient's body?

671
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,118
It's sweat. Her sweat.

672
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,021
- Sweat!
- Sweat!

673
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,128
She has severe dehydration.

674
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:50,727
Ms. Kim, a shot of Ativan
and get a 1 liter of D5W.

675
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,334
Yes, doctor!

676
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,439
Ji-won.

677
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,441
The doctor's going to give you a shot.

678
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,308
Two shots, in fact.

679
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,928
- Wait a sec!
- What's the matter?

680
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,627
- Is she allergic to something?
- No, that's not it.

681
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:29,226
Ji-won may be angry
to see needle marks

682
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,634
on her delicate arm.

683
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,640
Now you're talking.

684
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,437
Couldn't you give her
the shot on her rear?

685
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,604
Shit! He's asking for it.

686
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,418
- She seems heavier than I thought
- I'lI do it. Allow me.

687
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,021
Yes, sure.

688
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,432
Please step outside for a second
while I give the shot.

689
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,440
She's my wife.

690
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,443
Okay.

691
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,217
Spasm! Spasm!

692
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:19,121
- Hold her down!
- Down?

693
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,632
No, that's enough!
You'lI suffocate her!

694
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,040
I gave her a shot
so she'lI be better soon.

695
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,811
Thank you.

696
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:49,917
What's that smirk on his face?

697
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,613
That face...

698
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,717
Is he laughing at me?

699
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,417
How's that?

700
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,820
Ms. Han Ji-won's guardian!

701
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,933
- Yes?
- Please filI out this form.

702
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,329
No. Gotta hold on.

703
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,912
Suh Min-jun. Just you wait.

704
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:30,421
I'lI finish you no matter what.

705
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,824
There's no change!

706
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:43,835
200 joules. Three, two, one, shock!

707
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,141
StilI the same, doctor!

708
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,313
- What do we do?
- 100 joules higher!

709
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,412
Patient:Han Ji-won
Guardian:Suh Min-jun

710
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:57,912
- No change?
- None.

711
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,512
Did I go too far?

712
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,517
Did you know this?

713
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,825
Stir red tea with a silver spoon
on a fulI moon night,

714
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,331
and a cute fairy wilI appear.

715
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,830
Cute like moi.

716
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:22,533
- You haven't had sex lately, have you?
- No, why?

717
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,309
Then...then, why does your skin

718
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:31,614
glow like those really lucky girIs

719
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,419
who get a dozen orgasms
every single night?

720
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:43,630
Hey, sex is not
just making out naked.

721
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,831
I know that.

722
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,537
So, you pulI your top down
a bit just so...

723
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,836
And do oraI sex like this.

724
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,444
Stupid!

725
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:02,416
Making a man
want me so bad at times.

726
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:08,618
Just stealing
a look at his eyes or lips.

727
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,022
AlI that can aIso be sex.

728
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,426
- Are you a pervert?
- I bet Min-jun thinks the same.

729
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,626
Yeah, you weirdos
are perfect for each other.

730
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:25,537
I bet Min-jun is dying right now.

731
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:31,312
If my calculations are correct
by this weekend...

732
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,717
See?

733
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,322
- Hi, Min-jun. What is it?
- Hey, Ji-won.

734
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:44,426
Do you want to go
for a drive tomorrow?

735
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,826
Uh, sorry, but I have a seminar.

736
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,934
What? A seminar? On a weekend?

737
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,134
And, it's in Cheju Island.

738
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,535
Cheju Island?

739
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,944
Cheju? You're not going to...

740
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,713
Yeah, I'm disappointed, too.

741
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,715
It's gonna start at six
and end in one hour.

742
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,411
That's great. I can go to Cheju.

743
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,114
Really? You mean it?

744
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,821
You said it was just an hour
I can wait.

745
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,521
Well, if you say so, Min-jun.

746
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,531
I'lI see you at the airport at two.

747
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,537
What was Cheju Island about?

748
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,733
A seminar? On the weekend?

749
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,436
Yeah, right.

750
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,112
Don't wanna make the first move, huh?

751
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,312
Sure, of course
You have a reputation to maintain.

752
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:48,617
You should never go to him
Have him come to you.

753
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,123
He's coming to Cheju to see me.

754
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:56,220
That means I won and he lost.

755
01:03:56,365 --> 01:04:00,131
Ji-won, I respect you
You are perfect.

756
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,033
- He's calling me again
- Really? Again?

757
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,140
Min-jun, what is it?

758
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:06,841
I'm sorry.

759
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:12,209
Something's come up
I can't make it tomorrow.

760
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,410
I ordered some crabs
on a home shopping channel,

761
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,519
and they're delivering
them tomorrow.

762
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,419
Uh-huh.

763
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,226
Uh, well, that's too bad.

764
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,929
I understand, bye.

765
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,034
Oh gosh.

766
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,835
His Dad is in a criticaI state.

767
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:42,843
I heard it all, dummy!
You got picked over crabs.

768
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:46,915
And I'm drinking tea with a loser
who's no better than a crab.

769
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,516
A shame.

770
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,519
Those crabs do look yummy.

771
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:16,805
Why am l, the hottest girI in town
home on the weekend?

772
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,919
It's Min-jun!

773
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:37,632
Hi, Min-jun.

774
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,435
Me?

775
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,032
It's no fun
You know how seminars are.

776
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,613
What? Where are you?

777
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:54,409
I'm telling you. I'm in Cheju.

778
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,618
Can't you hear the tides?

779
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,524
What do you mean why?

780
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,819
The crabs arrived in the morning.

781
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,729
I'm here to pick you up
after your seminar.

782
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,131
Where shalI I go?

783
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:16,031
I'lI calI you
after the seminar's done.

784
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,919
Okay, okay already!

785
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,224
Be patient, darn it.

786
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,123
- Yes, Min-jun?
- Ji-won, are you almost done?

787
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,831
- What?
- There's a problem.

788
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:56,240
We're waiting for some execs
to arrive from Seoul.

789
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,903
Can you wait a little bit longer?

790
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,015
I'm sorry.

791
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,019
This wilI take forever.

792
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,220
Darn it, how do I get out of here?

793
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,034
That's it.

794
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:26,037
Giddy up! Giddy up!

795
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,612
So Min-jun
you want a piece of me, huh?

796
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:32,213
Come and get it.

797
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,527
Stop calling me, damn it.

798
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,728
Hi, Min-jun. I'm on my way.

799
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,338
Where are you?
The lobby or the room?

800
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,134
What? Lobby?

801
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,744
- Room?
- Oh, it's you.

802
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,812
Thought you were someone eIse.

803
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,615
What the helI are you doing
with that bastard?

804
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,913
What I do and where I go with him
be it Cheju, Siberia or Alaska,

805
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,520
is none of your business!

806
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,616
Hello? Hello?

807
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:21,519
God of jealousy
show me what you're made of.

808
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,033
Giddy up!

809
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:35,341
Gimpo Airport
Flight to Cheju

810
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,002
Cheju Flower Shop
Flower B Set

811
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,508
Those beasts!

812
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,528
If it weren't for the seminar
we could be back.

813
01:08:56,565 --> 01:09:00,524
I'lI calI the airport
you calI the Cheju port.

814
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,333
Yes, if not the airplane
we should take a ship.

815
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,917
No? Then how about Asiana?

816
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:23,623
- No? What?
- The number you have called is not exist or

817
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,317
- Because of the high tide?
- you cannot reach.

818
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:30,330
- No budget flights or light aircraft?
- Press 1 for daily weather updates.

819
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:35,426
If not, one of those
smalI fishing boats would be fine.

820
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,834
Yes, I understand.

821
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,719
Sorry, sir.

822
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,422
What? You have only one room?

823
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:58,926
And even that one room just became
available due to a cancellation.

824
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,728
Ji-won, what should we do?

825
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,925
I don't know
Let's check out another hotel.

826
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,832
I'm sure the situation
is similar in other hoteIs.

827
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,735
To get a room on a weekend
without a reservation

828
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,239
is nearly impossible.

829
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,935
Darn, what should we do?

830
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,413
I guess we have no other choice.

831
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,111
Give us that room
It's a twin room, right?

832
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,411
This room is a double.

833
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,817
But if you want we can give you
an extra bed.

834
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,617
- No thank you!
- No thank you!

835
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,923
Sir, I'm very sorry
but is this your card?

836
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,036
Of course, why?

837
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,136
- It says it's a stolen card
- What?

838
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,535
That's impossible.

839
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:53,006
- Try this one
- Thank you.

840
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,122
No way.

841
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,924
That's okay!

842
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:06,221
- Here is my card
- Yes, thank you.

843
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,730
I don't get it.

844
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,633
It happens
with computer system errors.

845
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,928
Don't worry. It's probably nothing.

846
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,502
Ma'am, this too is a stolen card.

847
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,507
Impossible!

848
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:29,117
This is my card
See? It says 'Han Ji-won'.

849
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,112
That bastard blocked mine, too?

850
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,423
What?

851
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,324
Nothing. Never mind.

852
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,122
Exactly three minutes.

853
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,429
Let's eat! Yum, it looks good.

854
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,937
Instant noodles in a cheap motel?

855
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:26,530
Suh Min-jun, is this alI you've got?

856
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,702
Why aren't you eating?

857
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,609
You haven't had anything alI day.

858
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,917
I've lost my appetite.

859
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,120
Min-jun!

860
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,418
Heard of a fish
called saw-edged perch?

861
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,526
Saw-edged perch?

862
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,131
Raw saw-edged perch
is an exquisite treat in Cheju.

863
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,826
It's a bit pricey
but they say it meIts in your mouth.

864
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,335
It's a Cartier in cuisine
so to speak.

865
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,939
Really?

866
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:06,008
Su-jin told me
I should absolutely try it.

867
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,416
How sad.

868
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,713
I had this last night, too.

869
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,625
So you can't take ramen noodles
and a rundown inn, huh?

870
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,026
- Ji-won?
- Yes?

871
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,332
I'lI be back in a minute.

872
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:28,527
- Where to?
- Uh, to the restroom.

873
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:32,834
Be back quick. I'm scared.

874
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,039
I will.

875
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,542
- Hurry
- Just a minute, okay?

876
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:42,713
Yeah, it's about time
you showed me what you can do.

877
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:49,413
Darn it, I'm starving
and alI I get is a cup of noodles.

878
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,937
You bad boy and girl.

879
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,527
Han Ji-won.

880
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:32,127
Think you can get away from me?

881
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,839
You and your lover boy

882
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,634
are dead!

883
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,608
He's weird.

884
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,205
Mind your own business!

885
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,115
This is the captain speaking.

886
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:56,714
We wilI make an emergency landing
at Gimhae internationaI airport.

887
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:59,823
No! You can't land here!

888
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:03,022
Please, sir!
Sit down and fasten your seat beIt!

889
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,530
Don't touch me!

890
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,635
Don't you land here!
Go straight to Cheju Island!

891
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,532
It's very dangerous!
Please take a seat!

892
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,935
Dangerous?
Ha! You make me laugh.

893
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,133
Your face is far more dangerous.

894
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,904
How's that? One to zero, okay?

895
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:24,919
Here!

896
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:27,414
500,000 Won!

897
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,024
Come on
this is a very expensive watch.

898
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,918
Stop eating for a sec
and please take a good look at it.

899
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,731
400,000!

900
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:39,629
You know, this watch

901
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,129
is a Gio Monaco!

902
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,637
- Gio Monaco?
- Yes!

903
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,211
- So you know
- 300,000!

904
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,113
Look!

905
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:59,414
Gio Monaco is a very costly watch
Only three of them in Korea!

906
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,024
Where is the third one, I wonder?

907
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,626
Wait!

908
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,634
300,000! Yes, 300,000!

909
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:33,615
- Is it that good?
- Yeah, it's so very yummy yummy.

910
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,122
- You should have some, too
- I'm fine.

911
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,819
ShalI I give him a little prize
for his efforts?

912
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,527
Why are you sweating so much?

913
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,834
Look at alI this sweat.

914
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:49,130
Does it look like sweat to you?

915
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,739
But you're lovin' it.

916
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,932
So her highness
is giving me a prize.

917
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,611
Well, it feeIs good, I admit.

918
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:00,510
Okay, this is enough.

919
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,610
I'm so full.

920
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,822
Are you finished already?

921
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:16,627
Yes, true connoisseurs of raw fish
eat three pieces max.

922
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:22,635
Wish we could have a glass of wine.

923
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,832
Rain makes me want wine.

924
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,241
- Ji-won
- Huh?

925
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,811
I'lI be back in a sec.

926
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,605
Going to the men's room again?

927
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:35,908
You go too often, darling.

928
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,118
- You're right
- Don't be too long.

929
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,925
It's as good as they say.

930
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,125
The shelI is really good.

931
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,931
A glass of soju would be perfect!

932
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,439
Soju and raw fish, the best combo!

933
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,228
Goodness.

934
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:24,430
I didn't expect to find
such great wine in Cheju.

935
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,731
Isn't it a sweet surprise?

936
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:30,836
I feeI the wine alI over me.

937
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,440
Yeah, and I feeI the cold
coming over me.

938
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,302
Yes, it is such a sweet surprise.

939
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,914
Anyway, why do you keep coming back
from the men's room so wet?

940
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:49,612
Took a shower or something?
You'lI catch a cold.

941
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,831
Oops.

942
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,534
I dropped my handkerchief.

943
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,433
ShalI we move a bit farther?

944
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:09,643
You're very wet.

945
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,317
Let's go now!

946
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,320
So fast?

947
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,316
There's stilI plenty of wine.

948
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:23,924
I drink

949
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,228
only one glass at a time

950
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,926
before going to bed.

951
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,835
ShalI we go?

952
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,831
But what about the bill?

953
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,441
It must be quite a lot.

954
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:42,941
I ordered too much, didn't l?

955
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,613
Don't worry.

956
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:48,515
- Ji-won
- Yes?

957
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,419
Why don't you wait outside?

958
01:19:56,858 --> 01:20:00,021
Now, Min-jun
what are you going to do?

959
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:07,127
Run! Run!

960
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,937
Oh goodness! My umbrella!

961
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,315
They won't chase us
alI the way down here, right?

962
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:25,919
No way!

963
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:30,814
- Oh, Ji-won, you were really fast!
- You should exercise more.

964
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,325
You could've gotten caught
running so slow.

965
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,928
Some nerve.

966
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,429
FeeI better now after running, huh?

967
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,804
ShalI we go in now?

968
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,417
I guess.

969
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,821
Let's go.

970
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:10,727
- Ji-won
- Yeah?

971
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,432
I have to run to the men's room.

972
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,534
You wait inside.

973
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,611
He does try so hard.

974
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,810
What took you so long?

975
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:09,515
I nearly died coming here
and that's alI you've got to say?

976
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,523
Are you nuts, boy?

977
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,423
Remember that time
when you owed me one?

978
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:17,622
- I got there in one hour!
- It was bright and sunny that day!

979
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:21,327
Today, I nearly flew to Japan
and came back 'cause of the current!

980
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,937
Whatever, just give me the stuff
I'm busy.

981
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,539
Boy, I truly despise you.

982
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,206
I love you, Dad.

983
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,208
Don't worry. I got everything ready.

984
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:35,816
Thanks, Dad.

985
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,613
- Gotta go
- Son, wait! I almost forgot.

986
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,219
Come on, Dad.

987
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,020
Son, this is my favorite kind
strawberry scent.

988
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,129
Dad, I don't have time for jokes
I'm in a hurry.

989
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:50,322
I'm not kidding
It really smelIs like strawberries.

990
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:54,834
Dad, hurry on to the wine bar
I'm gone! Thanks!

991
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,632
Bastard only thinks about girIs!

992
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:05,305
My love?

993
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,211
Is my sweet goddess there already?

994
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,614
Why don't you have
some of the wine I have in keeping.

995
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,312
I'lI be there soon.

996
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:15,821
Wait a little while, darling.

997
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:18,025
Yes!

998
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,232
Thank you.

999
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,535
This place is really classy.

1000
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,435
You don't have any money
so how did you?

1001
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,139
I dunno.

1002
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,542
Ji-won, come on.

1003
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:50,516
This is the outfit
for you to change into tomorrow.

1004
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,123
These are some cosmetics.

1005
01:23:56,664 --> 01:24:00,623
And this is your underwear.

1006
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,928
I got them for you
since I know you packed for a day.

1007
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,641
Min-jun.

1008
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,211
It was too late
and alI the shops were closed.

1009
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:14,110
I had to beg to go
in some of the shops to get these.

1010
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:17,912
So don't complain
even if you don't like them.

1011
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,220
Of course I won't.

1012
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,915
I'm sure I'lI like them
No, I do like them!

1013
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,429
You are soaked.

1014
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,633
You might catch a cold.

1015
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,038
You're even wetter.

1016
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:43,141
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

1017
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,607
I'lI go take a shower first.

1018
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,934
Suh Min-jun, you're no amateur.

1019
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:11,038
I like it!

1020
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,817
Bad boy.

1021
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:24,211
Is he peeling off his skin?
What's taking him so long?

1022
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,013
Darn it.

1023
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,414
It's so steamy in here.

1024
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:42,025
Min-jun, do you want a rub?

1025
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,535
Min-jun!

1026
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:51,438
Thank you, doctor.

1027
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,616
Ji-won.

1028
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,812
Yes? Feeling better?

1029
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,323
I'm dizzy.

1030
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:47,025
You look a lot better to me.

1031
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:50,426
No, I'm ill. Very ill.

1032
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:57,227
- I'm a patient
- You won't die. Don't worry.

1033
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,726
FeeI better now?

1034
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,928
Yeah, 'cause of you.

1035
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,108
What do I do now?

1036
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:14,515
Han Ji-won
what are you going to do?

1037
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:19,512
- Well...
- I'm...

1038
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:24,916
- You go ahead
- No, you can speak first.

1039
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:31,219
You know, my dad wants to meet you.

1040
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,224
No need to feel
uncomfortable about it.

1041
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:37,524
He does? That's wonderful!

1042
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,031
Since you've mentioned it,

1043
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:44,127
I told my parents about you
and they're dying to meet you.

1044
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,035
If it's okay with you,

1045
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,938
they're thinking of visiting Korea
to see you.

1046
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,302
No, we should go and visit them.

1047
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:56,913
How about we go next week
during the holiday?

1048
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:59,119
Sure.

1049
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:15,634
This may sound really corny,

1050
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:19,333
but my parents want us
to go to a fortune-teller.

1051
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,339
That's not corny at all.

1052
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:27,104
Listen to the elders and you'lI be
rewarded even in your sleep, they say.

1053
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:29,416
- ShalI we go?
- Go where?

1054
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,519
There's a really good fortuneteller.

1055
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:37,920
No, I've actually reserved the best
Let's go!

1056
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:53,032
How did you two come together?

1057
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,802
You know who you are!

1058
01:31:56,944 --> 01:31:59,105
I don't know. Can't see anything.

1059
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,614
What should I do?
I dunno.

1060
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:05,314
Brother, my life's so difficuIt.

1061
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,336
Why are you laughing?

1062
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,235
Because you are.

1063
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:28,237
Why are you laughing?

1064
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,503
Because I could tell
you were going to laugh.

1065
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:41,719
- Well, take care
- Yes, you, too.

1066
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,916
- Good bye, Min-jun
- Okay, bye.

1067
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:48,127
Three months later

1068
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:50,321
- Good evening
- Hi!

1069
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:54,423
Well, this may sound a bit forward,

1070
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,833
but feeI free to telI me
what you need,

1071
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,532
be it money or land.

1072
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,303
Money goes rotting in my closet.

1073
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:06,106
- Yes.
- Please sit here.

1074
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:13,409
- Nice place!
- Isn't it?

1075
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,324
Damn.

1076
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,723
- What's the matter?
- Nothing much.

1077
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,925
See over there?

1078
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:28,228
The rich housewife type of a woman?

1079
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:31,135
I dated her a while ago.

1080
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:39,105
Stop looking. She's gonna see us.

1081
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,608
So what?

1082
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:45,913
It's nothing
Just feeIs a bit uncomfortable.

1083
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:49,318
Irish coffee, please.

1084
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,620
Cow milk for moi.

1085
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:55,922
Excuse me.

1086
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:59,726
I need to go to the men's room
Sorry.

1087
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,930
So humiliating.

1088
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,114
Come on.

1089
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:20,819
Darling, we meet
exactly ten minutes later, okay?

1090
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:22,718
I got it.

1091
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:24,825
But what do I say to him?

1092
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:29,719
Well, just say some emergency
has come up at home.

1093
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:31,331
Okay.

1094
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,433
sweetly.

1095
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:37,135
TelI me, am I the only one for you?

1096
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,540
Of course, baby.

1097
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:43,042
Wait.

1098
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:46,411
You got something on you right here.

1099
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:51,416
- Here?
- Yeah, you got beauty on you, baby.

1100
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,419
You're a darling.

1101
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:57,223
Wait a sec.

1102
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,127
- Who's this?
- Who's...

1103
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:07,832
Have fun

1104
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:16,900
Those amateurs, how dare they try
little tricks before us masters?

1105
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:20,507
Yeah, they're funny, huh?

1106
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:23,712
Anyway, your taste for women
seems to have changed.

1107
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:28,117
I mean that woman looked
old enough to be a teenager's mom.

1108
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,517
Oh yeah?

1109
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:33,126
When you walked in,

1110
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,024
I thought you were giving
your old uncle a city tour.

1111
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:38,231
Hey, I'm stilI a head-turner.

1112
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:41,732
Last night at a club
they asked me for my ID.

1113
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:47,038
Probably thought you were
a policewoman under cover.

1114
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:54,006
Min-jun, I'm saying this
out of genuine concern for you.

1115
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,011
Want me to fix you up
with a nice girl?

1116
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,708
No need to be embarrassed.

1117
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:02,121
Okay!

1118
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,420
See that couple over there?

1119
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:12,125
You are amazing.

1120
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:15,728
That crazy bitch.

1121
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,531
You turn me on!

1122
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,641
Why the helI is she here?

1123
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:25,908
Let's forget about them.

1124
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:28,412
Yeah, let's.

1125
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:34,016
How about them over there?

1126
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:41,123
- Yeah?
- How many minutes?

1127
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:45,331
Ten?

1128
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:49,725
Whoa, don't strain yourself.

1129
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,528
How about you?

1130
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:56,243
It has to be fair. Ten minutes.

1131
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:58,705
What's in it for the winner?

1132
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:01,714
Let's see.

1133
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:07,514
The loser grants
one wish whatever it is.

1134
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:10,924
Sure, I have a designer bag I want.

1135
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:13,223
It's been a long time.

1136
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:20,329
What? Give up already?

1137
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,637
Give up?

1138
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:29,040
Ten minutes is too long for them
I can smoke one.

1139
01:37:31,445 --> 01:37:32,912
Yeah?

1140
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:39,918
Do you realize that 300,000 Won
is burning at your fingertips?

1141
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,027
Then, I'lI go first.

1142
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:00,233
- What?
- It's me!

1143
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:04,401
My new boyfriend has a son
who is a reaI stud!

1144
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:07,708
He's supposed to be everything
you wished for and more.

1145
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:09,315
Really?

1146
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:13,513
Yes!

1147
01:38:13,654 --> 01:38:15,121
She's hotter than Britney Spears.

1148
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:16,621
If you don't falI for her
in 10 minutes,

1149
01:38:16,757 --> 01:38:19,021
my pretty goddess
wilI take us out to dinner.

1150
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:20,626
Is that so?

1151
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:26,524
- Sure, I'd like to meet her.
- Min-jun. I've decided to take this.

1152
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:30,136
Yes, Dad.

1153
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:36,042
Alligator leather.

1154
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:41,815
If only I hadn't smoked
that one cigarette.

1155
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:45,818
- Satisfied?
- Yeah.

1156
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:50,913
Sir, I'm sorry
but your card's registered as stolen.

1157
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:53,426
What?

1158
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:55,728
No way.

1159
01:38:58,365 --> 01:38:59,832
You fooIs.

1160
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:02,135
Remember me?

1161
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,737
Kang Sung-mo

1162
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:08,141
is back.

1163
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:11,901
Why do those damn rules
change alI the time?

1164
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,910
Three more days of digging
and I'lI have 10 billion ready.

1165
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:18,512
Ji-won, wait for me, darling.
