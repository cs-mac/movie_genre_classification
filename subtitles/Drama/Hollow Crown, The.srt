Episode 31

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:13,937
Halt...!

5
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:04,209
<i>The palace maiden Chun Dong Yi
is no longer a Lady Investigator.</i>

6
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:09,601
Going forward, she shall be treated
in accordance as a Special Court Lady...

7
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:13,499
... who has shared relations with the King.

8
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,002
Your Majesty!
Shared relations...?

9
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,576
Don't you know what that means, 
Councilor?

10
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:37,200
You're not asking me to explain 
the meaning of that, are you?

11
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:39,880
Your Majesty!

12
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:59,722
- Please come this way.
- Chief Eunuch!

13
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:04,391
This isn't my Lady Investigator uniform!

14
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,181
How can I wear robes like these?

15
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,532
It is His Majesty's will.

16
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:13,726
He will explain everything.

17
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:27,755
How can you elevate Palace Maiden Chun 
to Special Court Lady?

18
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:31,361
That is preposterous!

19
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:36,122
She is a criminal who ran away 
from the Palace.

20
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,973
She is not only lost her rights 
to live in the Palace,

21
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,131
... but committed a grave crime.

22
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:44,106
How can you elevate a criminal 
to become a Special Court Lady?

23
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:50,030
This cannot happen.
She is a criminal that must be punished!

24
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,775
Chun Dong Yi is not a court lady,
but a criminal!

25
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,576
Your Majesty!

26
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:58,862
When she shared my bed,

27
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,487
She obtained the rights 
to be in the Palace again.

28
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:04,449
This is not a matter for discussion.

29
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,158
It is the prerogative of 
the Royal Monarchy!

30
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,040
Your Majesty!

31
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:23,520
How can this be?

32
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:31,721
Uncle, the King is using this method 
to protect the girl.

33
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:35,004
We won't be able to charge her 
with a crime this way.

34
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,186
Ridiculous!

35
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,100
A Special Court Lady!

36
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:44,900
She's about to become a Special Court Lady!

37
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,413
- Let me through! Hurry!
- Let her through.

38
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,848
So they're discussing how to deal 
with Dong Yi at the Grand Palace right now?

39
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,394
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:11,160
Dong Yi ran away from the Palace.

41
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:17,339
At the very least,
she will have to pay the price for that.

42
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:39,212
The peony blooms have all died.

43
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:42,740
It must be because 
it is the end of its season.

44
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,313
Do not let it trouble you, Your Majesty.

45
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,971
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

46
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:53,435
- Your Majesty!
- What happened?

47
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:56,078
Your Majesty!

48
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,823
I asked you what happened!

49
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:09,881
Hey! Is it true?
Was Dong Yi really wearing a Dang'ui?

50
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:14,749
It wasn't just a Dang'ui!
It was covered with silver emblems!

51
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,047
It was a Sorae Dang'ui!

52
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:18,752
A Sorae Dang'ui?

53
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:23,201
But that's what palace maidens wear 
after they've shared the King's bed!

54
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:28,875
- But why would Dong Yi wear that?
- Why else? I doubt she stole it!

55
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,625
- Then...?
- She's been with the King!

56
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,840
She has shared the King's bed!

57
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:44,510
Ae-Jong, are you crazy?
Dong Yi did what?

58
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,512
She said Dong Yi slept with the King!

59
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:52,847
It's true!
I saw her palanquin!

60
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:57,104
Do you think it's that easy 
to attract the King's eye?

61
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:00,129
- What nonsense!
- I know.

62
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,711
And if it was true, 
why would it be so quiet here?

63
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,000
A decree should have been given and...

64
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:14,661
- Where is Lady Jung?
- She's in the office.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,480
Is that really true?

66
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:30,814
I have to confirm it,
but the palace is buzzing with the news!

67
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:37,913
That's crazy!
How could Dong Yi have...?

68
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,735
What is this I hear? 

69
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,723
We have to prepare for Dong Yi 
to become Special Court Lady?

70
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,862
What is going on?

71
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,041
What?
You mean it's true?

72
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:58,758
Say something, Lady Jung!
You must know something!

73
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,159
- Your Majesty!
- You're here!

74
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,875
- And the girl?
- She has entered the Palace.

75
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:13,484
- She has?
- Yes.

76
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:18,886
Her residence is not yet ready,
so I escorted her to temporary quarters.

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,146
Indeed.
Was she very surprised?

78
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:29,561
She was confused because 
she didn't know what was happening.

79
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:34,120
Of course.
Of course she would be.

80
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:55,811
Are you uncomfortable, My Lady?

81
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,663
Not at all.
Please don't mind me.

82
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,205
By the way, My Lady...

83
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,493
When can I leave?

84
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:17,183
Yes, this place is a bit uncomfortable.
But please don't worry.

85
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:21,475
Once your residence is ready,
you will move there.

86
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,802
Residence?

87
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:28,216
Yes, your residence 
where you live, My Lady.

88
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,163
What?

89
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,275
And please speak informally to me, My Lady.

90
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:40,204
My Lady?
What do you mean by that?

91
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,189
Why do you address me like that?

92
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,218
And what do you mean by my residence?

93
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:52,348
I...

94
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:05,248
- Chief Eunuch...
- Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:09,873
How should I explain this to her?

96
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:16,753
I mean, I did all of this 
in order to protect her.

97
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:22,023
But I don't know 
how she will take all of this.

98
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,449
What do you mean by 
how she will take it?

99
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,703
We've had such an easy relationship thus far.

100
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:32,780
But this is like... like getting married.

101
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:35,781
She might be bewildered by all of this.

102
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:39,439
Is that how you feel, Your Majesty?

103
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,918
You don't feel like you're just 
making her a Special Court Lady,

104
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:49,147
... but you feel like 
you're getting married to her?

105
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:52,049
Of course.

106
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:56,746
I just want to know 
how she would feel about this.

107
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,302
I don't want her to just go along with this
because she's a palace maiden,

108
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:06,421
... but because she cares about me.

109
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:16,876
Your Majesty, will you permit me 
to speak my mind?

110
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:25,262
If you feel that way,
then tell her exactly how you feel.

111
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:30,830
What would be better than that?

112
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:44,213
A Special Court Lady?
Who..? Me?

113
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:49,494
Yes, that is what we were told, My Lady.

114
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:54,666
So this Dang'ui and this residence 
is all because of that?

115
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,876
Yes, My Lady.

116
00:10:57,146 --> 00:11:02,648
I...
You must be mistaken, My Lady.

117
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:09,662
- I...
- My Lady! His Majesty has arrived!

118
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,656
Your Majesty!

119
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,313
Your Majesty!

120
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,454
Your Majesty, did you know that
there seems to be a misunderstanding?

121
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:33,386
The Chief Eunuch has made a mistake!

122
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,148
What?
A mistake?

123
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:40,782
Yes! He thought when you visited me 
last night that...

124
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:43,103
He seems to have misunderstood...

125
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:46,499
So the Court Ladies are addressing me as...

126
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:50,085
- Dong Yi.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:54,436
- It's not a mistake.
- What?

128
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,619
It was on my orders.

129
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,567
What?

130
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:15,916
Dong Yi is staying at the Residence East 
of the Grand Palace.

131
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,653
Make sure security is tight.

132
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:21,316
Yes, My Lord.

133
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:27,371
By the way, 
I don't see Officer Cha around.

134
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:31,554
Me neither.
Shall I send some men out?

135
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:37,551
No, don't do that.
Let him be.

136
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:57,651
<i>This is what His Majesty told me.</i>

137
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:02,763
<i>He's going to make Dong Yi 
into a Special Court Lady?</i>

138
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:11,402
<i>Yes, he has decided that this is 
the best way to keep Dong Yi safe.</i>

139
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:22,473
<i>But more importantly,
this is His Majesty's true feelings for Dong Yi.</i>

140
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:21,899
You mean you gave orders for all of this,
Your Majesty?

141
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,651
This Dang'ui, my residence...
Even making me a Special Court Lady?

142
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,437
Yes, I did.

143
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:34,428
Why?
Why did you do this?

144
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:40,541
Did you forget? I told you I would do 
everything in my power for you.

145
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,745
Your Majesty...!

146
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,487
It was to protect you.

147
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,222
I couldn't leave you alone 
in the capital,

148
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:54,128
... nor bring you back 
into the Palace as you were.

149
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:58,867
You risked your life for me 
and my government.

150
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:02,536
It is only right that I protect you now.

151
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:07,245
If you become a Special Court Lady,
no one will dare harm you.

152
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:11,672
Because that would be the same thing
as trying to harm me.

153
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:16,121
But even so, 
Your Majesty, this isn't right.

154
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:20,348
This is a lie.

155
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,406
It's not completely a lie.

156
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:28,609
- What?
- Because I really care for you.

157
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:52,601
- Let's go.
- What? Already?

158
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:55,824
But you should stay tonight...

159
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,699
I said let's go!

160
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:24,934
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

161
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,981
<i>I said give me your hand.</i>

162
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,622
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

163
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:54,085
<i>Do you remember that day
when we were at the marketplace?</i>

164
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,610
<i>I bought it that day for you.</i>

165
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>But I didn't know then.</i>

166
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:10,272
<i>I didn't know that's how I felt.</i>

167
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,803
<i>Your.. Your Majesty...</i>

168
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:21,610
<i>None of this is a mistake,
a misunderstanding, or a lie.</i>

169
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:27,835
<i>The way I feel about you is real.</i>

170
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:34,544
<i>So will you give it some thought?</i>

171
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:43,884
<i>Consider being with me 
and accepting my heart, I mean.</i>

172
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:11,835
Why is my heart beating so fast?

173
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:19,493
Should I summon the Royal Physician?
Goodness!

174
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:48,231
Why are you taking so long?
Let's go!

175
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:51,253
My dear, where are you going off to?

176
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:54,871
Where else?
I'm going to Yoon's house.

177
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:57,715
What?
Why are you going there again?

178
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,959
You can't be going there to gloat?

179
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:06,167
You're not...?

180
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:11,375
Yes, My Lord!
I'm going there to gloat!

181
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm going to go there 
and laugh my head off!

182
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:18,766
How can you be so immature?

183
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,170
This incident has caused chaos 
in the Palace!

184
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,855
The entire South Faction is in turmoil!

185
00:19:23,903 --> 00:19:28,950
I know that's bad,
but I can't help but be pleased!

186
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,853
Let's go!

187
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,600
Why are you sitting there like that?

188
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:42,893
You rascal, let's go!
We need to go support my brother!

189
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:46,517
Can you go alone today?

190
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,514
- I won't get a word in anyway!
- What?

191
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:54,411
I've never had another rascal
steal a girl that I liked!

192
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:57,164
Do you even know how I feel?

193
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:01,873
You stupid boy!
Did you just call His Majesty a rascal?

194
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:05,563
Are you crazy?
You've finally lost your mind!

195
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,526
Yes, I've lost my mind!

196
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:14,866
How can I be sane when my girl 
has been stolen from me!

197
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:19,584
I know you're my son,
but you're really something.

198
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,601
Ho-Yang, you're really something!

199
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:40,866
- Hey, I think that's the place.
- Yes, I saw Dong Yi going in there!

200
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:46,056
- Shall I call her?
- Call her? Who do you think you are?

201
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,537
Dong Yi is an exalted 
Special Court Lady now.

202
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,770
Then how do we see her?

203
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:56,230
<i>Who goes there!</i>

204
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,781
Why are you loitering over here?

205
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,480
- Sir, we're...
- Take these suspicious fellows away!

206
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:05,871
Yes, sir!

207
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:11,769
- No, we're not suspicious! We're...
- Sir!

208
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,115
Dong Yi!

209
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:26,039
Please let them go.
I know these men.

210
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,890
Release them.

211
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:36,205
Dong Yi!

212
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,332
Sirs..!

213
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:47,986
What happened to you!

214
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,062
You're going to drive me to my grave!

215
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,181
Sir!

216
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,171
Come in.

217
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:10,047
I can't believe you're here!

218
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:15,448
- Don't you agree, sir?
- Yes, this is wonderful.

219
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,041
I caused you a lot of worry, haven't I?

220
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:25,559
Are you kidding me?
You rascal, you scared me half to death!

221
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm going to die early because of you!

222
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,434
I'm sorry, sir.

223
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,970
- That's enough for now.
- What? I'm just getting started.

224
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:40,325
What's all this about you being 
a Special Court Lady anyway?

225
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,582
I'm looking at you,
but I still can't believe it!

226
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:48,571
You know... actually...

227
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:53,592
You don't have to be embarassed, 
Dong Yi. We know everything.

228
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:59,003
- But actually...
- Let's leave. You've said enough!

229
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,241
Actually, I've known from the beginning.

230
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:07,294
His Majesty's gaze was so hot
when he looked at you!

231
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:13,628
Say something, sir!
Don't you agree?

232
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:19,395
- We both knew from the start...
- Stupid boy! Come to your senses!

233
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:21,935
Sir!

234
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:26,755
- Why did you hit me?
- You...

235
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:31,003
She's now a Special Court Lady.

236
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:35,684
Don't you know what that means?

237
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:40,884
- I know, but Dong Yi is...
- Don't say her name!

238
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:45,735
A Special Court Lady is higher in rank
than the Chief Madam!

239
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,569
That means Dong Yi is...

240
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:54,303
My stupid mouth!  That's what's 
going to happen to Her Ladyship!

241
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,224
Don't be like that, sir!
I'm just...

242
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:02,160
Please don't call me 'sir'!
You'll get in trouble!

243
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:07,745
You must never call me 'sir' again, My Lady!

244
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:10,277
Sir!

245
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:16,151
Then call her My Lady Dong Yi...?

246
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:21,013
Don't push me!

247
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:22,865
Sir!

248
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,398
<i>She is a lowborn girl of no consequence!</i>

249
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:31,634
And she's been living outside the Palace!
How could His Majesty do this?

250
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:36,050
A Special Court Lady is higher in rank 
than the Chief Madam!

251
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:40,621
That means that she's second 
only to the Queen in rank!

252
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:44,828
She was on the side of the deposed Queen
and threatened our power!

253
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:50,467
We must now allow her 
to have this power!

254
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,485
But this is a matter of the Inner Court.
We have no reasonable excuse to stop this.

255
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:58,832
The Queen can stop it.

256
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:02,205
She violated her duty as a palace maiden.

257
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:06,554
As head of the Inner Court,
the Queen can punish her for this.

258
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:09,982
He's right!

259
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:15,234
How has the Queen reacted to this?

260
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:19,658
She has not granted anyone 
an audience yet.

261
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,233
I've come to see Her Majesty.
Is she inside?

262
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:55,696
Yes, Your Excellency.

263
00:25:56,258 --> 00:26:03,818
The ministers are protesting?
How can they do this?

264
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:07,585
But they have a point.

265
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,056
Her birth status is an issue,

266
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:13,109
... and she was out of the Palace 
for a period of time.

267
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:18,291
Dong Yi had to leave the Palace
because of me.

268
00:26:18,484 --> 00:26:20,896
But Your Majesty, 
that is a separate matter.

269
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,520
The fact that she lacks the qualifications...

270
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,181
... to become a superior in the Inner Court
 is a valid one.

271
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:31,473
Minister, it was I who asked her 
to stay with His Majesty.

272
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:33,741
So how can you say this?

273
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,643
- Your Majesty!
- I beg you, Minister.

274
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,690
Please get the West Faction's support...

275
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,048
... so that she does not have 
to suffer any longer.

276
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:55,443
<i>My Lady, someone from the 
Office of Investigations is here.</i>

277
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:03,125
- My Lady!
- Dong Yi!

278
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:08,948
So it was true!

279
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,207
What do you mean you didn't really 
share His Majesty's bed?

280
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:23,472
He did this to protect me from danger
when I returned to the Palace.

281
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:27,486
I see. So that's how 
he wanted to protect you.

282
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:34,657
But even so, how does that change things?
This is how much he cares for you.

283
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:39,145
- My Lady, that...
- Dong Yi.

284
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:44,876
This may be the last time 
I call you by your name.

285
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:50,464
So listen to me as someone 
who was once your teacher.

286
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,050
My Lady...

287
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:56,326
Many people will try 
to make things difficult for you.

288
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:01,812
They will say you are not worthy 
and not qualified.

289
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,424
But that's all true.

290
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:09,666
How could I even consider it?

291
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,152
No, you are more worthy 
than anyone else.

292
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:19,882
Don't you remember when you first joined
the Office of Investigations?

293
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,319
You said that although 
you were lowborn by birth,

294
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,881
... your heart wasn't lowborn.

295
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:34,261
And you showed everyone 
that your words were true.

296
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:39,755
You became a proficient 
and expert Lady Investigator.

297
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:43,829
So how can you say you're not worthy?

298
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:50,349
How can you not accomplish this
when you've accomplished so much?

299
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,175
My Lady...!

300
00:28:56,035 --> 00:29:03,255
But even so, 
I cannot stay here.

301
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:05,681
Dong Yi...

302
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:13,351
My circumstances do not allow me 
to be with the King.

303
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:18,649
I cannot.
I must not do this.

304
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:25,477
What do you mean, Dong Yi?
What do you mean by your circumstances?

305
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,868
Dong Yi...

306
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,473
<i>This is the murderer who killed
 the Officer last night and his daughter.</i>

307
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:16,214
<i>The Sword Fraternity Chief's daughter 
is here. Find her!</i>

308
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:20,426
<i>There she is!
The Chief's daughter!</i>

309
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:31,882
<i>Father...!</i>

310
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:31,436
Dong Yi?

311
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:36,908
We must stop her from becoming 
a Special Court Lady.

312
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:41,375
I'm sure you don't want to serve her
as your superior either.

313
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:43,825
What do I need to do?

314
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:46,422
Investigate her background.

315
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,592
I'm sure there's something 
that can be of use.

316
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:53,727
Don't miss any detail, 
no matter how small.

317
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:54,692
Do you understand me?

318
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:57,079
Yes, My Lord.

319
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:22,455
I am Officer Cha Chun Soo 
of the Royal Guard.

320
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:29,824
May I humbly request an audience
 with His Majesty?

321
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:35,841
- Officer Cha?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

322
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:40,712
- Let him in.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:57,673
Welcome... I've been thinking of 
summoning you here too.

324
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,318
- Come closer.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:29,872
<i>Tell you how I feel about Dong Yi?</i>

326
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:39,533
Your Majesty, I know this is presumptuous,
but I wanted to ask you this.

327
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:45,049
I want to know how you really feel 
about Dong Yi.

328
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,963
Please forgive my presumptuousness,
 Your Majesty.

329
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:54,038
Not at all.
It's about your beloved sister after all.

330
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:59,364
But before I answer that,
I want to ask something too.

331
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:07,041
Are you asking this as her brother,
or as a man?

332
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:12,682
Don't be startled.
I'm the King, but I'm also a man.

333
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:19,534
It would be a lie if I said that I didn't mind 
another man being with my woman.

334
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:22,892
- Don't you agree?
- Your Majesty, I...

335
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:26,232
I don't know how Dong Yi feels 
about me yet.

336
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:30,671
The only thing I know is how I feel.

337
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,715
Actually, that's why I'm so nervous.

338
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,603
What if she has another man 
in her heart?

339
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:45,909
And if so, 
what should I do?

340
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,982
To tell you the truth, she once told me 
that she didn't think much of me.

341
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,568
What did she say?
Oh, yes.

342
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:03,541
She said she liked dark and sturdy men.

343
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,042
Just like you.

344
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:14,759
So answer my question first.

345
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:21,646
Are you here today as her brother,
or as a man?

346
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,303
Chun Soo!

347
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,890
It's strange, isn't it?

348
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:27,552
I'm uncomfortable too.

349
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:31,475
No, I'm looking at you 
because you're so lovely.

350
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:35,125
I thought you were someone else.

351
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,624
Chun Soo...

352
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:41,835
But why do you look so glum
when you're wearing such lovely clothes?

353
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:45,413
Are you troubled by something?

354
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:55,257
I...

355
00:36:56,296 --> 00:37:01,369
... don't know what to do anymore.

356
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:09,285
Can I stay here like this?

357
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:16,187
I keep thinking that I can't.

358
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:21,446
Is this because of what happened?

359
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:30,179
It'll come to light one day.

360
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,085
That I'm my father's daughter.

361
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:41,592
That my father was 
the Chief of the Sword Fraternity.

362
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,623
Dong Yi...

363
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:49,340
I never feared that,
even after I entered the Palace.

364
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,382
Because I came here 
to find the people...

365
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:57,895
... who caused the wrongful deaths 
of the members.

366
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:05,478
But to the world, 
father is just a criminal.

367
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:12,948
And I'm just a criminal's daughter in hiding.

368
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:21,835
- Dong Yi...
- But how can I be with the King?

369
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:29,531
How can I hide this from His Majesty
and be with him?

370
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:39,720
Then do you want to run away, Dong Yi?

371
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,005
- Can you do that?
- Chun Soo...!

372
00:38:53,168 --> 00:39:00,936
Just like before...
Before you knew the King...

373
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,108
Can you live like that again?

374
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:09,439
<i>Can you do that?</i>

375
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:17,249
<i>Just like before...
Before you knew the King...</i>

376
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:20,982
<i>Can you live like that again?</i>

377
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,561
You've come, Madam.

378
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:54,552
How is Her Majesty?
Is she still turning away visitors?

379
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:57,369
Yes, Madam.

380
00:40:57,657 --> 00:41:02,230
Let her know I'm here.
I must see her today!

381
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:09,862
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty..!

382
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:15,234
You've come, Mother.
I was just about to summon you.

383
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:19,151
I will go to the Grand Palace.
Let them know and make preparations.

384
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:25,141
- What?
- I said make preparations!

385
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,861
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,647
Your Majesty, are you all right?

387
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:36,194
Why? Did you think 
I would collapse over this?

388
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:38,323
Your Majesty...!

389
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:41,368
This wasn't completely unexpected.

390
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:46,437
I was just a little surprised, that's all.

391
00:41:49,649 --> 00:41:54,541
Don't look at me like that, Mother.
I'm fine.

392
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,816
Did you forget?

393
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,617
You were the one who said 
a man can never be trusted.

394
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:05,151
Your Majesty!

395
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,566
I forgot something.

396
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:16,511
I forgot that I can only trust in myself.

397
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:19,754
Your Majesty...!

398
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:33,155
What did you just say?
You want to make a deal?

399
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:39,336
- My Queen!
- It is as I said.

400
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:49,403
I will unravel the mess with Dong Yi.
In return, please release my brother.

401
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:54,473
- My Queen!
- You are well aware of this.

402
00:42:54,613 --> 00:43:01,024
The Ministers will do whatever it takes
to bring Dong Yi down.

403
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:10,276
And if they find a flaw,
they will not back down.

404
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:16,409
The most important thing in this nation 
is a just cause, is it not?

405
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:22,850
I will give you that just cause.

406
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:29,296
Because I am the head of the Inner Court.

407
00:43:30,794 --> 00:43:36,251
The Chief Steward of the Royal Treasury
has already died under torture.

408
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:44,607
All my brother did was to request medicine
for his nephew, the Crown Prince.

409
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:54,334
Do you really think you can condemn 
my brother with merely Dong Yi's words?

410
00:43:54,515 --> 00:44:06,027
No, you should be aware that
 it has become impossible.

411
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:19,486
How did we become like this?

412
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:29,662
Make a deal?
How can we be talking about this?

413
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:39,994
Because this is all that's left.

414
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:49,893
You and I are merely 
the King and Queen.

415
00:44:50,252 --> 00:45:02,168
There are no more words of love 
between us, is there?

416
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:21,518
Your Majesty, what will you do?

417
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:29,726
Your Majesty, I think it's best if we settle this
by demoting the Police Superintendent.

418
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:33,990
But I can't let them get away 
with it so easily.

419
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:41,245
I'm not suggesting we let them get away 
with it, merely to buy some time.

420
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:46,620
We cannot let Dong Yi fall into danger again
after she risked her life.

421
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:53,991
Will you let me handle this, Your Majesty?

422
00:45:55,270 --> 00:46:00,619
There is something else 
I must investigate.

423
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:02,710
Something else?

424
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:08,058
I will report to you 
when I have more evidence.

425
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:10,651
If that is confirmed,

426
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:14,894
... then everything will be solved, 
Your Majesty.

427
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:33,152
- Hee-Jae!
- Mother...

428
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:36,394
Are you all right?

429
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,126
I'm fine, Mother.
How is Her Majesty?

430
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:43,763
How is she?

431
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:47,172
She's suffering!

432
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:56,769
- Your Majesty!
- Brother!

433
00:46:56,918 --> 00:47:00,292
How are you?
Have you been hurt?

434
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:06,875
Who cares about me?
I heard about the girl.

435
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:11,892
Why haven't you done anything?
Who cares if I die?

436
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:16,945
- You should have stopped her first!
- Brother...

437
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,154
This won't be the end.

438
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:22,496
What if she is made a concubine 
and has a child...?

439
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:30,645
No! As long as I am Queen, 
that will never happen.

440
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:36,036
Do you understand now?
That is why I haven't done anything yet.

441
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:38,271
Because I want to remain here.

442
00:47:38,271 --> 00:47:43,786
That's the only way 
I won't see that happening.

443
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:51,260
- Your Majesty...
- I will not give up anything else to her.

444
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:55,608
Your Majesty, are you really all right?

445
00:47:55,709 --> 00:48:01,228
- You are...
- No, I wasn't all right.

446
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:06,258
I felt like my heart was ripped out.

447
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:13,470
But that's why I'm all right now.

448
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:20,745
I no longer have a heart that can be hurt.

449
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:26,639
I should have done this 
from the beginning.

450
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:33,849
I should have stopped myself 
from loving His Majesty.

451
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,454
Your Majesty...

452
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,991
Chief Eunuch!

453
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,551
- What did you find?
- She's nowhere to be found!

454
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,855
Where could she have gone?

455
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:07,454
- What is it?
- Your Majesty!

456
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:09,023
What is it?

457
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:13,411
I... We don't know 
where Her Ladyship is!

458
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,449
What?

459
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,813
<i>I am here as her brother, Your Majesty.</i>

460
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:49,168
<i>Because that is who I am to her.</i>

461
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:57,203
<i>- So may I ask you this as her brother?
- You may.</i>

462
00:49:57,314 --> 00:50:06,853
<i>If she fears being with you,
then what will you do, Your Majesty?</i>

463
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:10,468
<i>Fears being with me?
What do you mean by that?</i>

464
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:15,452
<i>She may think that 
she's unable to be with you...</i>

465
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:23,938
<i>... because of something out 
of her control.</i>

466
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:44,325
Dong Yi...

467
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,421
Dong Yi...!

468
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,769
What did you find?

469
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:37,022
She's not at the Office of Investigations.
I think she's left the Palace, Your Majesty.

470
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,439
- I will go out. Get ready!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

471
00:51:42,611 --> 00:51:47,168
Your Majesty,
Officer Cha sent you this letter.

472
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:48,839
What?

473
00:51:52,015 --> 00:51:55,555
<i>Dong Yi's childhood home</i>

474
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,666
<i>You're hopeless!
Father, are you sure she's related to us?</i>

475
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:25,027
<i>- How can she be so bad?
- I think she sounds wonderful.</i>

476
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:29,023
<i>No, she's awful!
She's just a little good.</i>

477
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:34,113
<i>- Hey, stop harassing my bride.
- Why is she your bride?</i>

478
00:52:34,266 --> 00:52:36,869
<i>When did I ever consent 
to give her to you?</i>

479
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,120
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

480
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,682
<i>I'm still going to marry Chun Soo 
when I grow up.</i>

481
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:46,107
<i>- What?
- What...?</i>

482
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:51,535
<i>You heard her, didn't you?
She's going to marry me!</i>

483
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,605
<i>She sounds better than you!</i>

484
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:40,192
<i>She will be at the cliff, Your Majesty.</i>

485
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:44,845
<i>Today is the anniversary of the day
her father and brother died.</i>

486
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:07,401
<i>Please stop Dong Yi, Chief.</i>

487
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:16,227
<i>So that she can do what I wish 
for with all my heart.</i>

488
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:25,869
<i>I will remember these things 
only in my heart.</i>

489
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:34,071
<i>I will hold it in my heart
and avenge your wrongful deaths.</i>

490
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,777
<i>But Dong Yi... that child...</i>

491
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:43,959
<i>... will disappear like this.</i>

492
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:51,482
<i>So that nobody will ever 
be able to find her...</i>

493
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:58,079
<i>So that she can be with His Majesty
and be happy for the rest of her life...</i>

494
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:05,356
<i>I will protect her.</i>

495
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:27,205
There should be a cliff somewhere. 
Find it!

496
00:55:27,205 --> 00:55:29,240
Yes, Your Majesty!

497
00:56:10,273 --> 00:56:15,624
<i>It's me, Father...
Older Brother...</i>

498
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:19,622
<i>You can see me, can't you?</i>

499
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:24,030
<i>What do I do now, Father?</i>

500
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,354
<i>Older Brother?</i>

501
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:31,535
<i>What should I do...?</i>

502
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:39,538
<i>- Who are you anyway?
- What?</i>

503
00:56:39,724 --> 00:56:42,941
<i>Who are you and 
why are you loitering here?</i>

504
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,698
<i>Then who are you?</i>

505
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,636
<i>- When I strike, run!
- Sir!</i>

506
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:01,358
<i>- I command you as King!
- Poongsan?</i>

507
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,597
<i>The hunting dog that never lets go
once it bites!</i>

508
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:09,366
<i>His Majesty seems like 
a very merciful person!</i>

509
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:15,463
<i>- His Majesty is really gracious!
- Yes, he must be!</i>

510
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:20,247
<i>Whether it's from His Majesty or me,
it's all the same.</i>

511
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,230
<i>- Let's go!
- Sir!</i>

512
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:26,788
<i>Give me your hand.
It's right here.</i>

513
00:57:36,764 --> 00:57:40,762
<i>I... I said raise your head!
Good!</i>

514
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,155
<i>I'm fine.
 I'm riding a palanquin after all.</i>

515
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:45,244
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

516
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:54,747
<i>Can you do that?</i>

517
00:57:54,993 --> 00:58:02,514
<i>Just like before...
Before you knew the King...</i>

518
00:58:02,766 --> 00:58:06,878
<i>Can you live like that again?</i>

519
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:42,068
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

520
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:46,664
<i>Do you remember that day
when we were at the marketplace?</i>

521
00:58:46,753 --> 00:58:49,893
<i>I bought it that day for you.</i>

522
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,242
Your Majesty...

523
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:14,401
<i>Did you forget already?</i>

524
00:59:25,024 --> 00:59:27,590
Your Majesty!

525
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:33,738
I asked you ...

526
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:40,420
... to never make me endure 
being without you again.

527
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,986
Your Majesty...!

528
00:59:54,872 --> 00:59:58,313
What is it?

529
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:03,654
What is it that troubles you so, Dong Yi?

530
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:16,042
Can't you share it with me?

531
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:25,774
No, it doesn't matter.

532
01:00:25,984 --> 01:00:32,880
Can... can you just stay with me?

533
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:43,897
May I... may I do so, Your Majesty?

534
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:48,906
That is what I want!

535
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:53,153
If I may... if I may...

536
01:00:53,362 --> 01:01:00,004
I want to accept your heart
and give you mine in return!

537
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,679
May I...

538
01:01:03,885 --> 01:01:12,058
May I do this, Your Majesty?

539
01:01:34,365 --> 01:01:38,469
- Your Majesty...
- Dong Yi!

540
01:02:00,196 --> 01:02:05,254
