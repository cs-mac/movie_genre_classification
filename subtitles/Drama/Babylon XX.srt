00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,128
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

3
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:37,321
<i>Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,</i>
<i>I've had to laugh.</i>

4
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

5
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:45,132
<i>What for? And from what?</i>
<i>From ourselves?</i>

6
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,682
<i>Life's simple:</i>

7
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:51,365
<i>Kill or be killed,</i>
<i>don't get involved...</i>

8
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:54,281
<i>... and always finish the job.</i>

9
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,099
<i>The survivor's code.</i>

10
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,243
<i>My code.</i>

11
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:04,006
<i>And it all sounds great until the day</i>
<i>you find yourself confronted by a choice.</i>

12
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:07,304
<i>A choice to make a difference,</i>
<i>to help someone...</i>

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,402
<i>... or to walk away and save yourself.</i>

14
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:13,131
<i>I learned something that day.</i>

15
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:15,845
<i>You can't always walk away.</i>

16
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,848
<i>Too bad it was the day I died.</i>

17
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,429
Get out here!

18
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,661
Come here!

19
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,286
Get back!

20
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,831
You remember me?

21
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,650
You sold me a gun that don't work!
You almost got me killed!

22
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,953
I paid $20 for this.
I want my money back.

23
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:28,524
Give me that.

24
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,994
This one's very good, very good.

25
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,553
Okay.

26
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,502
I owe you.

27
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,735
I'll save you some.

28
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:32,360
Hey, Toorop. Toorop.
Somebody came here looking for you.

29
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,466
Okay.

30
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,442
<i>Boy, what a massacre.</i>

31
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:01,194
<i>At the peak of the rush hour,</i>
<i>bombs were detonated in...</i>

32
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,615
Karl, is that you?

33
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,445
I thought you were in Sudan
killing babies.

34
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,967
Remember the last time we met?

35
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:48,105
I told you if you ever
point that gun at me again...

36
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,085
...l'd kill you.

37
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:54,541
Who would hire a baby killer
to get me?

38
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,366
Who?

39
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,657
No shit. If you wanted me dead,
you'd have blown up the building.

40
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:06,160
Who?

41
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:07,598
Gorsky.

42
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,865
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

43
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:16,522
You're not a mercenary,
you're a terrorist.

44
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,774
You need two things to live in this
business, your balls and your word.

45
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,629
You don't have either.

46
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:27,089
You know the difference
between you and me, Karl?

47
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,956
I still got both.

48
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,209
Take it easy.

49
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,916
Personal between him and me.

50
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,965
You are a hard man to find, Toorop.

51
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,588
I'm not hiding.

52
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,083
You could have knocked.

53
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:56,042
I needed to be sure
that you were the same idealist...

54
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,376
...who worked for me 10 years ago.

55
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,954
So you knew I was gonna kill Karl?

56
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,605
I don't like you, Gorsky.

57
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,074
You can't trust me
and I can't trust you.

58
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,927
Look at you.

59
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:14,159
Still in this shit hole, surviving.

60
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:17,358
No friends, no family, no future.

61
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,753
We are the same. You and me.

62
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,858
We're not the same.

63
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,685
What do you want?

64
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,577
I need a smuggler.

65
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,977
I don't do refugees anymore.

66
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,285
Use your own cargo.

67
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,037
- You own the borders anyway.
- Only on this side.

68
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:35,790
- This is an overseas delivery?
- A girl.

69
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,029
She needs to be in America
in six days.

70
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,432
Why are you playing with me?

71
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,247
You know I can't get back
into that country.

72
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:46,674
You know that U.N. Passports
are impossible to fake.

73
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,093
This is not a fake.

74
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:58,189
Inject it in your neck
when you pass the official border.

75
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,211
This is your new life.

76
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,315
I'll do it for half a mil.

77
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,971
I can make you do it for free.

78
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:08,337
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

79
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:11,696
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

80
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,723
A car will pick you up outside.

81
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,933
Everything you need
will be in the trunk.

82
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:22,738
Cross me and you'll have no place
to hide anymore...

83
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,007
...Toorop.

84
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:29,198
It goes both ways...

85
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:31,220
...Gorsky.

86
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,499
Shit.

87
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:15,792
Good morning.

88
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,098
You must be Toorop.

89
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,798
I am Sister Rebeka.

90
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,643
I want to bring three simple rules
to your attention...

91
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,751
...before we start our journey.

92
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,328
We?

93
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,244
I'm here to pick up one girl.

94
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,599
Wherever she goes, I go.
That is rule number one.

95
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:36,591
Rule number two, the less contact she
has with the outside world, the better.

96
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,728
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

97
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:43,313
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

98
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,261
Now, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

99
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:49,294
I know. That is why we live in here.

100
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,651
Shit. Okay, what's your third rule?

101
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,573
No foul language.

102
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,566
Do we have an agreement?

103
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,592
You listen to my one and only rule.

104
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:11,956
Don't fuck with me...

105
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,096
...or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

106
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:18,356
...with nothing but your ass to sell
to get back here...

107
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:20,855
...your perfect world.

108
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,376
Do we have an agreement?

109
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,256
Obviously, you are not a gentleman.

110
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,019
Obviously not.

111
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:33,842
Now that we have an understanding,
pick up the bags.

112
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:40,055
No.

113
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:58,451
What's your name?

114
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,176
My name?

115
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,256
You don't have to talk to him.

116
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,525
You didn't introduce yourself.

117
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,475
My name is Toorop.

118
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:12,345
- Are you taking us to New York?
- Yes.

119
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:14,810
Now please get into the car.

120
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,643
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

121
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,769
Look, lady. I'm just a delivery boy.

122
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:26,135
And to me you're just a package.

123
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,561
I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother,
I'm not your boyfriend.

124
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:32,823
In six days, I'm gonna deliver you
and never see you again.

125
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,212
Sister Rebeka's right.

126
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,203
We shouldn't even talk.

127
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:39,705
Come on.

128
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,423
Comfy?

129
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:29,842
Your Highness,
your child has left the convent.

130
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,052
At last.

131
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:35,932
Six days until we reveal our miracle
to the world.

132
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,277
Your Highness,
the press conference will begin shortly.

133
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,327
She's coming.

134
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,250
Let's pray.

135
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,227
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

136
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,742
Take your bags.

137
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,362
Are you really going to need all that?

138
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,308
You can never have enough firepower,
Sister.

139
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,128
In fact...

140
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,396
Never touched a gun in my life.

141
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,541
Now would be the perfect moment
to start.

142
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,580
No, thank you. I can defend myself.

143
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:47,164
Stay close, this is the real world.
There's no mercy for the weak.

144
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,260
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

145
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,219
It does here.

146
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,955
Hurry.

147
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,005
Change.

148
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,660
What are you doing?

149
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,255
<i>We've located the targets.</i>

150
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,364
<i>Contact New York.</i>

151
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,189
<i>Patch me through to Darquandier.</i>

152
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,140
They found her.

153
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,896
Okay.

154
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,981
Be careful now.

155
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:21,208
Noelites would be watching too.

156
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,901
My daughter must not be harmed.

157
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:24,893
<i>Put this on.</i>

158
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,536
Come on.

159
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,727
I'm scared. Can I hold your hand?

160
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:35,928
Hold mine.

161
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,850
Hang on.

162
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,187
Okay, give me three.

163
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,705
Hey.

164
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,719
Where are you going?

165
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,512
What are you doing? Come on.

166
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,410
Hey.

167
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:18,913
Hey!

168
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:20,415
Hey, come here.

169
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,301
Hey!

170
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:39,069
<i>- She's on the run.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

171
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:40,760
Aurora. Toorop.

172
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,730
Aurora. Toorop.

173
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,110
- What are you doing?
<i>- Stop.</i>

174
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:56,128
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

175
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,784
We have to go. We have no time.

176
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,131
- Now.
- We have to get away.

177
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,403
What's wrong?
Make her walk or I'll carry her.

178
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,220
- Stop. Don't touch her.
- We gotta leave. We're going.

179
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,175
- Don't touch her.
- You will die. No!

180
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,212
Come on.

181
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:29,025
We're going to the train.

182
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:31,903
We need to catch it. Come on.

183
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,746
Move. Get out of the way.

184
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,019
Move!

185
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:15,006
Those tigers in the cage.

186
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,504
They weren't real, right?

187
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:23,904
Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017.

188
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:26,716
The last one died in the Moscow Zoo.

189
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,976
What is she,
a walking wildlife encyclopedia?

190
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:33,377
They were clones?

191
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:37,880
Second generation clones.
Not real tigers.

192
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,163
Copies of copies.

193
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,569
But they're living creatures.

194
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:42,812
Made by God.

195
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,653
No, they were organic machines
made by man.

196
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,925
God made man in his image...

197
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:51,547
...so, what man creates
is also God's will.

198
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:53,723
Is this what you teach her
in the convent?

199
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,260
You wanna talk?

200
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,974
Tell me what happened
at the marketplace.

201
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,661
How did you know
about the explosion?

202
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,022
If I'm gonna protect you...

203
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,424
...I need to know
what's wrong with you.

204
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,068
She was scared.

205
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,211
It's her first time out of the convent.

206
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:15,901
And you put us in that situation.

207
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,210
<i>Your attention, please. We are about to</i>
<i>pass through high-radiation smog.</i>

208
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:25,338
<i>For your security,</i>
<i>the shutters will now be lowered.</i>

209
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,898
First time out of the convent, huh?

210
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,966
Stay close.

211
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,101
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a friend.

212
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:11,262
Must be somewhere around here.

213
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:25,053
Come on, come on.

214
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,572
It's a glorious game.
Marcus from gracious England...

215
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:32,125
...against the Killa from China.
Only one round.

216
00:25:32,486 --> 00:25:34,875
You can make it.

217
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,136
<i>I got them. They're right here.</i>

218
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:50,270
<i>I'll be right there in a minute.</i>
<i>And you, don't talk to anybody.</i>

219
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,861
They're splitting up.
What do we do now?

220
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,644
Everybody maintain their position.

221
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:58,818
Get up, Finn.

222
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:02,239
Hey, Toorop.

223
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,769
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

224
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:07,325
What you doing in this beautiful
part of Russia?

225
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,982
<i>- Working.</i>
<i>- Working for who?</i>

226
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,607
<i>Hey, hey, two shots.</i>

227
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,142
<i>Gorsky.</i>

228
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,539
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

229
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:26,951
- What can I do for you?
- I need three passes on the boat.

230
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,054
And two snow bikes
on the other side.

231
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:31,875
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering.

232
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,429
A girl.

233
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,317
Her?

234
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,074
Who is she?

235
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:40,895
I don't know.

236
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:43,102
- Where are you taking her?
- America.

237
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:44,930
You're on the terrorist list there.

238
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,300
- Yeah.
- You know that. You need a passport.

239
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:48,991
You need an identity.

240
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,265
You're kidding me.
You got a passport?

241
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,025
Yeah, and I'm not coming back.

242
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:57,088
- That is a bold move.
- I got 50 G's saying you can help out.

243
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,974
When?

244
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:00,575
Now.

245
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,439
You don't have to look.

246
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:10,308
Who is he?

247
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,938
He's a lost soul.

248
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:26,049
See you at the landing at 0600 sharp.

249
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:27,776
You got it.

250
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,818
- Who is that?
- An old friend, a good smuggler.

251
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,920
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anybody. Come on.

252
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:41,666
- Sorry, kids, these girls are with me.
- Just let her go, Toorop.

253
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,736
- How do you know my name?
- We know a lot of things you don't.

254
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:48,134
- Yeah? Like what?
- Like you don't know what you're doing.

255
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,440
- I'm doing my job.
- Forget your job.

256
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:53,862
- What?
- One million, tax-free.

257
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,096
Take the money
and walk out without a fight.

258
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:01,891
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

259
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:14,335
Go!

260
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,681
Move!

261
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,130
Aurora.

262
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:37,890
Hey!

263
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:41,000
- Aurora.
- Hey, man, let the girl go.

264
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:42,854
Just let her go. Let her go.

265
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,906
Another one is about to die.

266
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,009
A new opponent for the Killa.

267
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:56,967
Hey, man, hey, hey. I don't...

268
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,789
Get over there.

269
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:05,028
Wanna fight? Let's go.

270
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:09,801
No!

271
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,922
Aurora.

272
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:38,826
Stop!

273
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,582
Stop it!

274
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,177
Stop it! Stop!

275
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:47,112
Don't kill him.

276
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,678
He doesn't want to hurt me.

277
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:59,176
He wanted to protect me!

278
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:04,356
Your father sent us.

279
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:08,266
- My father?
- Yes, your father.

280
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:10,633
Get away from her.
Get away from her.

281
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:12,715
It's okay, Aurora.

282
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:16,456
- I have to know.
- No, Aurora.

283
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,764
Aurora? Aurora. Aurora!

284
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:19,972
Listen to me. Stop.

285
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,628
Toorop. Toorop.

286
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,399
Come on.

287
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:49,162
Let's go. Hurry up.

288
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,940
Come on.

289
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,148
Move it.

290
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:56,456
Come on.

291
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,313
Go, go, go.

292
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,004
Let her go!

293
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,254
Next one dies.

294
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,760
Come with us.
They're ready to die for you.

295
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:28,585
I don't want anybody to die for me.

296
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:40,524
What do you think you're doing?

297
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,791
- What's wrong with you?
- Think this is a game?

298
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,901
- Why did you shoot?
- Trying to get killed?

299
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:46,632
- Why didn't you let me go?
- You don't know them!

300
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,344
And what are you gonna do? Shoot me
in the head? Swing on me like an animal?

301
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,228
Stop it.

302
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,098
I told you I'd take you to New York.

303
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,342
And I will.

304
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,323
You don't have to like me.

305
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:13,221
Is my father really alive?

306
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,200
No, baby girl.

307
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,150
He died.

308
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,548
This is way too many refugees,
man.

309
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,265
The ice is getting thinner every year.

310
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:39,627
We're losing cargo all the time.

311
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:44,395
We're not gonna all get on the boat.

312
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,240
Make sure we do.

313
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,916
This goddamn global warming
is bad for business.

314
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:10,223
What's happening?

315
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,462
Watch this.

316
00:34:58,193 --> 00:34:59,720
There's not much time.

317
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,863
They don't wanna be spotted
by satellites.

318
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,975
Hurry, come on.

319
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,241
<i>Diving in two minutes.</i>

320
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,991
<i>Diving in one minute.</i>

321
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,911
<i>One minute.</i>

322
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:35,657
Go.

323
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,802
Come on.

324
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:05,160
No!

325
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,769
No!

326
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,920
You can't do this.

327
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,359
They'll die out there.

328
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:22,832
No!

329
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:27,016
- You can't do this.
- Get away from the controls.

330
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,324
- What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it.
- No.

331
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,952
Don't do that. What's wrong?

332
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,232
- Put it down.
- No, don't.

333
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:35,086
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You, put it down.

334
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,389
- Hey, take it easy.
- Hey, take it easy.

335
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,785
- Put it down.
- We go back up.

336
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,565
- Now.
- Okay, okay.

337
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,344
- Relax.
- We go back up.

338
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,937
- Easy.
- Now.

339
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,337
- Relax, stay put.
- No.

340
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:52,521
Calm down.

341
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:54,546
- Put her on the floor.
- I feel them dying.

342
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:57,641
No, no mercy. Dead!

343
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:09,675
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the hell was that?

344
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:19,241
I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco.

345
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,676
My life was a mess.

346
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,916
I met the wrong man.

347
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,637
I was lost in darkness.

348
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,837
But the high priestess of our church
opened the doors...

349
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,786
...that led onto the path of light.

350
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:36,561
I joined the Noelites...

351
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,342
...and I ended up in the convent.

352
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:43,599
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

353
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:47,151
I worked in the orphanage.

354
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:51,083
She arrived.

355
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:53,964
A little baby.

356
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,681
Her father was dead.

357
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:59,241
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

358
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:02,130
I took her as my own.

359
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:03,729
I fed her.

360
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:05,420
I taught her.

361
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,290
Everything was fine
until three months ago.

362
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:12,781
The doctor came and gave her a pill.

363
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:14,508
He was with her for 10 minutes...

364
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:16,880
...and then she slowly started...

365
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,124
To change, huh?

366
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,238
Schizophrenia.

367
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:22,510
Spasms.

368
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:26,858
Nothing as violent
as what you saw today.

369
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:30,444
Now, how could she know how
to operate a 30-year-old Russian sub?

370
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:35,668
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

371
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:39,439
Aurora could speak
when she was 2 years old.

372
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,287
Yeah, but there are kids
that can speak at 2 years old.

373
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,395
Nineteen different languages?

374
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,186
Who else knows about this?

375
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,171
Nobody but the doctor.

376
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,083
He told me to keep it a secret
to protect her.

377
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:00,079
He said...

378
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:04,173
...that we would get
the best medical help in America.

379
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:08,275
She needs help.

380
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:12,337
<i>Crew, prepare to surface.</i>

381
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:16,107
Get her ready.

382
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,477
You know, two years ago...

383
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:40,204
...in Uzbekistan,
I saw this viral bomb go off.

384
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:44,110
I saw it from the air. It was...

385
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:48,850
...incredible. Everybody died.

386
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:53,137
She's carrying, ain't she?

387
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,826
All the symptoms fit.

388
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:57,910
All that weird behavior.

389
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,518
I'm telling you, man,
she's carrying a weapon.

390
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:04,304
Do you have any idea
how much money she's worth?

391
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,594
If she's carrying a virus...

392
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:14,548
...l'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

393
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:36,077
What happened to them?

394
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:37,261
Fighter drones.

395
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:39,122
Anything that moves
is shot on sight.

396
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:40,847
It's 10 miles to the DMZ.

397
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:44,365
Then let's make it 10 fast miles.
Let's go.

398
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:01,073
Toorop, they're coming.

399
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,866
Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!

400
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,735
Brake!

401
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:22,039
Finn, get close to me.

402
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:24,722
Jump onto his bike.

403
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:30,932
I'll draw them off.

404
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,113
- What are you doing?
- Toorop cleared our way out.

405
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:18,769
We're only a mile from the border.

406
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:26,638
- Toorop, we need help.
- Don't worry.

407
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:27,791
We're almost there.

408
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,183
Toorop, we need you now.

409
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,043
Hang on, I'm getting there.

410
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:53,617
Stop! We have to get Toorop.

411
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:11,860
Toorop.

412
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:14,614
He's not dead.

413
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:17,742
Oh, shit.

414
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,637
Hey, stay with me.

415
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:24,245
He's not reacting.
He's bleeding to death.

416
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,930
I need your help. Okay.

417
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,432
We gotta get out of here now.

418
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:35,285
It's a small piece of metal.
I'm gonna take it out.

419
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,840
- What do you need?
- Just hold him.

420
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:42,458
Look, we don't have time
for this, okay?

421
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,277
They're gonna send more drones.

422
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:46,068
Aurora?

423
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:50,036
- You got it?
- I got it.

424
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:51,926
- He's okay.
- Give me a bandage.

425
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,480
We should never have turned back.

426
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,562
He knows the rules.

427
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,242
I'll sew it up later.

428
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,120
Hey...

429
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:06,224
...now you
and the passport are mine.

430
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,657
- What are you doing?
- You, I don't need.

431
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,126
Like I said...

432
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,568
...trust no one.

433
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,520
Remember that.

434
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:35,346
It's good.
Where did you learn to cook?

435
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:37,970
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

436
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:39,961
You never had a woman
take care of you?

437
00:44:42,812 --> 00:44:44,536
Sorry.

438
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:46,803
No, not in my line of work.

439
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,284
Finished.

440
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:54,324
- She gets pleasure out of this.
- Crybaby.

441
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,401
Crybaby?

442
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,646
What is that?

443
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:04,534
Painkiller?

444
00:45:05,212 --> 00:45:06,521
No, thank you.

445
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:09,498
- Live a little.
- No.

446
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:11,732
- Aurora, stop.
- Wait, let...

447
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:14,359
Spit it out.

448
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,900
Girls.

449
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:25,364
We made it across the border.

450
00:45:25,692 --> 00:45:27,154
Here's to survival...

451
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:30,388
...and thank you for saving my life.

452
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:32,760
Maybe now you can trust somebody.

453
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:38,870
We protected each other like family.

454
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,610
We are all going to die in New York.

455
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,286
Good night.

456
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,675
She's just scared.

457
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:10,835
Yeah, right.

458
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:39,639
Go back to sleep.

459
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:43,447
We still have a long way ahead of us.

460
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,654
What are you doing?

461
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,878
We go through customs tomorrow.

462
00:46:50,495 --> 00:46:52,666
Can't take these.

463
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:05,363
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first found me as a baby...

464
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:07,836
...it was a night like this.

465
00:47:09,214 --> 00:47:10,840
Aurora.

466
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:13,400
That's where I got my name.

467
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:15,159
From the chaos.

468
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:16,755
It suits you.

469
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,373
You're risking your life for me.

470
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:23,286
Why?

471
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,929
I've done my time.

472
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:31,961
All this killing and pain...

473
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:34,548
...and war for what?

474
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,005
I'm tired.

475
00:47:39,102 --> 00:47:41,241
I'm tired of it all.

476
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,672
You're my only chance
out of this hell.

477
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,268
And go where?

478
00:47:47,263 --> 00:47:50,611
27 Cedar Grove...

479
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:54,365
...near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

480
00:47:55,423 --> 00:47:57,757
My parents had a farm.

481
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,203
More like a cabin with a lot of land.

482
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,979
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

483
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:12,474
There is no place like home.

484
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:19,352
Well, Kansas ain't what it used to be.

485
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,213
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

486
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,471
1939.

487
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,491
That's right.

488
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:35,768
Toorop.

489
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:43,736
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

490
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,054
I hope I won't have to.

491
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:40,920
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

492
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,702
There's a plane to New York
in two hours.

493
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:01,499
<i>Passengers for Flight 712</i>

494
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:05,561
<i>... please proceed to Gate 211</i>
<i>for immediate boarding.</i>

495
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:12,128
<i>You are now leaving Canada.</i>
<i>We hope you enjoyed your stay.</i>

496
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:15,934
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the United States of America.</i>

497
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,374
Welcome to America.

498
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:27,647
Welcome to America.

499
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,306
Welcome to America.

500
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:33,339
Stop.

501
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:36,124
Hold it right there.

502
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,501
- Hey.
- I said, hold it.

503
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:39,522
- Calm down.
- Hey.

504
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,034
<i>A miracle in the making.</i>

505
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:49,532
<i>Tomorrow is the dawn</i>
<i>of our new age.</i>

506
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:20,737
Harlem, we've changed.
We've changed.

507
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:27,966
Right here, girls.

508
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:43,046
It's okay. It's safe here.

509
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,177
Here.

510
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,263
Can we turn it off?

511
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:13,579
You can't turn it off.

512
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:15,152
You can change the channel.

513
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:23,984
Hey.

514
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:25,933
There's no food.

515
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:28,428
Because we're not
gonna be here long.

516
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:37,422
What's wrong?

517
00:54:37,617 --> 00:54:39,756
They're all dead.

518
00:54:42,193 --> 00:54:46,537
<i>Sources report the destruction in</i>
<i>Kirghizstan of a 1000-year-old convent.</i>

519
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:50,764
<i>One of the oldest continually functioning</i>
<i>convents in Central Asia.</i>

520
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,580
<i>Now occupied by an ascetic branch</i>
<i>of the Noelites...</i>

521
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,298
<i>... the convent was struck by a missile</i>
<i>late last night.</i>

522
00:54:56,465 --> 00:54:57,872
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

523
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:00,903
<i>Here, an initial reaction</i>
<i>from the Noelites.</i>

524
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:04,303
<i>It is a tragedy to think</i>
<i>that even defenseless women...</i>

525
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:08,776
<i>... who made the choice to withdraw</i>
<i>from society and lead a life of purity...</i>

526
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:11,018
<i>... should suffer the attacks</i>
<i>of terrorists...</i>

527
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:16,489
<i>... who have absolutely no respect for</i>
<i>the lives of decent, God-fearing people.</i>

528
00:55:17,138 --> 00:55:19,026
<i>We shall mourn our Sisters.</i>

529
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:22,379
<i>The Noelites have been persecuted</i>
<i>for too long.</i>

530
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:25,229
<i>Tomorrow will be the dawn</i>
<i>of our new age.</i>

531
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:32,624
<i>Congratulations, my friend.</i>

532
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:34,826
<i>You made it safe and sound.</i>

533
00:55:34,995 --> 00:55:36,653
Gorsky.

534
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:40,496
- Did you destroy that convent?
<i>- I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.</i>

535
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:43,725
<i>- I'm a mercenary like you.</i>
- Bullshit.

536
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:45,265
What the hell is going...?

537
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,084
What the hell is going on over here?

538
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,640
- You didn't leave me a gun?
<i>- You've done your job.</i>

539
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:53,771
<i>When you turn over the girl, I'll get paid</i>
<i>and you're home free.</i>

540
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:58,063
<i>And the tracking device in your passport</i>
<i>will be deactivated.</i>

541
00:55:58,227 --> 00:55:59,787
<i>Deliver the package.</i>

542
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:02,988
<i>My men will be there</i>
<i>to be sure you do.</i>

543
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:06,218
They never hurt anybody.

544
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:08,329
Maybe it was an accident.

545
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,052
It was not an accident.

546
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:15,179
It was destroyed
right after we crossed the border.

547
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,847
Would you like to pray with me?

548
00:56:20,947 --> 00:56:23,435
I don't feel like praying anymore.

549
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:35,438
Toorop said
I'm just a package to him.

550
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:39,562
Is that all I am to you?

551
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:43,024
Of course not.

552
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:45,166
I love you.

553
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,475
How is she?

554
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,132
Scared.

555
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,373
Yeah, well, she should be.

556
00:57:09,044 --> 00:57:10,254
Who are they?

557
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,195
To the left, the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

558
00:57:14,868 --> 00:57:16,690
To the right...

559
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,641
...the bikers work for Gorsky.

560
00:57:24,148 --> 00:57:27,312
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

561
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:29,738
And if we don't?

562
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:34,986
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

563
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:39,787
Look, Sister.

564
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:43,026
We traveled 6000 miles together.

565
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:46,538
The truth is this has been
a suicide mission from the beginning.

566
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:49,426
They won't let either one of us
walk out of here alive.

567
00:57:51,188 --> 00:57:55,312
That's the doctor that came
to the convent three months ago.

568
00:57:55,477 --> 00:57:57,997
Answer the door.
Act like nothing's wrong.

569
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:01,389
Okay.

570
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:12,271
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

571
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:18,260
Good evening.

572
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:19,828
Where is she?

573
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:21,615
In the room.

574
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:44,113
You're a bad man.

575
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,372
Thank you, Aurora.
Thank you so much.

576
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,536
- How is she?
- She's fine.

577
00:59:15,703 --> 00:59:17,110
I have to run some more tests.

578
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:18,416
- More tests?
- Standard...

579
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:19,827
You just ran your test.

580
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:22,096
- What's wrong with her?
- Expect a call.

581
00:59:22,263 --> 00:59:24,816
What is wrong with her?

582
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,259
Toorop.

583
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:29,423
Toorop, let him go.

584
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,301
If you please?

585
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,527
Thank you, Sister.

586
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:45,329
- Get over here.
- What's wrong with you?

587
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:46,771
I wanna know everything.

588
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:50,896
Don't you think that if I knew anything,
I would tell you?

589
00:59:51,063 --> 00:59:52,590
No, I don't think.

590
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:56,054
You're a Noelite. You are like him.
You swore an oath.

591
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:58,222
Not to them. To God.

592
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:00,693
God has nothing to do with it now.

593
01:00:00,886 --> 01:00:01,966
You understand?

594
01:00:02,135 --> 01:00:04,819
If she carries a virus,
she could annihilate the city.

595
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:06,893
I'm not gonna have it on my conscience.

596
01:00:16,183 --> 01:00:18,737
I'm pregnant. Twins.

597
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:22,198
It's not possible.

598
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:25,010
I've watched over you all your life.

599
01:00:25,176 --> 01:00:27,347
No one's ever touched you.

600
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:33,267
- And nobody has.
- It's a miracle.

601
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:36,787
Shit.

602
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:43,221
- Hello.
<i>- Mr. Toorop, this is the High Priestess.</i>

603
01:00:43,384 --> 01:00:45,074
<i>- I am the...</i>
- I know who you are.

604
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,917
<i>Thank you for doing such a good job,</i>
<i>Mr. Toorop.</i>

605
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,062
You're welcome.

606
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:52,305
<i>Bring the girl to the limousine</i>
<i>and you'll be free...</i>

607
01:00:52,472 --> 01:00:53,650
- Toorop...
<i>...and rich.</i>

608
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,045
...if you deliver me to them, I'll die.

609
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:04,237
We're on our way out.

610
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,825
<i>All right, guys.</i>
<i>Let's go get her. Are you ready?</i>

611
01:01:33,337 --> 01:01:34,831
We can't let her go, Toorop.

612
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:37,619
Look around. Do we have a choice?

613
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:43,988
She's your problem now.

614
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,468
Move!

615
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:15,631
We're going to the subway.

616
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:17,711
Thank you, Toorop.

617
01:02:31,002 --> 01:02:32,114
What's wrong?

618
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,354
It's a missile linked to my passport.

619
01:02:35,738 --> 01:02:37,647
How can you stop it?

620
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:39,415
- I got him!
- Only by death.

621
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:44,758
Go to the subway.

622
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,305
Toorop.

623
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:13,136
Aurora.

624
01:03:15,868 --> 01:03:17,329
Get the girl.

625
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:31,828
It's you.

626
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:34,971
Protect them.

627
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:56,083
I need you to live.

628
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:25,400
Aurora was our miracle.

629
01:05:25,566 --> 01:05:27,704
A true virgin birth.

630
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:31,644
This was to make ours
the dominant religion on earth.

631
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:34,586
Now we don't know
what's happened to her.

632
01:05:34,749 --> 01:05:37,946
In this mess,
there's no sign of Aurora.

633
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:40,346
We can't find her.

634
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:44,218
We were finally on the verge
of becoming a bona fide religion.

635
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:48,658
Your incompetence has thrown 20 years
of careful planning down the tubes.

636
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:51,000
Who gave the order to use guns
to retrieve her?

637
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:52,857
You left Gorsky no choice.

638
01:05:53,022 --> 01:05:54,647
What were you thinking?

639
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,230
- Your Highness.
- What?

640
01:05:58,398 --> 01:06:00,470
The body stolen from the morgue
was Toorop's.

641
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:03,637
The police have found the van
that transported him to New Jersey.

642
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:08,088
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

643
01:06:16,926 --> 01:06:19,031
He's back online.

644
01:06:28,638 --> 01:06:30,231
Where are you taking me?

645
01:06:30,398 --> 01:06:32,340
To Darquandier.

646
01:06:47,646 --> 01:06:51,672
Jamal, Mr. Toorop is not our prisoner.
You can release him.

647
01:06:55,518 --> 01:06:57,079
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.

648
01:06:57,247 --> 01:07:00,443
I'm Dr. Darquandier. Aurora's father.

649
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:05,598
I thought you were dead.

650
01:07:05,759 --> 01:07:09,239
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

651
01:07:09,406 --> 01:07:10,388
You'll see.

652
01:07:11,998 --> 01:07:14,934
Oh, yes. You we're clinically dead
for two hours.

653
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:17,275
We lost time
getting you from the morgue.

654
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:19,511
And then you went into a coma
for five days.

655
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,712
I fixed you up as best I could.

656
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:27,000
Now, Mr. Toorop, I believe
I owe you some explanation.

657
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:32,475
Twenty years ago, I was drummed out
of the medical profession...

658
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,804
...for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

659
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,294
Around that time,
the Noelites came to me...

660
01:07:38,463 --> 01:07:42,041
...to create smarter,
stronger, healthier human beings.

661
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:47,903
So I built a super computer
to be Aurora's artificial mother.

662
01:07:48,063 --> 01:07:52,635
As a fetus, Aurora learned
to process information...

663
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,134
...just like a computer.

664
01:07:56,095 --> 01:07:58,135
But when she was born...

665
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,670
...she became much more
than just an experiment.

666
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:02,261
She became...

667
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:05,628
She became my daughter.
She was beautiful. She was unique.

668
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:09,502
I couldn't give her away, so that's when
they hired Gorsky to kill me...

669
01:08:09,664 --> 01:08:13,406
...and, well, he almost succeeded.

670
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:17,562
He took my baby away
and hid her for the Noelites.

671
01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:19,735
I searched for her,
but I couldn't find her.

672
01:08:19,904 --> 01:08:22,774
I knew that one day the Noelites
would present their miracle...

673
01:08:22,976 --> 01:08:24,285
...to the rest of the world.

674
01:08:29,824 --> 01:08:32,825
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

675
01:08:32,993 --> 01:08:35,676
We think she's alive
and that she's left you a message.

676
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:38,045
You died with your eyes open...

677
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:41,143
...but your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

678
01:08:41,313 --> 01:08:43,255
We just need to rewind the tape.

679
01:08:43,425 --> 01:08:47,319
You need to return to the same condition
you were in when we found you.

680
01:08:49,121 --> 01:08:50,234
I was dead.

681
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:53,592
Quite.

682
01:08:58,593 --> 01:08:59,967
What am I looking for?

683
01:09:00,128 --> 01:09:02,365
What you missed the first time.

684
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:05,143
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

685
01:09:06,305 --> 01:09:08,029
Are you ready, Mr. Toorop?

686
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:24,542
Stay with the memory.

687
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,593
Stay with the memory.
Move forward a bit.

688
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:32,438
Focus on his memories of Aurora.

689
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:35,264
He's seeing her. Very good.

690
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,668
Stop!

691
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,100
I'll die.

692
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:41,721
That's right. We're getting there.
We're getting there.

693
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:45,729
Now is good. Focus on his gun.

694
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:54,458
Easy, easy. Steady, steady.

695
01:09:59,234 --> 01:10:02,714
- Way past the danger threshold.
- I know, but he'll be fine. He'll be fine.

696
01:10:06,274 --> 01:10:08,641
Hey, slow down. Slow down.
Now. Slow down.

697
01:10:12,195 --> 01:10:14,234
Let's wait, let's wait, let's wait.

698
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:22,847
I need you to live.

699
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:39,032
He's dead.

700
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:40,920
Wait.

701
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:42,396
Don't bring him back yet.

702
01:10:42,563 --> 01:10:45,410
He's almost there. The last seconds.

703
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:08,953
Go home.

704
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:14,203
It's all right. You're back. You're safe.

705
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,281
You're all right. You're fine.

706
01:11:16,451 --> 01:11:18,556
I know where she is.

707
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:23,679
Mr. Gorsky, I hoped
I wouldn't have to see you again.

708
01:11:23,843 --> 01:11:25,599
<i>Where is my money?</i>
<i>You haven't paid me.</i>

709
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:28,033
You have an odd way
of killing people.

710
01:11:28,196 --> 01:11:29,603
What are you talking about?

711
01:11:29,764 --> 01:11:32,634
I'm on my way
to see our old friend, Darquandier.

712
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:35,803
Impossible.
I made his car explode myself.

713
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:38,721
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill, I kill for good.

714
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:40,956
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

715
01:11:41,124 --> 01:11:43,546
You will need a nuke to kill me.

716
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,067
Bitch.

717
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,867
How did she survive the blast?

718
01:11:52,036 --> 01:11:54,524
It's the babies, you see.

719
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,957
They're gaining power.

720
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,459
They're the ones guiding her.

721
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:03,842
Her capacity for survival is greater than
anything we could ever have imagined.

722
01:12:04,004 --> 01:12:07,834
Professor, your wife has found us.
She'll be here in two minutes.

723
01:12:08,644 --> 01:12:09,822
Find her, Toorop.

724
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,508
You're the only one
who can save her now.

725
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:19,679
So where are we going?

726
01:12:19,844 --> 01:12:20,859
North.

727
01:12:39,204 --> 01:12:40,481
Hello, my dear.

728
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:42,205
It's lovely to see you.

729
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:45,056
- Where's my daughter?
- I see you haven't found her.

730
01:12:46,118 --> 01:12:47,328
And you never will.

731
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,315
You selfish bastard.

732
01:12:49,477 --> 01:12:52,641
Twenty years ago,
I gave you the opportunity you wanted.

733
01:12:52,805 --> 01:12:54,660
Now it's my moment.

734
01:12:55,717 --> 01:12:57,725
Where is my daughter?

735
01:12:57,893 --> 01:12:59,070
She's not your daughter.

736
01:12:59,237 --> 01:13:00,349
She comes from me.

737
01:13:00,517 --> 01:13:02,722
- I designed her.
- For me.

738
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,703
She's my miracle.

739
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:07,717
- She belongs to my church.
- Your church is a lie.

740
01:13:07,878 --> 01:13:10,725
You're peddling miracles
for your own profit.

741
01:13:16,549 --> 01:13:18,405
Are you willing to die for her?

742
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:19,678
Yes.

743
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:33,052
Find Toorop. He knows where she is.

744
01:14:06,406 --> 01:14:08,097
Wait here.

745
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:42,877
You're finally home.

746
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:45,756
What's left of it.

747
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:51,068
But I came back for you.

748
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:55,681
Have a little faith.

749
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:36,417
Toorop, they're coming.

750
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,061
Break left.

751
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:38,079
Toorop, they need help.

752
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,026
No!

753
01:16:50,602 --> 01:16:52,358
Take the wheel.

754
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:04,548
Toorop.

755
01:18:18,475 --> 01:18:20,167
Thank you.

756
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:23,524
For protecting us.

757
01:18:30,603 --> 01:18:33,091
You're their father now.

758
01:18:45,643 --> 01:18:47,367
Aurora.

759
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:54,217
That's the first time
you've said my name.

760
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,769
You're gonna be okay.

761
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:03,041
Take care of them, Toorop.

762
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,748
Hey, kids.

763
01:19:19,084 --> 01:19:21,931
There's a storm coming.
We need to go.

764
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,489
Ready?

765
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,351
Okay, Dad.
