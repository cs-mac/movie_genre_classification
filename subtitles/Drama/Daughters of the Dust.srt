1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,051
(film reel whirring)

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,519
(mysterious tribal music)

3
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,231
(wind whistling)

4
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,319
(water splashing)

5
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,412
- [Narrator] I am the
first and the last.

6
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,909
I am the honored one
and the scorned one.

7
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,540
I am the whore and the holy one.

8
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,632
(rooster clucks)

9
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,337
I am the wife and the virgin.

10
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,509
I am the barren one

11
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,554
And many are my daughters.

12
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,725
I am the silence that
you cannot understand.

13
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,271
(water splashing)

14
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,864
I am the utterance of my name.

15
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,818
(birds cawing)

16
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,199
(man chanting in
foreign language)

17
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,185
(frogs croaking)

18
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,613
(lively tribal music)

19
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,643
- I can't believe it.

20
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,854
I had no idea.

21
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:12,939
Cousin Mary.

22
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,819
Praise the lord, Mr. Snead,
my dear cousin, Mary Peazant.

23
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,617
This has turned out to
be a very special day

24
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,286
for the Peazant family, indeed.

25
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,122
- Viola.

26
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,802
- Pleasure to meet
you, Mary Peazant.

27
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,929
- Yellow, they call
me Yellow Mary.

28
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:49,183
- (laughs) Our
fathers were brothers.

29
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,693
Of course, compared
to some people,

30
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,765
Yellow Mary's not all
that lightskinned, but...

31
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,069
Yellow Mary, I'd
like you to meet

32
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,608
my photographer, Mr. Snead.

33
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,872
I've commissioned Mr.
Snead to photograph

34
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,575
our family crossing
over to the mainland.

35
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,456
What's past is prologue.

36
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,796
I see this day as their
first steps toward progress,

37
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,387
an engraved invitation
to the culture

38
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,885
and education and
wealth of the mainland.

39
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,981
Yellow Mary, wouldn't you agree?

40
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,895
(laughing)

41
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,617
(upbeat tribal music)

42
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,763
- [Unborn Child] My
story begins on the eve

43
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,676
of my family's migration north.

44
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,511
My story begins
before I was born.

45
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,356
My great-great-grandmother,
Nana Peazant,

46
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,990
saw her family coming apart,

47
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,949
her flowers to bloom
in a distant frontier.

48
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,373
And then, there was my
ma and daddy's problem.

49
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,533
Nana prayed and the old souls

50
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,992
guided me into the New World.

51
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,920
I came in time for
the big celebration,

52
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,087
to be among my cousins,
my aunties, and uncles.

53
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,167
I can still see their faces,

54
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,263
smell the oil in
the wicker lamps.

55
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,100
I can hear the voice
of Auntie Haagar

56
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:36,016
calling out for her
daughters, Iona and Myown.

57
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,938
And teasing the newlyweds.

58
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,916
(laughing)

59
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,127
- Kalos, beautiful, eidos, form.

60
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,217
Skopein, to view.

61
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,188
If an object is placed
between two mirrors,

62
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:26,146
inclined at right angles, an
image is formed in each mirror.

63
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,780
Then, these mirror
images are in turn

64
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,147
reflected in the other mirror,

65
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,065
forming the appearance of four,

66
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,834
symmetrically-shaped objects.

67
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,370
Oh, I think it's just
a wonderful discovery.

68
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,212
It's beauty,
simplicity, and science

69
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,208
all rolled into one small tube.

70
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,090
(women laughing)

71
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,967
I think the children
will enjoy it.

72
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,005
- Yellow Mary, look!

73
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,965
Uncle Spikenard
used to live there.

74
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,484
Do you remember him?

75
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,096
Oh, I guess not.

76
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,903
I was just a young
Miss, too, then.

77
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,858
He was from Africa,
and just after the war,

78
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,780
he moved from the plantation to

79
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,989
that little house
on the waterfront.

80
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,540
(laughs)

81
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,793
Remember how when
Uncle Spikenard

82
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,379
got excited or angry
he'd talk funny

83
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,336
so the children
couldn't understand him?

84
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,756
(laughs) He'd speak in
African words and sounds.

85
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,348
You know, just before the
war, Uncle Spikenard told me,

86
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,016
they'd keep boatloads
of fresh Africans

87
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,016
off on some secret
islands around here.

88
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,898
- Viola, our government banned
the transporting of Africans

89
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,727
for slavery 50 years
before the Civil War.

90
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,946
- Not back off on
these islands, no.

91
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,698
Just before the
war, they were still

92
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,122
running and hiding
saltwater Africans,

93
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,327
pure-bred, from the Yankees.

94
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,756
(joyful tribal music)

95
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,255

96
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,586

97
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,933

it doesn't mean
we don't love you.

It doesn't mean we're not
going to miss you none.

And it doesn't mean
we're not going

to come home to visit
with you soon. (laughs)

148
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,345
- Eli Peazant, if you don't
stop grinning at me...

149
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,598
It ain't right to
tease old folks,

150
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,520
especially your
great-grandmother.

151
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,939
You're lucky I've got breath
in me yet, you old Goober Head.

152
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,231
(Eli laughs)
Goober Head.

153
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,655
Your name used to be called
Goober Head, remember that?

154
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,584
Goober means peanut.

155
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,205
- What is this?

156
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,545
Something seems to
be stuck in here.

157
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,427
- You know, your
grandaddy Shad ain't like

158
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,231
to see no woman chewing tobacco.

159
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,313
Ain't that so?

160
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,146
You know that's so.

161
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,357
- No, ma'am.

163
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,630
- I visit with old
Peazant every day

164
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,796
since the day him died.

165
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,716
It's up to the living to keep
in touch with the dead, Eli.

166
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,353
Man's power don't
end with death.

167
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
We just move on
to another place,

168
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,194
a place where we go and
watch over our living family.

169
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,361
(children laughing)

170
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,149
Respect your elders.

171
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,069
Respect your family.

172
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,580
Respect your ancestors.

173
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,867
You're worried that
baby Eula's carrying

174
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,002
ain't yours because
she get forced.

175
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:32,594
You won't have no baby
that wasn't sent to you.

176
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,009
The ancestors and the womb,
they're one, they're the same.

177
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,756
Those in this grave, like those

178
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,975
who're across the
sea, they're with us.

179
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:49,266
They're all the same, the
ancestors and the womb.

180
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,648
Call on your ancestors, Eli.

181
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,363
Let them guide.

182
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,573
You need their strength.

183
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,914
Eli, I need for you
to make the family

184
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,540
strong again, like
we used to been.

185
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,747
- How can you understand
me and the way I feel?

186
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,750
This happened to
my wife, my wife!

187
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,471
I don't feel like
she mine no more.

188
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,599
When I look at her, I feel I
don't even want her no more.

189
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,438
- You can't get back
what you never owned.

190
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,860
Eula never belonged to
you, she married you.

191
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,283
- Why didn't you
protect us, Nana?

192
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,907
Someone put the fix on me.

193
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,615
Was it the conjure or bad luck?

194
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,541
Or were the old souls too
deep in their graves to give

195
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,616
a damn about my wife while
some stranger was riding her?

196
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,175
When we was children,
we really believed

197
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,557
you could work the
good out of evil.

198
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,976
We believed in the
newsprint on the walls,

199
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,186
your tree of glass
jars and bottles,

200
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,278
the rice you carry
in your pockets.

201
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,945
We believed in the
frizzled-haired chicken.

202
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,952
The coins, the roots,
and the flowers,

203
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,288
we believed they
would protect us

204
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,750
and every little thing
we owned or loved.

205
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,554
I wasn't scared of
nothing and no one

206
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,758
because I knew, I knew
my great-grandmother

207
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,681
had it all in her pocket
or could work it up.

208
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,061
- Never forget who we is

209
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,024
and how far we done come.

210
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,114
- I have to leave here.

211
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,945
I don't have no other choice.

212
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,696
- Eli, Eli!

213
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,422
There's a thought,
a recollection,

214
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,915
something somebody remembers.

215
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,417
We carry these
memories inside of we.

216
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,552
Do you believe that
those hundreds and
hundreds of Africans

217
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,721
brought here on this other side

218
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,020
would forget everything
they once knew?

219
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,845
We don't know where the
recollections come from.

220
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,401
Sometimes we dream them.

221
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,225
But we carry these
memories inside of we.

222
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,693
- What are we supposed
to remember, Nana?

223
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,283
How at one time we were able
to protect those we loved?

224
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,570
How in Africa
world we were kings

225
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,663
and queens and built
great, big cities?

226
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,830
- Eli, I'm trying to learn you
how to touch your own spirit.

227
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,752
I'm fighting for my life,
and I'm fighting for yours.

228
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,166
Look in my face!

229
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm trying to give you something
to take north with you,

230
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,224
along with all your
great, big dreams!

231
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,268
Call on those old Africans, Eli.

232
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:21,402
They'll come to you when
you least expect them.

233
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,491
They'll hug you
up quick and soft

234
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,697
as the warm, sweet wind.

235
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:32,245
Let them old souls come
into your heart, Eli.

236
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,995
Let them touch you
with the hands of time.

237
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,129
Let them feed your
head with wisdom

238
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,127
that ain't from
this day and time.

239
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:47,223
'Cause when you leave
this island, Eli Peazant,

240
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,808
you ain't going to no
land of milk and honey.

241
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,015
(children laughing)

242
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,606
Eli, I'm putting
my trust in you,

243
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,938
to keep the family
together up north.

244
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,370
That's the challenge facing
all you free Negroes.

245
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,910
Celebrate our ways.

246
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:18,793
(ominous tribal music)

247
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,631
(metal clangs)

248
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,837
(roosters clucking)

249
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,945
(metal clangs)

250
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,949
(water hisses)

251
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,666
(glass shatters)

252
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,788
(chickens squawking)

253
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,705
(glass shatters)

254
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,624
(moaning)

255
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,843
(groaning)

256
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,302
(triumphant harp
and flute music)

257
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,846
- [Unborn Child]
Nana prayed for help.

258
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,481
I got there just in time.

259
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,358
(wind whistling)

260
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,819
- [Nana] Come, child, come!

261
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,455
(women screaming)

262
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:02,788
- Fresh and sweet like a
baby's breath. (laughs)

263
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,675
- Eula.

264
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,759
Who done this to us?

265
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,893
- Nothing good can
come from knowing!

266
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,152
- Everything good done gone.

267
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,615
Our dreams are all gone.

268
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,080
(ominous synth music)

269
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,220
(horses whinnying)

270
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:51,478
(triumphant harp
and flute music)

271
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,401
(glass clinking)

272
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,983
- God as my witness...

273
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,113
when I leave this
place, I'm never

274
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,240
again going to
live in your land!

275
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
(laughing)

276
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,023
- Oh girl, you're so silly.

277
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,055
What are you looking at?

278
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,323
(water splashing)

279
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,287
(laughs)

280
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,785
- Oh, I love you, oh!

281
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,933
Now, this means--

282
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,221
- [All] Gumbo!

283
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:46,926
- Pot called?

284
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,219
- [All] Sojo.

285
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,136
- (laughs) Water, water.

286
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,024
- [All] Deloe.

287
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,231
- Fire.

288
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,400
- [All] Diffy!

289
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,111
- Yeah! (laughs)

290
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,530
Now, that's all what
grandma remember.

291
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,461
- [Nana] They the last of the
old and the first of the new.

292
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:18,667
The older I get, the
closer I get to the ground.

293
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:24,883
This was the worst place to
have been born in slavery time.

294
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,264
(water splashes)

295
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:34,144
Their hands scarred with blue
from the poisonous indigo dye

296
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,563
what built up all them
plantations from swampland.

297
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:44,903
We spirit numb from the sting
of fever from the rice fields.

298
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,543
We back bend down
while we did planting

299
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,331
and the hoeing and
the Sea Island cotton.

300
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,878
I was an elder, and
many, many years back,

301
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,012
when I lay in my mother's arms,

302
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,350
I saw Africa in her face.

303
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,274
(people socializing)

304
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,284
(triumphant harp
and flute music)

305
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,283
- [Unborn Child] It was an age

306
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,157
of beginnings, a
time of promises.

307
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:34,044
The newspaper said it
was a time for everyone,

308
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,171
the rich and the poor, the
powerful and the powerless.

309
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:57,851
- [Nana] Eula say, we the
bridge that they cross over on.

310
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,902
We're the tie
between then and now,

311
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,896
between the past and the
story that will come.

312
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,319
(people socializing)

313
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,211
(baby crying)

314
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,219
(people yelling and whooping)

315
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:03,626
(joyful tribal music)

316
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,390
(speaking in foreign language)

317
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,942
- Old Man Peazant
granddaughter done come home.

318
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,279
- Oh, she got ruined.

319
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,486
Yellow Mary gone
off and got ruined.

320
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,241
- What's that she got with her?

321
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,492
- Iona!

322
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,453
Iona!

323
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,300
You go warn Nana Peazant.

324
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,838
It'll most likely kill her to
see this heifer done returned.

325
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,264
- But Ma, I don't think...

326
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,480
- All that yellow wasted.

327
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,921
- Ah, is this the
same little girl

328
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,338
I used to rock in
Gussie's yard? (laughs)

329
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,762
- The shameless hussy.

330
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,606
- Look, Trula, this is Eula.

331
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,896
- Eula, nice to meet you.

332
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,871
- What is this?

333
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,473
- [Yellow Mary] Store-bought
biscuits, Haagar.

334
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,600
- Bread from a store?

335
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,942
You know, Yellow
Mary, they say a woman

336
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,361
who knows how to cook
is mighty pretty.

337
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,111
- Ma, can I taste one?

338
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,247
- You know, I don't like
messing around in no kitchen.

339
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,667
- I wouldn't eat them no
how if she touched them.

340
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,498
- You never know where
her hands have been.

341
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,634
I mean, I can just
smell the heifer.

342
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,091
- Buzzards don't circle
in the air just for fun.

343
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,013
That gal's come back
here for something.

344
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,932
(waves crashing)

345
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:24,741
(people socializing)

346
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,753
(crabs crackling)

347
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,169
- [Iona] Girl, what are you
doing with those things?

348
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,876
- [Viola] Just make sure
ain't no dead crabs.

349
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,536
Ain't nobody wanna
eat no dead crab.

350
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,165
- Why're you making them crawl?

351
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,182
- Girl, you need to be
plucking this chicken.

352
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,596
- Throw one of them
things on Haagar. (laughs)

353
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,596
- No, no.

354
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,768
(women socializing)

355
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:11,286
- The Earth, O Lord, is
swelling with fruitage

356
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,670
and reminds us that this

357
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,836
is the seed time of life.

358
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,969
That not today, not
tomorrow will come

359
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,771
the true reaping
of the deeds we do

360
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,766
but in some far-veiled

361
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,725
and mighty harvest,

362
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,030
not deceiving ourselves with
the apparent ease of evil,

363
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,108
looking to that harvest

364
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:48,122
when the earth
belongs to the Lord,

365
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,326
not us and the fullness thereof.

366
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,209
(whistle squealing)

367
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,008
Put that down.

368
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,354
Now, you know, when
I left this island,

369
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:15,193
I was a sinner and I
didn't even know it.

370
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,477
But I left these islands,

371
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,941
touched that mainland,

372
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,105
and fell into the
arms of the Lord.

373
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:31,243
- [Young Boy] What they got
out there, Auntie Viola?

374
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,955
- Life, child, the
beginning of a new life.

375
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,800
- Who's out there?

376
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,762
- Jesus Christ,
baby, the Son of God.

377
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,348
- Heard you was coming.

378
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,139
I've been waiting to
see you since daybreak.

379
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,020
- I heard the drums
but I didn't know

380
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,783
they were talking
about me, you know.

381
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,947
- I wanted to
surprise you, Nana.

382
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,486
It's a hard thing to
do in Ibo Landing.

383
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,581
- No surprises
here, Yellow Mary.

384
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,723
What's that you wear
around your neck?

385
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,904
- St. Christopher's charm,
for travelers on a journey.

386
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,729
- What kind of belief is that?

387
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,494
He protect you?

388
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,275
(contemplative synth music)

389
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,898
- I see your family
sticks to the old ways.

390
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,653
- Yeah, yeah, we stick to them,

391
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:34,235
but times is a-changing,
and you know, Mr. Snead,

392
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,253
you have to change
with the times.

393
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,825
- Mr. Hail, you know
any of those old

394
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,423
Africans from your
plantation days?

395
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,300
(women laughing)

396
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,781
- As much as I like to fish,

397
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,331
I'll never put a
pole in that water.

398
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,786
That's the spot where the
girl got drowned by her owner.

399
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,118
- Isn't this Ibo Landing?

400
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,800
- That don't mean
you can't drown here.

401
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,393
Say again how they
say water in Spanish.

402
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,349
- Agua.

403
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,269
- Agua, agua.

404
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,368
My Ma came to me
last night, you know?

405
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,829
She took me by the hand.

406
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,961
- Your titty's been
dead a long time, Eula.

407
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,048
- I needed to see my Ma.

408
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,968
I want to talk to her.

409
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,768
So I wrote her a letter,
put it beneath the bed

410
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,977
with a glass of
water, and I waited.

411
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,936
I waited, and my Ma came to me.

412
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,991
She came right away.

413
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:38,783
- Eula!

414
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:44,914
You're a real back-water
Geeche girl! (laughs)

415
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:54,507
This must be the most
desolate place on the earth.

416
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,050
You know, I think
what I would do--

417
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,062
- [Eula] No, Mary,
it's beautiful.

418
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,349
- Here it is folks, Ibo Landing,

419
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,685
reflecting the muddy
waters of history.

420
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,989
Me, myself, personally,
I don't look for

421
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,278
my reflection in no
muddy water, you know?

422
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:25,043
The only way for things to
change is to keep moving.

423
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,828
People sitting still,
men sitting still,

424
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,752
don't get it with me, you know?

425
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,177
Wish I could find
me a good man, Eula.

426
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,010
Somebody I could depend on.

427
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,394
Not that I'd want
to depend on him.

428
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,896
Just to know that I
could if I had to.

429
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,738
(lively tribal music)

430
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,275
(laughing)

431
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,089
- [Eli] Eula!

432
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,695
(flies buzzing)

433
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,988
- [Eula] Mind now, Yellow
Mary, you'll be itching soon.

434
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,714
- A little face powder never
hurt Yellow none, y'know.

435
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,035
It's these blood sucking gnats

436
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,710
is going to drive me back
over to the mainland.

437
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:56,339
You live like savages
back over in here.

438
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,469
(screaming)

439
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,284
Oh, you know,

440
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,575
I sure hope they're
fixing some gumbo.

441
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,285
It's been a long time since
I've had some good gumbo.

442
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,577
I had some in
Savannah, you know,

443
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,831
but they didn't put
everything in it.

444
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:43,262
I've haven't had some
good food in a long time.

445
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,224
- I found her.

446
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:52,144
I found her fetching her
parasol by Ibo Landing.

447
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,645
- [Woman Throwing Rocks]
What kind of woman she is?

448
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,979
Yellow Mary's no family woman.

449
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,025
She's a scary woman.

450
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,242
- She's a new kind of woman.

451
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,866
- At the same time, the
raping of colored women

452
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,658
is as common as fish in the sea.

453
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,995
You didn't tell Eli
who did it, did you?

454
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,097
You've got a good man, Eula,
somebody you can depend on.

455
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,348
He doesn't need to know what
could get himself killed.

456
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,310
There's enough uncertainty
in life without

457
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:38,061
wondering what tree your
husband's hanging from.

458
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,234
Don't tell him nothing.

459
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,782
(tranquil synth music)

460
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,078
- [Unborn Child] I
remember how important

461
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,495
the children were to
the Peazant family,

462
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,915
and how I had to convince my
daddy that I was his child.

463
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,340
- Hold it.

464
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,434
- If you want to know
about them African people,

465
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,848
you need to talk to Bilal.

466
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,022
- [Mr. Snead] Salt
water negroes.

467
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,462
- They stole Bilal from Africa

468
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,800
when he was just a little boy.

469
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,296
He came over on the
very last slave ship.

470
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,089
Bilal came over on The Wanderer.

471
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,517
- My baby was born dead...

472
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,820
and my titty was full of milk.

473
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:51,572
We needed money, so I hired
out to a wealthy family,

474
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,331
some big, supposed
to be, muckety-mucks,

475
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,956
off Edisto Island,
high-falutin' buckra.

476
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,843
They go to Cuba, I go.

477
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,843
I nursed their baby and took
care of their other children.

478
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,557
That's how I got ruined.

479
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,605
I wanted to go home
and they keep me.

480
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:25,936
They keep me.

481
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,070
So I fix the titty,
they send me home.

482
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,536
(gulls screeching)

483
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,826
(somber synth music)

484
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,892
(triumphant synth music)

485
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,733
- Iona, Iona!

486
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:53,612
Iona, Iona!

487
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,608
Where's that girl?

488
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,490
I don't know why
Nana Peazant won't

489
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,873
come sit herself down over here

490
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,749
near where we can
watch over her.

491
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,876
Snakes off in that high grass.

492
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,957
- Old people think they have
all the answers, you know?

493
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:21,844
Carrying around that
tin can. (laughs)

494
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,763
I don't think I ever
see her without it.

495
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,602
- [Haagar] We ought to
save this one for Eula.

496
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,598
She's about as strange
as Nana Peazant.

497
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,061
Sometimes, I think that old
woman isn't in her right mind.

498
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,733
- Haagar Peazant, you're
laughing at an old woman,

499
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:42,284
and just like Eula, you
married into this family,

500
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,700
but she's our grandmother.

501
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,446
There's nothing wrong or harmful

502
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:51,542
in that tin can she
carries, just some old--

503
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:56,539
- [Both] Scraps of
memories! (laughing)

504
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,054
- Now, I'll be
the first to admit

505
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,127
that Nana is carrying
a lot of luggage,

506
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,643
and she needs to put her soul
in the hands of the Lord,

507
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:09,466
but she built her life
around this family.

508
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,811
She's old and she's frightened.

509
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:21,114
What does Nana know
about the world outside?

510
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,110
Nothing.

511
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,605
Nana was never educated.

512
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,655
All she knows are simple things,

513
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,869
things people told
her a long time ago.

514
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,383
- That's why I say Nana
Peazant needs to pack

515
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,457
her things like the rest
of we and come along.

516
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:42,884
She doesn't need
to stay here like

517
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,932
she's somebody with no people.

518
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,677
- I might not have
been born into

519
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,808
this family, but I'm here now,

520
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,926
and I say let Nana
Peazant stay behind.

521
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,523
That's what she wants.

522
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:55,729
We're moving into a new day.

523
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,858
She's too much a
part of the past.

524
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:03,276
- Don't let Daddy Mac
hear your mouth! (laughs)

525
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,070
- I'm a fully grown woman,

526
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:09,332
and I don't have
to mind what I say.

527
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,695
I done born five
children into the world

528
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,462
and put two in the ground
alongside their daddy.

529
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,665
I worked all my life and
got nothing to show for it.

530
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,667
And if I can't say
what's on my mind,

531
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,300
then damn everybody to hell!

532
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,008
- Mind now, the
Lord is listening!

533
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,717
- I'm an educated person,

534
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,771
and I'm tired of
those old stories,

535
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,885
watching her make
those root potions.

536
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,232
Hoodoo, she be talking!

537
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,558
Washing up in the river
with her clothes on,

538
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:42,734
just like those old Salt
Water folks used to do.

539
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:43,903
My children ain't gonna be like

540
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,241
those old Africans,
fresh off the boat.

541
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,158
My God, I still remember.

542
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:53,288
- And look at that
old crazy Bilal.

543
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,656
- Bilal Muhammed is a heathen.

544
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,583
- [Woman with Baby] But he does

545
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,581
strange things, just like Nana.

546
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,003
- [Viola] Hush, she's
our grandmother!

547
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,383
- Those old people,
they pray to the sun,

548
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,801
they pray to the moon,
sometimes just to a big star!

549
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,351
They ain't got no
religion in them.

550
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,465
No, this is a new world
we're moving into,

551
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,774
and I want my daughters to grow
up to be decent somebodies.

552
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:20,900
I don't even want
my girls to have

553
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,817
to hear about all that mess.

554
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,736
I'll lock horns with anybody and

555
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:30,066
anything that tries
to hold me back.

556
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,032
Now I say, if Nana Peazant
wants to live and die

557
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:38,535
on Ibo Landing, then
God bless her old soul.

558
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,079
(thunder rumbles)

559
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,292
- I think it's going to rain.

560
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,883
(baby crying)

561
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,844
- [Unborn Child] My
time was running out.

562
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,973
(thunder rumbles)

563
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,181
The women were
arguing and fighting.

564
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,231
I can still see the fear and the

565
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,018
hope in the eyes of our fathers.

566
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,484
They were the sons of drums,

567
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,324
who could only speak
of their future.

568
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:14,121
Everyone was just as
scared as Nana Peazant.

569
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,160
(thunder rumbles)

570
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,875
(dramatic tribal music)

571
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,757
(women laughing)

572
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,391
(women laughing)

573
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,029
(men socializing)

574
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,166
(baby crying)

575
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:56,815
(Eli grunts)

576
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,321
(laughing)

577
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:08,213
- Solomon's in town, got
a colored lady with him.

578
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,377
Says she's a newspaper woman.

579
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,035
(Eli grunting)

580
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,968
(laughing)

581
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,067
- [Eli] Cousin!

582
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:50,786
- We're working on the
anti-lynching law again.

583
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,421
Maybe you want to be with us.

584
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,049
- [Eli] Maybe...

585
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,797
I still be leaving with
the rest come morning.

586
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,740
- Maybe when we go north,
you'll take with you

587
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,411
more than Eula and your dreams.

588
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:32,332
- I ain't got no more
dreams, cousin. (grunts)

589
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:44,219
- [Bilal] (groans)
You've been practicing.

590
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,845
- [Unborn Child] In
this quiet place,

591
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,559
years ago, my family knelt down

592
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,823
and caught a glimpse
of the eternal.

593
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,979
(water splashing)

594
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:44,395
We left our markers in the soil

595
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:48,405
in memory of the families
who once lived here.

596
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,880
We were the children of
those who chose to survive.

597
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,297
Years later, my Ma
told me she knew

598
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:13,432
I had been sent forward
by the old souls.

599
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:21,727
(mysterious tribal music)

600
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,272
(blocks clacking)

601
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,991
(singing in foreign language)

602
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,801
- [Eula] That's mine,
that's me, no wait,

603
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,300
this one, this one,
wait, that one's you.

604
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,722
(women laughing)

605
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,141
(tranquil synth music)

606
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,399
- [Unborn Child]
I was travelling on a spiritual mission,

607
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:49,822
but sometimes, I
would get distracted.

608
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,237
- I wish I had this doll,
I wish I had this doll,

609
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,155
I wish I had this bed
to go inside my house.

610
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,173
- You ain't got no house!

611
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,245
(women laughing)

612
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,290
- I wish I did.

613
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,212
If I did, I'd put this
bed inside my house.

614
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,713
Then I wish I had a rabbit.

615
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,375
- [Older Cousin] What'd
you wish for, Ninnyjugs?

616
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:10,593
- Everything!

617
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:11,802
(women laughing)

618
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,262
- Ninnyjugs, you
can't have everything!

619
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,143
You've got to go like this.

620
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:20,230
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe,
catch a piggie by his toe,

621
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,477
my mother said to pick

622
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,518
this one right over here.

623
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,244
Wish for the one right
where my finger stopped.

624
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,856
Now, put that wish book away.

625
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,374
It's time to eat.

626
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:38,195
- [Solomon] I hear they
done opened up the old

627
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:42,213
Seminole Creeklands for
the white homesteader.

628
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,340
The only thing left is scrap
iron stills and tenant farming.

629
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,917
Listen to what I tell you, man.

630
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,382
If Roosevelt does
anything at all,

631
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,603
it will be for Northern
industry and not for we.

632
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,023
- [Viola] Supper's
ready, Mr. Snead.

633
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,150
We'll be taking our
places right up there.

634
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:07,937
- Wish books, saltwater negroes,

635
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,988
gold earrings, to sharpen
your vision? (laughs)

636
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,200
- Oh, they spoil their children

637
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:22,464
with dreams, wishes, magic.

638
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,509
But then, they're the most
important members of the family,

639
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:34,337
the children and the old souls.

640
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:40,973
Come.

641
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,283
Gather up those
kids on Ibo Landing!

642
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,447
Bring them over here!

643
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,279
- Let's go and get them.

644
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,622
Come now, no!

645
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:19,966
- Hey, Yellow Mary, they
say you're a rich woman.

646
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:28,404
(children laughing)

647
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:31,687
(serene synth music)

648
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,377
- [Unborn Child] My Ma said
she could feel me by her side.

649
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,509
(gull squawks)

650
01:08:55,757 --> 01:09:00,347
I remember the call of my
great-great-grandmother.

651
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,305
I remember the journey home.

652
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:07,687
I remember the long
walk to the graveyard,

653
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:12,106
to the house that I would be
born in, to the picnic site.

654
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,742
I remember, and I recall.

655
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:26,411
- [Viola] It's 50 years since
slavery, Mr. Snead, but here,

656
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:30,463
we still give our
children names like

657
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,459
Myown and Iona, Unita,

658
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,720
Iadora, Euadora. (chuckles)

659
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:42,136
We even have a Pete
and Re-Pete. (laughs)

660
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,726
Sometimes, these Islanders
name their babies

661
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:52,146
the day of the week or the
season in which they were born.

662
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:56,817
(laughs) Not to mention,
everyone has several nicknames,

663
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,818
Goober, Boy Rat, Hail,

664
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,577
Harvest, Winter,
Pidgeon, Hardtime,

665
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,997
Fantee, Cudah, Ocra, Yono,

666
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,134
Cish, Alexmine, Jackiemine,

667
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,415
Jaspermine, Cornhouse,

668
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:22,593
Binah, Shango,

669
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,308
Obatala, Oya-yansa,

670
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:33,689
Yemonja,

671
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:37,318
Eshu Elegba.

672
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,492
(mysterious tribal music)

673
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,754
- We're here today to show

674
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,500
our respect to our family elders

675
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:45,176
and to celebrate our family's
crossing to the mainland.

676
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:51,394
But we're also here today
to honor the old souls,

677
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,902
many, who from the
very, very beginning

678
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,282
of our creation
guided our journey

679
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,863
from one world to another.

680
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:10,743
We're here today because our
parent took we by the hand

681
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,785
and teach we to swim the current
surrounding these islands.

682
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,462
And they teach we to--

683
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,250
- [Nana] I recollect
how we lived in the time

684
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,554
before freedom come,
in the old days.

685
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:31,683
They didn't keep good
records of our births,

686
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,771
our deaths, or the selling
of the slaves back then.

687
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,778
A male child might get took
from a mother and sold at birth.

688
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,368
Then years later,
the same person

689
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:52,285
might have to mate with
his own mother or sister

690
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,035
if they was brought
back together again,

691
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,169
so it was important
for the slave,

692
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,956
theyself, to keep
the family ties.

693
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,591
Just like the African Griot,

694
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,928
who would hold these
records in his head,

695
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,545
the old souls in each family

696
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,219
could recollect all the births,

697
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,733
deaths, marriage, and sale.

698
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,858
Those 18th century Africans,

699
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,819
the watchers, the keepers,

700
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:27,864
the ancestors.

701
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:44,091
- We Peazants, we
come from a long,

702
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,304
long line of creation and hope

703
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:54,602
begun by those
first-captured Africans.

704
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,814
And Nana, Nana, she
carried them with her,

705
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,355
four generations of Peazants.

706
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,904
And we, we must
carry them with us,

707
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,873
wherever we go.

708
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:20,750
(contemplative tribal music)

709
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,028
- It was here they brought them.

710
01:14:56,493 --> 01:15:00,663
They took them out of the boats
right here where we stand.

711
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,712
Nobody remembers how
many of them it was,

712
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:14,144
but there was a good
few, according to my
great-grandmother.

713
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,853
She was a little,
little girl at the time.

714
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,106
The ship had just come
from the deep water.

715
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:33,608
It was a great big
old ship with sails.

716
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,541
The minute those Ibo
were brought ashore,

717
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:42,866
they just stopped and
took a look around.

718
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,712
Not saying a word, just
studying the place real good.

719
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:57,933
And they saw things
that day that you

720
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,770
and I don't have
the power to see.

721
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,773
Well, they saw just
about everything

722
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,199
that was to happen
around here that day.

723
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:19,155
The slavery time, the war my
grandmother always talks about,

724
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:23,449
(chuckles) those Ibo
didn't miss a thing.

725
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:27,665
They even saw you and me,
standing here talking.

726
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:38,888
When they got through sizing
up the place real good

727
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,507
and seeing what was to come,

728
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,232
my grandmother said they turned,

729
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,110
all of them, and walked
back in the water,

730
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,821
every last man,
woman, and child.

731
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,371
Now you wouldn't think
they'd get very far

732
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:04,407
seeing as it was water
they were walking on.

733
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,042
Had all that iron upon them,

734
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:12,003
upon their ankles
and their wrists,

735
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:16,223
and fastened around their
neck like dog collars.

736
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,350
But chains didn't
stop those Ibo none.

737
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:25,766
They just kept walking, like
the water was solid ground.

738
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,530
When they got to where
the ship was, (chuckles)

739
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:38,236
they didn't so much
as give it a look.

740
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:40,528
Just walked right past it

741
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:45,581
because they was going home.

742
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,119
- I'm especially proud today

743
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,873
to bless the coming child of

744
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:30,211
our Eli and Eula Peazant.

745
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,919
Our first child that's
going to be born up north,

746
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,299
we child of the future.

747
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,966
- Just counting stumps,
don't clear the field.

748
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,718
(people laughing)
Let's eat.

749
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,061
(people socializing)

750
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,675
(rhythmic tribal music)

751
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,203
- Once, I saw a pink satin case,

752
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:52,331
for jewelry, for rich
women in a shop window.

753
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,620
And it had a thing on the side

754
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:56,923
and you turned it
and music came out.

755
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:04,175
I couldn't afford
that case for myself,

756
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:08,595
and I didn't ask nobody to
buy it for me, you know?

757
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:14,058
But in my mind, I put
all those bad memories

758
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,230
in that case, and I
locked them there,

759
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,067
so that I could take them out

760
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:22,647
and look at them when
I'd feel like it,

761
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,112
and so I could study
them when I want to,

762
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:27,073
and figure it out, you know?

763
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,993
But I didn't want
them inside of me.

764
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,793
I didn't want them inside of me.

765
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,172
I don't let nothing in that case

766
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,749
or nobody outside that
case tell me who I am

767
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,344
or how I should feel about me.

768
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:49,262
(lively tribal music)

769
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,770
- Bilal, Bilal!

770
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,280
Bilal Muhammed, come join we.

771
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:08,237
Come wash away your sins
in the blood of the lamb.

772
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,409
- Let him go, Deacon.

773
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,702
He's a saltwater negro.

774
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:14,332
He has no shame!

775
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:18,668
He's the master of
the sun and the moon.

776
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,593
- [Yellow Mary] When I
leave here, you know,

777
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:27,298
I'll be heading up for
Canada, Nova Scotia.

778
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:33,604
I like the sound of it,
you know, Nova Scotia.

779
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,135
- No-va Scotcha.

780
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,231
- Nova Scotia.

781
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,741
- I never had too much
trouble making a dollar.

782
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,777
Never needed nobody
to help me do that.

783
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:52,582
I can't stand still.

784
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,747
Got to keep moving.

785
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,831
New faces, new places...

786
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:07,007
Nova Scotia will be good to me.

787
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,425
(peaceful synth music)

788
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:28,858
- Come closer together,
closer, come on.

789
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,479
- Mind now, Mr. Snead, there's

790
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,444
gators back off in these waters.

791
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:37,784
(Mr. Snead squeals)
(women laughing)

792
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,704
(chanting in foreign language)

793
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:47,043
- I don't think about
those old days much lately,

794
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,963
but when I start to study them,

795
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,510
lots of things come back to me.

796
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,910
- You're a natural
fool, Haagar Peazant.

797
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,575
Nobody ever said
that the old souls

798
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:28,790
were living inside
those glass jars.

799
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,714
The bottle tree
reminds we of who

800
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:35,132
was here and who's gone on.

801
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,300
You study upon the
colors and the shapes.

802
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,933
You appreciate the bottle
tree each and every day,

803
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:46,931
as you appreciate
your loved ones.

804
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,397
- Mr. Snead!

805
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,704
- Can you take me to
the old man, Bilal?

806
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:58,605
- That old heathen?

807
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,363
He's not important.

808
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,074
- Is he family?

809
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,534
- Oh, I guess so.

810
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,753
Everybody back off on
these islands is family.

811
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:14,499
Unfortunately, so many like
Bilal are so backwards.

812
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,843
They believe everything
that happens is caused by

813
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,380
conjure, magic, or
their ancestors.

814
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,644
They don't leave nothing to God.

815
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:27,428
- Where we're headed Nana,
there'll be no need for trees

816
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:31,443
covered with glass
jars in our yard.

817
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,767
We'll have gardens
of fresh flowers,

818
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,483
vegetables for the dinner table.

819
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:38,994
Where we're headed
Nana, there'll be

820
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,106
no need for an
old woman's magic.

821
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,624
(peaceful synth music)

822
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,068
- Look, look up!

823
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,492
And remember Ibo Landing!

824
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,363
Hold!

825
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:46,222
- Can't complain none about
them horseflies worrying you.

826
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,640
Stop putting that
lard on your head.

827
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:52,139
(women laughing)

828
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:55,273
- [Viola] The Lord will
carry us through, Nana.

829
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,811
Trust in Jesus.

830
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,610
Nana, we don't need no charms
of dried roots and flowers.

831
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:11,292
- When I was a child,
my mother cut this

832
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:15,417
from her hair before she
was sold away from we.

833
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,665
Now, I'm adding my own hair.

834
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:30,135
There must be a
bond, a connection,

835
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:34,309
between those who go North
and those who remain,

836
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:40,613
between us who are here and
those who are across the sea.

837
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:41,898
A connection!

838
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,993
We are as two
people in one body,

839
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,039
the last of the old

840
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,786
and the first of the new.

841
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:03,168
We will always live
this double life,

842
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:06,512
you know, because
we're from the sea.

843
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:09,298
We came here in chains,

844
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:12,771
and we must survive.

845
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,098
We must survive!

846
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,942
There's saltwater in we blood.

847
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,903
(waves crashing)

848
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,639
- (laughs) Mister,
for many years,

849
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,021
I've not spoken those
words with no one.

850
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,808
What I remember,
I'll tell you in

851
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,734
this language that I
learned to speak here.

852
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,782
I come here on a ship
called The Wanderer.

853
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,583
I come with the Ibo.

854
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,631
Some say the Ibo flew
back home to Africa.

855
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,625
Some say they all joined hands

856
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,588
and walked on top of the water.

857
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:31,389
But, Mister, I was there.

858
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,771
Those Ibo, men, women, and
children, a hundred or more,

859
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,885
shackled in iron,
when they go down

860
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:44,268
in that water, they
never came back up.

861
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,651
Ain't nobody can walk on water.

862
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,164
- We'll be fine, Nana.

863
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:00,041
Now, Nana, don't
you go worrying.

864
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,958
We're going to be just fine.

865
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,458
Mind now, Nana Peazant.

866
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,501
Don't go work yourself up.

867
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:10,514
It's too hot out
here for no mess.

868
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,974
Get a hold of yourself, Viola!

869
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:20,595
- I remember what my father
teach me before he passed on.

870
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,154
It was the same as
his father teach

871
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,856
him on the day he become a man.

872
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:32,199
He said, "Women are
the sweetness of life.

873
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:39,664
"They're sweet to the eye
because they're beautiful.

874
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:42,662
"They're sweet to
the ears because of

875
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:46,245
"their lovely voice
and the way they sing.

876
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,085
"Woman is the
sweetness of life,"

877
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:59,314
and that's what I remember.

878
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,131
(baby crying)

879
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:54,702
- I've been on my own
since I was a little girl.

880
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:01,738
I've been on my own
for such a long time,

881
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:05,664
I thought I wanted
it to be that way.

882
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:09,334
- Lord knows, you've
done worked hard, gal.

883
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:14,844
- You know, I'm not like
the other women here,

884
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,800
but I need to know
that I can come

885
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,760
and hold onto what I come from.

886
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,973
I need to know that
people here know my name.

887
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,894
I'm Yellow Mary Peazant!

888
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:30,274
And I'm a proud woman,
not a hard woman.

889
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,401
I want to stay.

890
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,334
I want to stay with you here.

891
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,793
- Oh, now how's
she going to come

892
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:50,209
and put her shame
upon Mother Peazant?

893
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,423
- I can't understand...

894
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:58,842
how me and Peazant
put you children

895
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:02,352
here on Earth to fight
among yourselves.

896
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:05,846
How you can leave
this soil, this soil.

897
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:12,060
The sweat of our love,
it's here in this soil.

898
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:19,403
(groans) I love you
'cause you're mine.

899
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:25,081
You're the fruit of an
ancient tree. (groans)

900
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:26,997
- Hush, hush, hush!

901
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,252
Hush, all of you.

902
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,633
Some of us aren't forgetting
how Yellow Mary sent the money

903
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:40,971
to get Cousin Jake out
of jail last spring.

904
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:45,218
- Now, Nana, we aren't talking
about no Cousin Jake here.

905
01:34:45,472 --> 01:34:49,232
A dog don't get mad
'cause you say he's a dog.

906
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:53,980
- Say it!

907
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,443
- If you're so
ashamed of Yellow Mary

908
01:34:58,694 --> 01:35:02,664
'cause she got ruined,
what do you say about me?

909
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:04,947
I'm ruined too?

910
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:10,655
- Whatever's to be said,
just say it now, Eula!

911
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:16,293
- As far as this
place is concerned,

912
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:20,466
we never was a pure woman.

913
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,932
Deep inside, we believed
that they ruined our mothers

914
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:32,101
and their mothers who
had come before them,

915
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,562
and we live our lives
always expecting the worst

916
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:39,154
'cause we feel we don't
deserve no better.

917
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:47,581
Deep inside, we
believe that even God

918
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,961
can't heal the
wounds of our past

919
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,035
or protect us from the world

920
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,632
that put shackles on our feet.

921
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:04,300
- My God loves me and protects
me and watches over me.

922
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,470
- Even though you're
going up north,

923
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,101
you all think about
being ruined, too.

924
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:18,108
You think you can cross
over to the mainland

925
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,226
and run away from it?

926
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,150
You're going to be sorry,
sorry if you don't change

927
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:28,244
your way of thinking before
you leave this place.

928
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,253
(retches)

929
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,809
If you love yourselves,

930
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:53,807
then love Yellow Mary,

931
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,765
because she's a part of you,

932
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:04,194
just like we're a
part of our mothers.

933
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:12,198
A lot of us are
going through things

934
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:15,412
you feel you can't
handle all alone.

935
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,380
There's going to be all kinds
of roads to take in life.

936
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:30,014
Let's not be afraid
to take them.

937
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:34,473
We deserve them because
we're all good women.

938
01:37:43,692 --> 01:37:46,072
Do you understand who we are

939
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,240
and what we have become?

940
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:55,695
We're the daughters
of those old dusty

941
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:58,794
things Nana carries
in her tin can.

942
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:06,131
We carry too many
scars from the past.

943
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,179
Our past owns us.

944
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:21,057
We wear our scars like
armor for protection.

945
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,654
Thick, hard, ugly scars that

946
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:32,445
no one can pass through
to ever hurt us again.

947
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:39,829
Let's live our
lives without living

948
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,251
in the fold of old wounds.

949
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,134
(sobbing)

950
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:17,329
(ethereal chimes music)

951
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:26,210
(wind howling and whistling)

952
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:49,113
- [Nana] Shad, how can
we plant in this dust?

953
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,529
- We plant 'em each and every
year, or we're finished.

954
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,535
(people socializing)

955
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,998
- My life is almost over,

956
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,546
and yours is just starting.

957
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,801
And I'm not going
to live long enough

958
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:19,602
to see what becomes of
all you free Negroes.

959
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:24,854
- [Peazant Boy] We're gonna
be watching from heaven, Nana.

960
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:29,193
- No, I'm not going to be
watching from no heaven

961
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:33,611
while there's still soil
here for me for planting.

962
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,495
We've done took old Gods

963
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,633
and given them new names.

964
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:54,468
(speaking in foreign language)

965
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,978
This hand, it's
from me, from them,

966
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:08,729
from us.

967
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:12,225
Same soul as you all have.

968
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:19,372
Come children, kiss
this hand full of me.

969
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,370
- Lord, have mercy, have mercy.

970
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:34,674
- [Nana] Take my hand.

971
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:39,339
I'm the one that can
give you strength.

972
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,900
Take me wherever you go.

973
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,356
I'm your strength.

974
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:07,576
Take my hand.

975
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,416
Take me wherever you go.

976
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:15,343
I'm your strength.

977
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,086
Wherever you go.

978
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,466
- Old folks are supposed to die!

979
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:25,722
It ain't right!

980
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:30,943
They're supposed to
die and go to heaven!

981
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:34,477
It ain't right! (cries)

982
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:43,775
It ain't right! (cries)

983
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,251
- Hoodoo!

984
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:52,249
Hoodoo!

985
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,210
Hoodoo!

986
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:56,421
Hoodoo mess!

987
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:03,514
Ain't no roots and herbs
going to change nothing.

988
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:06,391
Don't go and spoil everything.

989
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,729
Old Used-To-Do-It-This-Way
don't help none today!

990
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:33,457
(people gasping)

991
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:37,798
- [Nana] Come, come child, I
love you 'cause you're mine!

992
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:45,756
- [Viola] Mama, please!

993
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:14,503
- [Nana] Look at that, see?

994
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,419
(gulls cawing)

995
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:25,551
(man chanting in
foreign language)

996
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:43,241
(tranquil synth music)

997
01:45:24,902 --> 01:45:28,362
In this quiet place,
simple folk kneel down

998
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:32,986
and catch a glimpse
of the eternal.

999
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,423
Morning would begin a new life

1000
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:44,802
for my children and me.

1001
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:49,425
They would carry my spirit.

1002
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,890
I would remain here
with the old souls.

1003
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:34,846
- Iona, Iona!

1004
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,770
Iona! (sobs)

1005
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,930
(horse neighs)

1006
01:47:30,987 --> 01:47:33,697
- [Unborn Child] And
so, on the 19th day

1007
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,278
of August, 1902,

1008
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,079
they left these islands.

1009
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:45,843
And set out for the North,
having said farewell,

1010
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:50,628
perhaps, never to see us again.

1011
01:47:50,882 --> 01:47:53,932
(somber flute music)

1012
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:16,704
(triumphant harp
and flute music)

1013
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:21,119
My Momma and Daddy stayed
behind with Yellow Mary.

1014
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:25,713
Some say Eli got
himself all involved

1015
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:29,303
with the anti-lynching issue.

1016
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:36,178
Some say Eula saw too much
of herself in Nana Peazant

1017
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:39,967
and wanted her children
born on this island.

1018
01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:45,685
They say Mama was
always peculiar,

1019
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:49,187
and Nana's roots and
herbs set her off.

1020
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:57,656
All I know is, I was born
here before Nana passed on.

1021
01:49:03,162 --> 01:49:05,922
We remained behind,
growing older,

1022
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,090
wiser, stronger.

1023
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:29,562
(funky synth music)

1024
01:50:00,386 --> 01:50:04,136
(singing in foreign language)
