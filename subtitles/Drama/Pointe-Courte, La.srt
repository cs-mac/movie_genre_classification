{6514}{6610}-What? Like a union?|-More like a club. Work less, make more.
{6614}{6671}That´s a great idea,|but, uh, thank you. No.
{6675}{6733}"No". Remember Burma?

{6811}{6875}- You were like a colonel|in that army or something, right?|- Yeah. Yeah.
{6878}{6959}- And he sold you all those tanks|and you shipped them to Alabama.|- T-34s. I took a bath on that.
{6963}{7058}- Yeah. That was fun.|- That´s what I´m talkin´ about, kid.|We could be workin´ together again,|for God´s sake.
{7062}{7128}You know, makin´ big money,|killin´ important people.
{7132}{7231}I want to structure an arrangement|where you get, like, you know, shares...|original shares on the ground floor.
{7235}{7335}And you would be the president|of this organization, or maybe just|a father figure to me.
{7339}{7405}- Hey, if you want a father,|I´ll give you a spanking.|- Yeah. Forget about it.
{7409}{7475}- Look, the employers|are gettin´ us a lot cheaper|´cause there´s so many of us.|- Yeah.
{7479}{7529}- Well, after the Berlin thing,|what can you do?|- The Soviet bloc collapsed.

{9711}{9796}It´s in French.
{9800}{9879}- It´s a Greenpeace boat.|It´d be so easy.|- No way.
{9902}{9972}I have scruples.

{10218}{10296}You don´t seem like,|well, your old self lately.
{10300}{10383}If you don´t mind my asking, sir:|Is it the job?
{10387}{10437}Is it getting to you?
{10441}{10520}You know, when you start getting invited|to your ten-year high school reunion...
{10524}{10568}time is catching up.
{10572}{10640}Are you talkin´ about a sense of|my own mortality or a fear of death?
{10644}{10703}Well, I haven´t really thought|about it quite like that.
{10707}{10753}- Did you go to yours?|- Yes, I did.
{10757}{10860}- It was just as if everyone had swelled.|- Why are you so interested in me|goin´ to my reunion?
{10864}{10939}I just find it amusing|that you came from somewhere.
{10943}{11002}Bye.
{12957}{13015}Fuck!
{13413}{13531}Whatever it is I´m doing that|you don´t like, I´ll stop doing it.
{13535}{13581}It´s not me.
{13961}{14035}- Morning.|- Hi.
{14134}{14200}- Sir, may I come in?|- Uh, gimme a second.
{14852}{14907}- Sir, they´re very unhappy.|- I´m very unhappy.
{14911}{15033}- It was supposed to|look like a heart attack.|He was supposed to die in his sleep.|- Well, he moved.
{15037}{15140}His sleep research pattern suggested|deep sleep at that hour.|There´s nothing to be done about it.
{15144}{15188}Sir, this is|a very valuable firm.
{15192}{15262}- Come in here.|- We´ve done a lot of business|with them over the years...
{15266}{15311}and they blame you|for the snafu.
{15315}{15388}- They say you´ve got to make amends.|- When?
{15392}{15440}A canary decided to sing.
{15444}{15531}They scheduled his deposition|for early Monday morning.|You´ve gotta do it this weekend.
{15535}{15663}This weekend? No. lmpossible.|Tell them I need my normal lead time.
{15694}{15731}Where?
{15735}{15828}I´m getting a black cat, Friday-the-13th|kinda feeling about this one.
{15832}{15932}It´s in Detroit.|You can take care of business and stop|by Grosse Pointe for your reunion.
{15979}{16061}Hey, look, Sergeant Pepper.|I really need you to shut up about that.
{16065}{16121}Sir, it´s outta my hands.
{16125}{16244}The gods want you to go back home,|and they want you to delete someone|while you´re there.
{16248}{16328}Would you describe their position|on this matter as inflexible?
{16332}{16454}Intractable, sir. I booked you on|an early flight tomorrow morning.
{16458}{16527}Dossier.
{16531}{16598}All right... All right, listen.|I´m gonna call you from Detroit.
{16602}{16711}And just make sure that you pick up|the dry cleaning and feed the cat.
{16715}{16772}- Okay?|- Don´t forget your identity.
{16776}{16822}All right. Thank you.
{16953}{17055}- Could you, um, tell Dr. Oatman|that I´m on my way?|- Oh, yes. Of course.
{17059}{17157}- All right?|- Mm-hmm.|- Bye-bye.|- Bye.
{17164}{17235}So I got invited to my ten-year|high school reunion.
{17238}{17294}I´m conflicted. I mean,|I don´t know if I really want to go.
{17298}{17362}It´s in Detroit, you know, and I grew up|there, but I just honestly don´t know...
{17366}{17435}what I have in common|with those people anymore.
{17439}{17562}I mean, or with anyone, really. I mean,|they´ll all have husbands and wives...
{17566}{17631}and children and houses|and dogs, and, you know,|they´ll have made themselves...
{17635}{17736}a part of something, and they|can talk about what they do,|and what am I gonna say?
{17740}{17809}"I killed the president|of Paraguay with a fork.
{17813}{17863}How have you been?"
{17867}{17989}I´m just thinkin´ it´ll be depressing.|It´ll be depressing.
{17993}{18041}Shouldn´t you be taking|notes or something?
{18045}{18115}I´m not taking notes, Martin,|because I´m not your doctor.
{18119}{18227}- Please don´t start|with that stuff again.|- Martin, I´m emotionally|involved with you.
{18231}{18283}- How are you emotionally|involved with me?|- I´m afraid of you.
{18287}{18352}- You´re afraid of me.|- And that constitutes|an emotional involvement...
{18356}{18416}and it would be unethical for me to work|with you under those circumstances.
{18420}{18481}Don´t you think maybe you´re|just upset because I told you|what I do for a living...
{18485}{18545}and you got upset and you´re letting it|interfere with our dynamic?
{18549}{18621}Whoa! Martin, you didn´t tell me|what you did for a living...
{18625}{18712}- Yes, I did.|- You didn´t tell me what you did|for a living for four sessions.
{18716}{18791}Then you told me, and I said,|"I don´t wanna work with you".
{18795}{18924}And yet you come back every week at the|same time. That´s a difficulty for me.
{18928}{18982}On top of that,|if you´ve committed a crime...
{18986}{19051}or if you´re thinking about committing|a crime, I have to tell the authorities.
{19055}{19094}I know the law, okay?
{19098}{19195}But I don´t want to be withholding.|I´m very serious about this process.
{19199}{19270}- And I know where you live.|- Oh, now. See.
{19274}{19351}That wasn´t a nice thing to say. That|wasn´t designed to make me feel good.
{19355}{19411}That´s a kind of|a not-too-subtle intimidation...
{19415}{19509}and l, uh... I get filled with anxiety|when you talk about something like that.
{19513}{19582}- Come on. Come on.|- I mean, that´s...|- I was just kidding, all right.|The thought never crossed my mind.
{19586}{19650}You did think of it, Martin.|You thought of it and then you said it.
{19654}{19701}And now I´m left with, uh...|with the aftermath of that...
{19705}{19807}thinking I gotta... I gotta be creative|in a really interesting way now|or Martin´s gonna blow my brains out.
{19811}{19859}You´re holding me hostage here.|That´s not right.
{19863}{19945}I just wanna work, okay?|There are some issues that|I need to work on in my life.
{19949}{20011}I´ve read your books.|Your best sellers, on the top 20.
{20015}{20076}- They were both ghost written, Martin.|- What? The Annihilation of Death?
{20080}{20134}- Yeah.|- Kill Who? A Warrior´s Dilemma.
{20138}{20189}I read it.|The New York Times top 20.
{20193}{20260}- Well, l... I don´t know what to say.|- Well, what do you say|to other patients, you know?
{20264}{20331}- I don´t know. How does it work?|Ask me how I´m feeling.|- How do you feel?
{20335}{20400}I´m feelin´ uneasy, man.|Um, I´m just dispassionate.
{20404}{20532}I´m bored. I´m... It´s hard to stay in|a good mood. I´ve had problems at work.
{20536}{20622}You know, concept/execution stuff.|And I´m just ill at ease.
{20626}{20693}Well, look, Martin,|I don´t want to suggest anything|that might be uncomfortable for you...
{20697}{20788}but you might consider...|just consider the possibility|that part of your problem...
{20792}{20891}part of the thing that´s making|you so miserable is the angst|over killing a lot of people.
{20895}{20965}- Maybe... Just put it|in the background there.|- Come on.
{20969}{21047}I show up at your door, chances|are you did something to bring me there.
{21051}{21096}Okay? I don´t care|about that stuff.
{21100}{21151}- You don´t care about what stuff?|- You know, morality.
{21155}{21233}- Hmm.|- I don´t want to talk about work...
{21237}{21335}because I don´t think|necessarily what a person does|for a living reflects who he is.
{21339}{21416}So what do we do?|We talk about dreams? Or what´s next?|What´s next? What´s the score here?
{21420}{21485}We´ll talk about dreams. We can talk|about dreams. It´s your nickel.
{21489}{21571}Sure. Uh, I had|another one about Debi.
{21575}{21666}- That girl you´re obsessed with?|- Don´t you think "obsessed"|is a strong word?
{21670}{21763}Uh, recurring dreams|of loss and pain for ten years|featuring the same person.
{21767}{21861}Yeah, maybe that´s a bit excessive.
{21865}{21987}Um, I had one where I was, uh,|that television mechanical rabbit.|You know, with the-the-the...
{21991}{22099}- The battery bunny.|- Yeah. I was the bunny.|- That sounds like a very,|very depressed dream.
{22103}{22149}- Really?|- Yes.|- Why?
{22153}{22239}Martin, it´s a terrible dream!|It´s a depressing dream|to dream about that rabbit.
{22243}{22303}It´s got no brain.|It´s got no blood. It´s got no anima.
{22307}{22377}It just keeps banging on those|meaningless cymbals endlessly...
{22381}{22453}and going and going and going.
{22457}{22579}- Time is up.|- Time´s up already?|You really wanna do half a session?
{22633}{22692}Could we just pretend like we have|a normal doctor/patient relationship?
{22696}{22763}I´ll ask you a piece of advice|and you give me an answer?
{22767}{22811}You know... advice.|Should I go to the reunion?
{22815}{22869}Yes, yes. Get out of town.
{22873}{22957}- Thank you.|- Go see some old friends. Have some|punch. Visit with what´s-her-name.
{22961}{23007}- Debi.|- Debi.
{23011}{23079}- Don´t kill anybody for a few days.|See what it feels like.|- All right, I´ll give it a shot.
{23083}{23162}No, no. Don´t give it a shot.|Don´t shoot anything.
{23300}{23392}"Services for Detroit|contract terminated.
{23396}{23503}Contract being serviced by alternate|vendor for original quote".
{23507}{23559}What fucking alternate vendor?
{23563}{23608}No, no, no.
{23612}{23717}Preparations have begun|in good faith.
{23814}{23865}Fuckin´ Martin Blank.
{23869}{23948}Snaked the Detroit job|from under me.
{24165}{24296}- Agent Farrell.|- Yes. Extension 1715, please.
{24300}{24397}- Yeah?|- Lardner?|- Yeah.|- I´ve got your pigeon for ya.
{24401}{24492}Arriving Detroit airport today. He´s|supposed to hit a star federal witness.
{24496}{24581}Now, my advice is you wait till he gets|the witness and then you guys do him.
{24625}{24731}When I´m a-walking I strut my stuff|Then I´m so strung out
{24735}{24842}I´m high as a kite|I just might stop to check you out
{24846}{24905}Let me go on
{24909}{24958}Like I blister in the sun
{24962}{25027}Let me go on
{25031}{25090}Big hands|I know you´re the one
{25094}{25209}Remember to kick it over
{25213}{25327}No one will guide you|Oh...
{25331}{25414}-You´ve never met Martin Blank.|-You know, Grocer pointed him out to me.
{25418}{25471}I´m tellin´ you that you|never met Martin Blank, okay?
{25475}{25547}No. Seventeen months ago, I was postin´|a walk in Lisbon and he was there.
{25551}{25616}He hasn´t been|in Lisbon since 1990.
{25620}{25672}You know how I know that?|I read the file.
{25676}{25799}- Read the file.|- You know, as a matter of fact,|I actually talked to him in Bonn.
{25803}{25873}You always... You always|have to know everybody. I tell you what.
{25877}{25991}- Why don´t I take the weekend off|and you kill him,|since you two are so close?|- All right. I´ll do that.
{25995}{26097}The battle is getting harder
{26101}{26215}In this racial armageddon time

{29244}{29281}- You look great.|- Oh, thank you.|Thank you very much, Martin.
{29285}{29377}You have always been|very good at saying that|and not sounding like a kiss-ass.
{29381}{29432}So, what happened?
{29436}{29507}I mean, we... we thought|Princeton, Harvard.
{29511}{29578}You fooled us all in the teacher´s pool|and went nowhere.
{29582}{29663}I guess you could say I went west,|you know, the way of Horatio Alger|and Davy Crockett.
{29667}{29762}- The Donner party...|- Thank you. Thank you.|That´s a, a barrage of imagery.
{29766}{29867}Are you still, uh, you know, inflicting|all that horrible Ethan Frome damage?|Is that off the curriculum?
{29871}{29937}- It´s off the curriculum now.|- Oh, that was a horrible book.|- That´s a very nice tie you have on.
{29941}{30003}- Oh, thanks.|- You look like a mortician. I mean...
{30007}{30067}- You like it?|- Yeah. Thanks. So, I gotta...|- You still got that|whole Mary Tyler Moore thing.
{30071}{30136}- Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.|That´s enough. Uh-huh.|- Right. Good to see you again.
{30140}{30245}- Yeah. Good to see you.|Where... Where are you off to?|- I´m, uh... I´m goin´ home.

{30879}{31010}But if this ever-changing world|in which we live in
{31014}{31110}Makes you give in and cry

{35128}{35240}So, I spoke to your father|the other day.
{35244}{35328}- I imagine that´d be rather difficult.|- No, no. It wasn´t. It wasn´t.
{35332}{35378}- No?|- No.
{35382}{35455}They told me|you have been taking lithium.

{40770}{40820}How are... How are you?|It´s good to see you. You look great.
{40824}{40907}How long has it been, ten years?|How long has it been?
{40911}{40986}Since you stood me up on prom night|and vanished without a word?
{40990}{41044}Yeah. Ten years, I think.
{41048}{41136}- Yeah.|- Mm-hmm.
{41140}{41214}- You tell me about yourself.|- I´m in California.
{41218}{41324}- Travel a lot around on business.|- That´s it?
{41328}{41404}- Yeah.|- That´s ten years?
{41408}{41495}- Yeah.|- I would hope for a great|abduction story or something.
{41499}{41636}Well, I´ve had a few thrilling moments|here and there, but, you know,|it just flew by.
{41640}{41704}So what´s your business?
{41707}{41766}Professional killer.
{41770}{41836}- Do you get dental with that?|- No.
{41922}{42014}I gotta go. So, you´re working. It´s|a great... I mean, it´s a great show.
{42018}{42123}I´ve been listening. I mean, since I got|back into town. But I´ll come back.
{42127}{42220}- What are the odds?|- Very funny. I´ll... See you.
{42224}{42271}Pressure, pressure|pressure
{42275}{42332}Pressure´s gonna drop on you
{42336}{42422}I say pressure, pressure|pressure, pressure
{42426}{42475}Pressure´s gonna drop on you
{42543}{42615}Someone has come to me|out of the past...
{42619}{42700}reviving a feeling|long since forgotten.
{42704}{42787}I know I should be mad,|and I am.
{42871}{42970}- What´s he doin´?|- I have no clue.
{42974}{43092}He says cryptic things|and is gone abruptly again.
{43203}{43269}Oh, boy. What...|What is this I´m feeling here?
{43273}{43354}What... Is this pain?|Is this panic? Is it pleasure?
{43358}{43425}- Am I hungry? Who´s hungry?|- 79.5.
{43429}{43540}Okay, first five callers|will receive a sentimental breakfast|from Cuppa Joe´s...
{43544}{43623}courtesy of the long-lost love|of my life.
{43675}{43755}The man who vanished.
{43800}{43884}The man who is walking|right back into the station...
{43888}{43950}and into my booth.
{44047}{44093}Sit.
{44360}{44494}Okay, let´s take a random day.|Uh, spring of ´86.
{44498}{44576}Two young lovers with|frightening natural chemistry.
{44604}{44663}A girl sits...
{44667}{44766}in a $700 prom dress...
{44770}{44868}on the front steps of her house|waiting for the most romantic|night of her young life.
{44872}{44918}The boy never shows up.
{44922}{44966}Not until now.
{44970}{45070}- So, what´s the question?|- Where have I been?
{45074}{45129}- More like "What happened, Mr. Blank?"|- I don´t know.
{45133}{45187}I mean, I could... I could venture|a guess, but I think it would|sound like a rationalization.
{45191}{45280}You know, some sort of a cop-out.|I thought coming home,|seeing some friends...
{45284}{45394}and I thought maybe, you know,|seeing you, of course, would be the|most important part of that equation.
{45398}{45475}That didn´t...|That didn´t come out right.|Uh, there´s... This is not my idea.
{45479}{45543}This whole... This whole thing is|my therapist´s idea, really.
{45627}{45674}Is this bothering you?
{45933}{46004}Okay. So, you´re back...
{46008}{46087}a decade late, and you´re on some sort|of therapeutic assignment...
{46091}{46143}and you wanna|sort things out with me.
{46147}{46260}So the question now becomes: Do I allow|you access to me, or do I call security?
{46264}{46379}- I don´t think that´d be a good idea.|- Grosse Pointe, I need your help.|555-WGPM.
{46383}{46491}Do you think maybe we could go|get a cup of coffee and I could try|to explain and apologize?
{46554}{46646}Come on, Marty. This segues|so nicely into my ´80s weekend.
{46650}{46744}Should a once brokenhearted girl|give a guy a second chance?
{46779}{46823}Let´s go to the phones.
{46827}{46882}- You´re on the air.|- Hi, Debi. It´s Gail.
{46886}{46944}- Oh, hi, Gail.|- You know, I wouldn´t take him back yet.
{46948}{47034}I'd make him jump through some hoops|for a while, walk over hot coals.
{47038}{47124}- Make him beg for it.|- Harsh. That´s very harsh, Gail.
{47128}{47181}Maybe we could discuss this|in a more discrete setting?
{47185}{47259}Make like a beggar.|You know. Come on...
{47263}{47339}- Next caller. You´re on the air.|- Debi, man, it´s Nathaniel.
{47343}{47442}I don´t hear any real remorse, dude.|I mean, like, I don´t think I'd|let this guy back in your life.
{47446}{47517}And, dude, I'd make him|wear that prom dress.
{47521}{47603}Does anybody else have a question for|Marty? I do, but he´s a shifty one.
{47607}{47683}- Put that down.|- I have a question for Marty.|- Uh-uh.
{47687}{47755}- I´ve a question for Martin.|- Next caller. You´re on the air.
{47759}{47820}Yeah, Debi. Hi.|Longtime listener, first-time caller.
{47824}{47907}I love the show. Uh, so, Martin, what?|No yellow ribbons?
{47911}{48019}Didn´t anybody miss you?|Don´t you think you should tell her why|you´re really in town, tough guy?
{48023}{48102}Huh? You know what we love?|We love tough guys like you.
{48106}{48190}Thanks. That was our own Michigan|Militia with their latest chart-topper.
{48194}{48261}Come on, people.|Do I give this guy the time of day?
{48265}{48367}Marty, do you have|any deeply personal responses...
{48371}{48421}you want to share|with our listeners?
{48425}{48513}No? Okay. He´s shaking his head "no".|In radio, that usually signals|the end of the interview.
{48517}{48578}Grosse Pointe, Michigan,|I hear you loud and clear.
{48582}{48631}If you love something,|set it free.
{48635}{48742}If it comes back to you,|it´s, well...
{48802}{48848}broken.
{48939}{49012}Damn it!|Never trust my instincts.
{49671}{49717}Marty!
{49782}{49843}Paul. Don´t leave me|hangin´, baby.
{49847}{49916}- Hey, man.|- How the hell you doin´?
{50024}{50094}- Walk with me, man.|- Sure.|- I got my car parked around the corner.
{50098}{50215}- Okay.|- Yeah. Goddamn. I was worried|you joined a cult or something, man.
{50219}{50292}I half expected you to come back into|town in a fennel wreath and paper pants.
{50296}{50338}- No money in it.|- Says you.
{50342}{50412}- Look at you. You´ve gone respectable.|- Well, you know, I stopped|pouting on the sidelines.
{50416}{50468}I got in the game. You know,|joined the working week.
{50472}{50550}So why don´t you|valet park your high horse, slick,|and take it easy on your old buddy Paul?
{50554}{50620}- Fair enough. Fair enough.|It was a cheap shot.|- Yeah, it was.
{50654}{50713}- Man! L-Let´s catch up, huh?|- Yeah! Let´s catch up.
{50717}{50795}- I got a real estate deal.|I´m takin´ ´em through|a final walk-through, you know.|- Okay.
{50799}{50869}- This your Beemer?|- Yeah.|- In Detroit? That´s sacrilege.
{50873}{50935}- Well, you know,|guess who I got it from?|- I have no idea.
{50939}{51012}- Bob Destepello.|- Bob Destepello sold you a car?
{51016}{51097}- Yeah, he did.|- Didn´t he, uh, break your collarbone|and steal, uh, your woman?
{51101}{51145}- Yeah.|- So you´re in real estate, huh?
{51149}{51211}Yeah. I got a couple newlyweds|with a decision-making disorder.
{51215}{51287}I´ll just hold their hands|and reinforce their clarity.
{51291}{51379}- Isn´t there some sort of Frank|Lloyd Wright connection with this?|- You know what? There is indeed.
{51383}{51462}- For the life of me,|I can´t believe I forgot.|- Blank!
{51611}{51689}Hey, Blank. Hey, I was drivin´ by,|saw you on the lawn.
{51693}{51766}I thought there was gonna|be a problem at first, you know,|before I recognized you.
{51770}{51876}- Terry Rostand. How you doin´? P.H.S.|- Terry Rostand. Oh, yeah, from...|You were always the guy who was...
{51880}{51933}- Yeah.|- Yeah, I remember you.|- Yeah, ´86.|- Yeah, cool.
{51937}{52001}How you doin´, man? You look good.|You´ve become a cop. Nice badge.
{52005}{52083}Oh, no, no. I´m not a peace officer.|No, no, no. This badge isn´t|a meaningful symbol or anything.
{52087}{52151}It´s just a badge|of my company, you know.|We don´t... We don´t enforce the law.
{52154}{52248}- We just execute company policy|for homeowners.|- Oh, I get it. Cool.
{52252}{52327}- Well, you mind talkin´ a little shop?|- Sure.
{52331}{52378}When are you authorized|to use deadly force?
{52382}{52463}Well, you know, of course...|you know, taxes provide your|basic service, police and whatnot.
{52467}{52515}But our customers need|a little bit more than that, you know.
{52519}{52588}So if we find you on the property,|you know, we do what we have to do.
{52592}{52722}So, if I just look suspicious on your|customer´s property under those, you|know, "heightened" circumstances...
{52726}{52790}- you have the authority to shoot me?|- Correct.
{52793}{52858}Wow, all right. All right.|How´d you get the gig?
{52862}{52933}Oh, you know, they were hiring.|It was only a two-week course.
{52937}{52996}- Yeah, that´s good. Well,|that made it easy. You look good.|- Yeah. Thanks.
{53000}{53092}It´s a beauty. What more can I say?|You know, you´ll be raising|your family in a work of art.
{53096}{53204}- A work of art in a work of art.|- Oh, yeah.
{53208}{53295}- Well, I...|- I´ve always felt very|temporary about myself.
{53299}{53365}And looking at the two of you|and this house...
{53369}{53485}when my time comes... if it ever does...|I want a house like this;|I want a wife like you.
{53489}{53571}- Uh-huh.|- And you´ll be safe here.
{53575}{53662}- We really gotta go.|- Okay, so, uh, gimme a call, you guys.
{53666}{53766}- Gimme a call. You´re not gonna go|through another broker, are you?|- Oh, definitely not.
{53770}{53831}- Okay.|- Cute couple. I don´t think|they´re real buyers, though.
{53835}{53891}- I don´t know if you´re qualified|to make that statement, Terry.|- No, I´m just saying they look like...
{53895}{53948}From 11:00 to 3:00|I show the house, Terry.
{53952}{54029}- Well, they don´t look|like people who´d use the...|you know, live in this neighborhood...|- Did you get a call, Terry?
{54033}{54131}Oh, no. l, um... I was just driving by|and, um, you know, I saw some people|milling around the, the lawn here.
{54135}{54203}- No, there was just me. It was|just one guy. I was right there.|- Oh. Okay.
{54207}{54277}- Terry.|- Well, that´s what I thought.|I just came by.|- Look, l-I show people houses here...
{54281}{54319}and I'd appreciate it|if you don´t show up, okay?|- Well, I know you do.
{54323}{54395}- But you think... You´re coming|around here in the neighborhood|unannounced, you know.|- Listen. Did you get a call, Terry?
{54399}{54460}- No, but sometimes...|- Did you get a call?|- You don´t know the alarm codes.|- Did you get a call, Terry?
{54464}{54524}- No. They go off and this...|How am I supposed to know?|- Okay, this is the part where you go.|You´re gonna have to go.
{54528}{54584}- Listen. Thing is, you know, I´m more a|part of this neighborhood than you are.|- Okay. We´ll see you later, Terry.
{54588}{54694}Besides that, you know,|a lot of times you don´t know|the alarm codes when you´re checking|the house and, uh, the alarm goes off.
{54698}{54771}- Wow!|- Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
{54902}{54973}- You know, what can you do?|I´m sorry about the "temporary" thing.|I was just...|- No, don´t even worry about it.
{54977}{55041}I don´t... I don´t even care. Listen,|I don´t usually pimp my friends...
{55044}{55120}but I got an excellent piece of property|I think you might wanna look at.
{55124}{55174}- I got a few minutes.|- Listen, I gotta get something|off my chest.
{55178}{55246}- Have you been home|to see the old house?|- Yeah.
{55250}{55348}- Torn down in the name of convenience.|- Yeah, I brokered the deal.
{55352}{55425}- I tried to get... I tried to get|a family in there, but Ultimart|made the best offer.|- Wow. Wow.
{55429}{55523}- Well, thank you for profiting|on my childhood.|- Stop your fooling around
{55586}{55644}Time to straighten right out
{55727}{55798}Take a look at this, uh,|new listing.
{55802}{55891}- Debi´s house.|- Yeah. Kinda crept up on you, didn´t it?
{55895}{55951}No, you drove us here.
{55955}{56003}Yep.
{56246}{56308}So, uh...|So, how´s the family, man?
{56312}{56394}- Oh, you didn´t know? Of course you|don´t know. You don´t know anything.|- No, I mean I didn´t...
{56398}{56440}- Parents are divorced.|- They got divorced?
{56444}{56523}Yeah, my dad´s...|He´s shacking up with his woman.|She´s like 20 years younger than him.
{56527}{56615}She´s like a biscuit older than me.|It´s ugly. My mom´s making|ceramic night-lights.
{56619}{56725}- Takes, like, the plain shells|and, you know, paints ´em.|- How´s your sister? Did she ever...|Did she ever marry that guy Kenny?
{56729}{56806}- Kenny?|- Yeah. Did that ever work out?
{56810}{56869}Come on, man.|He did three years at Joliet.
{56873}{56974}They put one of those bracelets|on him, like a LoJack, you know.|They know where he is at all times.
{56978}{57045}- I think he´s at Pizza Hut right now.|- So let´s not go there.|- No.
{57049}{57102}Yeah, yeah. So, you look good.|You seem good.
{57106}{57164}Thank you.|You may have, uh...
{57168}{57243}Ten years, man! Ten!
{57247}{57321}Where have you been|for ten years?
{57325}{57381}I freaked out...
{57385}{57467}joined the army,|went into business for myself.
{57471}{57528}I´m a professional killer.
{57532}{57612}Oh, does that... Do you have to|do postgraduate work for that,|or can you... or can you jump right in?
{57616}{57665}- I´m curious about that.|- No, it´s an open market.
{57669}{57715}- Open market. That´s good. Wow.|- Yeah.
{57719}{57775}Ten years, man!
{57779}{57826}Ten year... Ten years!
{57830}{57879}Ten years! Ten!
{57883}{57962}Ten years! Ten years.
{57966}{58051}I freaked out!|I joined the army!
{58055}{58112}I worked for the government!|I went into business with myself!
{58116}{58180}I´m a professional killer.|That´s what I did!
{58183}{58251}- Okay. Well, can I join up?|- Yes!
{58340}{58386}Come on.
{58390}{58527}- Well, how´s your mom, man?|Is she still... Is she a little loopy?|- She´s... She is uncorked, man.
{58531}{58626}All right, I´ll see you at the|l-peaked-and-I´m-kidding-myself party.
{59087}{59154}- Pacific Trident Global.|- I need some data.
{59158}{59212}Hey, there.|How´d the assignment go?
{59216}{59320}- I´ll do it tomorrow.|- What´s it look like?
{59324}{59461}Looks fine. Looks like it always does.|Nothing remarkable about it.|Nothing remarkable at all.
{59465}{59551}You´re taking your time?|Just being professional?
{59555}{59626}Something like that. Look, I got|a job to do. I´m gonna do it, right?
{59630}{59735}Um... Oh, the reason I called. Could you|find out who else is in town and why?
{59739}{59785}I´ve made two spooks|and a ghoul so far.
{59789}{59885}So, if they double booked the job,|and/or they´re gonna kill me,|you know, I'd like to know about it.
{59889}{59946}- That´d be great|if you could find that out.|- Okay, got it.
{59950}{60072}- Bye, bye.|- Amelia? Wait. Hold on a second.|Pacific Trident Global.
{60076}{60152}Janice?
{60156}{60241}Yeah, no, where the fuck is it?|I ordered it three days ago.
{60352}{60466}No, that doesn´t work.|That´s... That´s not right.|Let me go over it again, all right?
{60470}{60574}Let´s see, 3,000 rounds of nine|millimeter subsonic. You had that.
{60578}{60675}I gave that to you|on the fuckin´ list!
{60679}{60828}Well, I don´t give a goddamn|where it is! You get it here now!
{60832}{60913}Amelia? I´m sorry.
{60917}{61050}Yeah, no. No, I´m... It´s not gonna be|a boring soup. It´s just... That´s just|the base. You put the chicken in.
{61054}{61154}You´ve gotta add other flavors.|Carrots and celery are just|a base of the soup!
{63351}{63402}What the fuck, man?
{64186}{64272}- Cool.|- What´d you do that for?
{64304}{64398}It´s not me.|You all right?
{64402}{64484}- No, I´m not all right!|- Take it easy.
{64488}{64580}I´m hurt. I´m pissed.|I gotta find a new job.
{64918}{64977}- WGPM-FM.|- Debra, it´s Martin.
{64981}{65043}- Hi, Martin.|- Listen, that thing|didn´t go as I planned.
{65047}{65096}Uh, seeing you, it didn´t|really go as I planned. l...
{65100}{65164}- Oh, it was just as I planned.|- Well, I´m wondering how you are.
{65167}{65246}And I would like to catch|up with you if that´s possible.|I don´t know if it´s possible.
{65250}{65356}- Well, okay, let´s catch up.|- Well, I thought maybe we could|go someplace and talk...
{65360}{65427}- Well, I talk all day.|- Well, then just listen. Maybe, uh...
{65431}{65513}- Maybe we could go to, you know,|the Hippo Club, say, in 30 minutes?|- Yeah, okay.
{65517}{65588}By the way, is this, uh, live, or,|you know, are we being broadcast again?
{65592}{65685}Not right now, but I tend to record|everything, ´cause you never know.
{65689}{65760}- Right, right, right. That´s|a good point. I´ll see you there and...|- Okay.
{65764}{65854}And I'd like to explain some|things to you and have a good...
{65926}{65974}Martin Blank.
{66217}{66295}- You seem very nervous.|- No, no, I´m not. It´s just...
{66299}{66345}Why do you keep looking|over your shoulder?
{66349}{66448}No, I just don´t like having my back...|You know, it´s a habit.|But let´s not talk about that.
{66452}{66499}- I come here, I wanna talk to you.|- Okay.
{66503}{66542}- Put the spotlight on you.|- Sure.
{66546}{66651}You got married. That´s hard to imagine.|It´s just un... It´s unbelievable.
{66655}{66731}No, it´s, it´s pretty normal, Martin.|It happens all the time.
{66735}{66834}- It´s not like you|went away for the weekend.|- Can I ask you a question?
{66838}{66958}I mean, if it´s too personal, you don´t|have to answer. But what happened?
{66962}{67077}I think... I think|I married him to get away.
{67081}{67149}- Didn´t like where I ended up.|- What was the guy like?
{67153}{67207}- Well, he...|- It doesn´t matter.|Forget about that question.
{67211}{67295}But, I... Same thing happened|to me, you know, when I joined|the army; it´s a marriage of sorts.
{67299}{67399}Oh, on prom night.|That´s psychotic.
{67403}{67473}How could you|possibly join the army?
{67477}{67560}I just... It´s something I felt like|I had to do. It´s hard to explain.|I mean, I know it doesn´t make sense.
{67564}{67672}No, it doesn´t make any sense.|Do you know how much time I spent|on, on this masochistic cycle...
{67676}{67743}just trying to figure out|what I'd done to drive you away?|- Nothing.
{67747}{67808}Yeah, well, you tell me that now.|It´s a little late.
{67812}{67922}And I thought you´d been murdered|or brainwashed or... At least,|I'd hoped that´s what had happened.
{67926}{67975}Well, I´m sorry to disappoint you.
{67979}{68073}So, you know. Come on, spill. What have|you been doing the last ten years?
{68077}{68172}- Well, you must´ve had worthwhile|experiences you wanna tell me about.|- Bad experiences.
{68176}{68237}- You met people?|- Bad people.
{68241}{68288}- You´re pathetic.|You know what you need?|- What?
{68292}{68365}- Shockabuku.|- You wanna tell me what that means?
{68369}{68485}It´s a swift, spiritual kick to the|head that alters your reality forever.
{68489}{68600}Ooh, that´d be good.|I think.
{68604}{68668}So, listen, I was thinking|I could pick you up for the reunion|around 7:00? We go...
{68672}{68805}Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.|You are asking me to go as your date|to the reunion?
{68809}{68894}- Yes.|- It´s unbelievable.
{68898}{68944}Well, you know,|what the hell.
{68948}{69000}- You know, I´m not even|planning on going.|- Really?
{69004}{69096}Really. I´m... I was just gonna|be mean about them on the radio.
{69100}{69164}- You know.|- Yeah, yeah.|- Besides, Marty, it´s...|it´s just gonna be depressing.
{69167}{69277}Maybe. But listen, if you wanna go,|I can´t think of any reason|why we wouldn´t go together.
{69281}{69358}- I can.|- I think if you can open up,|forget, forgive a little.
{69362}{69479}- And I think it´d be good for you,|and I´ll be on time.|- Showing up would be a big step.
{69544}{69595}- Well, I´ll think about it.|- Really?
{69599}{69665}- Yeah.|- Oh, my God! It´s Marvin and Debi.
{69669}{69720}It´s me, Amy.
{69724}{69797}- Amy!|- Yes! You´re still together?
{69801}{69919}Oh, God, you were|the coolest couple!
{69923}{69975}- Whoa, whoa.|- Still are. Oh, I´m so sorry.
{69979}{70051}- Here, you want my drink?|- That´s okay. No, no, God.|- No, no, don´t worry about a thing.
{70055}{70124}Debi, I love your show.|It´s so timeless.
{70128}{70204}- Yeah, it does run|a little long sometimes.|- Marvy, are you here for the reunion?
{70208}{70268}- Sure.|- Where you been these last ten years?
{70272}{70334}- Yeah, Marv, where ya been?|- You look great.
{70338}{70384}Thanks. I work|at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
{70388}{70458}- You do not.|- I do. I sell biscuits and gravy|all over the southland.
{70462}{70549}- No.|- Mm-hmm.|- You´re so funny. He´s a funny guy.
{70553}{70656}- You know, Tim, my husband...|- Listen, why don´t I get you two another|drink and you guys can just catch up.
{70660}{70739}- Oh, could I have a Stoli|with three olives and an onion?|- Yeah.
{70743}{70824}- Oh, I´ll have what she´s having.|- Sure.
{70922}{70968}Oh, hi.
{71119}{71194}That girl down there,|she doesn´t trust me anymore.
{71198}{71288}I don´t know why.|I´m trying to earn back her trust.
{71493}{71611}I´m gonna go downstairs, finish my|drink, walk her to the car, and I´ll be|back at the hotel in about a half-hour.
{71615}{71668}I´ll see you there?
{71766}{71882}- That´s him!|- Yeah, we know. Thank you.|We´ve been following him around.
{71886}{71934}Well, what´s the problem here?|You guys on an hourly rate?
{71938}{72002}If we observe the subject|in an illegal act...
{72005}{72085}only then can we intervene|and terminate.
{72089}{72168}- Yeah.|- Why don´t you just go|and shoot the fucker, huh?
{72172}{72283}Because we´re not assassins, Mr. Grocer.|We work for the American government.
{72287}{72356}Hey, he´s coming back.
{72523}{72591}Ah, fuck you, guys!
{72595}{72659}Hey, I don´t appreciate|being hosed.
{72686}{72765}- You´re exactly the same.|- So are you.|- I am?
{72769}{72818}- Mm-hmm.|- How so?|- Just like I remembered you.
{72822}{72865}Oh, yeah? Troubled?
{72869}{72952}- I´m troubled? Yeah. Well, I got...|I got a few problems. Don´t you?|- Sure.
{72956}{73020}- Yeah? What´d you do about it?|- Well, I tried everything, you know.
{73024}{73093}I went to the nutritionist,|the herbalist, the psychiatrist.
{73097}{73140}Really? That´s quite a list.|Any of it work?
{73144}{73215}Can´t tell yet, but you gotta try. You|know what I´m saying? It´s your duty.
{73219}{73328}Ah, yeah, patriot. Sure, sure.|So, tell me more about your problems.
{73332}{73436}And I´ll tell you about mine.|And then we´ll solve them tonight.
{73440}{73516}Not so fast.|You´re still in the penalty box.
{73520}{73605}Oh, right, right, right.
{73609}{73663}Well, thanks|for coming to see me.
{73667}{73728}Hmm. So, is there|a Mrs. Mysterio?
{73732}{73787}- No, but I have a very nice cat.|- Not the same.
{73791}{73848}Well, you don´t know my cat.|It´s very demanding.
{73852}{73939}- It? You don´t know|if it´s a boy or a girl?|- I respect its privacy.
{74008}{74059}- You happy?|- Kind of.
{74063}{74128}- Really?|- Sort of.
{74132}{74212}- We´ll talk soon?|- Okay.
{74318}{74373}It´s a nice ride.|Nobody buys American anymore, huh?
{74796}{74890}- Hello?|- Marcella, what do you got?|- Hey, that town is hot!
{74894}{74980}I got the stink from an assistant over|at Rothchild´s. We prepped together.
{74984}{75083}- I downloaded everything,|so just call it up.|- I´m on-line.
{75132}{75236}We´ve got Steven Lardner,|a.k.a. Steve.
{75240}{75297}And Kenneth McCullers.|No pseudonym.
{75301}{75365}Steve was a redshirt tailback|from Ohio State.
{75369}{75476}McCullers, All-American wrestler|from Northwestern. M.B.A. from the same.
{75480}{75570}- What are they doing here?|- Well, they´re domestic covert|operatives for the N.S.A...
{75574}{75657}up there as part of a new|"Get Tough on Terror" campaign.
{75661}{75731}They´re looking for an Oswald;|a patsy to take the fall.
{75735}{75835}- Grocer fed them you.|- Grocer set me up.|- Surprised?|- No.
{75839}{75962}Well, they were supposed to catch you|in the act, but I guess they|weren´t quick enough, right?
{75966}{76007}- Who´s the ghoul?|- Whoa.
{76011}{76119}This guy is a badass.|Felix LaPoubelle.
{76123}{76192}An accomplished amateur|with the Basque Nationalists.
{76196}{76260}Few odds jobs|with the Algerian Separatists.
{76263}{76366}Went pro with a stunning debut|aboard an elite Caribbean cruise liner.
{76370}{76427}Oh, that´s where I know him from.|He´s an asshole.
{76431}{76522}Did loan-outs for Likkenbakken.|Enjoys, uh, Native American art...
{76526}{76609}- ballroom dancing, pornography...|- Yeah, yeah, yeah.|What is he here for?
{76613}{76696}It´s part of that Oregon|snafu with that dog, Budro.
{76700}{76789}So, you´re gonna get out of there,|right? I mean, that´s not right, right?|You gotta get out of there, right?
{76793}{76872}- You´re on a flight tonight, right?|- It isn´t done.
{76876}{76953}- This is not good.|- I´ll do it tomorrow. It´s fine.
{76957}{77041}- Sir, I´m beginning to worry|about your safety.|- Look, I have to go.
{77045}{77116}Yeah, we all have to go sometime, sir,|but we can choose when.
{77120}{77164}No one chooses when.
{79252}{79296}Ya can´t come in.
{79300}{79397}Well, I was in the neighborhood,|so I just stopped by.
{79401}{79458}Wanted to say hi.|Can I come in?
{79462}{79570}Ya can come in,|but only for a second.
{79831}{79883}Unbelievable.
{79887}{79933}It´s exactly the same.
{79937}{80005}It´s a shrine.|It´s only temporary.
{80009}{80069}My apartment burned down|on Devil´s Night.
{80073}{80173}Really? So you never|gave me an answer.
{80177}{80249}- I said we´d talk later.|- Well, this is later.
{80253}{80337}See, I figure if we go together|we have a much better chance|of gettin´ out of there alive.
{80341}{80439}You know, we can partner up,|watch for traps, you know. Go tandem.
{80443}{80504}I think it´d be a lot safer|than if we lone-wolfed it.
{80508}{80636}- I have to say I´m curious as to|what ten years has done to you.|- You too.
{80639}{80744}Is, uh... Is that the same bed?
{80748}{80843}- Uh-huh.|- The magic bed.
{80847}{80911}The magic carpet. Wow. Hmm.
{80976}{81049}I´ll tell you what. I´ll give you|an answer if you give me an "airplane".
{81053}{81111}- Okay.|- Cool!
{81147}{81195}- Ready?|- Okay.
{81232}{81338}- Keep your feet low there.|- I remember.|- Oh, it´s been ten years.
{81342}{81397}- Oh!|- Fly! Be free.|- I´m flying!|- Be free.
{81401}{81442}- Emancipation!|- Are you free?
{81446}{81511}- Of course. Okay.|- What if your Dad comes in?
{81515}{81575}You can give him one too. Okay.
{81579}{81648}You can pick me up at 7:00.
{81652}{81731}Put me down.|You can pick me up.
{81853}{81910}Okay, you can go now.
{81914}{82011}You want me to leave right now?|You don´t wanna, you know, maybe watch|CNN, Crossfire, something romantic?
{82015}{82131}- No, "airplane" was quite enough.|- Okay. I´ll go. That´s fine. I´ll go.
{82135}{82181}But this, this night...|tomorrow night... the reunion...
{82185}{82262}is gonna be|an im... important step...
{82266}{82348}in our, you know,|burgeoning relationship.
{82352}{82406}You´re a fucking psycho.
{82410}{82521}Don´t rush to judgment on something|like that until all the facts are in.
{82525}{82601}- I´ll just let myself out.|- Go.
{82605}{82731}And, um, you can, you know, lock|the door behind me because, you know,|there´s a lot of undesirables around.
{82735}{82793}I´ll call you or...|I´ll... I´ll go.
{83036}{83102}Oh, shit, there he is.
{83187}{83290}Man, why don´t we just do his job|so we can do our job|and get the fuck out of here?
{83294}{83400}What do you mean, "do his job"?|What am I, a cold-blooded killer?|I´m not a cold-blooded killer.
{83404}{83482}- Now, wait a minute.|- No, you wait a minute.
{83486}{83572}You wanna kill the good guy, but not be|the bad guy. Doesn´t work like that.
{83576}{83654}You gotta wait until|the bad guy kills the good guy.
{83658}{83712}Then when you kill the bad guy,|you´re the good guy.
{83716}{83855}So... just to clarify...|if we do his job, we´re the bad guys.
{83859}{83954}- And if we do our job,|we´re the good guys.|- Yes.
{83958}{84015}That´s great.
{84074}{84150}Hey, hey.
{84154}{84203}Hi, Mr. Grocer.
{84247}{84313}Oh, he´s brown-bagging it today.
{84520}{84586}Oh, my God.
{84705}{84783}Easy there, chief.
{84787}{84839}I don´t see hollow point wound care|on the menu.
{84843}{84920}Up, up, up.
{84924}{84982}What are you in Detroit for?|The Red Wings need a new goon?
{84986}{85076}Hi, my name is Melanie. Let me|tell you about some of our specials.
{85080}{85161}Today, there´s the Alfalfa On My Mind.|That´s our featured omelette.
{85165}{85221}Or there´s Gatsby´s|West Egg omelette.
{85225}{85316}And if you´re in the mood|for something different, there´s|the I Left My Heart In San Francheezy.
{85320}{85409}- What´ll you have?|- Two poached eggs.|Scrape off the milky white stuff.
{85413}{85486}Hash browns, well done. English muffin|for the bread and a coffee.
{85490}{85552}Whole-grain pancakes|and an egg-white omelette, please.
{85556}{85627}- What would you like in your omelette?|- Nothing in the omelette.|Nothing at all.
{85631}{85706}- Well, that´s not|technically an omelette.|- Well, I don´t want to get into|a semantic argument over it.
{85710}{85798}I just want the protein, all right?
{85802}{85882}Come on there, ice man,|live a little. Let Chef Raoul put in|a little cilantro for your liver.
{85886}{85971}- I don´t want that.|- A little onions for the blood.
{85975}{86077}- What are those?|- Nutrients.
{86081}{86141}Here´s the new stuff, kid.|Durazac-15.
{86145}{86205}Makes Prozac|feel like a decaf latte.
{86209}{86283}- You want a couple? I got jars.|- I don´t do that stuff anymore.
{86287}{86353}No wonder you got the shakes.|And don´t say "do it".
{86357}{86437}Because I don´t "do it". I ingest|it on orders from my neurophysiologist.
{86441}{86534}It´s legal. In five years,|we´ll be puttin´ it in the water|for the citizens like fluoride.
{86538}{86634}That´s fascinating. Is there anything|else you wanted to talk about?|Because I was gonna have breakfast.
{86638}{86728}I heard about that|little blowup at the Ultimart.|It was a wicked, rippin´ shame.
{86732}{86799}- One of yours?|One of your fraternal brothers?|- No!
{86803}{86861}Hey, listen,|I wanna work with you.
{86865}{86962}That was some indie frog.|Some Basque whacker from the Pyrenees.
{86966}{87024}You sure Oregon|doesn´t ring a bell?
{87028}{87111}Pacific Northwest,|a couple of months ago?
{87115}{87179}Something about you doin´|some wonder dog named Cujo?
{87182}{87295}- Ohh. Budro. Yes, Budro. Jesus Christ.|- He knows the dog.
{87299}{87371}- Yeah, I was out there trying to|whack these three junk bond fuckos...|- Yeah?
{87375}{87454}and these idiots were flushing game|with sticks of dynamite.
{87458}{87543}And the dog that they borrowed,|little Budro, was a retriever. Get it?
{87547}{87654}Budro was never a target. Budro was|acting on instinct. I would never hurt|an animal. And I´m offended at the acc...
{87658}{87742}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,|Chatty Kathy. Clip your string.|l don´t need to know.
{87746}{87866}But just for the record, here´s|what I heard. The marks borrowed|your client´s prized hunting pup.
{87870}{87948}So bad luck for Budro|and bad luck for Blank.
{87952}{88036}Poodle pumper. Hound hitter.|Pooch puncher.
{88040}{88100}Let´s not talk|about Budro, huh?
{88104}{88164}What about those two guys|in the Caprice Classic outside?
{88168}{88238}- The word is you turned two|governments on me, you turncoat.|- Me?
{88242}{88289}- You.|- Go "G"?|- Yes.|- On you?
{88293}{88361}- Yes.|- Never.
{88365}{88423}Listen, why don´t we get|our relationship straight|for a minute, all right?
{88427}{88492}I didn´t get into this business|to have any relationships!
{88496}{88565}And I don´t wanna join|your goddamned union, all right?
{88569}{88642}Loner. Lone gunman. Get it?|That´s the whole point.
{88646}{88703}I like the lifestyle, the image.|Look at the way I dress.
{88707}{88787}Why don´t you become a cop or something?|You can have coffee in the morning|with friends.
{88791}{88914}Look, this is a one-on-one business.|The minute you start relationships,|bad things start happening.
{88918}{89001}If it´ll make you feel any better,|l think this is my last job.
{89005}{89072}- Oh, I believe that.|- So what do you say...|What do you say we put away our guns...
{89076}{89157}and forget the whole goddamn thing|and have some breakfast, all right?
{89224}{89332}No scabs. From now on, all arrangements,|all contracts, all engagements|are regulated. You got it?
{89336}{89424}- Ooh, meet the new boss.|- Yes.|- No deal.
{89428}{89485}Okay. But we´re not gonna let|you do your little job here.
{89489}{89543}- No?|- No, because we´re gonna do it for you.
{89547}{89612}- Is that right?|- And after we do your job,|we´re gonna do another little job.
{89616}{89680}- Tell me about it.|- Like, I´m gonna put a bullet hole|in your fuckin´ forehead...
{89683}{89751}- and I´m gonna fuck the brain hole!|- Nice talk, sugar mouth.
{89793}{89871}- Hi.|- You had the nada omelet?

{91700}{91803}Oatman, listen, don´t hang up.|All right, I didn´t kill anyone.
{91807}{91869}Uh, except some guy tried to kill me,|so if I see that guy again|I´m definitely gonna kill him.
{91873}{91932}But I´m not gonna kill anyone else,|you know, except maybe the guy I was|sent here to kill. I don´t know.
{91936}{91998}But anyway, I saw Debi.|I´m on my way to the reunion with Debi.

{107256}{107385}The people on the edge of the light
{107389}{107502}And love dares you|to change our way
{107506}{107609}Of caring about ourselves

{109236}{109292}It´s me, Martin.|From high school.
{109359}{109438}I´m drawing a complete blank.
{109544}{109627}- Hate to see it.|- I hate that.
{109755}{109803}Bobby, get away from me.
{109915}{109994}Do you know I have recurring dreams|about you? Did I tell you that?
{109998}{110094}Like, five nights a week for,|like, six years. Did I tell you that?
{110098}{110200}You know,|yesterday on the radio...
{110204}{110281}- When you publicly humiliated me?|- Yeah, well, you know,|no less than you deserve.
{110327}{110445}I think... I think I was overly harsh|when I said that you were broken.
{110449}{110526}H... Really? How so?
{110530}{110610}- I don´t think you´re broken.|- No?
{110614}{110703}I think you´re mildly sprained.
{110753}{110815}- Nothing that can´t be mended.|- Wow.
{110819}{110875}Think...|I think that´s a compliment.
{110931}{110987}Yeah.
{111072}{111121}What was I gonna say?
{111125}{111224}That you´re glad you came back|and you´re real happy to see me.
{111228}{111323}Yeah. I am. I definitely am.
{111364}{111433}Sorry if I fucked up your life.
{111437}{111493}It´s not over yet.
{111649}{111720}- Do you have a wife in Arkansas?|- No.
{111754}{111825}- Do you want to dance?|- Sure.
{111863}{111916}Okay.
{111920}{111984}When people keep repeating
{111988}{112071}That you´ll never fall in love
{112075}{112143}When everybody keeps retreating
{112147}{112220}But you can´t seem to get enough
{112224}{112300}Let my love open the door
{112304}{112368}Let my love open the door
{112371}{112445}To your heart
{112449}{112490}To your heart
{113450}{113563}- Oh. The nurse´s office.|- Health station.
{113567}{113653}I don´t feel well, and neither do you.
{113863}{113969}You know, there´s this big black cloud|that´s following you around...
{113973}{114043}that you´re gonna have to come out|from under before it even can...
{114047}{114153}That´s just like you.|A little rain follows me to town,|and you just fall to pieces.
{114370}{114469}God, it´s been so long,|I´ve forgotten who gets tied up.
{114473}{114534}- Wait.|- What?|- No, stop.
{114538}{114602}Stop?|What´s wrong? Too fast?
{114606}{114694}- I´m sorry.|- Too fast?|- No, i... Yeah.
{114698}{114777}Something... Something is missing.
{114781}{114865}- Something...|- What?
{114869}{114914}Oh, I know.
{114951}{115002}Welcome home.
{115088}{115144}I missed you.
{115378}{115494}Oh. Welcome back, Pointer.|It´s Arlene Oslott-Joseph.
{115498}{115603}- And who might you be?|- It is I, Sidney Feldman.
{115607}{115655}Oh. Been overseas?
{115728}{115803}My. You have changed.
{115888}{115954}Save a dance for me, now.
{116255}{116324}I think the best thing for both of us|would be to go away someplace quiet|for a few weeks...
{116328}{116374}and work this whole thing out.
{116378}{116415}Fine.
{116482}{116596}- Where are you going?|- Well, you know, there´s a few people|I should say good-bye to.
{116629}{116731}I´m gonna go cruise by my old locker,|and then I´ll meet you in front.
{116735}{116785}I´ll find you.
{117059}{117131}- Hi, Bob.|- Debi Newberry, huh?
{117135}{117238}- You gonna hit that shit again?|- Fine, Bob. How are you?
{117242}{117342}Real smart. Come on.
{117346}{117397}Let´s see how smart you are|with my foot up your ass!
{117401}{117519}Do you really believe that there´s|some stored-up conflict...
{117523}{117580}that exists between us?
{117584}{117697}There is no "us".|"We" don´t exist.
{117701}{117795}So, who do you want to hit, man?|It´s not me.
{117853}{117906}Now, what do you want to do here, man?
{118022}{118103}- I don´t know what that is.|- These are my words.
{118107}{118171}It´s a poem?|See, that´s the prob...
{118175}{118266}Express yourself, Bob.|Go for it.
{118270}{118326}"When I feel quiet...
{118373}{118486}when I feel blue..."
{118490}{118584}You know, I think that is terrific,|what you have right there.
{118588}{118659}Really. I liked it a lot.|I wouldn´t sell the... I wouldn´t sell|the dealership or anything...
{118663}{118718}but I´m telling you, it´s intense.
{118722}{118792}- There´s more.|- Okay. W-W-Why don´t you|just skip to the end.
{118796}{118852}To the... the very end.
{118907}{118960}"For a while".
{118964}{119032}That´s good, man.
{119036}{119087}- "For a while".|- That´s excellent.
{119091}{119172}- You wanna do some blow?|- No, I don´t.
{119243}{119293}- There you go.|- I missed you.
{119297}{119381}Okay, I missed you too.
{119385}{119442}Okay.

{126444}{126589}Every story has to be|about something, I suppose
{126593}{126654}This one says I lose my head

{128164}{128243}I can feel those doors go thump
{128247}{128337}- Take care of yourself, Ken.|Thank you for the pen.|- Oh. Yeah. Sure.
{128341}{128456}...latest series of threats...|on the WNA... I am confident...
{128460}{128524}- I didn´t touch no one!|- Chihuahua city!

{128671}{128792}Plus, we´ll have more information...|And I´m working... Burning building...
{128796}{128850}Right decision... Are exploding...
{128854}{128930}Hello, This is Dr. Oatman.|I am not available right now.
{128934}{129040}But if you´d like to leave a message|I will get back to you shortly.
{129044}{129093}Dr. Oatman, it´s Martin Blank.
{129097}{129174}Listen, I just wanted to tell you that|I don´t wanna work with you anymore.|Things are going really well here.
{129178}{129275}They´re going a lot better than expected|and I just don´t really feel like|you´re helpful in any way...
{129279}{129343}and I don´t think|you´re serious about the therapy and...
{129347}{129457}So, I want you to take a deep breath|and realize...
{129461}{129532}that this is "me" firing "you".
{130461}{130522}- He was gonna kill you, right?|- Yes.
{130574}{130638}- It wasn´t the other way around?|- No. No.
{130641}{130727}- That wasn´t my intention.|- Is it something you´ve done?
{130765}{130853}It´s something I do.|Professionally.
{130857}{130913}For about five years now.
{130953}{131046}You were joking. People joke about|the horrible things that they don´t do.
{131050}{131105}They don´t do them.|It´s absurd.
{131109}{131182}When I left I joined the army,|and when I took the service exam...
{131186}{131301}my psych profile fit a certain...|moral flexibility would be|the only way to describe it.
{131305}{131444}I was loaned out to a ClA-sponsored|program and we sort of found each other.|That´s the way it works.
{131448}{131521}- So you... you´re a government spook?|- Yes. I mean, no.
{131525}{131618}I was before, but I´m not now.|Uh, but that´s all irrelevant now.
{131622}{131687}The idea of governments, nations is|public relations theory at this point.
{131691}{131748}Don´t. I don´t wanna hear|about the theories.|I wanna hear about the dead people.
{131752}{131850}Explain the dead people.|Who do you kill?
{131854}{131908}Well, that´s very complicated,|but...
{131912}{131985}-Why do you kill people?|-in the beginning, you know, it matters,|of course, that you have something...
{131989}{132050}to hang on to, you know,|a specific ideology to defend.
{132054}{132118}Right? I mean,|"taming unchecked aggression,"|that was my personal favorite.
{132122}{132189}Other guys like "Live free or die,"|but, you know, you get the idea.
{132193}{132254}But that´s all bullshit, and I know|that now. That´s all bullshit.
{132258}{132320}You do it because you were trained to|do it, you were encouraged to do it...
{132324}{132405}and ultimately, you know, you...
{132409}{132459}get to like it.
{132505}{132600}I know that sounds bad.
{132604}{132694}- You´re a psychopath.|- No, no, no. A psychopath|kills for no reason.
{132698}{132764}I kill for money. It´s a job...|That didn´t sound right.
{132768}{132827}Uh, let me see if I can put it|another way.
{132831}{132932}If I show up at your door, chances are|you did something to bring me there.
{132936}{132983}I mean, everybody´s doing it.|It´s like the natural order.
{132987}{133119}I mean, the states do it. Sometimes|there´s due process, and sometimes|pilots carpet-bomb cities, you know.
{133123}{133204}Riot cops shoot demonstrators.|That´s indiscriminate. I don´t do that.
{133208}{133265}You should read the files|on some of these fuckers.
{133269}{133339}I mean, it reads like a demon´s resumé.
{133376}{133420}Look, I bottomed out here.
{133424}{133483}I´ve lost my taste for it completely.
{133487}{133577}That´s why I came back.|I wanted to see you, you know. I wanted|to start over, leave that behind.
{133581}{133705}Oh, so I´m part of... I´m part of|your romantic new beginning.
{133709}{133778}Right?
{133782}{133853}How come you never learned|that it was wrong...
{133857}{133951}that there are certain things|you do not do... you do not do|in a civilized society.
{133955}{133997}- What civilizations|are we talking about?|- Oh, shut up.
{134001}{134059}- I mean, history...|- Shut up!
{134110}{134200}Everything about you is a lie.
{134204}{134277}Everything.
{134281}{134364}Stay away from me.
{134428}{134478}Debi, don´t go!
{134482}{134602}You don´t get to have me.|Don´t you get it?
{134677}{134769}- You´re overreacting.|- Yeah! Yeah!
{135452}{135512}Whoo!
{135516}{135561}- Hello.|- Are we out of business yet?
{135565}{135636}- I´m taking down the office now.|- Good.
{135640}{135710}- I´ll put things right,|and then I´ll find you.|- Why?
{135714}{135760}It´s not like that, Marcella.
{135764}{135828}Look under your desk.|I left a little something for you.
{135831}{135887}All the way under.
{136012}{136091}- You shouldn´t have.|- That´s profit sharing. You deserve it.
{136095}{136153}All right!
{136280}{136366}You´re a handsome devil.|What´s your name?
{136926}{136997}Dumb fuckin´ luck.
{137066}{137131}lgnacio
{137135}{137213}Lay dyin´ in the sand
{137267}{137336}- A single red rose|- Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
{137340}{137436}Clutched in her dyin´ hand
{137440}{137498}- Here he comes.|- And I don´t wanna watch
{137538}{137605}To see them all die
{137656}{137772}And the big black birds|gathered in the sky
{137850}{137941}- What the hell is the matter with you?|- Get in the car now.|Keep your head down.
{137945}{138005}Shit. Blank.
{138009}{138076}Go! Go, Chano, go!
{138223}{138315}You must have done some naughty shit|there, Bart, ´cause there´s|a contract out on your life.
{138319}{138402}Believe me. I was hired to kill you,|but I´m not gonna do it.
{138406}{138483}It´s either because|I´m in love with your daughter,|or I have a newfound respect for life.
{138487}{138605}That punk is either|in love with that guy´s daughter,|or he has a newfound respect for life.
{138609}{138682}- My whole life!|- Hopefully not.
{138769}{138822}Durazac?
{138999}{139086}Design division wants me dead|over a leaky sunroof?|You wanna kill me because of that?
{139090}{139186}It´s not me! Why does everybody|think it´s personal? Get in here.
{139190}{139288}Dad? What´s going on?|What is he doing here?
{139292}{139410}They´re... They´re... They´re trying...|They´re trying to kill me.|My... My testimony. Martin saved my life.
{139414}{139494}I was sitting there alone on prom night|in that goddamned rented tuxedo...
{139498}{139579}and the whole night flashed before|my eyes, and I realized finally...
{139583}{139689}and for the first time|that I wanted to kill somebody.
{139693}{139781}So I figured since|I loved you so much it´d be a good idea|if I didn´t see you any more.
{139785}{139862}They´re right behind us.|So, I was in the Gulf last year.|I was doing this thing.
{139866}{139987}Anyway, I came up over this dune|and I saw the ocean, and it was on fire.
{139991}{140071}I mean, the whole thing.|It was beautiful. And I just sat down|and I watched it burn.
{140075}{140153}And I got the sneaking, dark suspicion|that maybe there was meaning to life.
{140157}{140211}You know, a point, like an organic|connection between all living things.
{140215}{140281}I don´t know, God, Yahweh, a higher|power, whatever you want to call it.
{140331}{140383}Don´t move.
{141296}{141361}Debi, I´m in love with you...
{141365}{141423}and I know we can make|this relationship work.
{141427}{141512}Come on, come on, come on, come on.|Wait, wait!
{141516}{141587}- I was always afraid|to commit to a relationship.|- What?
{141591}{141667}But now I´m ready to make it happen.|We need to go upstairs now.
{141671}{141813}It´s not easy for me. I always control|my emotions, my feelings, you know,|and I just need time to change.
{142182}{142242}Go in there. Lock the door.
{142280}{142349}Yeah, I wasn´t exactly raised|in a loving environment.
{142353}{142420}It´s not an excuse, it´s a reason.|You know, my soul is empty.
{142424}{142467}- I´ll be comin´ around the mountain|when I come|- It´s up to me to fill it.
{142471}{142536}I´ll be comin´ around the mountain|when I come
{142540}{142593}I´ll be blowin´ your fuckin´ head off|I´ll be blowin´ your fuckin´ head off
{142597}{142664}I´ll be whackin´ your fuckin´ mind out|when I come
{142668}{142715}Popcorn!
{142840}{142915}"See, and I saw a beast|rise up out of the sea...
{142919}{143019}having seven heads and ten horns.
{143023}{143100}And they worshipped the beast saying,|´Who is like the beast?
{143104}{143157}Who is able to make war with him?"
{143161}{143235}- It´s okay. It´s Martin.|- Not you, Pinky!
{143239}{143304}I know what I do isn´t,|you know, moral, per se...
