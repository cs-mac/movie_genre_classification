1
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:36,906
<i>All aboard!</i>

2
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,052
All right, let's go.

3
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,032
That's my main man Pierce
coming back from the war!

4
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:17,035
Thank you! Thank you, man.

5
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,938
Hey, what's happening, Jack?

6
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,490
Private party.

7
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,265
Pick another card.

8
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,807
There you go!

9
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,047
Oh, I see what you're saying.

10
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,818
There we go!

11
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:01,562
Damn it! Give me that shit.

12
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,333
Party's over!

13
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,803
Here we go. Move on out.

14
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:08,608
Move on out.
Step out! Step out!

15
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,213
Everybody out! Out!

16
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,684
Let's go!

17
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,554
I know you can hear me.
Get the fuck up and go!

18
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:15,655
I don't care what you do

19
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,660
during the week. Get out!

20
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:21,200
Party's over!
Let's get it moving!

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,837
You know how this works!

22
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:23,507
Says who?

23
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,144
I'm sorry?

24
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,682
Man, take a hike!

25
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:31,019
Come in here
smelling like pig juice!

26
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,800
Excuse me, miss.
Thank you so much.

27
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,135
What'd you say?

28
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:39,738
I ain't said anybody
talking... Hey, man!

29
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,551
Come on, man! Let me go, man!
Let me go!

30
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,361
Hold on a second.

31
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:56,236
Get the fuck out!
Get out! Get out!

32
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,006
How many times
you want me to say it?

33
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:58,910
You're moving slow!

34
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:02,348
Come on, man!

35
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,987
Motherfuckers, man!

36
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,991
Look, Frank, man.
The owner split.

37
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,394
Man, I'm sorry,
but you got a room

38
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,031
full of open warrants
in there. All right?

39
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,739
Just make sure you search
the women, you lazy bastard.

40
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,578
All right. Watch your eyes.

41
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:17,846
Oh, shit!

42
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,854
You know
that's not right, brother!

43
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:24,993
No, no, no!

44
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,505
We gotta go
through the front.

45
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,076
What? You wanna take these
guys out in public, Sarge?

46
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,047
We have no fucking option.

47
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,048
Go tell them. Run.

48
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,384
All right.

49
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,388
You dirty pig!

50
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,627
Get the fuck out of here.

51
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:43,764
Anybody else?

52
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:46,303
Why're we not moving?
You wanna go next?

53
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:46,838
Out, out, out!

54
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,408
All right,
party's over, folks. Let's go!

55
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:49,845
You heard him.
Time to move out!

56
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:52,749
Put your drinks down
and step out the door.

57
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,052
I do not understand,

58
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,287
I thought I was very clear!

59
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:56,690
Let's go! Come on!

60
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,193
Out of here! Let's go!
Come on!

61
00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:59,228
Congratulations.

62
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:00,532
Get the fuck out!

63
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:01,701
How many times
I gotta say "Move out"?

64
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,903
Let's go!

65
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,542
I know your black asses
is faster than that.

66
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,611
Go!

67
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,583
Let's move! Come on!
Move! Let's go!

68
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,056
On your feet!
Move it! Let's go!

69
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,762
We're taking them out front.

70
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,331
Out the front door!
Let's go! Now!

71
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,701
Taking them out the front.

72
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,370
Shit!

73
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,807
Out the front!

74
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:25,180
Guys, sir, both sides.

75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,120
Up against
the wall. Against the wall.

76
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,024
Let's move it. Come on.

77
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:31,262
Let's go!

78
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,404
Here we go. Squad's here.

79
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,010
If they're not resisting,
don't push them.

80
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,722
Put it right there.

81
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,928
Right here against the wall.

82
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,165
Welcome home!

83
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,301
Thank you, sir.

84
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,405
Get out the way.
Get out the way!

85
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,176
Hands where we can see them.

86
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:57,813
We had to use the front door.

87
00:05:57,813 --> 00:06:00,816
Shit!

88
00:05:57,813 --> 00:06:00,619
Make it a public display.

89
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,622
I almost feel bad for them.

90
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,624
We gotta get out of here.

91
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:03,925
Quickly.

92
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,164
Let's go! Get them in!

93
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,370
All right! Start
loading them up! Let's go!

94
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,511
Okay, let's go!

95
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:15,883
Look at this shit!

96
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,455
Let's hurry!
Get it out of here!

97
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:20,629
Get it out! Let's go!

98
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,637
Make sure we get
those guys at the back.

99
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,975
What are you doing down here
all the time?

100
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,120
We gotta get this moving!

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,289
Stop messing with us.

102
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:37,558
These people
didn't do a thing.

103
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,795
Where's the other one?

104
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,699
It should be here any minute.

105
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:40,967
What did they do?

106
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,240
Please calm down!
Everything's fine.

107
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,517
Finally!

108
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,025
Over here.

109
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,329
This is our neighborhood
and here y'all come.

110
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,599
That's not necessary.

111
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,168
Open the door! Get them in!

112
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,586
Arrests for
a private gathering?

113
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,021
That's police overreach!

114
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,326
You got no liquor license
on this place.

115
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:13,866
Get the fuck out of my face.

116
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,870
Let's just keep it calm.

117
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,973
Are you fucking kidding me?

118
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:23,220
Come on! Get in
the damn van! Step in there!

119
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:28,628
Move, let's go!

120
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,632
Let's get them moving,
gentlemen!

121
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:34,773
Let's go!
Get them in the wagon!

122
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:37,879
Hey, Dave! Told you you'd
get busted, you alcoholic!

123
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,481
Oh, the night's not over!

124
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,524
Go home!
Go home!

125
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:43,992
Go home!

126
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,396
You go home!

127
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,107
Get them in.

128
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,410
Last one.

129
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:55,715
Get them in!

130
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,417
You punk-ass
motherfuckers!

131
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,562
Let's go, get in!

132
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,533
Don't touch me!

133
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,202
Let's go! In!

134
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:07,605
I'm moving!

135
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,408
Get in! Let's go!

136
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,356
Get in the car! Let's go!

137
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:45,147
Check this, motherfuckers!

138
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,259
Bub, can't even
ride that bike!

139
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,295
You know good and well

140
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,566
you don't know
how to ride no bike.

141
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,439
Do it, man! Throw it!

142
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,677
Catch this!

143
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,116
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

144
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,321
It's show time now!

145
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,373
<i>Destroyers striking</i>

146
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:32,643
<i> from as far as three miles</i>

147
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,947
<i> away from this
west side ghetto,</i>

148
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:37,485
<i> where it all began
early this morning</i>

149
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,024
<i> with a police raid on an
after-hours drinking parlor.</i>

150
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:42,495
<i> There have been
some reports of gunfire.</i>

151
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,800
<i> Police are under orders
not to fire.</i>

152
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,806
<i> More than 200 looters
have been arrested so far.</i>

153
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,278
<i> Police officials say they
do not have enough men</i>

154
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:51,714
<i> to worry much
about the looters.</i>

155
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,687
<i> They are there
to protect the firemen.</i>

156
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,792
<i> But that is
why you elected me.</i>

157
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:01,567
<i> To bring about change.</i>

158
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,439
<i> But during this time,</i>

159
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:07,579
<i> it's important that
we all settle down.</i>

160
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:11,083
Settle yourself!

161
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:11,419
<i>I know you're angry.</i>

162
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,089
<i> I'm angry, too.</i>

163
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,560
<i> This city has problems,</i>

164
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,229
<i> especially with the policemen.</i>

165
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,364
<i> We have problems.</i>

00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,390
Nah! Bring Stokely Carmichael

This is what I need you to do!</i>

173

You gotta roll it back.

I can't be singing
when I'm supposed to

490
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,794
be out there
swinging, brother.

491
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,697
Hey, look. We're not
too far from the Algiers.

492
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:58,705
Let's just go there
till all this blows over.

493
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,113
We gotta
get off this bus!

494
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:06,720
Everybody out! Let's go, now!

495
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,101
Come on, man!

496
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,437
Sit the fuck down!

497
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,876
I didn't do anything!

498
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,411
I'm sorry,
I've been working

499
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,182
straight shifts
since the riots started.

500
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,453
Yeah, that guy you shot at
didn't make it home.

501
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,694
Ambulance found him
bleeding out under a car.

502
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:32,768
Are we sure
it's the same guy?

503
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,773
He's the only
Virginia Park shooting today.

504
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,743
You carry a shotgun,
he had shotgun wounds.

505
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:37,748
You wanna play ballistics?

506
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:43,957
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

507
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:44,861
That's it?

508
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:46,697
What else?

509
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,135
You shot him in the back.

510
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,374
Right. He was...

511
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:53,644
He was running away from me.

512
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,881
Where else do you
want me to shoot?

513
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:59,056
My point was him being
no threat to you.

514
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:03,462
In hindsight,
but I'm thinking,

515
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:04,799
why is he running
away from me,

516
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,268
if all he did was
steal some groceries?

517
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,441
What if he killed somebody
in that grocery store?

518
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,579
He's avoiding the police.
What do you assume from that?

519
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,149
You don't assume.

520
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,886
If he had a weapon in his
hand, that's another story.

521
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:17,891
We don't shoot for robberies.

522
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:22,235
Detective, you know it's
a war zone out there, right?

523
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,676
Yeah. 10th had to shut down.

524
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:28,714
They're destroying the city.

525
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:33,155
We're facilitating that
with the message we send,

526
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:35,125
which is that
it's okay, go ahead,

527
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,395
burn down your houses,

528
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,466
rob a store.

529
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,539
It's total chaos. And...

530
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,444
Where does that lead us
long term, Detective?

531
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:46,183
All right, kid. Thank you.

532
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,458
Anytime.

533
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,762
I'm recommending
murder charges.

534
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:55,970
You go back to work,
wait to hear from the DA.

535
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,042
Yes, sir.

536
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,647
And kid...

537
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:04,618
Calm down out there.

538
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,525
Thank you, Detective.

539
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,402
All right?

540
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:14,738
Forget it.

541
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,740
Are you in trouble?

542
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:15,807
I'm fine, so forget it.

543
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,381
He's doing his job,
same as you and me.

544
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:22,453
Stand up. Let's go.
On your feet.

545
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,012
Go home, now! All you
people, off the streets.

546
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:37,350
Yo, we need to split up, man.

547
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,620
I mean, the police

548
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:38,788
are going crazy
out here right now.

549
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,024
Five brothers together,

550
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:42,294
you know they
gonna say we a gang.

551
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,164
Come on, man,
we're not splitting up.

552
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:45,366
Shit!

553
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,036
Where do you think
you're going?

554
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,038
We're going home, man.

555
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,207
Get off the street!

556
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,511
Hands on the wall!

557
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,513
Keep them up!

558
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,447
Okay!

559
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:53,349
Oh, shit!

560
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:58,593
Keep moving!

561
00:29:58,593 --> 00:29:59,695
What the hell
you talking about?

562
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:01,098
Look at this mess, man!

563
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,168
Hey, come here! You! Stop!
It's after curfew!

564
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,339
<i>This is the Detroit Police.
There is a curfew.</i>

565
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,509
We're going home!

566
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:07,877
<i>Assalamu alaikum,
my brother!</i>

567
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,213
<i>Disperse!</i>

568
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:09,850
<i> Leave using the streets
behind you.</i>

569
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,888
<i> This direction!</i>

570
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,560
This is our street!

571
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,664
<i>Go back to your homes!</i>

572
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:19,666
<i> Go back to your homes!</i>

573
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,012
<i>Disperse</i>

574
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:26,721
<i> or you will be arrested.</i>

575
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,263
Hello, hello.

576
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,364
Hello.

577
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:53,937
How you doing?
Just need to get a room.

578
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,673
Y'all at the
wrong hotel, though.

579
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:58,245
Ritz down the street.

580
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:00,483
Yeah, well, the Ritz ain't got
you behind the counter, so...

581
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,355
Look, all I got
is a room in the annex

582
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:03,923
out back down
through the breezeway.

583
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:07,363
$11 a night,
you pay in advance.

584
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:07,934
That's cool.

585
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,882
A8, A8.

586
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:14,165
<i> Voila!</i>

587
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,237
What you expect for 11 bucks?

588
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,325
Hey!

589
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:29,828
<i>With the exception
of a few isolated snipers...</i>

590
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:31,866
You know
what fucking time it is, boy?

591
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,035
Let me have
a little fun with you.

592
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,605
Come on, man!

593
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,607
What time is it?

594
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,040
I ain't got no watch.

595
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,644
How am I supposed to know
what time it is?

596
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,414
It's past curfew
and you know it, Goddamn it!

597
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:40,717
You gonna shoot me
because I don't have a watch?

598
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:42,352
Get the fuck off my street!

599
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:43,353
What you gonna do? Shoot me?

600
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:43,589
Get off my street!

601
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:44,659
Do it! Go ahead.

602
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,760
I will kill you
right the fuck now.

603
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,095
So sorry!

604
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,298
I'm guarding
that grocery store

605
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:49,668
right there. I'm guarding it.

606
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,774
This my nephew.
I'm so sorry, I apologize.

607
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:54,011
I'm gonna take him away.
Come on.

608
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:56,414
I ain't your nephew,
motherfucker!

609
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:59,353
Just get across the street.
Calm down.

610
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:02,356
They let you out, Uncle Tom?

611
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,993
Just get across the street.

612
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:03,997
Keep on walking.
Don't look back.

613
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:06,937
Keep on moving.

614
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:09,407
Dumb jacky giant,

615
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:12,312
I'll beat your head
to the white meat.

616
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:14,216
You won't kick my ass.

617
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:18,091
I'm a black belt in karate,
I'll whoop that ass.

618
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,730
Besides,
even if you did win,

619
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,401
those ten guys over there
would be on you

620
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,974
and behind them is 10,000.

621
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,280
Now, you smart. Go home.

622
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:39,703
So you the cool brother, huh?

623
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,877
Dismukes.

624
00:33:44,878 --> 00:33:46,851
Okay, Tom.

625
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,690
<i>This is the Detroit Police.</i>

626
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,926
<i> There is a curfew.</i>

627
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,764
<i> You cannot stay on the street.</i>

628
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:57,369
What the hell was that?

629
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,840
You checked
the windows and doors?

630
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,843
I checked them already.

631
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,278
Check it again.

632
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:03,348
I don't even wanna see
graffiti back there.

633
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:08,727
Hello.

634
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:12,066
Everything is fine.
No trouble here.

635
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:16,177
I'll sleep when they stop
rioting. Good night, sir.

636
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,594
Hey, hey.
Hey. Look at this.

637
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:33,943
Miller, with me.
Ready, Title 32? Let's do it!

638
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:35,345
You got it!

639
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:37,216
You know what?

640
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:39,587
I'm gonna go talk
to those white guys.

641
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:41,792
I'm gonna stay here,
if that's okay.

642
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,794
I'm gonna make sure

643
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,531
they don't
start shooting at us.

644
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:46,969
All right, boys.

645
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,508
Relax here.

646
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,046
Hey, you sure
you want them white boys

647
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,048
to know where we are?

648
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,016
I'll be right back.

649
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:07,209
Jefferson, Wood, head
in there and take the roof.

650
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,313
We're on it.

651
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,085
Hey, fellas.

652
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,923
Melvin Dismukes.

653
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,225
I'm with United Security,

654
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:17,296
I'm guarding that grocery
store across the street.

655
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,297
I come bearing gifts.

656
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,132
Oh.

657
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,437
Thank you.

658
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:22,677
Isn't this nice, boys?

659
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:27,784
All things considered,

660
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:29,187
this is pretty good.

661
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:32,562
Thank you. I don't have
my usual appliances.

662
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,100
You got any sugar?

663
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,974
Oh, don't push it, man.

664
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:42,948
It's good
to have some quiet.

665
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:45,219
We were at Black Bottom
earlier today.

666
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:47,190
We actually took sniper fire.

667
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,929
Had one, right by here.

668
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,400
Ain't no snipers here, man.
Just you and me

669
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,106
and the people
partying in that motel.

670
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,377
How long do you think
this is gonna last?

671
00:35:57,377 --> 00:36:02,988
Yeah, how long till these
negros, people, quit?

672
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:04,858
What do you think?

673
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:07,531
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

674
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,001
Is Morris home? It's Larry.

675
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:13,308
I can't find
those guys anywhere.

676
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:15,947
No, no, no. No, he's fine.

677
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:17,250
Just when you see that cat,

678
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,853
tell him to come down
to the Algiers.

679
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,557
We're rehearsing.

680
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:21,660
Bye.

681
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,567
No luck?

682
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:28,108
His mama don't even know
where he is.

683
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,818
He's probably all right.

I've had that freedom,

No, you haven't.

00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,278
a private conversation
here, would I?

755

when you meet someone new,

816
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:08,485
you're supposed
to say "Hi, hello!"

"How are you?"

818
00:42:11,524 --> 00:42:13,297
It makes them
feel comfortable.

819
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,971
Nice duds, man.

820
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,710
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

821
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,279
We were performing earlier.

822
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,416
Watch out.

823
00:42:25,953 --> 00:42:27,955
Total bull.

824
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,094
This guy. Okay.

825
00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:32,432
Food is served
right there.

826
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:34,971
Yeah, all right, man.

827
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,973
Hey, Julie,

828
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:39,179
the air conditioning's
real nice over here.

829
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,381
Real nice, huh?

830
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,185
Mmm-hmm.
The bed's comfortable, too.

831
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:07,868
Yeah, that's nice.

832
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:07,471
Yeah?

833
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,878
Maybe roll up
one of these joints.

834
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,815
Aubrey, man,
turn that radio up.

835
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:49,388
Come on, fellas, please.

836
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:56,467
Can we please let Trane speak?

837
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,717
What the hell?

838
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:12,233
That's beautiful.

839
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,305
So sad that he died.

840
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:17,109
He was young, right?

841
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:18,111
He was 40.

842
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:20,415
But he used his years.

843
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:21,853
Let me tell you,
that man lived.

844
00:44:22,854 --> 00:44:23,691
Unfortunately, it was heroin.

845
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,698
Now, we know Trane
did not overdose.

846
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,403
Don't put a rumor
on that, man.

847
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:33,575
I didn't say Trane overdosed.

848
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:36,081
But John Coltrane was a junkie
for years.

849
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,718
Love Supreme Trane
was high on dope.

850
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,322
I'm not saying
that's taking anything away

851
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:41,558
from the man
as a spiritual example.

852
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:43,028
He's one of my many saints.

853
00:44:43,028 --> 00:44:44,866
But heroin
is what killed his liver.

854
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,337
I heard the FBI poisoned him.

855
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,975
FBI. You wanna know
how I know?

856
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:52,479
John Coltrane's wife
is a Detroit musician,

857
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:53,883
same set as me.

858
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:56,088
Oh, so now you a trained
expert on Coltrane?

859
00:44:59,326 --> 00:45:01,497
<i>Continuing coverage tonight</i>

860
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,201
<i> of the rioting
here in Detroit.</i>

861
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,642
<i> The National Guard
has been called in</i>

862
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:08,211
<i> and more than 3,200 people</i>

863
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:10,783

864
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,121
<i> Updates will continue
throughout our broadcast...</i>

865
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:15,160
Why is everything
always so violent?

866
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:19,835
You ask your people that?

867
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:22,306
Try a little revolution
with the English,

868
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:25,078
all that "liberty or death"?

869
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:27,717
That ain't
so non-violent at all.

870
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:29,420
Man, she from Ohio.

871
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,923
I highly doubt she understands

872
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:32,927
your logic
about liberty and death.

873
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,269
Well, let's put it
in layman's terms.

874
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:38,206
Slide over, stripes.

875
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,978
You see,

876
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:43,980
you white, ain't you?

877
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:45,085
Brother.

878
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:46,322
You white, right?

879
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:48,726
See, y'all don't
have to deal with

880
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,128
the police nearly
as much as we do.

881
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:51,965
Unless, of course,
you're some

882
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,403
Uncle Tom handkerchief head,
you know?

883
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,307
It's like... When you're
black, it's almost like

884
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:58,847
having a gun pointing
right at your face.

885
00:45:59,848 --> 00:46:01,486
You understand that?

886
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,789
It's like this.

887
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,429
Hey, boy!
Get your hands off my plate.

888
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,903
Put the hot dog...
Step away from the mustard!

889
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:14,911
Put your hands down!
Don't... You nervous?

890
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,913
You're making me nervous!

891
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:17,182
You got a gun on me.

892
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:19,486
This like police brutality
or something, man.

893
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:22,526
Oh. Oh... So you gonna tell me
how to do my job now?

894
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:23,729
I'm not...

895
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:25,131
So now you're
the police officer

896
00:46:25,131 --> 00:46:25,800
that tells me how to do my job
on my street?

897
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:28,605
What you doing
on my street, nigger?

898
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:32,045
See, that's the way they like
to express themselves.

899
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:34,083
You know, "My street,
my house, my car."

900
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:34,851
That way they can take
everything from you.

901
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:36,853
Larry.

902
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:36,856
So again.

903
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:40,228
What you doing
on my street, boy?

904
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:42,400
Did I do something
wrong, officer?

905
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,007
Did you do something wrong?

906
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:48,879
I ought to blow
your head right off.

907
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:51,283
Get that gun off me, man.

908
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:53,285
Or what, boy?

909
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:53,454
I said, get that gun off...

910
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:56,327
Oh, my God!

911
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:59,000
Oh, my God!
You shot him! Carl!

912
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:01,270
Lee!

913
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,680
He shouldn't
have made a move.

914
00:47:08,685 --> 00:47:09,889
Lee?

915
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:13,595
Hot dog, please!

916
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,603
You're nuts!

917
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,773
What?

918
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,775
Oh, man!

919
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,343
You're nuts!

920
00:47:21,344 --> 00:47:23,314
You're nuts!

921
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:25,786
It was just a starter pistol.
It just starts races.

922
00:47:25,786 --> 00:47:27,056
It don't kill nobody,

923
00:47:27,056 --> 00:47:28,057
it don't hurt nobody.

924
00:47:27,056 --> 00:47:28,792
Crazy!

925
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:31,531
I'm just demonstrating
white power.

926
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:33,034
So am I, honey.

927
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:36,240
Sweetheart, baby,
it was just a joke.

928
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,943
Y'all can go
and get the hell out,

929
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:39,847
you and your partner.

930
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,722
Thought they could
take a joke.

931
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,663
I'm performing.

932
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,270
Sorry, Larry,
they're usually nice guys.

933
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,542
No, come on. Don't let
those fools bother you.

934
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:56,279
Why don't we all go to my room
and relax for a little bit?

935
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:58,585
We told a friend
we'd drop by.

936
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,320
Maybe later.

937
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:01,724
Come on.

938
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,830
Find me later.

939
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:06,968
See you!

940
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,471
I thought
everybody should know.

941
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:08,905
But you scared them off, man.

942
00:48:09,906 --> 00:48:11,476
But Karen though...

943
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:12,847
She was looking at me.

944
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,850
Karen wasn't looking at you.

945
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,285
Karen was feeling me, man.

946
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:18,290
She was like, "Hey, Aubrey!"
I was like, "Hey, Karen!"

947
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,627
<i>Disperse</i>

948
00:48:19,627 --> 00:48:21,765
<i> or you will be arrested.</i>

949
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,000
Julie!

950
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,275
We should teach
these pigs a lesson.

951
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:29,647
What you
talking about, Carl?

952
00:48:29,647 --> 00:48:31,420
Them right down there.

953
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:37,897
You know
if you shoot them,

954
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:39,466
they're gonna
shoot us back, right?

955
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:41,337
How they gonna know
where it came from, Lee?

956
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:42,338
It's not even possible.

957
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:41,938
Just calm down, man.

958
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:44,276
Man, you chicken.

959
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:45,546
It's already crazy
in here enough.

960
00:48:45,546 --> 00:48:47,181
Look.
They need to understand

961
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,350
that they can't be picking
on us all the time.

962
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,687
Y'all gotta be
with the program!

963
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:50,789
We're gonna
get our asses beat!

964
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:51,825
One, two.

965
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:53,827
Would you...

966
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:54,965
Get down! Hit the deck!

967
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,236
You guys okay?

968
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:59,238
Who's shooting?

969
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:59,373
From down there, maybe?

970
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,078
It could be
any one of those buildings.

971
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:02,982
Did you just hear
that gunshot, baby?

972
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,220
No, I didn't hear anything.

973
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:09,561
Anyway, you know
if I get a record deal,

974
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,096
we gonna drive
a Cadillac, right?

975
00:49:12,265 --> 00:49:14,035
Look, check him out!

976
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:17,743
Run, Mr. Cracker, run!

977
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:20,616
Get down!

978
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:21,651
Muzzle flash!

979
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:24,924
By the Algiers,
could be a sniper.

980
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:28,129
Mike?

981
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:27,998
I'm okay!

982
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,210
I didn't get hit!

983
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:41,156
Keifer Command, this is
Warrant Officer Roberts.

984
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:42,225
Take cover!

985
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:43,595
Army taking sniper fire.

986
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:46,200
Algiers Motel vicinity,
on Virginia Park.

987
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,905
Yeah, keep running.

988
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:52,477
That was bad, brother.

989
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:52,579
That's crazy, man.

990
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,850
Now everybody know
what it's like to be black.

991
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:58,692
Police 2-4, potential sniper

992
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:00,127
-in the area.
-Army taking fire.

993
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:01,631
<i>Near the Algiers Motel</i>

00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:24,443
Sniper out there!

1001
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:26,414
Lock the whole place up!

1002
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,787
Let's find that motherfucker.

1003
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,534
Anyway, my boy Fred
was just telling me

1004
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,036
that the rioting
is getting so bad,

1005
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,239
even Ford's thinking about

1006
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,909
shutting down assembly
for a day.

1007
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,179
Larry, that's terrible.

1008
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:43,448
<i>Yeah, I know it is.</i>

1009
00:50:43,448 --> 00:50:44,984
Maybe we should
make the most of it.

1010
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,156
In a time of hate, love does
become more important.

1011
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:49,761
Maybe the most important.

1012
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:51,329
Why don't you come over here
and visit me?

1013
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:52,666
<i> We got a swimming pool
and I think</i>

1014
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,737
<i> we need to spend
some time together.</i>

1015
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:57,309
My mom says
I can't leave the house.

1016
00:50:57,309 --> 00:50:58,212
<i> But I want to.</i>

1017
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:02,192
Your mama, right.

1018
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,201
Give me some shells.

1019
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,538
Here.

1020
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,753
Thanks.

1021
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:32,044
Move, move, move!
Move forward!

1022
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:35,919
Left hand, top window!

1023
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:37,824
Spread out to the side!

1024
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:41,398
Hey, y'all, there's a bunch
of police outside right now.

1025
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,971
Quit playing, man!

1026
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,042
Why would I be playing?

1027
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,678
Yo, is they lost?

1028
00:51:48,678 --> 00:51:50,081
Come on, move!

1029
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:51,785
I hope so!
What you mean? I don't know.

1030
00:51:51,785 --> 00:51:53,054
I don't know, man,
but it look like

1031
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:54,389
they coming
right toward the house.

1032
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:56,664
Go! Don't just
stand there! Move up!

1033
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:00,071
Get in position!

1034
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:05,076
Close the windows!

1035
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:05,011
Window!

1036
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:07,718
Hide everything!
Turn the lights off!

1037
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:09,820
Sniper!

1038
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:13,394
Oh, shit!

1039
00:52:13,394 --> 00:52:14,631
Baby,
did you hear that?

1040
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,106
They're shooting at us!

1041
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:24,350
I gotta go!
They're shooting us.

1042
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,452
Larry!

1043
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:27,294
Fred, you good?

1044
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,136
You good?

1045
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:35,873
I don't wanna die, man!

1046
00:52:36,874 --> 00:52:38,344
We gotta get out of here!

1047
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:40,346
Man, don't get up!

1048
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:39,848
Carl, stay down!

1049
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:41,850
They can't do this to us.

1050
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:41,951
Stay down!

1051
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,487
They can't do this to us.

1052
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,490
Carl, stay down!

1053
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,760
What're you doing, man?

1054
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:48,499
Here we go!

1055
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:51,949
Go. Go. Go. Go.

1056
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:08,673
Going up.

1057
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:18,462
Clear!

1058
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:23,769
Clear!

1059
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,020
Police!

1060
00:53:43,942 --> 00:53:45,679
Hey, do you hear that?

1061
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:46,785
Fred, stay low!

1062
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:03,548
Police! Get on the floor!

1063
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:05,184
Get the fuck
against the wall right now!

1064
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:07,856
All right, all right!

1065
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:09,660
I didn't do nothing!

1066
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,503
Have you got a weapon?

1067
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,839
I don't have
a fucking gun!

1068
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,276
Put your hands
behind your back!

1069
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,279
Have you got a firearm?

1070
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:19,881
No!

1071
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,884
Have you got a fucking weapon?

1072
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:29,501
Go, go, go!

1073
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:32,504
Come here! Come on!

1074
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:31,904
Why you doing this?

1075
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:35,411
Get him the fuck
downstairs now.

1076
00:54:35,411 --> 00:54:37,413
Get the fuck out of here now!

1077
00:54:35,411 --> 00:54:37,448
Get out of here!

1078
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,450
Come on!

1079
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,019
Take him!

1080
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:02,499
Put your hands on your head
and relax. Just calm down.

1081
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:05,071
Sit down.
Put your hands on your head.

1082
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:06,875
Move the fuck downstairs! Go!

1083
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,849
I don't have a gun!
Don't pull man!

1084
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,920
Police! Put your hands
on your head!

1085
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,759
They already are.

1086
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:28,484
Against the walls and doors!

1087
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:28,852
All of them! Against the wall!

1088
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:31,256
Fred!

1089
00:55:31,256 --> 00:55:32,391
Walls and doors!

1090
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:34,128
I didn't do nothing!

1091
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:35,666
I don't have nothing!

1092
00:55:39,272 --> 00:55:41,274
I don't got no gun!

1093
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:46,888
Anybody in there?

1094
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:49,325
No, sir.

1095
00:55:51,129 --> 00:55:51,899
Get the fuck up! Get up!

1096
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,235
Get downstairs! Go!

1097
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:56,237
Get him downstairs!

1098
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:56,008
What's going...

1099
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,814
What're you doing here?

1100
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,489
Down on
the ground! Get down!

1101
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,491
I'm not resisting!

1102
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:05,925
Get up!

1103
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:15,579
Yeah, keep goin'!
Don't look at me!

1104
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:18,752
Against the wall,
bring them all down!

1105
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:20,990
Hey! You got him?

1106
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,660
Against
the walls and doors!

1107
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:22,928
Turn around
and stay against the wall.

1108
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:25,801
Let's get them
down here!

1109
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:28,872
Let's go!

1110
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:30,411
Don't you fucking move!

1111
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,416
Get them, go!

1112
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,685
What did we do?

1113
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:37,155
You better
shut your mouth!

1114
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:39,225
Get them! Get
the fuck... Get out of here!

1115
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:41,229
Get the fuck downstairs!

1116
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:55,727
Go! Let's get them
down here!

1117
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:59,099
Go!
Down the stairs! Let's go!

1118
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,100
Let's go!

1119
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,001
Okay, okay!

1120
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:04,744
Come on, man!
My arm, man! Stop!

1121
00:57:04,744 --> 00:57:06,214
We didn't even do anything!

1122
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,551
Shit!

1123
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,768
Where's Carl, man?

1124
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:20,909
Where's Carl?

1125
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:23,147
What happened?

1126
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:25,251
Fella here had a knife,
tried to go for my gun.

1127
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:27,856
Yeah, I heard him shout,
"Get off my gun!"

1128
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:30,896
Yeah, it all happened
pretty fast.

1129
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:34,102
I guess you had
to defend yourself.

1130
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:36,942
Aubrey, get back!

1131
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:41,517
Get back
against the wall! Move!

1132
00:57:41,517 --> 00:57:44,520
Chill!

1133
00:57:41,517 --> 00:57:44,289
They killed Carl!

1134
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:46,527
Don't be stupid, boy!
Stay against the wall!

1135
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:47,565
Okay, okay.

1136
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,936
He has his face
filled with blood.

1137
00:57:50,936 --> 00:57:52,775
They killed him, man.

1138
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,852
Shame.
A young kid like that.

1139
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:02,191
Still, he might
be the shooter.

1140
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,666
We need to find out.

1141
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,308
They killed him, man.

1142
00:58:18,758 --> 00:58:20,862
They killed our friend.

1143
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:22,732
What's the deal
with the girls?

1144
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,604
I found them with the
big nigger down the end.

1145
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:25,445
Same room?

1146
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:34,454
You find anything?

1147
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:34,155
Nothing.

1148
00:58:34,155 --> 00:58:35,224
No gun?

1149
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,336
No.

1150
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:47,651
Some bad news.

1151
00:58:49,653 --> 00:58:51,390
One of the guests is dead.

1152
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:56,399
He tried to take
a police officer's weapon,

1153
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,171
ended up getting shot.

1154
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:01,276
Carl Cooper.

1155
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,980
He killed Carl.

1156
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:12,566
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1157
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:13,971
Amen.

1158
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,613
Now let's not be stupid
in this situation.

1159
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:25,324
We still have a crime scene
here and you're all suspects.

1160
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:27,228
Each and every one of you.

1161
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:28,865
Don't look at me!

1162
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,271
Turn around, face the wall!

1163
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:40,524
Was Carl the one
doing the shooting?

1164
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:45,001
Huh?

1165
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:51,645
Somebody better start
getting honest with me.

1166
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:57,054
Hey! I want that gun!

1167
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:58,356
We looked around,
we didn't find a gun.

1168
00:59:58,356 --> 01:00:01,262
Doesn't mean
it's not here! Go find it!

1169
01:00:01,262 --> -00:00:00,800
You, too!

1170
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:09,916
I got nothing
against you people.

1171
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:15,593
But you need to tell me
where the gun is.

1172
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:19,700
You need to tell me

1173
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,806
who was doing the shooting.

1174
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:24,410
I'm only gonna ask
so many times.

1175
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:27,983
Who did the shooting?

1176
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:29,085
We don't know.

1177
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:30,991
You do fucking know!

1178
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:36,669
You were upstairs,
who was doing the shooting?

1179
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:41,674
Who was doing the shooting?

1180
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:41,209
You doing the shooting, man!

1181
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:42,879
Lee!

1182
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,883
No, man.

1183
01:00:45,885 --> 01:00:48,323
Carl ain't got no gun.

1184
01:00:48,323 --> 01:00:49,458
What's that?

1185
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,630
You're the ones out here
killing people!

1186
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,802
Say that to my face!

1187
01:00:53,802 --> 01:00:55,538
I said, Carl ain't shoot
nobody, man!

1188
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:57,909
Yeah, all right.

1189
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:03,520
Fuck.

1190
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:07,294
Stop your goddamn crying!
Face the door!

1191
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:09,300
You, too. Face the front!

1192
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,411
Why don't you pick that up
and defend yourself?

1193
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:17,686
Hmm?

1194
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:22,638
It's easy, look.

1195
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:37,990
You sure you don't wanna
try and stab me?

1196
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,002
I'm not gonna play your game.

1197
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:47,274
Come on.

1198
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:49,178
That would just give me
an excuse to do

1199
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:51,584
what we both know
is gonna happen anyway.

1200
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,319
Right?

1201
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:55,323
Man, y'all
some crazy crackers!

1202
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:58,064
Shit!

1203
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:04,821
Get off of me.

1204
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,738
You still a cracker.

1205
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:21,044
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Shut up.

1206
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:25,585
There's a goddamn
shooter in this house.

1207
01:02:25,585 --> 01:02:27,421
Was it Carl?

1208
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,391
Let me tell you something.

1209
01:02:29,391 --> 01:02:32,999
If you think that you can
shoot at innocent people

1210
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,904
and get away with it,

1211
01:02:35,905 --> 01:02:37,512
you are dead wrong.

1212
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:43,220
My partner said, "stand up."

1213
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,223
Look, I'll take him.

1214
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,891
So stand.

1215
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:47,929
Go search the place,
I'll take him with me.

1216
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:49,900
Come on, come on.

1217
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,902
Come on.

1218
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,174
Get the fuck outta here.

1219
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:01,791
I got all night, people.

1220
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,397
Nobody's gonna talk?

1221
01:03:05,397 --> 01:03:07,167
Nobody knows
who the shooter is?

1222
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:08,571
Please, God. Please, God.

1223
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:10,608
Nobody's going to admit shit?

1224
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:11,910
All right.

1225
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,115
Then start prayin'.

1226
01:03:14,115 --> 01:03:17,220
Start praying. What's the
matter, boy? You don't pray?

1227
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,224
You don't go
to fuckin' church?

1228
01:03:19,224 --> 01:03:21,226
Start praying!

1229
01:03:19,224 --> 01:03:21,129
Oh, Lord.

1230
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:21,330
Forgive our trespasses as we

1231
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:23,734
forgive those
that trespass against us.

1232
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,404
'Cause I will
kill you, one by one,

1233
01:03:25,404 --> 01:03:28,878
until you tell me exactly
what is going on here.

1234
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:31,482
Cover us with
the blood of Jesus, God.

1235
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:33,354
I'm just gonna assume
you're all criminals.

1236
01:03:34,355 --> 01:03:37,962
Because if we're honest,
you probably are.

1237
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:38,363
So let's hear it.

1238
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:41,737
Let's fucking hear it!

1239
01:03:41,737 --> 01:03:43,707
Pray! Do it loud!

1240
01:03:44,676 --> 01:03:46,346
You don't sing
that gospel shit?

1241
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:48,918
<i> ♪ My way ♪</i>

1242
01:03:48,918 --> 01:03:50,420
There you go,
now we got two of 'em.

1243
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,690
Take the hate out
of our hearts, God.

1244
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:52,659
What about you?

1245
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:54,194
<i> ♪ Your grace is with me ♪</i>

1246
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:56,933
You are not praying. I'm not
hearing shit out of you.

1247
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,935
Mary, full of grace...

1248
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,804
I don't give a fuck.

1249
01:03:58,804 --> 01:04:01,877
You may need a little fuckin'
help to know how to pray.

1250
01:04:04,248 --> 01:04:07,187
<i> ♪ You are near me ♪</i>

1251
01:04:07,187 --> 01:04:08,456
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1252
01:04:08,456 --> 01:04:10,327
<i> ♪ When my life ♪</i>

1253
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:11,930
He's really fuckin' praying.

1254
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,299
It's not bad.

1255
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,854
All right, check the room.

1256
01:04:23,854 --> 01:04:26,762
Under the beds
and in the drawers. Okay?

1257
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:41,590
They're gonna kill us, man.

1258
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,629
Why? You gonna be crazy?

1259
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,669
They the ones
that's acting crazy.

1260
01:04:47,669 --> 01:04:49,138
They lost they mind
when they seen

1261
01:04:49,138 --> 01:04:51,376
a couple white girls
in a room with a black man.

1262
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:53,781
They're lookin' for
a sniper, okay?

1263
01:04:53,781 --> 01:04:56,686
But Carl wasn't
no sniper, man.

1264
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,122
So if a guy goes for your gun,

1265
01:04:58,122 --> 01:05:00,159
you gonna let him have it
because he's black?

1266
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,563
Come on!

1267
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,072
A cop has a shotgun
like yours, right?

1268
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,314
You hold that tight
with two hands.

1269
01:05:11,316 --> 01:05:12,555
How you even gonna
try to take that?

1270
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:17,265
Lotta ways.

1271
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:33,460
There's no guns
in this whole motel

1272
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:37,301
except the ones
these cops brought.

1273
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,303
There's no guns.

1274
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,820
We takin' something
for those crazy boys.

1275
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:51,263
Pick 'em up.

1276
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:54,802
What's the point?

1277
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:58,042
Look, I understand. Okay?

1278
01:05:58,042 --> 01:06:00,948
But don't antagonize
those guys.

1279
01:06:00,948 --> 01:06:02,519
I need you
to survive the night.

1280
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:06,158
Survive the night.

1281
01:06:07,492 --> 01:06:08,930
All right?

1282
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,533
You don't think
you're gonna talk?

1283
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,137
I'll fucking make you talk.

1284
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:13,674
Where's the fuckin' gun?

1285
01:06:13,674 --> 01:06:15,811
Get up!
Get the fuck up!

1286
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:17,013
You gonna tell me
where the gun is?

1287
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:19,015
I don't know.

1288
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:19,184
Bullshit!

1289
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:23,259
Stop fucking lying to me!

1290
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:24,795
Where's the fucking gun!

1291
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:26,934
I swear to God,
I'll pull the fucking trigger!

1292
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:28,102
Where is it?

1293
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:29,438
I don't know,
I swear...

1294
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:30,579
Bullshit!

1295
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:37,956
Come here.

1296
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,290
What's going on?

1297
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,562
I gotta tell you, Detroit PD
is going nuts in there.

1298
01:06:41,563 --> 01:06:42,898
What do you mean?

1299
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,502
Looks like they're
terrorizing suspects,

1300
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:46,438
beating and so forth,
trying to get a confession.

1301
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:49,211
Well, that's not correct,
they got their civil rights.

1302
01:06:49,211 --> 01:06:50,614
That's what I'm saying.

1303
01:06:50,614 --> 01:06:51,983
Don't look right to me.

1304
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:53,485
Where's
that fucking gun?

1305
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:55,190
Don't lie to me!
Where's the gun?

1306
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:57,629
All right.

1307
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,768
Let's let them have the case.

1308
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:02,672
I don't wanna
get involved in any

1309
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:05,110
civil rights mix-up, you know?

1310
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,386
Let's go.

1311
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:22,074
Where's the fucking gun!

1312
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:22,043
I don't know!

1313
01:07:22,043 --> 01:07:24,516
Bullshit!
You people are always lying!

1314
01:07:24,516 --> 01:07:26,257
Who's the shooter?

1315
01:07:32,263 --> 01:07:33,432
Find it?

1316
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:34,836
No.

1317
01:07:35,837 --> 01:07:36,573
All this looks stolen.

1318
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:39,712
I searched
the whole room, myself.

1319
01:07:39,712 --> 01:07:42,751
He wouldn't even
tell you, huh?

1320
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,289
All right.
Get Demens to watch the line.

1321
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:46,458
Come with me.

1322
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,897
Get in there. Quickly.

1323
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:50,899
Wait, wait, wait.

1324
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:51,168
Lie down.

1325
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,707
Come on!
We need you in here.

1326
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,946
Get the...

1327
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:58,948
Get on the goddamn floor.

1328
01:08:01,857 --> 01:08:03,766
You don't have to
do this, man.

1329
01:08:15,617 --> 01:08:16,622
We're gonna hold the line.

1330
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:24,102
Why you gotta fuck them, huh?

1331
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,541
What's wrong with us?

1332
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,977
Listen to me.

1333
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:30,514
You need to tell me

1334
01:08:30,514 --> 01:08:33,052
where the gun is
and who the shooter is...

1335
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:34,688
I swear to you there's no gun.

1336
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:36,124
There's no gun, man!

1337
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:36,663
...or I swear to God,
I will kill you.

1338
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,740
There's no gun, man.

1339
01:08:46,412 --> 01:08:47,480
Okay.

1340
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,851
I don't know nothing, man.

1341
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:50,853
No!

1342
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:59,174
He shot him. He shot him.

1343
01:09:03,178 --> 01:09:05,349
Face the fucking wall.

1344
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,132
Be still and stay quiet,

1345
01:09:13,132 --> 01:09:15,738
or the next one is for real.

1346
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:17,043
Understand?

1347
01:09:21,047 --> 01:09:21,789
This'll make 'em talk.
Watch this.

1348
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,201
That one didn't even kick.

1349
01:09:32,203 --> 01:09:33,777
That's what happens
when you lie to us.

1350
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,951
Who else wants to kill one?

1351
01:09:39,952 --> 01:09:41,290
You wanna kill one?

1352
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:43,828
Okay.

1353
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:46,672
All right.

1354
01:10:01,662 --> 01:10:03,867
Officer, wait!
I didn't shoot nobody!

1355
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:04,868
Officer, wait!

1356
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,436
Shut up!

1357
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:06,572
Fuck!

1358
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:08,342
Shut up.
Get the fuck in there.

1359
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,146
I told you I don't know where
the fucking gun is, man.

1360
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:11,147
You looked for it, right?

1361
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:10,749
Shut your mouth!

1362
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,421
Hey, man. You gotta tell me

1363
01:10:14,421 --> 01:10:16,024
where the gun is
so all this can stop.

1364
01:10:16,024 --> 01:10:17,025
Where's the gun?

1365
01:10:16,024 --> 01:10:17,327
I don't know.

1366
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:19,329
You can't do this shit!

1367
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:19,599
Shut the fuck up!

1368
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:23,739
Michael. Michael.

1369
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,513
You think we're bluffin'?

1370
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,583
This is Detroit.

1371
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,918
We don't bluff.

1372
01:10:29,918 --> 01:10:32,090
Now, be quiet,

1373
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,501
or the next one
will be for real.

1374
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,287
I killed that nigger.

1375
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:49,626
There you have it.

1376
01:10:50,627 --> 01:10:54,668
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1377
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:57,508
Get your goddamn hands
off her. Turn around.

1378
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:59,311
What's your part
in all this, huh?

1379
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:01,381
Probably know
where the gun is.

1380
01:11:01,381 --> 01:11:03,520
Probably know
who the shooter is.

1381
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,823
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1382
01:11:05,824 --> 01:11:07,326
Yes, you do.

1383
01:11:07,326 --> 01:11:08,863
And you're lyin' to me.

1384
01:11:08,863 --> 01:11:10,299
Get away from me!

1385
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,735
You think you'd get a pass
'cause you're white?

1386
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,140
No, whore. You don't.
Find out what she knows.

1387
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,079
It's okay. Easy, easy.

1388
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:21,322
Face the goddamn wall.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1389
01:11:23,324 --> 01:11:25,030
It's just you and me.

1390
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,099
Take a seat.

1391
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,046
Sit down.

1392
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:35,852
Sit down.

1393
01:11:37,854 --> 01:11:39,390
Ouch.

1394
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,194
You all right there, miss?

1395
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:41,865
Is everything okay?

1396
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,204
You're okay though, right?

1397
01:11:46,204 --> 01:11:48,343
Don't touch me.

1398
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:51,616
Try to keep calm.

1399
01:11:52,617 --> 01:11:53,820
What are you doin'
living here?

1400
01:11:54,821 --> 01:11:56,091
It's a hotel, isn't it?

1401
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:57,359
Yeah.

1402
01:11:57,359 --> 01:11:59,499
So you're up here
for a while?

1403
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:00,836
Some, uh,

1404
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:04,241
prostitution, maybe?

1405
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:07,914
I'm visiting from Ohio.

1406
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:09,518
My father is a judge.

1407
01:12:09,518 --> 01:12:11,989
And your father,
he knows you're here, right?

1408
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:13,660
Living amongst the blacks?

1409
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,128
Are there black people here?

1410
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:16,299
I didn't notice,
I'm colorblind.

1411
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,003
Really?

1412
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:21,542
What color am I? Blue?

1413
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,750
You look yellow to me, sir.

1414
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:32,596
You're working prostitution.

1415
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:32,799
No!

1416
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:38,442
Look at me.

1417
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,847
You're fuckin'
these black guys, right?

1418
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:42,250
They're kids.

1419
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,855
What's the matter with you?

1420
01:12:44,855 --> 01:12:46,998
I'm trying
to protect you, miss.

1421
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:53,377
Stay there.

1422
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:00,154
She's a hooker.

1423
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:04,364
All right, fuck it.
Come here.

1424
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:09,872
So, you are the pimp.

1425
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:11,409
No, sir.
I think you're mistaken.

1426
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,781
Fuck!

1427
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,350
Listen.

1428
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,020
We've got
all the time in the world.

1429
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,957
We are gonna get
to the bottom of this.

1430
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:20,828
So think very carefully about

1431
01:13:20,828 --> 01:13:21,462
how you answer
our questions,

1432
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:25,871
or you're gonna end up like
your friends in the next room.

1433
01:13:25,871 --> 01:13:28,175
How long you been pimpin' out
these young girls, huh?

1434
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:29,745
Destroying their bodies
and minds.

1435
01:13:29,745 --> 01:13:31,749
I just met 'em.
I ain't pimpin'.

1436
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:32,787
I just got back from the war.

1437
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:35,424
You're a veteran?

1438
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:37,794
Yes, sir.

1439
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:42,538
Fuckin' stupid
do you think I am?

1440
01:13:42,538 --> 01:13:43,607
You wear army green,

1441
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:45,109
you try to be
a fucking serviceman.

1442
01:13:45,109 --> 01:13:47,949
We don't need
pimps in the army.

1443
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,955
Probably drove
a fucking supply truck.

1444
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:57,403
I was airborne.

1445
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,527
Look out!

1446
01:14:10,527 --> 01:14:11,996
Take cover!

1447
01:14:11,996 --> 01:14:13,666
Move to cover!

1448
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:16,004
Get down! Get down!

1449
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:18,006
Go, go, go!

1450
01:14:19,344 --> 01:14:22,347
Take cover!

1451
01:14:19,344 --> 01:14:21,883
Sniper!

1452
01:14:23,018 --> 01:14:24,622
Down, down!

1453
01:14:24,622 --> 01:14:26,558
Across the street!
They're running up Euclid!

1454
01:14:26,558 --> 01:14:27,559
Three houses up.

1455
01:14:26,558 --> 01:14:28,162
I see him!

1456
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:29,932
Who's got eyes on him?

1457
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,036
Don't worry about it.
If it was anything,
they'd grab us.

1458
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:38,620
Larry, what are you doin'?

1459
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:43,759
Larry.

1460
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:46,565
Get back on the wall.

1461
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,968
Let's get the fuck up
outta here.

1462
01:14:47,968 --> 01:14:49,504
They're gonna
come back.

1463
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:50,039
We can. Let's go.

1464
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,343
No.

1465
01:14:52,343 --> 01:14:53,045
What are you doing, man?

1466
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:55,716
Come on. Come on.

1467
01:14:55,716 --> 01:14:57,255
Fred, let's go.

1468
01:14:59,257 --> 01:15:00,729
No, Larry. Stop.

1469
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,801
Who's got eyes on him?

1470
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,147
Watch the roof!

1471
01:15:16,157 --> 01:15:18,128
Just breathe,
just breathe.

1472
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:21,974
It's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.

1473
01:15:29,183 --> 01:15:30,195
Come on, come on.

1474
01:15:40,205 --> 01:15:41,808
Stay the fuck away.

1475
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:46,957
Check all those windows!

1476
01:15:51,962 --> 01:15:53,170
Hold your perimeter!

1477
01:15:59,176 --> 01:16:00,513
They're shooting.
You hear that?

1478
01:16:00,513 --> 01:16:02,015
Shut up!

1479
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:04,621
Fall back!
Covering fire! Put it down!

1480
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:06,623
Fire! Fire!

1481
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:10,599
Oh, shit!

1482
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:11,203
Oh, shit!

1483
01:16:14,206 --> 01:16:16,208
We got 'em!

1484
01:16:14,206 --> 01:16:16,210
Hold your fire!

1485
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,016
All right, it's clear.

1486
01:16:20,018 --> 01:16:22,825
Snipers everywhere, tonight.

1487
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:25,667
Clear!

1488
01:16:34,682 --> 01:16:36,919
Is that your
buddies out there, huh?

1489
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:38,526
Is that who was
shooting at us?

1490
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:43,464
Huh? What do you gotta say?

1491
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:47,140
Fuck!

1492
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:50,847
Says right there.
Paratrooper, eight years.

1493
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:52,617
Two deployments.

1494
01:16:52,617 --> 01:16:55,288
Honorable discharge.

1495
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:57,290
This is a fake.

1496
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:57,961
No, sir.

1497
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,964
This your girl?

1498
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,365
I just met her.

1499
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:01,167
What's his name?

1500
01:17:02,168 --> 01:17:03,572
I don't know.

1501
01:17:03,572 --> 01:17:05,041
His name is Karl Greene.

1502
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,745
I wasn't asking you,
I was asking her.

1503
01:17:06,745 --> 01:17:08,314
You just said,
"What's his name?"

1504
01:17:08,314 --> 01:17:11,320
You're lucky I haven't broken
your fuckin' neck, yet.

1505
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,590
Okay.

1506
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,928
All right, man. I see
what you're trying to do.

1507
01:17:14,928 --> 01:17:18,468
I'm not gonna cause
any trouble, okay?

1508
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:21,612
But I'm not gonna
lie down for you, either.

1509
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:26,151
What are you doin'
in Detroit, huh?

1510
01:17:27,152 --> 01:17:30,358
Like everybody else,
I'm lookin' for work.

1511
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:31,828
Left one war zone
and joined another.

1512
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:33,431
Yeah.

1513
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:36,070
All right. Get this
motherfucker back in line.

1514
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,511
Give me back
my government card, man.

1515
01:18:13,548 --> 01:18:15,117
Why don't you
get outta here?

1516
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:17,122
Run out the back door. Run.

1517
01:18:18,123 --> 01:18:18,968
Right now, go!

1518
01:18:28,978 --> 01:18:31,249
You know the one
who was praying?

1519
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,921
He's okay, it's not him.

1520
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:35,792
And you can
scratch off G. I. Joe.

1521
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:38,531
That little twerp with
the big, fuckin' prayer.

1522
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:41,236
Yeah, it's not him.

1523
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:43,406
That leaves us
with the big motherfucker

1524
01:18:43,406 --> 01:18:45,077
who's in that room.

1525
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:46,213
I like him for it.

1526
01:18:47,214 --> 01:18:49,216
Okay.

1527
01:18:47,214 --> 01:18:49,326
Yeah.

1528
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:57,040
Flynn.

1529
01:19:02,045 --> 01:19:02,749
Fuck!

1530
01:19:06,753 --> 01:19:08,191
He's escaped.

1531
01:19:09,192 --> 01:19:10,461
Well, we need another one.

1532
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,563
I know.

1533
01:19:27,928 --> 01:19:29,801
Still... Still no gun.

1534
01:19:31,803 --> 01:19:34,141
So, who wants to go next?

1535
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:35,277
Hmm?

1536
01:19:36,278 --> 01:19:39,052
Please, please, please.

1537
01:19:40,053 --> 01:19:42,892
Please. Just, please, please.

1538
01:19:42,892 --> 01:19:44,566
Officer, can I say something?

1539
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:48,971
There we go.

1540
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:50,577
Yes, you can.

1541
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:55,252
I think you have
the wrong house.

1542
01:19:57,254 --> 01:20:00,127
'Cause nobody we saw...

1543
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:03,703
'Cause nobody we saw here
was shooting at the police.

1544
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:07,077
Please.

1545
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,155
It's possible
we made a mistake.

1546
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:18,496
But I need to know for sure.

1547
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:20,671
Can't let a cop killer
get away with it, can I?

1548
01:20:23,674 --> 01:20:26,045
Please, please.

1549
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:35,669
How about you, sweetheart?

1550
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:40,675
You wanna be next?

1551
01:20:40,675 --> 01:20:41,676
No.

1552
01:20:40,675 --> 01:20:41,944
Hmm?

1553
01:20:43,345 --> 01:20:44,816
No, I don't, please.

1554
01:20:44,816 --> 01:20:46,051
I think
you know something.

1555
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:47,154
I don't.

1556
01:20:47,154 --> 01:20:48,189
You wanna just die now...

1557
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:49,592
No.

1558
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:50,628
...or watch me
kill the others first?

1559
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:53,332
Which one, huh? Which one?

1560
01:20:57,909 --> 01:21:01,684
Get her outta here. Jesus!
And her! Up!

1561
01:21:01,684 --> 01:21:02,852
Upstairs!

1562
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:04,989
No!

1563
01:21:11,937 --> 01:21:13,372
Shut up!

1564
01:21:13,372 --> 01:21:15,276
You wanna cry, huh?

1565
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:16,478
Jesus Christ!

1566
01:21:16,478 --> 01:21:17,782
You wanna cry?

1567
01:21:17,782 --> 01:21:18,416
I'll give you something
to cry about.

1568
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,021
Watch them.
This one's coming with me.

1569
01:21:21,021 --> 01:21:22,659
Shut up!

1570
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:24,963
You wanna cry, huh? I'll give
you something to cry about.

1571
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,432
Leave her alone!

1572
01:21:34,582 --> 01:21:37,221
I guess there are no weapons
on your person.

1573
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:44,036
Stay over there
and keep quiet.

1574
01:21:47,273 --> 01:21:49,679
God.

1575
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,481
Aren't you ashamed
of yourselves?

1576
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:53,319
You're the one
checking out my tits.

1577
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:55,189
You're having
sex with niggers.

1578
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:56,960
It's 1967, asshole.

1579
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,163
Honestly.

1580
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,835
It doesn't bother you?

1581
01:22:00,835 --> 01:22:02,973
The Afro Sheen in their hair?

1582
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:04,442
The way it smells?

1583
01:22:05,443 --> 01:22:06,847
You're on some trip.

1584
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:08,617
You think you can
come into my city

1585
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:10,387
and pimp out a bunch
of young girls?

1586
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:12,459
I said it wasn't like that.

1587
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,463
I don't care
if you were in the army.

1588
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,067
I'll drown all you pimps
in the river

1589
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:18,202
until the city's clean.

1590
01:22:18,202 --> 01:22:19,405
You gonna question them

1591
01:22:19,405 --> 01:22:21,341
or I'm gonna
take 'em outta here.

1592
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:22,816
Just hold on.

1593
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,691
Look.

1594
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:33,366
You might not be
such bad girls after all.

1595
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:35,103
But be straight with me.

1596
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:37,175
Who was shootin'
at the National Guard
out there?

1597
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:39,648
Mister?

1598
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:44,287
I didn't see anybody shoot
at the National Guard.

1599
01:22:44,287 --> 01:22:46,259
I would tell you if I had.

1600
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,532
You would?

1601
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:52,572
You can think
I'm a slut if you want,

1602
01:22:52,572 --> 01:22:55,111
but I was raised right.

1603
01:22:57,113 --> 01:23:00,086
All right. I'm gonna
get 'em outta here.

1604
01:23:00,086 --> 01:23:03,164
Let's get you
covered up, okay?

1605
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:10,440
You too.

1606
01:23:15,684 --> 01:23:17,459
Come on.

1607
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:24,608
Hey, can I get a hand?

1608
01:23:32,284 --> 01:23:33,419
Fuck.

1609
01:23:33,419 --> 01:23:34,689
Fuck those fuckers.

1610
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:36,125
You're fucking
murdering those kids!

1611
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,262
Why don't you stop them?

1612
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:40,901
This animal did it too.
He shot one of them!

1613
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,705
Don't concern yourself.
They're just scaring them.

1614
01:23:42,705 --> 01:23:44,040
It's an interrogation tactic.

1615
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,911
Are you nuts, Mister?
I saw the bodies!

1616
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:47,919
Those guys are getting
murdered in cold blood.

1617
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,338
I didn't really
shoot the guy.

1618
01:24:01,341 --> 01:24:03,179
It's not real.

1619
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:06,018
I didn't shoot that guy,
and neither did the other.

1620
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:07,655
It's to get the guys
to fess up

1621
01:24:07,655 --> 01:24:08,826
about the location of the gun.

1622
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:13,499
Who said they even had a gun?

1623
01:24:13,499 --> 01:24:15,072
I don't know.

1624
01:24:18,075 --> 01:24:19,579
If they did,
it was just a toy.

1625
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,989
It wasn't a real gun.

1626
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:30,301
Well, thanks for saving us.

1627
01:24:31,302 --> 01:24:32,006
We gotta head out.

1628
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:37,380
Are we safe here?

1629
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,153
She means, are you gonna tell
the police where we are?

1630
01:24:41,154 --> 01:24:41,728
No.

1631
01:24:55,249 --> 01:24:56,019
Karen.

1632
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,257
We're gonna be okay.

1633
01:24:59,257 --> 01:25:00,928
But those boys...

1634
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:07,775
Fucking stay there.

1635
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:09,344
You see that? See that shit?

1636
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:11,414
That is your fault
right there. Look at it.

1637
01:25:11,414 --> 01:25:14,354
You don't talk, that's
what happens. Look at it.

1638
01:25:22,838 --> 01:25:23,977
At ease.

1639
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,784
That kid. Him.

1640
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:30,119
He was up there
in the same room

1641
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:31,257
as those other
two delinquents.

1642
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:34,995
Yeah. Let's get
our confession out of him,

1643
01:25:34,995 --> 01:25:36,833
vacate the premises,
all right?

1644
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,835
Okay.

1645
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,804
Demens should do it.

1646
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:41,241
Do what?

1647
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:43,011
You haven't
killed a nigger yet.

1648
01:25:43,011 --> 01:25:45,015
Uh...

1649
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:46,887
Well, I don't know
about that.

1650
01:25:47,888 --> 01:25:48,825
Sure you do.

1651
01:25:50,827 --> 01:25:53,166
What's the matter, partner?
Problem?

1652
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:57,377
Whatever you say.
Which one?

1653
01:26:02,183 --> 01:26:05,657
Come with me. I gotta ask you
some questions.

1654
01:26:05,657 --> 01:26:07,060
Please.

1655
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,800
Please don't
kill me, please.

1656
01:26:11,802 --> 01:26:13,673
Please don't
shoot me, please.

1657
01:26:13,673 --> 01:26:15,811
Where is the gun?

1658
01:26:15,811 --> 01:26:16,679
I don't know. Please.

1659
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,954
I don't know. I swear to God,
I don't know. Please. Please.

1660
01:26:20,954 --> 01:26:22,558
I got no cause
to shoot you.

1661
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:24,060
Please don't
shoot. Please.

1662
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,329
Where's the gun?

1663
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:25,732
Please don't
shoot me, man.

1664
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:29,238
I ain't never shot
anybody before in my life.

1665
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:32,778
Please! I don't know
where... Please.

1666
01:26:32,778 --> 01:26:33,779
Please, don't...

1667
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:40,695
Turn around.

1668
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,846
They fucking killed him.

1669
01:26:54,855 --> 01:26:55,758
So that's done.

1670
01:26:56,759 --> 01:26:58,395
Good. Great job.

1671
01:26:58,395 --> 01:27:00,635
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

1672
01:27:01,636 --> 01:27:03,440
Boy, I feel funny.

1673
01:27:04,441 --> 01:27:08,115
Yeah. It's the right thing.
He'll talk now.

1674
01:27:08,115 --> 01:27:09,189
What do you mean?

1675
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:16,866
Another one bites the dust.

1676
01:27:16,866 --> 01:27:19,572
I bet some of you thought
we weren't serious, huh?

1677
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:21,074
Well, we still
don't have our gun

1678
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:22,878
and we are running
out of time, people.

1679
01:27:22,878 --> 01:27:23,749
Who was the sniper?

1680
01:27:26,752 --> 01:27:29,933
Just be honest with us
so we can all go home.

1681
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:39,712
You shot him, Demens.

1682
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:41,651
Yeah, I got him.

1683
01:27:43,653 --> 01:27:44,855
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1684
01:27:44,855 --> 01:27:46,458
We weren't actually
shooting the other guys.

1685
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,095
We're playing with them.

1686
01:27:48,095 --> 01:27:49,732
What do you mean?

1687
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,000
Playing.

1688
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,136
Playing what?

1689
01:27:52,136 --> 01:27:54,742
A game.

1690
01:27:54,742 --> 01:27:57,881
A game to get them to talk,
scare the shit out of 'em.

1691
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,151
Interrogation tactics.

1692
01:27:59,151 --> 01:28:00,655
Fuck.

1693
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:03,833
This is strictly
police business.

1694
01:28:09,839 --> 01:28:12,410
Hey, boys,
let's move out.

1695
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:15,049
Have you got...
You don't have a knife.

1696
01:28:15,049 --> 01:28:17,051
Fuck me.

1697
01:28:15,049 --> 01:28:17,019
Oh, fuck.

1698
01:28:17,019 --> 01:28:19,021
Okay, listen. Listen.

1699
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:20,258
Listen to me.

1700
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:20,459
Oh, fuck.

1701
01:28:20,459 --> 01:28:22,330
He grabbed your gun,
all right,

1702
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,332
and you warned him, okay?

1703
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:26,605
And you were forced
to shoot him, okay?

1704
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:28,607
Line of duty. Get your
fucking story straight.

1705
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:27,808
Oh, fuck.

1706
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:31,616
Hey, get your head straight.
I'm serious.

1707
01:28:31,616 --> 01:28:32,818
All right,
just take a minute.

1708
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:34,955
Stay here.

1709
01:28:37,561 --> 01:28:39,563
Oh, God.

1710
01:28:39,197 --> 01:28:39,967
Oh, fuck.

1711
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,554
Marty shot the guy.

1712
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:51,955
What?

1713
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:52,956
He did?

1714
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:53,727
Yeah.

1715
01:28:53,727 --> 01:28:54,864
Point blank.

1716
01:28:56,866 --> 01:28:58,939
We need to wrap this up
and get out of here.

1717
01:29:00,941 --> 01:29:02,678
We don't have a suspect.

1718
01:29:02,678 --> 01:29:04,815
Should we just
arrest them all?

1719
01:29:04,815 --> 01:29:08,956
No, no, not now. We just need
to get out of here, you know?

1720
01:29:08,956 --> 01:29:09,892
And... Us and them.

1721
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:14,270
If they're smart,
they're not gonna say
anything, all right?

1722
01:29:17,273 --> 01:29:19,178
All right. Let's do this.

1723
01:29:20,179 --> 01:29:21,323
You come with me.

1724
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:31,836
Listen to me.

1725
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:33,940
You're free to go.

1726
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:37,414
But you don't talk about this
to anyone, ever.

1727
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:39,552
You understand?

1728
01:29:39,552 --> 01:29:41,956
'Cause I got your name,

1729
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:43,827
and I know
exactly who you are.

1730
01:29:44,828 --> 01:29:47,735
I don't got your name.

1731
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:50,141
I don't know
nothin' about you.

1732
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:55,884
Please don't kill me.

1733
01:29:55,884 --> 01:29:58,024
Please don't kill him.

1734
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:01,833
What's this here?

1735
01:30:05,837 --> 01:30:07,514
I don't see nothin'.

1736
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,390
All right.

1737
01:30:16,391 --> 01:30:18,224
Get going.

1738
01:30:47,253 --> 01:30:49,726
Hey, we don't know nothin'.

1739
01:30:50,727 --> 01:30:52,002
We don't know nothin'.

1740
01:30:58,008 --> 01:30:59,581
No, no, no, no!

1741
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,752
Relax.

1742
01:31:03,753 --> 01:31:05,157
Listen.

1743
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:07,427
What if I told you

1744
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:10,701
you can run out
that door right now,

1745
01:31:10,701 --> 01:31:12,475
but you never talk about
what you saw here?

1746
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:19,785
Understand?

1747
01:31:19,785 --> 01:31:24,164
Please don't kill him.
Please don't kill him.

1748
01:31:37,554 --> 01:31:39,058
No, no, no!

1749
01:31:43,031 --> 01:31:44,840
Listen to me.

1750
01:31:49,845 --> 01:31:51,586
What do you see here?

1751
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:58,263
You killed him.

1752
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,001
You killed him.

1753
01:32:06,144 --> 01:32:08,155
We're gonna try this again.

1754
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:17,278
I don't see anything.

1755
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:32,273
There's a dead guy
right there.

1756
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:13,146
Halt!

1757
01:33:14,147 --> 01:33:16,552
Please, please, please...

1758
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:19,428
Please, please, please...

1759
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,104
Hey.

1760
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:27,741
Hey.

1761
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:29,443
Oh, my God.

1762
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:31,414
Who could do this
to someone?

1763
01:33:31,414 --> 01:33:35,289
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here
to help you, all right?

1764
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:37,561
Come on. Hey.

1765
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:39,464
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

1766
01:33:39,464 --> 01:33:41,302
All right? Relax.

1767
01:33:43,304 --> 01:33:45,178
Okay? Hey, hey,
it's all right.

1768
01:33:48,181 --> 01:33:50,853
Come with me. Come on.

1769
01:33:50,853 --> 01:33:53,058
Come on.
We're gonna get you there.

1770
01:33:53,058 --> 01:33:54,032
Come on, brother.

1771
01:33:59,037 --> 01:34:03,218
Don't you go on me, all right?
Come on. Come on.

1772
01:34:09,224 --> 01:34:10,360
We got him.

1773
01:34:11,361 --> 01:34:12,148
Let's go.

1774
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,289
Aubrey! Phone call!

1775
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,326
Aubrey, hey!

1776
01:34:44,327 --> 01:34:45,597
You got phone call!

1777
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:48,600
Say again?

1778
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:48,003
You got a call from home.

1779
01:34:50,005 --> 01:34:51,140
Something's wrong.

1780
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,177
Kid's in trouble or hurt,
or something.

1781
01:34:53,177 --> 01:34:55,350
Bet it's my youngest.

1782
01:34:57,352 --> 01:35:00,355
He's always googy-googy.

1783
01:35:05,802 --> 01:35:07,642
Yes?

1784
01:35:08,643 --> 01:35:09,946
<i>Well, Aubrey,</i>

1785
01:35:11,982 --> 01:35:14,353
they found Aubrey dead
this morning

1786
01:35:14,353 --> 01:35:16,394
at the Algiers Motel.

1787
01:35:19,397 --> 01:35:22,774
No. No. Aubrey's supposed
to be at home.

1788
01:35:26,778 --> 01:35:29,121
It's gotta be somebody else.

1789
01:36:03,252 --> 01:36:04,722
What is this, Ma?

1790
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:07,862
A mistake?

1791
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:11,268
It's gotta be a mistake.

1792
01:36:11,268 --> 01:36:13,273
Aubrey's got more sense
than that.

1793
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:17,948
Well, baby, you never know.

1794
01:36:17,948 --> 01:36:19,761
Let's go see.

1795
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,032
Dismukes?

1796
01:37:33,032 --> 01:37:34,637
Is he there?

1797
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:43,419
Looking for a Dismukes.

1798
01:37:45,421 --> 01:37:47,328
Appreciate it.

1799
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:52,202
Any of you fellas
named Dismukes?

1800
01:37:52,202 --> 01:37:54,006
Yeah, that's me.

1801
01:37:54,006 --> 01:37:56,079
I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

1802
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:00,318
Is there a problem?

1803
01:38:00,318 --> 01:38:02,691
No. I don't think so.

1804
01:38:02,691 --> 01:38:04,563
Rather not have
to ask again, though.

1805
01:38:06,565 --> 01:38:09,304
Y'all tell the boss, huh?

1806
01:38:10,305 --> 01:38:11,445
You got this?

1807
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:17,451
Take care of yourself.

1808
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:17,663
This way.

1809
01:38:26,672 --> 01:38:29,396
Come on, I ain't got all day.

1810
01:39:05,049 --> 01:39:05,906
Take a seat.

1811
01:39:52,176 --> 01:39:53,713
I'm sorry, I...

1812
01:39:53,713 --> 01:39:56,786
I assume this is about
what went on at the motel?

1813
01:39:56,786 --> 01:39:59,123
What happened at the motel?

1814
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:01,061
If you don't know,
I'll tell you.

1815
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:04,433
I was working security
by Wisconsin.

1816
01:40:04,433 --> 01:40:06,605
And on Tuesday night,
we heard gunfire

1817
01:40:06,605 --> 01:40:09,210
coming from the area
near the Algiers.

1818
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,213
Oh.

1819
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:11,615
In that direction.

1820
01:40:11,615 --> 01:40:13,820
Police was there.
State police,

1821
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,756
National Guard.
It was a lot of shooting.

1822
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:20,900
And when I went in there,
three kids had been killed.

1823
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,935
No.

1824
01:40:21,935 --> 01:40:23,937
Yes, sir.

1825
01:40:21,935 --> 01:40:24,273
This right there, right?

1826
01:40:24,273 --> 01:40:26,912
Is that what
you're talking about?

1827
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:30,486
Yes, sir.

1828
01:40:30,486 --> 01:40:31,956
Yeah.

1829
01:40:31,956 --> 01:40:35,262
He was lying just like this.
The blood was fresh.

1830
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:37,399
It hadn't congealed yet.

1831
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:41,274
So they were killed
right before you got there?

1832
01:40:42,543 --> 01:40:44,015
Yes, sir.

1833
01:40:46,017 --> 01:40:49,631
You carry a .38, right?

1834
01:40:56,638 --> 01:40:58,876
A revolver.
Do you carry a revolver?

1835
01:40:58,876 --> 01:41:00,848
I do have a .38.

1836
01:41:01,849 --> 01:41:03,719
Hmm. You ever shoot anyone?

1837
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:05,721
No.

1838
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:06,325
Strike anyone?

1839
01:41:07,326 --> 01:41:07,593
Not the way you mean, sir.

1840
01:41:08,594 --> 01:41:10,306
What do I mean?

1841
01:41:18,314 --> 01:41:19,650
Fellas,

1842
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:21,421
you know, sometimes,

1843
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:25,095
when a black guy's put
in a position of authority,

1844
01:41:25,095 --> 01:41:28,368
other black guys, they like
to single you out, okay?

1845
01:41:28,368 --> 01:41:30,642
Because I'm not supposed
to tell 'em what to do.

1846
01:41:32,644 --> 01:41:34,615
When we have
these conversations,

1847
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:38,055
we do them in stages, okay?

1848
01:41:39,056 --> 01:41:41,629
Stage one, witnesses.

1849
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:45,335
Stage two, suspects.

1850
01:41:45,335 --> 01:41:47,940
What stage are we in?

1851
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,309
You don't know
what stage we're in?

1852
01:41:49,309 --> 01:41:51,147
No. Could you
specify for me?

1853
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,920
Yeah, we're in stage two.

1854
01:41:54,921 --> 01:41:55,827
You're a suspect.

1855
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:01,701
I didn't do it.

1856
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:02,803
The police...

1857
01:42:02,803 --> 01:42:05,244
Ah, here we go.

1858
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:08,782
The police shot those kids.

1859
01:42:08,782 --> 01:42:11,153
See,
how the hell do you know that

1860
01:42:11,153 --> 01:42:13,357
when you weren't inside
the building

1861
01:42:13,357 --> 01:42:15,864
until after
the shooting stopped?

1862
01:42:15,864 --> 01:42:18,401
So, are you lying to us now,

1863
01:42:18,401 --> 01:42:21,373
or were you lying
just a minute ago?

1864
01:42:21,373 --> 01:42:24,479
That's
a good question, Detective.

1865
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:27,018
You need to think real hard.

1866
01:42:27,018 --> 01:42:29,291
You need to answer me.

1867
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:33,031
All due respect,
I am telling the truth.

1868
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:35,269
I'm not lying.

1869
01:42:35,269 --> 01:42:39,110
I told you what I saw.
I saw these kids...

1870
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:41,112
Melvin.

1871
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:40,980
Okay. Okay.

1872
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,982
We're here
to help you, okay?

1873
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:43,117
Yes, sir.

1874
01:42:43,117 --> 01:42:45,188
Melvin, do you
wanna go home?

1875
01:42:45,188 --> 01:42:46,591
Yeah.

1876
01:42:46,591 --> 01:42:46,725
Can we let him
think about it?

1877
01:42:47,726 --> 01:42:48,962
Yeah.

1878
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,535
You think about it,
okay, Melvin?

1879
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:55,412
I didn't do it.

1880
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:12,349
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

1881
01:43:18,355 --> 01:43:21,393
You're doing
a real good job, honey.

1882
01:44:04,379 --> 01:44:05,815
Eddie...

1883
01:44:05,815 --> 01:44:07,520
Has he woken up?

1884
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,524
No, man.

1885
01:44:12,563 --> 01:44:13,499
Hey.

1886
01:44:14,501 --> 01:44:15,603
Larry.

1887
01:44:15,603 --> 01:44:16,772
Hey, wake up, brother.

1888
01:44:17,773 --> 01:44:19,443
Hey.

1889
01:44:19,443 --> 01:44:20,218
Be gentle.

1890
01:44:26,224 --> 01:44:28,397
It's all right, man.
It's us.

1891
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:33,138
You know where
my little brother is?

1892
01:44:34,139 --> 01:44:35,676
The police are saying
Fred is dead,

1893
01:44:35,676 --> 01:44:37,550
but I can't get nobody
to tell me what's going on.

1894
01:44:40,553 --> 01:44:42,023
What's going on?

1895
01:44:43,024 --> 01:44:45,166
You tell us, man.

1896
01:44:50,171 --> 01:44:51,609
The police...

1897
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,912
The police?

1898
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:55,183
The police...

1899
01:44:57,185 --> 01:44:57,856
They...

1900
01:45:17,892 --> 01:45:19,196
You have children?

1901
01:45:19,196 --> 01:45:21,701
Oh, yes. I have three boys.

1902
01:45:21,701 --> 01:45:25,208
The oldest is 12.
Then nine and seven.

1903
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:27,111
You know
how youngsters are then.

1904
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:29,517
Oh, boy...

1905
01:45:29,517 --> 01:45:32,457
The way they communicate,
grunts and groans.

1906
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:34,995
My little cavemen.

1907
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:35,896
Especially boys.

1908
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:39,136
It's like they don't know
if they wanna be slick,
you know?

1909
01:45:39,136 --> 01:45:40,606
That's right.

1910
01:45:40,606 --> 01:45:43,277
They're still trying
to find their place in life

1911
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:45,114
and we have
to allow for that.

1912
01:45:45,114 --> 01:45:45,887
Uh-huh.

1913
01:45:49,891 --> 01:45:51,161
Oh, yes.

1914
01:45:53,163 --> 01:45:53,900
Hmm.

1915
01:45:55,902 --> 01:45:57,740
Well,

1916
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:00,014
I can see
you want to go back there.

1917
01:46:03,017 --> 01:46:04,798
Sure.

1918
01:46:24,093 --> 01:46:25,963
<i>We helped put out fires.</i>

1919
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:28,001
<i> We helped try to keep
the riots down</i>

1920
01:46:28,001 --> 01:46:29,370
<i> and keep the corner clear.</i>

1921
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:30,673
<i> What can you say</i>

1922
01:46:30,673 --> 01:46:34,012
<i> about having all this
murdering and confusion?</i>

1923
01:46:34,012 --> 01:46:37,820
<i> Everybody isn't thieves
and murderers.</i>

1924
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:42,630
<i> I wish that things could be
better for the negro people.</i>

1925
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:53,050
Just, uh...

1926
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:55,188
Remember what I told you,
and this whole thing's
gonna blow over.

1927
01:46:55,188 --> 01:46:58,231
All right?
You did nothing wrong.

1928
01:47:02,235 --> 01:47:03,441
I think I gotta say somethin'.

1929
01:47:07,445 --> 01:47:08,554
Hey. You made...

1930
01:47:13,559 --> 01:47:15,095
Demens.

1931
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,233
Something that took one minute

1932
01:47:17,233 --> 01:47:19,704
should not define
your entire life.

1933
01:47:19,704 --> 01:47:21,575
You understand?

1934
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,716
You made a mistake.

1935
01:47:25,716 --> 01:47:27,955
You say what you need to say,

1936
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:30,392
and you move on.

1937
01:47:30,392 --> 01:47:31,864
That's how
you get out of this thing.

1938
01:47:33,866 --> 01:47:35,868
All right?

1939
01:47:33,866 --> 01:47:35,771
All right.

1940
01:47:36,772 --> 01:47:37,907
All right?

1941
01:47:37,907 --> 01:47:39,143
Yeah. You don't
have to lecture me,

1942
01:47:39,143 --> 01:47:40,546
I know what to do.

1943
01:47:40,546 --> 01:47:41,650
There you go.

1944
01:47:43,652 --> 01:47:44,623
You were doing your job.

1945
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:57,783
You first, knucklehead!

1946
01:48:00,786 --> 01:48:02,030
All right.

1947
01:48:32,884 --> 01:48:33,577
Flynn!

1948
01:48:59,704 --> 01:49:01,279
All right. Let's go, ladies.

1949
01:49:07,285 --> 01:49:08,966
I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

1950
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:21,213
Well?

1951
01:49:21,213 --> 01:49:23,651
Some things were said
in there.

1952
01:49:23,651 --> 01:49:24,790
Such as?

1953
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:31,066
You stupid...
You motherfucker, you're dead.

1954
01:49:31,066 --> 01:49:32,841
You're fucking dead.

1955
01:49:36,845 --> 01:49:39,249
You too?

1956
01:49:39,249 --> 01:49:41,356
We're all going down.

1957
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:47,032
Phil, listen. It's...

1958
01:49:47,032 --> 01:49:48,033
No. No.

1959
01:49:47,032 --> 01:49:48,301
Just listen to me.

1960
01:49:48,301 --> 01:49:50,303
Get the fuck out of my way.

1961
01:49:48,301 --> 01:49:49,875
Phil!

1962
01:50:11,581 --> 01:50:13,953
I got nothing to say
without my union lawyer.

1963
01:50:13,953 --> 01:50:15,756
Are you kidding me,
you racist fuck?

1964
01:50:15,756 --> 01:50:18,367
Get out of the car
before I break your neck.

1965
01:50:25,374 --> 01:50:26,611
I couldn't say for sure

1966
01:50:26,611 --> 01:50:28,048
who went inside
the building first.

1967
01:50:29,049 --> 01:50:30,051
Um...

1968
01:50:31,052 --> 01:50:33,859
There were five,

1969
01:50:33,859 --> 01:50:35,996
maybe six state police.

1970
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:38,669
We have complete statements
from your partners.

1971
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:43,076
We know you shot those kids.

1972
01:50:43,076 --> 01:50:43,681
So just go from there.

1973
01:50:46,684 --> 01:50:48,522
No. No.

1974
01:50:48,522 --> 01:50:51,561
I don't recall
doing that. Uh...

1975
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:53,631
Bang his head against
the table. Might help.

1976
01:50:53,631 --> 01:50:55,002
Hey.

1977
01:50:56,003 --> 01:50:58,407
I'm trying to help here.

1978
01:50:58,407 --> 01:51:00,012
I'm trying to be thorough.

1979
01:51:01,013 --> 01:51:02,516
So, you wanna know

1980
01:51:02,516 --> 01:51:04,554
how many state police
were on the scene,

1981
01:51:04,554 --> 01:51:05,956
how many National Guard?

1982
01:51:05,956 --> 01:51:09,564
I can't tell if you're stupid
or smart,

1983
01:51:09,564 --> 01:51:12,567
but I'm willing
to find out.

1984
01:51:12,002 --> 01:51:13,972
Don't say another word.

1985
01:51:13,972 --> 01:51:15,576
Come on.

1986
01:51:15,576 --> 01:51:17,011
What's the point?

1987
01:51:17,011 --> 01:51:19,918
Coercive testimony
will be tossed.

1988
01:51:27,499 --> 01:51:29,474
Larry!

1989
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:36,083
Yo, you sure he's home?

1990
01:51:36,083 --> 01:51:37,322
Give him a minute.

1991
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:43,932
Man, what?
What's so important?

1992
01:51:43,932 --> 01:51:45,936
The record company
called, baby!

1993
01:51:45,936 --> 01:51:48,273
They wanna hear our music
at the studio!

1994
01:51:48,273 --> 01:51:49,643
Oh, and they called you?

1995
01:51:49,643 --> 01:51:51,213
Yeah, man. They said
they tried to call you

1996
01:51:51,213 --> 01:51:52,683
but you never
called them back.

1997
01:51:52,683 --> 01:51:53,751
This is what
we've been working for, man.

1998
01:51:54,752 --> 01:51:56,156
They wanna hear
The Dramatics!

1999
01:51:56,156 --> 01:51:59,196
So what?
You Mr. Show Business now?

2000
01:51:59,196 --> 01:52:01,199
This isn't professional.

2001
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,640
Call at business hours,
not 3:00 in the morning.

2002
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,876
But Larry...

2003
01:52:05,876 --> 01:52:07,846
Larry!
It's a record company, man.

2004
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:10,151
They don't keep banking hours.

2005
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:10,934
Come on.

2006
01:52:25,949 --> 01:52:28,353
<i>Listen, you guys
had better sound good</i>

2007
01:52:28,353 --> 01:52:29,590
<i> because I'm broke.</i>

2008
01:52:30,893 --> 01:52:32,897
Let me hear that blend.

2009
01:52:35,234 --> 01:52:36,705
Uh, yes, sir.

2010
01:52:36,705 --> 01:52:39,708
Are you guys ready?

2011
01:52:36,705 --> 01:52:39,443
Yeah.

2012
01:52:39,443 --> 01:52:43,050
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

2013
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:46,290

Uh, George,
can we get a minute?

2020
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,202
Come on.

2021
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,046
<i>Yeah, hurry back.</i>

2022
01:53:19,055 --> 01:53:20,926
Look, what is in your head,
man?

2023
01:53:20,926 --> 01:53:22,495
'Cause you ain't singin'
in there.

2024
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:24,566
How am I supposed to sing
with what happened to Fred?

2025
01:53:24,566 --> 01:53:26,136
Look, you just do it.

2026
01:53:26,136 --> 01:53:28,741
Sing while my boy
is lying dead?

2027
01:53:28,741 --> 01:53:31,446
Look, a song ain't words
on a page, man.

2028
01:53:31,446 --> 01:53:31,849
That ain't music.

2029
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,185
Music is what you put into it

2030
01:53:34,185 --> 01:53:34,855
and you can make that
whatever you want.

2031
01:53:35,856 --> 01:53:38,027
I'm not singing so white
motherfuckers can dance!

2032
01:53:38,027 --> 01:53:40,333
Well, them pale motherfuckers
ain't dancing for free!

2033
01:53:43,638 --> 01:53:45,846
Since when do you care
if white folks dance anyway?

2034
01:53:58,067 --> 01:54:00,270
<i>During the week
of rioting in Detroit,</i>

2035
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:02,910
<i> three negros were shot
to death in a motel room.</i>

2036
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:05,047
<i> Police and the Guardsmen
had raided the motel,</i>

2037
01:54:05,047 --> 01:54:06,917
<i> searching for snipers.</i>

2038
01:54:06,917 --> 01:54:08,487
<i> Later,
witnesses to the shootings</i>

2039
01:54:08,487 --> 01:54:10,825
<i> said the three negros
had been lined up</i>

2040
01:54:10,825 --> 01:54:14,199
<i> and shot in cold blood
by the officers.</i>

2041
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:16,671
<i> Today, two police officers
were arrested</i>

2042
01:54:16,671 --> 01:54:18,073
<i> and charged with the murders</i>

2043
01:54:18,073 --> 01:54:20,344
<i> of two of the negros
shot in the motel.</i>

2044
01:54:20,344 --> 01:54:22,549
<i> The officers,
one with two years' service,</i>

2045
01:54:22,549 --> 01:54:23,951
<i> the other with four</i>

2046
01:54:23,951 --> 01:54:25,989
<i> and no previous
misconduct charges,</i>

2047
01:54:25,989 --> 01:54:27,693
<i> were ordered
held without bail.</i>

2048
01:54:27,693 --> 01:54:29,962
<i> They pleaded not guilty.
Their attorney said</i>

2049
01:54:29,962 --> 01:54:32,268
<i> the arrests
were a shame and a pity.</i>

2050
01:54:32,268 --> 01:54:34,106
<i> Police Commissioner,
Ray Girardin,</i>

2051
01:54:34,106 --> 01:54:36,143
<i> refused to discuss
the facts of the case,</i>

2052
01:54:36,143 --> 01:54:38,615
<i> except to say
the two officers...</i>

2053
01:54:38,615 --> 01:54:40,251
Who do you got mail for?

2054
01:54:40,251 --> 01:54:42,254
Larry Cleveland Reed?

2055
01:54:42,254 --> 01:54:44,256
Larry!

2056
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:55,385
Larry, you got a letter.
From the government.

2057
01:55:00,892 --> 01:55:02,894
Thank you.

2058
01:55:00,892 --> 01:55:02,763
You're welcome.

2059
01:55:49,724 --> 01:55:52,061
<i>I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't do nothin'!</i>

2060
01:55:52,061 --> 01:55:54,063
<i>Lie down.</i>

2061
01:55:52,061 --> 01:55:53,631
<i>Please, man!</i>

2062
01:55:53,631 --> 01:55:55,769
<i>I will kill you
one by one</i>

2063
01:55:55,769 --> 01:56:00,378
<i> until you tell me
exactly what is going on here.</i>

2064
01:56:00,378 --> 01:56:03,551
<i> Don't look at me. Turn around.</i>

2065
01:56:03,551 --> 01:56:05,254
<i> Start praying!</i>

2066
01:56:05,254 --> 01:56:07,391
<i>Get down! Get up!</i>

2067
01:56:07,391 --> 01:56:09,930
<i> Get the fuck up! Get up!</i>

2068
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:12,269
<i> Bullshit!
Stop fucking lying to me!</i>

2069
01:56:12,269 --> 01:56:13,671
<i>Carl ain't got no gun.</i>

2070
01:56:13,671 --> 01:56:15,007
<i>One of the guests
is dead.</i>

2071
01:56:15,007 --> 01:56:16,577
<i>Please don't shoot.
Please.</i>

2072
01:56:16,577 --> 01:56:17,813
<i>Where's the gun?</i>

2073
01:56:17,813 --> 01:56:20,218
<i>Please don't shoot me,
man!</i>

2074
01:56:20,218 --> 01:56:22,122
<i>Officer,
can I say something?</i>

2075
01:56:22,122 --> 01:56:23,992
<i> I think you have
the wrong house.</i>

2076
01:56:23,992 --> 01:56:26,096
<i>In the Algiers Motel case,</i>

2077
01:56:26,096 --> 01:56:27,967
<i> both the prosecution
and the defense</i>

2078
01:56:27,967 --> 01:56:28,535
<i> in their opening statements</i>

2079
01:56:29,536 --> 01:56:32,743
<i> reminded the all-white jury
of the racial violence</i>

2080
01:56:32,743 --> 01:56:34,714
<i> that seared Detroit
two summers ago.</i>

2081
01:56:34,714 --> 01:56:37,118
<i>Now, Mr. Reed,
before the police</i>

2082
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:40,390
<i> or military personnel
started firing,</i>

2083
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:43,397
<i> to your knowledge, had there
been any sniper fire</i>

2084
01:56:43,397 --> 01:56:47,438
<i> from inside the Algiers Motel
or annex?</i>

2085
01:56:47,438 --> 01:56:49,008
No.

2086
01:56:49,008 --> 01:56:52,582
And did you see anyone
in the motel that night

2087
01:56:52,582 --> 01:56:54,052
with a gun of any kind
in their hand

2088
01:56:54,052 --> 01:56:56,527
outside of police officers
or military personnel?

2089
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:03,606
I saw someone shoot a toy gun
at one of his friends.

2090
01:57:05,608 --> 01:57:06,648
A toy gun.

2091
01:57:10,652 --> 01:57:12,557
Mr. Reed.

2092
01:57:13,558 --> 01:57:16,196
Isn't it a fact that your head

2093
01:57:16,196 --> 01:57:18,634
was against the wall
for most of the evening?

2094
01:57:18,634 --> 01:57:20,471
No, sir, it is not.

2095
01:57:20,471 --> 01:57:23,410
My hands were against the wall
for most of the evening.

2096
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:24,714
That's a fact.

2097
01:57:24,714 --> 01:57:25,549
I asked about your head.

2098
01:57:27,551 --> 01:57:31,393
My head is attached
to my neck.

2099
01:57:31,393 --> 01:57:34,800
It moves. This way, and that.

2100
01:57:37,238 --> 01:57:41,479
And yet, it cannot
turn completely around

2101
01:57:41,479 --> 01:57:43,251
to see what's behind you?

2102
01:57:44,252 --> 01:57:45,856
Unless you have
a special skill

2103
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,526
this courtroom
should know about?

2104
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:53,771
You said you saw the flash
before you heard the gunshot.

2105
01:57:53,771 --> 01:57:56,143
Was that your testimony?

2106
01:57:56,143 --> 01:57:57,980
Well, it was pretty confusing.

2107
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,382
Well, which is it?
Which came first?

2108
01:57:59,382 --> 01:58:00,719
Did you see the flash?

2109
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:02,689
When did you hear the body
hit the floor?

2110
01:58:02,689 --> 01:58:04,025
I can't say for sure.

2111
01:58:04,025 --> 01:58:06,130
You said you were
just outside the door.

2112
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:09,001
You also said
you might be confused,

2113
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:10,772
that you don't know
what point in time

2114
01:58:10,772 --> 01:58:11,840
these things happened.

2115
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:14,446
So, are you confused?

2116
01:58:14,446 --> 01:58:16,283
I saw the flash,
just through the door.

2117
01:58:16,283 --> 01:58:16,651
What I need to know is,

2118
01:58:17,652 --> 01:58:19,155
did you see Aubrey Pollard

2119
01:58:19,155 --> 01:58:21,059
make a threatening move
toward my client?

2120
01:58:21,059 --> 01:58:25,407
Or are you perhaps confused
on that point as well?

2121
01:58:32,414 --> 01:58:34,085
Yes, sir.

2122
01:58:34,085 --> 01:58:36,189
Being a military man,

2123
01:58:36,189 --> 01:58:37,960
you would be able
to distinguish

2124
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,964
between the uniforms
of a National Guardsman

2125
01:58:39,964 --> 01:58:41,567
and that
of a Detroit police officer.

2126
01:58:41,567 --> 01:58:42,803
Is that correct?

2127
01:58:42,803 --> 01:58:44,305
I suppose.

2128
01:58:44,305 --> 01:58:45,808
And so you say

2129
01:58:45,808 --> 01:58:47,411
that the man who took
one of the victims
into the room,

2130
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:49,750
that he was
a National Guardsman?

2131
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:51,252
So I presume
you know that because

2132
01:58:51,252 --> 01:58:53,725
he was wearing a uniform
of the National Guard.

2133
01:58:53,725 --> 01:58:55,762
Well, yes.
I saw a guy in uniform

2134
01:58:55,762 --> 01:58:57,532
take him back there.

2135
01:58:57,532 --> 01:58:59,771
Did you see anybody else
go back into that room?

2136
01:59:00,772 --> 01:59:02,442
No.

2137
01:59:02,442 --> 01:59:04,580
Would you have been
able to see

2138
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:06,985
if anybody else
went back into that room?

2139
01:59:06,985 --> 01:59:10,490
At the time, wasn't your head
turned back around

2140
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:11,627
by the police officers

2141
01:59:11,627 --> 01:59:12,731
that were still
standing there with you?

2142
01:59:15,734 --> 01:59:17,639
Yes.

2143
01:59:17,639 --> 01:59:19,008
And so in one of the lineups,

2144
01:59:19,008 --> 01:59:20,177
when you were
asked to identify

2145
01:59:20,177 --> 01:59:21,613
the officers who beat you,

2146
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,016
who did you identify?

2147
01:59:23,016 --> 01:59:26,490
Do you see him
here today in court?

2148
01:59:27,491 --> 01:59:27,828
Him.

2149
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,099
And him.

2150
01:59:32,702 --> 01:59:35,909
You just identified
two of the defendants.

2151
01:59:35,909 --> 01:59:37,879
Why would you identify
only one of them

2152
01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:39,115
at the time of the lineup

2153
01:59:39,115 --> 01:59:41,119
if both of them took part
in beating you?

2154
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,090
Which recollection
for the record

2155
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:44,627
would you say
is the correct recollection?

2156
01:59:44,627 --> 01:59:46,463
I just said
I couldn't tell at first.

2157
01:59:46,463 --> 01:59:48,635
When I went down to the police
station, I was very nervous.

2158
01:59:48,635 --> 01:59:51,406
And so now, you are calm?

2159
01:59:51,406 --> 01:59:54,513
And you will not be changing
your story again then?

2160
01:59:54,513 --> 01:59:56,416
This is it? This is the one
you want us to work with?

2161
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,886
Objection. Asked and answered.

2162
01:59:57,886 --> 01:59:59,188
Overruled.

2163
01:59:59,188 --> 01:59:59,724
<i>So you were led
into a room,</i>

2164
02:00:00,725 --> 00:59:59,258
<i> and then what happened?</i>

2165
02:00:04,667 --> 02:00:07,973
He fired off a shot
by my head and told me

2166
02:00:07,973 --> 02:00:10,612
to keep my mouth shut
and lay still.

2167
02:00:10,612 --> 02:00:12,281
Or the next one for real.

2168
02:00:12,281 --> 02:00:13,754
And what did you do?

2169
02:00:15,756 --> 02:00:17,291
I lie still.

2170
02:00:17,291 --> 02:00:19,898
And were you mistreated
in any way after that?

2171
02:00:20,899 --> 02:00:22,101
Mistreated?

2172
02:00:22,101 --> 02:00:23,942
Have you ever been
arrested, sir?

2173
02:00:27,946 --> 02:00:29,215
Sure.

2174
02:00:29,215 --> 02:00:31,020
Ever spent
a night in jail?

2175
02:00:33,022 --> 02:00:34,358
Yeah.

2176
02:00:34,358 --> 02:00:36,096
How many times
have you been arrested?

2177
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,098
I don't know.

2178
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:38,466
How many nights and days
have you spent

2179
02:00:38,466 --> 02:00:40,137
in prison for crimes
you've committed...

2180
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:41,339
I don't know, a few.

2181
02:00:41,339 --> 02:00:42,609
...or alleged
to have committed?

2182
02:00:42,609 --> 02:00:43,948
Criminal acts.

2183
02:00:46,951 --> 02:00:48,188
I don't know. A few.

2184
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,861
Are you certain?

2185
02:00:51,861 --> 02:00:54,365
Yeah, you don't forget
a beating like that.

2186
02:00:54,365 --> 02:00:57,137
So you're certain
that these three men

2187
02:00:57,137 --> 02:00:58,944
beat you and the others?

2188
02:01:00,946 --> 02:01:02,281
Yes, I'm certain.

2189
02:01:03,651 --> 02:01:05,722
Up until some army guy
pulled me in a room

2190
02:01:05,722 --> 02:01:07,057
and told me to lie still.

2191
02:01:07,057 --> 02:01:09,295
Then you heard him go out
and tell them I was dead.

2192
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:10,865
And this is
what's being referred to

2193
02:01:10,865 --> 02:01:12,101
as the "death game"?

2194
02:01:13,102 --> 02:01:13,907
What did you see next?

2195
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:18,413
I didn't see nothin' lying
face down on the floor,

2196
02:01:18,413 --> 02:01:20,317
but I heard Aubrey yell,
"Don't shoot."

2197
02:01:20,317 --> 02:01:22,220
And he shot. I heard that.

2198
02:01:27,566 --> 02:01:29,001
Your witness, council.

2199
02:01:29,001 --> 02:01:31,473
Now we've already
talked to your cohort about,

2200
02:01:31,473 --> 02:01:33,711
friend, Lee,
about his criminal past.

2201
02:01:33,711 --> 02:01:34,915
Have you ever had trouble
with the law?

2202
02:01:36,917 --> 02:01:38,688
I'm not on trial here.

2203
02:01:38,688 --> 02:01:40,291
No need to introduce
a new crime, sir.

2204
02:01:40,291 --> 02:01:41,596
Just the ones already known.

2205
02:01:43,598 --> 02:01:45,769
Or maybe you can start
by telling us,

2206
02:01:45,769 --> 02:01:47,371
how did the night begin?

2207
02:01:47,371 --> 02:01:48,708
Party? A few drinks?

2208
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:51,513
Man, why? Why y'all talking
about me at all?

2209
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,183
Man, y'all see
a black man in court

2210
02:01:53,183 --> 02:01:54,385
and assume
I'm the one on trial.

2211
02:01:54,385 --> 02:01:56,624
Man, they killed
my friends, man!

2212
02:01:56,624 --> 02:01:58,626
They beat us!

2213
02:01:58,126 --> 02:01:59,328
Lined us up and abused us

2214
02:01:59,328 --> 02:02:00,931
and y'all doing
the same thing!

2215
02:02:00,931 --> 02:02:03,771
There's no justice here, man.
Go fuck yourself, man.

2216
02:02:09,348 --> 02:02:11,350
Man, no, get off of me!

2217
02:02:09,348 --> 02:02:11,118
Take him out.

2218
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:12,254
This is bullshit!

2219
02:02:12,254 --> 02:02:14,727
What? What you lookin' at?

2220
02:02:15,728 --> 02:02:17,131
This is bullshit!

2221
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,705
I think what is clear here,
Your Honor,

2222
02:02:20,705 --> 02:02:24,078
is that these men were under
an intolerable situation.

2223
02:02:24,078 --> 02:02:26,916
They were under this duress,
which we say was inherent,

2224
02:02:26,916 --> 02:02:29,022
and for that reason,
had no other choice.

2225
02:02:29,022 --> 02:02:30,257
All right.

2226
02:02:30,257 --> 02:02:31,827
All they had to do
was keep quiet.

2227
02:02:31,827 --> 02:02:34,331
If they kept quiet,
they wouldn't be here today.

2228
02:02:34,331 --> 02:02:35,735
But they made a statement,

2229
02:02:35,735 --> 02:02:37,539
and that statement
should be admissible.

2230
02:02:37,539 --> 02:02:39,843
Not if they were
made under duress, Your Honor.

2231
02:02:39,843 --> 02:02:41,445
Not if the taking
of those statements

2232
02:02:41,445 --> 02:02:43,852
violates
constitutional rights.

2233
02:02:44,853 --> 02:02:48,694
These policemen
were owed an obligation.

2234
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:52,068
Advising them that they had
a right to remain silent,

2235
02:02:52,068 --> 02:02:53,638
they had a right to counsel,

2236
02:02:53,638 --> 02:02:56,075
and that anything they said
could be used against them

2237
02:02:56,075 --> 02:02:56,878
in a court of law.

2238
02:02:57,879 --> 02:02:59,482
I don't think
these defendants,

2239
02:02:59,482 --> 02:03:01,486
<i> because
they're police officers,</i>

2240
02:03:01,486 --> 02:03:04,659
<i> have any right to expect
anything more from us,</i>

2241
02:03:04,659 --> 02:03:06,564
<i> but they have a right
under the Constitution</i>

2242
02:03:06,564 --> 02:03:08,967
<i> not to settle
for anything less.</i>

2243
02:03:08,967 --> 02:03:13,545
I therefore rule
the statements inadmissible.

2244
02:03:13,545 --> 02:03:15,681
Wasn't that just
a load of bullshit.

2245
02:03:15,681 --> 02:03:16,682
Whew.

2246
02:03:16,951 --> 02:03:19,222
Wow, man.

2247
02:03:19,222 --> 02:03:20,490
That was...

2248
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:22,295
You know as well I do,

2249
02:03:22,295 --> 02:03:24,967
those kids shouldn't have been
killed like that.

2250
02:03:25,968 --> 02:03:28,176
Yeah. It's a shame.

2251
02:03:31,179 --> 02:03:33,050
Should've complied
with a lawful order

2252
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:35,323
and relinquish their weapons.

2253
02:03:37,325 --> 02:03:39,296
But you're
a solid guy though.

2254
02:03:40,297 --> 02:03:41,951
Really.

2255
02:04:36,343 --> 02:04:39,059
They know
what they're supposed to do.

2256
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:51,882
Jury entering. All rise.

2257
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:02,043
All rise.

2258
02:05:17,058 --> 02:05:20,397
Has the jury reached
a verdict in this matter,

2259
02:05:20,397 --> 02:05:22,134
with regard
to the charges of murder

2260
02:05:22,134 --> 02:05:24,305
in the first degree
and assault?

2261
02:05:24,305 --> 02:05:26,777
We have, Your Honor.

2262
02:05:26,777 --> 02:05:28,080
On the assault,

2263
02:05:29,081 --> 02:05:30,351
not guilty.

2264
02:05:35,762 --> 02:05:38,337
As to the murder charges,

2265
02:05:42,341 --> 02:05:44,343
not guilty.

2266
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:53,230
What we have witnessed today

2267
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:55,100
is a disappointment
to the justice system,

2268
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:56,670
to the state of Michigan.

2269
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:58,508
<i>Excuse me,
would you like to comment?</i>

2270
02:05:58,508 --> 02:06:00,812
This wouldn't have happened
if they had found black girls

2271
02:06:00,812 --> 02:06:02,448
in a hotel with white men.

2272
02:06:02,448 --> 02:06:04,520
<i> No, sir. No way
would they do this</i>

2273
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,155
<i> to white men.
That's the truth!</i>

2274
02:06:06,155 --> 02:06:08,093
And I don't care
who knows it!

2275
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:10,531
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Pollard, how do you feel
about losing your son?

2276
02:06:10,531 --> 02:06:11,834
How do you think he feels?

2277
02:06:11,834 --> 02:06:14,371
How would you feel?
How would you feel?

2278
02:06:14,371 --> 02:06:16,844
It's a terrible pain.

2279
02:06:16,844 --> 02:06:18,846
A pain that
never goes away.

2280
02:06:16,844 --> 02:06:18,848
Come on.

2281
02:06:18,848 --> 02:06:20,083
Thanks, man.

2282
02:06:20,083 --> 02:06:21,419
<i>Listen, sir,
will you conduct yourself</i>

2283
02:06:21,419 --> 02:06:22,656
<i> with a little bit of empathy?</i>

2284
02:06:22,656 --> 02:06:23,991
<i> We are here today to witness</i>

2285
02:06:23,991 --> 02:06:25,762
the justice system
at work and we demand

2286
02:06:25,762 --> 02:06:29,135
that police criminality
be treated the exact same way

2287
02:06:29,135 --> 02:06:30,738

of criminality.

2290
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:34,913
<i>Nice try.</i>

2291
02:06:34,913 --> 02:06:35,914
<i> You have my statement.</i>

2292
02:06:34,913 --> 02:06:35,616
<i>What a shame.</i>

2293
02:06:36,617 --> 02:06:38,587
<i>Police criminality
needs to be treated</i>

2294
02:06:38,587 --> 02:06:42,301

We have
a contract, Larry.

2307
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:51,837
We gotta snatch
this, brother.

2308
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,109
Not like this.

2309
02:07:56,109 --> 02:07:59,281
Look, Motown
is a black-only company.

2310
02:07:59,281 --> 02:08:01,318
Oh, but you know what I mean.

2311
02:08:01,318 --> 02:08:03,594
Who listens to this music?

2312
02:08:06,597 --> 02:08:08,505
This ain't easy for me, man.

2313
02:08:15,347 --> 02:08:16,788
We all a long way from easy.

2314
02:08:20,792 --> 02:08:23,230
Well, then you do
what you need.

2315
02:08:24,231 --> 02:08:25,002
I'm gonna lay low.

2316
02:08:27,004 --> 02:08:27,916
Come on, man.

2317
02:10:40,937 --> 02:10:42,939
Excuse me, brother.

2318
02:10:40,937 --> 02:10:43,309
Yes, son.

2319
02:10:43,309 --> 02:10:45,948
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

2320
02:10:45,948 --> 02:10:48,185
and I never heard
anything back.

2321
02:10:48,185 --> 02:10:51,527
Oh, um,
speak to the choirmaster.

2322
02:10:51,527 --> 02:10:53,533
Okay, thank you.

2323
02:10:56,035 --> 02:10:57,639
Excuse me.

2324
02:10:57,639 --> 02:10:59,576
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

2325
02:10:59,576 --> 02:11:01,613
and I never heard
anything back.

2326
02:11:01,613 --> 02:11:03,316
Larry Cleveland Reed.

2327
02:11:03,316 --> 02:11:04,954
Larry. Uh...

2328
02:11:04,954 --> 02:11:07,124
Oh, I remember.
You're with
The Dramatics, right?

2329
02:11:07,124 --> 02:11:08,326
Yes, sir.

2330
02:11:08,326 --> 02:11:09,796
You're a little bit
overqualified.

2331
02:11:09,796 --> 02:11:12,803
We're just
a neighborhood church.

2332
02:11:12,803 --> 02:11:15,541
Well, yeah,
I am overqualified. So?

2333
02:11:15,541 --> 02:11:17,713
Why don't you go try some
of those clubs downtown?

2334
02:11:17,713 --> 02:11:19,817
I'm sure they'd be happy
to have you.

2335
02:11:19,817 --> 02:11:22,321
And I guarantee you,
the pay will be much better.

2336
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:26,029
There's police
at those clubs downtown.

2337
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:29,037
And it's dangerous.

2338
02:11:31,039 --> 02:11:33,513
Sir, can you please help me?
I need a job.

2339
02:11:35,515 --> 02:11:38,655
Do you sing
any liturgical music?

2340
02:11:39,656 --> 02:11:41,431
<i>Yeah, I know something.</i>

2341
02:11:47,437 --> 02:11:49,676
Let me see if I...

2342
