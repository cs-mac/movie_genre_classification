[Episode 06]

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,930
Where's the body?

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,730
The capital is crawling with troops.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,200
If they find it first...

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,500
Easy. It's not that easy.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Good.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,470
Have some more.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,500
Here.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
How is you're not in danger?

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I made my way out
when I heard they were coming.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,070
I see.

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,330
I felt so bad about it.

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,500
I came here to try
and rescue Commander Ki.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,430
At least we ran into each other.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,500
I'll go reconnoiter. Wait here.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,400
How long do we have to wait?

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
Let's take him now...

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,370
What good will that do?

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,700
Finding Togon's body
is the important thing.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,500
'Finding...'
Since when do you give orders?

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,600
Shut up and listen.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Sungnyang will show me
where the body is.

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,500
He can't suspect anything
until I've confirmed it's Togon.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,270
Understood?

26
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,670
'Under...'
How dare you order me around?

27
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,100
Listen.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,370
I'll be a general soon.

29
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,400
And after finding Togon's body,
well, you see my point.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
What? How dare I?

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,470
Well.
See that Sungnyang doesn't get away.

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,170
What now?

33
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,200
What else? Come in.

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,500
So you were the traitor.

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Traitor?

36
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
We're just on different sides.

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,500
You, the ill-fated Koryo.
Me, the Yuan empire.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,470
Filthy Dog.

39
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,400
Dog?

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,500
Filthy?

41
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,730
Better an emperor's dog
than a village headman.

42
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,530
It's already been decided.

43
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,670
What has?

44
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,500
Koryo will cease to be,
it will become part of Yuan.

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,730
The court's decision was unanimous.

46
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,500
Because of your foul-up.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,100
You are to abdicate.

48
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,500
You will come to Daidu
and submit to Yuan justice.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Togon treated Koryo with disdain.

50
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,500
Because of that...

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I had him killed.

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,830
Sire.

53
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,530
What are you saying?

54
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,500
You admit it?

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I acted alone.

56
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,500
My court, my people,
they have done nothing..

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
There is no need to abdicate.

58
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Kill me now.

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Kill me and leave my people be.

60
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,730
- Sire.
- Sire.

61
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Open the gate.

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,500
I have Prince Togon's body!

63
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Sungnyang, it's up to you now.

64
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,570
Kill me now.

65
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,500
I alone am guilty.

66
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,600
Sire.

67
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,730
Your life isn't enough.

68
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,100
Regent.

69
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,270
I'll take him to our capital.

70
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,500
You and Wang Ko deal with things here.

71
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
Father.

72
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,770
Regent El Temur.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,570
I bring you the body of Togon.

74
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,500
Togon is in that coffin?

75
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
He should be bloated from the river.

77
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,070
He's in salt but still recognizable.

78
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,870
Check.

79
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,870
The stench.

80
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,500
Verify it's him.

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Bayan, you check.

82
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Rest in peace, Your Worship.

83
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I can't get the stench out of my nose.

84
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Your Worship, you're alive?

85
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Your Worship! You left us!

86
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,600
Your Worship.

87
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,370
- Your Worship!
- Your Worship!

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Sire, Togon is alive.

89
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,530
What are you talking about?

90
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,500
He isn't dead.

91
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,500
He's alive.

92
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,130
Silence! The corpse is right here!

93
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,630
Prince Togon.

94
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,500
El Temur.

95
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
You're alive.

96
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,130
Hail His Worship, all hail...

97
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Togon, what is all this?

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Well, um...

99
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm, er...

100
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Please, Your Worship.

101
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Tell him they are the ones
that tried to kill you.

102
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
No. You dare not.

103
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Go on. Did I try to kill you?

104
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Tell him, Your Worship.

105
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,500
The moment you do... you're dead.

106
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,500
It's all right. Go on now.

107
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,770
Who tried to kill whom?

108
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, the thing is...

109
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Prince, Prince!

110
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,470
Well? Look after him.

111
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,600
That's enough.

112
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,230
Sire, they can't look after him.

113
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,500
It's enough that we saw him alive.

114
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,170
Alive or dead, it's all the same to us.

115
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
You're alive.

116
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Thank you.

117
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Why won't he wake up?

118
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm not sure.
His internal energy is fine.

119
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,400
I've never seen anything like it.

120
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,500
Lord Zhang. Escort the doctor out.

121
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes, Regent.

122
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,370
Who checked the corpse?

123
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,600
Tangqishi...

124
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,670
told me and I told Bayan...

125
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,000
You....!

126
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,870
Kill me, Father.

127
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,030
Kill us.

128
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,500
Yes, I should.

129
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,770
You made me look the fool!

130
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,500
Please, Regent.

131
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,270
The problem is what to do now.

132
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,500
Once he awakes,
he'll name his attackers.

133
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,000
Better to kill him now.

134
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,500
What?

135
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,730
Kill him now?

136
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,470
After the Koryo king and
his court saw that he's alive?

137
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,030
Should we kill them too?

138
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,700
That's... maybe later...

139
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,500
Morons.

140
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
You never learn.

141
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm sorry, Father.

142
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Bayan.

143
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,670
No one comes in until Togon wakes up.

144
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,730
Yes, Regent.

145
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,330
Incompetent fools.

146
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,500
You can open your eyes.

147
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,500
Everyone is gone.

148
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
The Khan is dead.

149
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,500
You rule now.

150
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,700
You are the Emperor.

151
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,500
Not if El Temur has his way.

152
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,200
There may be a way to change his mind.

153
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Can we trust Togon?

154
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,930
Not to worry.

155
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,670
He gave me his word.

156
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,270
You've done it again.

157
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,500
Well done.

158
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,100
Any news of Commander Ki?

159
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,400
Don't take too long.

160
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,570
Commander.

161
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,170
It's Sungnyang.

162
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,500
It's me. Nyang.

163
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,030
Father.

164
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
It's me, Nyang.

165
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
It's me, Father.

166
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,870
Father... Father...

167
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,170
Yes, Father, it's Nyang.

168
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,970
Father.

169
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,370
Don't cry, sweetheart.

170
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:44,500
To see my little girl before I die
is all I could ask.

171
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,500
Father, be patient.

172
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,670
Once Togon wakes up
we'll get you out of here.

173
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:05,030
I'll get whoever did this to you.

174
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,570
Nyang.

175
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,200
Father... Father...

176
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Father.

177
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
Never.

178
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,870
Never?

179
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,630
I gave Sungnyang my word.

180
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,500
What's that got to do with...!

181
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,370
Sir.

182
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Sire, this is your life.
The fate of the empire.

183
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,700
What's a promise to some
Koryo scum compared to that?

184
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,500
You don't know.

185
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Sungnyang risked his life
to protect me.

186
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
'Sungnyang, Sungnyang!'

187
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Pull yourself together.

188
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:26,500
Sire, who do you think killed
your late father?

189
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,930
Only as Emperor can you
have your revenge.

190
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,430
Do you get it now?

191
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,270
Do you see what you have to do?

192
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,130
Father.

193
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,270
You!

194
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,270
Die! Die! Die!

195
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,500
You brought him here?

196
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,830
You spit in MY rice?

197
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,230
Sire, spare me, not that I deserve it.

198
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,500
Unhand me! Worthless..!

199
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,730
Sire!

200
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,830
Prince Togon is awake.

201
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,500
What?

202
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,500
Poor baby.

203
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,200
Talk down to me again...

204
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,030
and you're dead.

205
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,500
Sungnyang.

206
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,470
You're dead.

207
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,430
I'll kill you myself!

208
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,770
Your Worship.

209
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
It's time.

210
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,970
I'm so glad you're safe,
Your Worship.

211
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,500
Can you identify
who tried to kill you on Daechong?

212
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,000
I can.

213
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,770
Who was it?

214
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,500
Who tried to kill you?

215
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,370
Koryo... soldiers.

216
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,830
Your Worship.

217
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,170
They acted on the King's orders.

218
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,500
And tried to kill me.

219
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,730
Lies. Why are you doing this?

220
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,700
I saw it myself.

221
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,130
Ki Jaho... It was Ki Jaho.

222
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,500
Don't say that!

223
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,500
Take him away.

224
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,430
He did nothing.

225
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,200
Kill me instead.

226
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Your life is already in my hands.

227
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,970
You don't die until I say so.

228
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,430
Escort His Worship inside.

229
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
If you please.

230
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,500
Sungnyang.

231
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,500
Father...

232
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,400
Father.

233
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,900
H-He's dying.

234
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,500
H-Help us.

235
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,030
He's dying! Help us!

236
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,630
Help us...

237
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,970
Father.

238
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,830
I'm sorry, Sungnyang.

239
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,070
My little girl.

240
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,270
I failed your mother...

241
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,970
...failed you...

242
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,530
Father!

243
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:58,670
No, Father. Don't die.

244
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,970
Father! No, Father!

245
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,530
No!

246
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:17,500
Father, Father!

247
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,170
You can't die. Father, look at me!

248
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,500
Stay with me, stay with me...

249
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Father! Don't die...

250
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Father... Father! Look at me!

251
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,500
You sent for me?

252
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,170
What is it now?

253
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,800
Spare me, Regent El Temur.

254
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,500
If you need a fool, I'll act the fool.

255
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
A coward, I'll act the coward.

256
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Callous, I'll be callous.

257
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
A puppet...

258
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,870
I'll be your puppet.

259
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,170
Please, please don't abandon me.

260
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,000
Regent.

261
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,500
Which is the real Togon?

262
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,900
A simpering fool?

263
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,500
Or a viper waiting to strike?

264
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,130
Regent...

265
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,670
Get up.

266
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,270
The Emperor is dead.

267
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Is that true?

268
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,630
Never blubber,
never kneel to anyone again.

269
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,400
You rule now.
You are His Imperial Majesty.

270
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,900
There is only one ruler.

271
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,530
And El Temur will brook no other.

272
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,500
Assure him who the real ruler his.

273
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,830
You follow?

274
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,870
Rule? Never.

275
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,100
I am not the true ruler.

276
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,270
That's not my place, Regent.

277
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,500
What a fool.

278
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,570
Give him everything.

279
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,330
You...

280
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,500
should take the throne.

281
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,630
All that is mine is yours.

282
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,500
You should rule us all.

283
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Maybe he's the emperor
I've been looking for.

284
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,000
Right in front of me all along.

285
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,500
Then beg for your life.

286
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Just don't abandon me.

287
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,100
Spare me.

288
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,500
I just want an easy life.

289
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,570
You are under my protection.

290
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,500
Regent.

291
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,670
On one condition.

292
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,700
Anything.

293
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Name it. Anything you say.

294
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,830
Make my daughter Empress.

295
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,830
Making you my father-in-law?

296
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,970
Does that bother you?

297
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,500
Not at all.

298
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,130
I count myself blessed.

299
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,500
You have the Mandate of Heaven.

300
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,800
The heavens need your mandate, sir.

301
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,500
The Emperor of Heaven
speaks through me.

302
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Rest easy on your throne.

303
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Thank you, Regent.

304
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,900
Thank you, Regent.

305
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,500
Sungnyang, I can't die here.

306
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,030
I must live.

307
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,330
Live and exact my revenge.

308
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:57,130
I'll keep my word in some other way,
any other way.

309
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,500
Togon, I'll kill you.

310
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:10,800
You'll pay for my father and
Koryo somehow, some way.

311
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Men of Koryo.

312
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,530
Yes, Your Worship.

313
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:25,500
Your King tried to assassinate me.

314
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,930
And tried to conceal that fact.

315
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:45,430
For this crime he is stripped of
his crown and will be taken to Daidu.

316
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:52,500
Those involved in the rebellion
will be enslaved.

317
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,000
In honor of my coronation,

318
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Koryo will provide
200 women as concubines...

319
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,500
and 100 boys as eunuchs.

320
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,500
And 120 pounds of gold,
7500 pounds of silver...

321
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,530
and 100 stallions each year.

322
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:20,730
And... and...?

323
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,500
3,000 bolts...

324
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,270
Right, 3,000 bolts of silk,
100,000 sheets of parchment...

325
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,500
...1,000 inkstones...

326
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,500
And... otter... otter skins...?

327
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,700
10,000.

328
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Right, 10,000...

329
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,330
10,000 skins?
Do they have that many otters?

330
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,500
Sire.

331
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,370
They're not easy to trap.

332
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,500
And even if you get that many,
skinning them alone would be...

333
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Sire.

334
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,330
Koryo must obey your decree.

335
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,500
Even so, how can they?

336
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
You should have told me.

337
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,830
Memorizing it alone
has my head spinning.

338
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,500
No wonder he needs the parchment.

339
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,670
He's illiterate.

340
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,630
You mean he can't read?

341
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Regent.

342
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,830
You didn't mention
the next king of Koryo.

343
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,300
The Emperor will make his decree
from Daidu.

344
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
Be ready.

345
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,500
Your servant awaits your decree.

346
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,000
Do not forget me, Sire.

347
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,300
Come closer.

348
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,330
I'll remember.

349
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,500
How you tried to kill me.

350
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,770
It's burned into my bones.

351
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm not likely to forget.

352
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,100
What is it, Sire?

353
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,730
I'll be taking the concubines myself.

354
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,500
All the way to Yuan?

355
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Whatever his decree,
I'll see I'm named king of Koryo.

356
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,470
Or all of this will have been in vain.

357
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,170
Every woman here.

358
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,670
Sir.

359
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,800
You can thank your king for this.

360
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,500
This is what you get for trying
to kill the Emperor of Yuan.

361
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,530
Innocents taken
as concubines and slaves.

362
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,530
If you must blame someone,

363
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,500
blame your deposed king.

364
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,500
He will be one of the eunuchs.

365
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Yes, Sire.

366
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Betray me and
you're less than a dog, a pig.

367
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Enjoy your fate.

368
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,400
Your road to Yuan
will be a trip through hell.

369
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,870
Sire.

370
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,230
Sire, let us come with you.

371
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,630
I said no.

372
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,470
How can we let you go alone?

373
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,530
This is my final command.

374
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:54,500
I won't have you suffer because of me.

375
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,500
- Sire!
- Sire!

376
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:06,530
Serving me wasn't easy.

377
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,930
Thank you.

378
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:53,500
Any stragglers or loafers
will be severely punished.

379
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Remember that.

380
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,600
Let Sungnyang go.

381
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,500
He saved your Emperor.
There's no reason for this.

382
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,400
Silence!

383
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Wait. Don't forget what Father said.

384
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,970
Remember.
Show him every courtesy as king.

385
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,500
Father, he's going to die anyway...

386
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,670
Since when do you question me?

387
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,500
Your pardon.

388
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
May I ask why you're protecting him?

389
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,270
I've faced fierce men
on the battlefield.

390
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,500
But never one with such heart.

391
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
To face death with such pride.

392
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,000
It's a shame he has to die.

393
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,500
I'm not a merciful man.

394
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Now shut up and stay in line.

395
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,030
Sire, I'll be fine.

396
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,200
The boat won't sink.

397
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
What's bothering you?

398
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm ashamed of myself.

399
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,130
Sungnyang again?

400
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm only emperor
because he kept me alive.

401
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,500
This is how I repay him.

402
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
You already ordered
that his life be spared.

403
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,800
He's probably relaxing at home
even as we speak.

404
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,870
Oh, Sire, I have a niece.

405
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,200
You'll like her.

406
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm pretty picky.

407
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,870
Her beauty would make Buddha smile,
if I say so myself.

408
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,500
Oh?

409
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,070
Then bring her to the palace.

410
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,570
[The Koryo Border]

411
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,070
Move it along! Move it!

412
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,530
Time's a-wastin'! Move!

413
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:47,000
Fall behind and die. Get up!

414
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
Move!

415
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,170
I said move!

416
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,230
Shall we make camp?

417
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,070
The women are hurt.

418
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,370
At this rate, half will be dead
before we reach Daidu.

419
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,570
Silence.

420
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,500
How dare you...

421
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,200
Stop here.

422
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,500
Sir.

423
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,030
His High-n-Mighty wants to rest.

424
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,130
Make camp.

425
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,500
Water. Drink.

426
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,700
Leftovers. Share it out.

427
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Let's go.

428
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
What is this?

429
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
You have to ask?

430
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Whose fault is this anyway?

431
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Don't try it if you can't do it.

432
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Why try to kill the Emperor anyway?

433
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,670
He gave you his own food.

434
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,500
Don't be like this.

435
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Let's go.

436
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,200
Come on.

437
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,370
Wait.

438
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,570
Leave it.

439
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,300
They're not wrong.

440
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,500
Sire.

441
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,430
Get all the women.

442
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,500
Sir.

443
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,570
What is this?

444
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:33,970
They're slowing us down.
My brother says kill them.

445
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,400
Well? Get them.

446
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,500
Sir.

447
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Move out.

448
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,770
No one touches my people.

449
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,470
Are you so eager to die?

450
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
This is Yuan territory.

451
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,100
Those who disobey me die.

452
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,270
Have them stand down.

453
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,500
No more special treatment.

454
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,000
- Take him.
- Sir.

455
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,330
I will kill anyone that enters this tent.

456
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
You think you're the only killer here?

457
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Just the sight of you makes me sick.

458
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,500
Last chance.

459
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,330
Stand down.

460
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Sire.

461
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,030
Don't shoot!

462
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,600
You want to die with him.

463
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,430
Fair enough.

464
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,870
Move.

465
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,030
Never.

466
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:11,500
I hate everything about him.

467
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,000
Enough.

468
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,170
Wang Ko.

469
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,070
El Temur will be furious.

470
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,300
He's right.

471
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,500
He's not worth it.

472
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,730
Sire.

473
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,070
He's still breathing.

474
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,000
Step up the pace.

475
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,170
Kill anyone that slows us down.

476
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,130
Sir.

477
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,730
He hasn't fallen behind yet.

478
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,300
I'll help him.

479
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,370
You?

480
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:03,500
We won't break ranks.

481
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,430
Fall behind and
you'll have to kill him to survive.

482
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,500
Can you do that?

483
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,930
I need a stretcher.

484
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,970
Hang on, Sungnyang.

485
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,300
I'll save you somehow.

486
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,370
His Imperial Majesty.

487
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,500
Sire.

488
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,230
There you are.

489
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,230
Mother.

490
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,500
Poor boy. But you made it.

491
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Come to the palace.
The court is waiting.

492
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,400
Sire, your throne.

493
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,170
If you please.

494
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,800
It is your throne now.

495
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,500
Pay your respects.

496
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,600
You have a new Emperor.

497
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,500
Hail the new Emperor.

498
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,500
Hail the new Emperor!

499
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Hail the Emperor. Hail the Empire!

500
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:27,500
All hail! All hail!

501
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:34,700
Hail the Emperor.

502
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:42,900
Hail the Empire!

503
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,870
We must have a coronation.

504
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,500
See to it.

505
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,500
Empress Dowager.

506
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,700
Before that...

507
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,500
there is the wedding.

508
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
The wedding?

509
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:01,500
His Majesty has chosen
my daughter as his empress.

510
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,330
Sire, is this true?

511
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,570
Tanasiri is supposed to be quite lovely.

512
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,500
With El Temur as my father-in-law,

513
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,500
I can have my cake and eat it too.

514
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,670
That is Inner Court business.

515
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,330
You chose an empress
without consulting me?

516
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:20,930
I just...

517
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,500
Sire, I have never seen this Tanasiri.

518
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
Empress Dowager cannot be ignored.

519
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Do you have something
against my daughter?

520
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,770
Perhaps you mean to insult me?

521
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,930
Is that it?

522
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,500
The imperial house has rules.

523
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,270
They'll be followed. In time.

524
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,770
Shall we?

525
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,500
Now he shows his claws.

526
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,500
I won't have it, not if it kills me.

527
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,270
El Temur holds the court
and the military in his hand.

528
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,800
I was the late Emperor's favorite.

529
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
I will not be bullied.

530
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,500
Why didn't you tell me
you're marrying El Temur's daughter?

531
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,070
You never asked.

532
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,500
I saved your life.

533
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
We should have discussed it.

534
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,700
Sure, later, you bet.

535
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,030
Now when are you bringing over
this niece of yours?

536
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,470
Never mind.

537
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,270
Never mind?
I need imperial concubines.

538
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,830
I won't have Tanasiri kill her, thanks.

539
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:48,500
Have you heard about Tanasiri?

540
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,570
Tell me about her.

541
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,570
A real hellcat.

542
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,500
Hellcat?

543
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,400
Haughty. And jealous.

544
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,530
Worse, consider who her father is,
she's an unbridled colt.

545
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,870
An unbridled hellcat colt.

546
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:07,500
El Temur by day. Tanasiri by night.

547
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Lucky you.

548
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Just my luck. No one's to blame.

549
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,830
Sire, pull yourself together.

550
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,500
You're the Emperor now.

551
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,430
I liked Daechong better,
with Sungnyang.

552
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,500
I was hoping for a place
in the imperial family.

553
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,970
A dog barking at
chickens on the roof, huh?

554
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,130
It's his early days.

555
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,870
Don't rush it.

556
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:39,470
Don't this, don't that,
I should have known better.

557
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,800
Follow me.

558
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,500
Bayan.

559
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,500
The Turks are making trouble
on our Northwestern border.

560
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,670
Take care of it.

561
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,230
The border?

562
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,800
Do you suspect me of something?

563
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,470
Half of politics is suspicion.

564
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,030
The other half is confirmation.

565
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:22,100
Let the heavens bear witness,
I will never betray you.

566
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,030
Trust me, Regent.

567
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,500
Root out the Turk problem.

568
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,770
And don't come back till you do.

569
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,770
Odd. Very odd.

570
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,370
What is?

571
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,500
That Sungnyang.
He smells like a girl.

572
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Well,
maybe you've gone too long without.

573
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,100
Look at him.

574
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,000
He's prettier than most women I know.

575
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,900
Take a break.

576
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,700
Break time!

577
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,500
Sungnyang...

578
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,500
Please.

579
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,830
His fever is rising.

580
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,430
Water, please.

581
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,800
Thirsty?

582
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,500
It's for the King.

583
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Give it to me.

584
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,630
Sure. Here.

585
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,330
Lap it up like a dog.

586
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:04,000
Yom,
I'll tear your heart out and eat it.

587
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,300
You can't die.

588
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,670
Stay. Stay with us.

589
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,500
Hold it.

590
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,930
Wait, he's Commander Ki's...

591
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,670
You know this dog?

592
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,070
What are you doing here?

593
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,430
What are YOU doing here?

594
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,070
Is Tanasiri as bad as all that?

595
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,430
The entire staff is worried
about her coming.

596
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,930
That's all the staff does is fuss.

597
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,930
Does he have all his teeth?

598
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,500
Would I do that to you?

599
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,770
I heard he's deformed.

600
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,730
Hush. Enough.

601
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,230
You just want me to be Empress.

602
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,000
You're selling me off.

603
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,670
Will you hush? We're here.

604
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:27,470
Beautiful or not,
I hate temperamental women.

605
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,700
A man should be manly.

606
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,630
Who wants a coward and a fool?

607
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,430
I wish...

608
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,830
I said hush.

609
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,500
Halt.

610
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,800
Your Imperial Majesty.

611
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,470
Welcome, Regent.

612
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,500
It's His Majesty. Pay your respects.

613
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,500
Your servant, Your Imperial Majesty.

614
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,770
I have heard so much about you.

615
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:52,500
You are as noble and dignified
as I heard.

616
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,500
People really say that?

617
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,500
Get up, get up.

618
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,230
What's your problem?

619
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,300
I was right.

620
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:49,870
A girl's scent. You're a girl.

621
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,800
Not likely.

622
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,370
Sungnyang is a woman.

623
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,800
You'll be my concubine in Daidu.

624
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,500
Tanasiri must be trained.

625
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
And she will fail.

626
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,200
If you do not learn,
you cannot be Empress.

627
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,500
Again, again, again.

628
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,570
I can't, I can't, I won't.

629
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,500
What will you do to Sungnyang?

630
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,830
As my slave, anything I want.

631
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,400
Were you never tempted?

632
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,500
Even now I can't stop my heart
from pounding.

633
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Why is that?

634
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
Your life is in my hands.

635
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,130
Mine!

636
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,570
Don't, Sire.

637
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,500
Let go. I'll kill him!
