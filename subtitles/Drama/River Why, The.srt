00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,145
Over the mountains, over the oceans.

7
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:22,083
Over the obstacles, facing the dangers.

8
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,447
I still have to catch up, I still have to fly.

9
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:29,545
I am not afraid no matter how dangerous it is on the way.

10
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:33,577
Before dawn, I have to be ready.

11
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:37,326
Going forward on the roads. Being able to see my destination.

12
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:41,155
I won't regret. I am definitely right.

13
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:48,406
I want  an exciting  tomorrow.

14
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:52,111
Because of you, I will not back away.

15
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,845
I want to see my achievement progressing slowly.

16
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:59,752
Because love can make a dream fly.

17
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:03,340
No matter how much longer the road ahead of me is, I will overcome it all.

18
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,680
Every time I close my eyes,

19
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:10,655
I can only think of you, smiling at me.

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,669
I have surpassed it. Everything went smoothly.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,076
Just need one more step, and I can reach my destination.

Sayings of the ancient people

28
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,711
really come true,

29
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:19,630
in life, 8 or 9 times out of 10.

30
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,251
The more the Good Family Virgin Girl doesn't want to see Miss Elegant,

31
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:25,013
the more likely it is that they'll meet.

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,926
How strange!

33
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:41,546
The master is not here,

34
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,668
yet you still come without notice.

35
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,870
Your suspicions are out of control again.

36
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,204
Not going to wait for Huo Da?

37
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,653
Leaving in such a rush

38
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,295
makes it seem even more suspicious.

39
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,587
Feels like you're sneaking around.

40
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,206
Are you trying to say

41
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:01,453
that I am a thief?

42
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,516
Jia Di isn't.

43
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:12,913
Precious Ah Xin,

44
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:13,830
why are you here?

45
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:15,765
Huo Da, you're back.

46
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:17,934
Were classes tiring this morning?

47
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,646
Yan Shu has already helped me find

48
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,675
a really good tutor.

49
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:25,937
Oh! that's great.

50
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,480
I came today

51
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,366
to render the last of my services.

52
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,251
Let's just say I accepted your three good deeds.

53
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:46,388
I'll give you some advice.

54
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,369
What advice?

55
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,381
Student Liu has arrived.

56
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,473
You still can be saved.

57
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:56,012
Good luck.

58
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:57,307
Bye.

59
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,209
Huo Da,

60
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,511
I helped you find the class' top student

61
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,978
to assist you in taking the exams.

62
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:10,588
Huo Da,

63
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:12,159
you're so popular.

64
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:15,531
At first, I thought that I was getting lucky with my love life...

65
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:18,197
Please help! Please!

66
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,844
But her coming to find me...

67
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,342
Was it also because of you?

68
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,910
With the support of the King of Awards,

69
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:33,797
I think you'll do fine on your exams.

70
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:35,420
Work hard!

71
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,198
I can return these to you.

72
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:38,993
Thank you.

73
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,194
Thanks for opening the door for me.

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,144
No problem.

75
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:42,613
What did you borrow his notes for?

76
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:47,456
Bo Zi,

77
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:49,422
don't you ever dare to

78
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:51,294
randomly let strangers in.

79
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:53,327
Let's not have this happen again.

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,133
But Liang Jia... Di

81
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,115
isn't a stranger.

82
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:05,989
Student Liu,

83
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,214
until the exams are held,

84
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,435
I'll leave Huo Da in your care.

85
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,773
No problem!

86
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,362
"What are the four P's in advertising?"

87
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:39,089
"If you can't even answer this question,

88
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:40,447
you don't have the right to watch TV."

89
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,429
Playing while working isn't bad,

90
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,506
but make time for both models and studying

91
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:03,908
so that you can succeed in both.

92
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,461
Writing these,

93
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,380
probably took a long time.

94
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,795
Getting my house all covered with these,

95
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:08,790
it looks awful.

96
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,254
Wow, doesn't she need to study for exams?

97
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,485
She used all her time on you!

98
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,838
And these are my notes from the whole semester.

99
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,134
She copied them all out,

100
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:29,998
and didn't even miss a single word.

101
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:32,002
"Studied this page?"

102
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,218
"You're very serious."

103
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,006
"Continue working hard!"

104
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,248
Huo Yan,

105
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,618
I'm at Huo Da's place.

106
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:53,397
I have already solved his problem.

107
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,818
How so?

108
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,734
The top student in Huo Da's class,

109
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,918
will start to tutor him from now on.

110
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,695
Being in the same class,

111
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,176
will make it more beneficial.

112
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,669
As for this Ms.Tong,

113
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:10,276
I've already talked to her.

114
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:11,959
What did you say to her?

115
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,613
I spoke truthfully.

116
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:14,851
What does that mean?

117
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,843
From the very beginning,

118
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,420
I haven't trusted her.

119
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:21,070
You don't have to make it sound so serious.

120
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,880
I don't ever want to see that girl again.

121
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,254
She's like a cockroach,

122
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:25,844
continuously interrupting our lives.

123
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,839
She didn't.

124
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:31,386
The relationship between Huo Da and her is very pure.

125
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,863
The one making me worry isn't Huo Da...

126
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:34,767
-Thanks. -It's you.

127
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,625
I cannot stand

128
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,993
the fact that you and Tong Jia Di

129
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,568
have this special thing going on.

130
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:44,095
I helped Huo Da find a tutor,

131
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,579
just to avoid seeing her again.

132
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,379
I don't want her to find any reason

133
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:50,939
to appear beside you again.

134
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,341
Huo Yan,

135
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,727
everything I've done

136
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,957
isn't for Huo Da.

137
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,861
It's for you.

138
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:16,418
Huo Da.

139
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,708
Don't misunderstand this.

140
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,702
Classmate, sorry for wasting your time today.

141
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:24,073
But,

142
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,087
because I am

143
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:26,726
naturally evil,

144
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,346
sitting beside you is very uncomfortable.

145
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:30,971
So?

146
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:33,371
So clean your things up,

147
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,292
drink a bit,

148
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,195
and leave.

149
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,724
-But... -There's no buts.

150
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,221
Didn't you hear me? Just Leave!

151
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,978
Even god wants to diffuse my anger.

152
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,585
This rain,

153
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,925
I don't think it'll stop anytime soon.

154
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,936
Let me entertain myself.

155
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,917
From this point on, the 10th guy who walks past,

156
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:47,616
I must...

157
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,260
I must go under his umbrella,

158
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,141
and have him take me to the station.

159
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,510
That Devil and Xiao Nan have

160
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,912
trained me to become so oblivious to humiliation.

161
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:03,251
I could even withstand

162
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:05,374
Miss Yan Shu's suspicions.

163
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,202
The 10th guy.

164
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,346
Hello? Jia Di?

165
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,168
It's me.

166
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,574
I know.

167
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,711
The 10th guy.

168
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,586
Let me tell you,

169
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:26,847
you probably won't have to worry, as

170
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,860
your brother will do fine on his exams.

171
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:30,291
This is because Miss Yan Shu

172
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:33,211
helped him find our class' top student to be his tutor.

173
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,851
That guy is really good!

174
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,639
If I were Huo Da,

175
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,904
what I would really need isn't some top tutor.

176
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:41,466
But rather someone who

177
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,776
would care for me as a friend.

178
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,706
This...

179
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,535
Miss Yan Shu can do this better than me.

180
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,687
Because...

181
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,416
I can only use silly methods.

182
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,687
I tried really hard

183
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,461
to get your classmate, Liu to help tutor you.

184
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,488
And you just kicked him out.

185
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,791
When will you be able to

186
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,824
understand other people's feelings?

187
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:12,759
When then, will you be able to

188
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:15,741
understand the feelings that I have for you?

189
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,805
We've known each other since childhood,

190
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,629
you're just like my little brother.

191
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,888
Our relationship is that of good friends,

192
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,759
caring for you,

193
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,571
being good to you,

194
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:35,271
it's a given.

195
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,826
Plus Huo Yan is so busy,

196
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,202
so taking care of you,

197
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,635
is also helping him.

198
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:44,084
Must the relationship between us

199
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,550
always include Huo Yan?

200
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,603
Don't force me.

201
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,175
This question has no answer.

202
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,581
To me,

203
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,479
you and Huo Yan are both equally important.

204
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,206
It's different.

205
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,321
In front of Huo Yan,

206
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,011
I am just a tool that you use to get closer to him.

207
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:11,802
In front of me,

208
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:15,042
Huo Yan becomes your protection.

209
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:24,113
Some feelings are true,

210
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,098
just like those of Precious Ah Xin.

211
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,049
Other feelings are fake,

212
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,089
and carry ambition.

213
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,348
Why?

214
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,828
Even our precious memories from childhood,

215
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,294
you use them for your own ambitions.

216
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,109
Huo Da!

217
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,429
Not studying?

218
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,510
What are you calling me for?

219
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:23,862
I should be asking you what you're doing!

220
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,092
I...

221
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,463
I'm eating Pork Rice.

222
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:30,430
Eating a lot.

223
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,784
To celebrate the end of our exchange coupons.

224
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,649
Hey. Listen up.

225
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,678
If you fail on your exams,

226
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,222
I'll teach you a really big lesson!

227
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,746
Pork rice, is it good?

228
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:50,131
It's very good.

229
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:51,489
It smells nice too.

230
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,671
Fool.

231
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,141
You must pass.

232
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:58,937
Once you pass,

233
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,811
if you call me a fool,

234
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:00,903
people will believe you.

235
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,899
I will for sure.

236
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,677
You better.

237
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:07,048
Don't suddenly give up half way.

238
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,624
I'll laugh at you if you do.

239
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:09,950
Like this

240
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,965
Hahahaha...

241
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,334
So humiliating.

242
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:17,797
Are you full?

243
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,715
If you're full, I'll come pick you up.

244
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,119
What for?

245
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,179
Why aren't you focusing on your studies?

246
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,395
Picking me up,

247
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,956
it's a waste of time.

248
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,879
Don't talk so much nonsense.

249
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:32,744
Hello? What a jerk.

250
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59,580
Are you full?

251
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,544
If you're full, I'll come pick you up.

252
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,115
What for?

253
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,111
Why aren't you focusing on your studies?

254
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:06,548
Picking me up,

255
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:07,780
it's a waste of time.

256
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,793
Don't talk so much nonsense.

257
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:14,565
Hello? What a jerk.

258
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,005
Why are you treating yourself like this?

259
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,306
Look, your hands are so cold.

260
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:42,317
Get in the car.

261
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,255
I'll give you a ride home.

262
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,728
I thought

263
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:43,955
you already left.

264
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:46,950
Why did you let yourself get soaked like this?

265
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,569
Ever since we were children,

266
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,080
you've been like my little brother.

267
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,340
Being good friends,

268
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,337
caring for you,

269
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,429
taking care of you,

270
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,437
It's always been this way.

271
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,994
Now,

272
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,695
you even refuse

273
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,519
my sincerity,

274
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,829
mistrusting me.

275
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,965
In your eyes,

276
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,884
there is a lot of suspicion.

277
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,535
Why has it come to this?

278
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,515
Who is the one changing?

279
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:49,941
I'm not your little brother.

280
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:52,735
Saying I'm your little brother,

281
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,014
is just an excuse.

282
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,476
But I won't just stand

283
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,710
pretending and lying to myself.

284
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,111
Friendship, relationship,

285
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,776
they're all your perfect protection.

286
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,443
Protecting yourself,

287
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,569
and yet wanting to have this confusing bond with me.

288
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:09,942
Huo Da, you...

289
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,377
I refuse to continue acting like this.

290
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,724
From now on,

291
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,552
please don't question me,

292
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,875
or in front of others,

293
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,123
show that you

294
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:23,106
care for me.

295
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:24,760
Because,

296
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:26,035
either,

297
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,255
I get all of your feelings.

298
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:29,390
Or,

299
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,480
the relationship between us

300
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:31,605
is zero.

301
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,060
To me, you

302
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:41,854
are very important.

303
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,238
-But if there was no Huo Ya... -There are no ifs!

304
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:45,613
I accept zero.

305
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,207
I understand.

306
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:57,249
If that is your decision...

307
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,928
I'll try to accept it.

308
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:40,727
CEO,

309
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,597
thanks for driving me home.

310
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,204
Jia Di!

311
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,200
Huo Yan,

312
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,012
everything I've done

313
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,571
isn't for Huo Da.

314
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,614
It's for you.

315
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,594
There are no ifs!

316
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:26,764
I accept zero.

317
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,423
If that is your decision...

318
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:31,993
I'll try to accept it.

319
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,792
I knew that a rotten strawberry like you

320
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,550
would turn crazy while studying,

321
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:41,975
and try to destroy your books.

322
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:48,866
The strong rubber band won't allow you to deny my existence!

323
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,269
I'm very smart.

324
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,154
I demand you to pick up those books in 10 seconds,

325
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,932
and apologize sincerely to it.

326
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,147
Say "I'm wrong" three times,

327
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:00,143
Or else this house

328
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,425
will automatically explode.

329
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,777
10...9...

330
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:05,995
The fool skipped 2.

331
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,563
Facing a tough situation,

332
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,310
and want to drink beer like you usually do?

333
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:17,271
Please think again before you open the fridge!

334
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:21,004
There are only 2 choices.

335
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,105
Milk will allow you to drink and fight again

336
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,914
or beer will allow you to drink and get confused.

337
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:26,398
This is a once in a lifetime choice...

338
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:27,586
Please make it wisely!

339
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:37,007
My dear master,

340
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,694
please let me live a day longer!

341
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,241
Once you've passed your exams,

342
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,858
then with your cute tutor,

343
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:44,432
drink me ,and celebrate together.

344
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:47,916
A fool a million times over.

345
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,483
Work hard!

346
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:51,980
Precious Ah Xin.

347
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,540
Why are you back?

348
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,761
Study!

349
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,978
I must use the best of my abilities

350
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,195
and the best of my skills

351
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:02,070
to raise your exam battle energy

352
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:03,316
up to 100%!

353
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:06,156
Work hard!

354
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,391
Huo Da work hard!

355
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,666
Spirits of the heavens, spirits of the earth...

356
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:12,117
isn't it funny?

357
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:14,144
There's the Devil inside, no entrance for sleep.

358
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:22,565
You pig!

359
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:23,720
Wake up!

360
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,406
I knew you couldn't last until this page.

361
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:45,613
I... think I just had a dream.

362
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,859
This is the last of my notes.

363
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,357
Don't waste your life.

364
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,136
You can't waste any of it.

365
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:58,665
All of us humans,

366
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,582
are working hard to live.

367
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:04,156
You, who views life as garbage,

368
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,543
probably feels very lonely.

369
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,199
But inspite of your loneliness,

370
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,571
I can still see through you.

371
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:13,630
Because,

372
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,247
I have seen in you before,

373
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:18,148
the one who loves to race,

374
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:21,086
the one who seriously loves Miss Yan Shu,

375
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:22,642
and even...

376
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,280
the one who makes me smile,

377
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:26,807
and helped me wipe away my tears.

378
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,445
I believe that,

379
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:31,393
there are still things that are worth you being serious about.

380
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:32,609
This world,

381
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,778
probably isn't that bad,

382
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,280
right?

383
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,839
So...

384
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:40,472
this time, be serious for yourself

385
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,909
okay?

386
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,579
Winter holidays!!!

387
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:53,193
Whoah! So many things happened

388
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:54,316
to you in one day.

389
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,459
The 10th guy stayed at your house for the night.

390
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:58,684
And then?

391
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,026
Spill it!

392
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,772
I thought I already told you,

393
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,861
it's not possible between the 10th guy and me.

394
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,766
Did you?

395
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:09,193
I really don't understand.

396
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,795
The 10th guy is already

397
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,543
so great to you.

398
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,498
Tong Jia Di,

399
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,038
what on earth are you so frustrated about?

400
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,695
-I don't like the 10th guy anymore. -Liar.

401
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:20,283
I didn't.

402
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,069
Then why are you blushing?

403
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,419
I...

404
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:28,103
It's from yesterday's fever.

405
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:28,831
Right.

406
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,282
The fever burnt your head.

407
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,749
Why don't you like the 10th guy?

408
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:43,032
Right...

409
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,494
why?

410
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:45,477
After that night,

411
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:46,709
what happened?

412
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:49,470
I really want to know too.

413
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,659
That time...

414
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:05,102
I realize...

415
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:10,503
I think I fell in love with you...

416
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:12,938
Devil.

417
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:18,377
Was I dreaming,

418
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,780
or did I really say something like that?

419
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,837
The fever has really fried my brain.

420
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:28,849
If you don't give me a reason,

421
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,873
I won't allow you to not like the 10th guy.

422
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:33,603
If I don't like him, then I don't like him.

423
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,679
That's not true.

424
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,193
You're just running away again.

425
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,208
Whether you permit it or not,

426
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,560
I've already said my goodbyes to those two brothers.

427
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:43,182
Tong Jia Di,

428
00:27:43,243 --> 00:27:44,772
don't go overboard.

429
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,914
When I said I liked Devil,

430
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,876
that's the time when I ended it with the 10th guy.

431
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,105
Even if it was only in my dream.

432
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,037
I'm okay.

433
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:10,192
Whatever it was,

434
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,822
At least I had some really great memories.

435
00:28:16,973 --> 00:28:18,906
That's really awesome!

436
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:20,404
If I think about it,

437
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,087
it was really happy.

438
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:23,211
What memories?

439
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,728
If it's past, then they're memories.

440
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,271
The story hasn't ended yet.

441
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,994
Take it?

442
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:36,053
What?

443
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,626
"Happiness" Exchange Coupon.

444
00:28:37,703 --> 00:28:39,871
Tong Jia Di, you have to be happy.

445
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,276
If that isn't enough,

446
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,766
"Forever Smiling" Exchange Coupon.

447
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:53,787
"God, Give me Love" Exchange Coupon.

448
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:56,907
"Moon God plus God of Love,

449
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:58,518
West-East combined together" Exchange Coupon.

450
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,548
"Bravery" Exchange Coupon.

451
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:13,225
<i>Love really needs bravery</i>

452
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,302
<i>to face fake rumors.</i>

453
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:20,167
<i>Only your eyes make sure</i>

454
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:23,304
<i>that when I have love, it's worth it.</i>

455
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,016
Xiao Nan,

456
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,763
you're so good to me.

457
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,074
Having you is enough.

458
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:32,382
Don't be like this.

459
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,005
This "friendship" Exchange Coupon

460
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:36,426
is only for when every other Exchange Coupon doesn't work,

461
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,514
then we use the ultimate secret weapon.

462
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:39,964
You're exchanging it too early.

463
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:41,108
I don't care.

464
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,648
I want to exchange it now.

465
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,893
Jia Di,

466
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:47,358
promise me,

467
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:49,624
try using these exchange coupons.

468
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,568
If working hard isn't enough,

469
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,879
I'll be here by your side.

470
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,749
I...

471
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:01,586
Well...

472
00:30:02,474 --> 00:30:04,706
I don't like the 10th guy,

473
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,107
it's because I think...

474
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:08,667
What?

475
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,600
How to say it?

476
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:15,829
Listen.

477
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:17,562
My heart beats rapidly,

478
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:19,713
and I am not thinking right anymore,

479
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,194
it is all messed up.

480
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:22,727
The universities now are so open.

481
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,819
It's really messed up.

482
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,147
Listen.

483
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:44,144
My heart beats rapidly,

484
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,279
and I'm not thinking right anymore,

485
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,574
it's all messed up.

486
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:49,167
The universities these days are so open-minded.

487
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,133
That is what is really messed up.

488
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,541
Yeah.

489
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:01,603
They are so open that

490
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,051
even dirty-minded people like you

491
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:04,861
can enter.

492
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,402
Your sticky-notes,

493
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:19,492
were actually pretty useful.

494
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:22,689
Really?

495
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,829
So you passed your exam,

496
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,030
and won't get kicked out!

497
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,008
If the notes you copied for me were correct.

498
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:33,735
Even though the credit goes to Miss Yan Shu,

499
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,268
at least,

500
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:37,526
everyone is satisfied with the results.

501
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:40,569
I believe that your brother will be very happy also.

502
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:46,731
I worked so hard,

503
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:49,383
yet you only care about whether Huo Yan's happy or not.

504
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:50,958
Of course.

505
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,594
The reason why I'm happy

506
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:55,810
is because "everyone" is happy with the results.

507
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,288
Thank you.

508
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,237
Until the very end of the exams,

509
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:02,550
you chose not to give up.

510
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,296
You did something really great.

511
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,574
You're not that bad after all!

512
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,151
Thank you!

513
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:22,127
Because you reached your goal,

514
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:24,251
so...

515
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:29,369
So...

516
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,393
I can say goodbye to you without any hesitation.

517
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:35,418
What do you mean?

518
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,491
There are no endless parties, and

519
00:32:38,617 --> 00:32:40,258
no endless exchange coupons.

520
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:43,171
So...

521
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,219
here right now, I have to say goodbye to you.

522
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,239
Great!

523
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,792
I don't have to be bothered anymore.

524
00:32:56,712 --> 00:32:57,929
Right!

525
00:32:58,163 --> 00:32:59,333
From now on,

526
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:00,986
there's no need for us to see each other again.

527
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:02,656
I can finally escape

528
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:04,341
your stupid girl annoyances.

529
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,371
Jia Di can finally escape

530
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,336
the torture from a Devil like you.

531
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,083
You, big noisy horn,

532
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:11,281
why are you talking so much.

533
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,018
I really want to celebrate.

534
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:14,863
Celebrate what?

535
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:15,993
Celebrate that your mouth is so big

536
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,699
that I could fit my fist in there?

537
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:19,364
You're so evil.

538
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:20,506
Jia Di, let's go.

539
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,672
Don't ever let those

540
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:33,168
stupid exchange coupons

541
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:34,701
appear again in my house.

542
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,462
And if you

543
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:49,876
break a leg,

544
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,061
go hungry,

545
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:52,747
or have unwashed underwear,

546
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:55,213
don't call me.

547
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:02,278
Let's go.

548
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:03,750
Don't talk to him.

549
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,627
Stand still.

550
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,665
I don't want to see

551
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,613
arrogant people walk away from me.

552
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,312
If someone has to leave,

553
00:34:30,452 --> 00:34:31,530
I'll leave first.

554
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,548
"I realized,

555
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:21,252
that I have fallen in love with you,

556
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,363
Devil."

557
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,932
Mr. CEO.

558
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:41,594
Sorry, please continue.

559
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:48,567
Did you take a look at the plan I e-mailed you?

560
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:58,433
That your computer,

561
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:01,032
needs your fingerprint to open it...

562
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,125
I have some thoughts about that.

563
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:06,243
You want to look at the secrets on my computer?

564
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:08,504
Just kidding.

565
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,142
Last time you were at the hospital,

566
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,342
no one could turn on your computer.

567
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:13,720
There's so much information on your computer that we needed

568
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:15,310
that your secretary went crazy trying to find it.

569
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,115
In the end, I re-did everything.

570
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:20,984
Last time it was a car accident.

571
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:22,143
I promise,

572
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:23,779
if I leave one day,

573
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:26,324
I will copy all the information for you,

574
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:27,821
so you won't be frustrated.

575
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,326
The plan you sent, I received it already.

576
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:34,759
I'll take a look at it.

577
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,457
Mr. CEO,

578
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,811
the VIP party we held last time,

579
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,919
had a very good response.

580
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,787
Then I will leave the arrangements for the,

581
00:36:45,883 --> 00:36:47,208
upcoming spring events to you

582
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:49,158
Organize some events that will captivate our customers.

583
00:36:58,644 --> 00:36:59,631
Cai Juan.

584
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:01,595
Sorry, you come and visit me,

585
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,244
yet you still have to help me out.

586
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:05,529
We're good friends, don't say things like that.

587
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:06,775
If you talk like that, I won't talk to you,

588
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:07,692
and go back to Taipei.

589
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,800
Yu Hua, are you alright?

590
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,748
It's nothing.

591
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:21,778
Just a minor illness,

592
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:23,462
it'll be fine soon, it's nothing.

593
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:26,044
If I didn't come to visit this time,

594
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:27,776
I wouldn't have known that your health had become so poor.

595
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:29,305
Why is it that everytime you come to Taipei,

596
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,616
you won't let me know?

597
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,407
Why are you worried about me?

598
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,095
You're the one suffering more.

599
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:36,481
I'm only one person.

600
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:37,917
You have to take care of two children.

601
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:40,148
At least let me know

602
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,365
when you are sick.

603
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:43,267
Then I can be the one visiting you.

604
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,270
So you won't be the one visiting

605
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:46,309
me in Taipei everytime.

606
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,538
Actually...

607
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,610
actually I went to see my son.

608
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,668
Did you get back together with your son?

609
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:00,770
I just...

610
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,492
just quietly went to take a look.

611
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,091
As long as I can see him from afar,

612
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:06,547
it's enough.

613
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,645
He's living really well right now,

614
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,861
very handsome.

615
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:17,993
My original decision,

616
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,413
to send him away,

617
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:20,722
was indeed the right one.

618
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:23,000
It was right.

619
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,214
Right.

620
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,503
Devil!

621
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:51,132
What are you doing?

622
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:51,953
Are you crazy?

623
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,107
That was really dangerous.

624
00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:55,153
Let me ride around for a little bit.

625
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,132
You haven't ridden a bike for ages,

626
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:58,708
can you manage?

627
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,342
How long has it been since you last dated?

628
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,966
It's been about...

629
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,211
two years since I have dated.

630
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:08,763
Then can you do it?

631
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,645
Can you?

632
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:14,067
Hey, there is no need for doubts.

633
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:18,478
Combine your question with your answer.

634
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,351
The way the Devil changes his gears

635
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,974
is still not smooth.

636
00:39:58,822 --> 00:40:00,696
<i>There are no endless parties and,</i>

637
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,719
<i>there are no endless exchange coupons.</i>

638
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:05,526
<i>So,</i>

639
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:07,195
<i>I'm here to say goodbye to you.</i>

640
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:12,466
How was it?

641
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,434
Was it smooth?

642
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:17,911
Felt really bad.

643
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:18,973
It wasn't smooth at all.

644
00:40:42,214 --> 00:40:43,712
Careful with the displays.

645
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:45,791
During holidays,

646
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:48,532
many professionals get their bonus and

647
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,530
go on a shopping spree.

648
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:52,728
For the upcoming two months,

649
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,286
every division should put in their best effort.

650
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,640
Especially the fashion section,

651
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:01,214
I think they should increase their outlets

652
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:05,395
Is there a problem?

653
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,440
No.

654
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:09,291
But...

655
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,633
increasing decorated outlets

656
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:13,382
means we need to add more salespeople.

657
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:17,091
We can mainly hire part-time students.

658
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:19,679
Yes, Manager Yang.

659
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:25,905
Hey Bo Zi,

660
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:27,013
No matter how I calculate,

661
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:28,713
I don't know where we can find this money.

662
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:32,083
Even if we save money

663
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,834
for two months.

664
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:34,957
Now,

665
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,559
we don't even have one-fifth of the fund.

666
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:37,777
How can we ever compete?

667
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:38,836
What are you talking about?

668
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,006
Nothing.

669
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,222
Didn't say anything.

670
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,793
You don't want this wealthy Devil

671
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,310
to know you guys are in straits.

672
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:49,836
This means

673
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:51,441
you guys are overly proud.

674
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,904
Don't use that face.

675
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm not using money

676
00:41:58,651 --> 00:41:59,743
to buy your fortitude.

677
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:00,849
Then don't care about it.

678
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,038
That's right.

679
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,785
You're wealth is your own business.

680
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:05,936
But your business is my business.

681
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:16,852
At least

682
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,562
this piece of the dream,

683
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:21,105
you will let me join, right?

684
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,332
So much crap.

685
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:24,533
After this is exposed,

686
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,687
you would still give us money.

687
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,611
Then do you want to reject me

688
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:28,884
or the money?

689
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,793
After knowing Taiwan A Shin,

690
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:38,758
for the first time towards money,

691
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,434
I have a different perspective.

692
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:41,661
Money is money,

693
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:42,680
what's different about it?

694
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,004
What's money?

695
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:44,800
What is it?

696
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,221
It's just a tool.

697
00:42:47,036 --> 00:42:49,074
If it can't let the people I care

698
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:50,761
to have a meaningful life

699
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:52,662
but if I horde my money

700
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:54,113
and not help others,

701
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,189
then it is the same as being poor.

702
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:57,078
Devil Boy,

703
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,090
I think you have been enlightened by

704
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:01,117
Good Family Virgin, so you have a Buddha's heart now.

705
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,584
Even though

706
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:03,816
I don't want to use your money.

707
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:06,109
I don't want to reject your heart either.

708
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:22,401
When you go back,

709
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:23,982
quickly phone to find people.

710
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,288
Yes.

711
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:27,096
Group leader Lin,

712
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:28,426
I'm pregnant.

713
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:30,153
So starting next week,

714
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:32,308
I want to have two months of maternity leave.

715
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:36,767
There are already not enough workers.

716
00:43:39,546 --> 00:43:41,353
Okay...

717
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:42,633
When I find a replacement,

718
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:43,819
I'll let her take over.

719
00:43:44,693 --> 00:43:45,988
Thanks group leader Lin.

720
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,905
Xiao Ru,

721
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,640
remember to find experienced workers.

722
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,478
Or else when we're busy,

723
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:53,836
we'll need to train them.

724
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,698
Yes.

725
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,035
Okay, get back to work now.

726
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,471
Hello Xiao Nan,

727
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,655
This is group leader Lin from Huo Shi department store.

728
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:23,507
I'm not going.

729
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,292
But I've already promised her.

730
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,208
Since it's winter break now.

731
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:29,068
Ok,

732
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:29,985
then you go.

733
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:31,279
I can find another job.

734
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:33,057
I've told you already,

735
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,339
I don't want to be related with those two brothers anymore.

736
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:37,337
I'm...not going to Huo Shi.

737
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:38,648
But...

738
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:40,250
I'm going to the office to make a phone call.

739
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:45,775
Ken, why are you here?

740
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,364
Have you told Tong Jia Di yet?

741
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:03,481
Hey, I was having an exam before,

742
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:04,652
so I forgot to tell you...

743
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:07,584
Where are you? So loud.

744
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:08,743
Where's mom?

745
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:09,971
How's Auntie Xin?

746
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:11,282
What is it?

747
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:12,451
I'm telling you

748
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:13,653
that our uncle's loan

749
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,166
has already been paid.

750
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:16,398
You and mom can come back.

751
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,620
Let me stay here longer,

752
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:18,754
then I'll come back.

753
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,034
Where's mom?

754
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:20,753
Let her pick-up the phone.

755
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:23,808
Hey, the phone signal is weak,

756
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:24,666
I'll call you later.

757
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:31,485
What's up?

758
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:32,983
You still have to report to your parents when you come out?

759
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:34,307
Of course not!

760
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,681
Why would I care about them?

761
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:38,707
The batteries ran out.

762
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,866
Your phone call has been transferred to voicemail,

763
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:58,798
a fee would be charged after the "beep" sound.

764
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:00,689
If not, please end the phone call.

765
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,684
Speed message is after the "beep" sound...

766
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:11,206
Since you're already

767
00:46:11,296 --> 00:46:12,496
friends with everyone in this Agency,

768
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,760
we will get you a job.

769
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:14,790
Don't worry.

770
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:16,708
Thanks.

771
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:19,470
I've already given all my money to you.

772
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,184
Then get Tong Jia Di to lend me some more.

773
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:24,726
But...

774
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,270
Jia Di has her own difficulties back home

775
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,486
Then are you saying that she is more important than your boyfriend?

776
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:34,606
Ken,

777
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,994
the love between us,

778
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:38,787
other than money,

779
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,617
what's left?

780
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,710
I think that the answer to this question

781
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:49,601
should be answered by you.

782
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:55,073
Ken!

783
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,548
Don't go!

784
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:58,427
Don't be like this.

785
00:46:58,568 --> 00:46:59,925
Listen to me.

786
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:03,262
Ken!

787
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,165
Taiwan A Shin,

788
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:36,819
I'm not gonna annoy you anymore.

789
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:37,801
I'm going home.

790
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:52,203
Xiao Nan is $3000,

791
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:53,514
$5000,

792
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:54,888
$4000,

793
00:47:54,964 --> 00:47:56,108
$7500.

794
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:59,588
The total amount that I owe her is $24 500.

795
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,797
My salary from the gas station,

796
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:04,672
has reduced due to money I loaned Uncle.

797
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:08,444
There's not even $3000 left.

798
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,547
That kid doesn't look too bad.

799
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:23,560
We can make some money from him.

800
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,138
Why do you need this money?

801
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:55,197
Because Bo Zi is going to a national competition,

802
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:56,340
and they need the fee expense.

803
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,954
There are no "free lunches" in this world.

804
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:02,940
Other than your daily expenses,

805
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,305
I am not responsible for giving you anymore money.

806
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:08,893
I knew you wouldn't give me money easily.

807
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,908
What do you want me to do?

808
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:23,951
Why do you need this money?

809
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,240
Because Bo Zi is going to a national competition,

810
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,363
and they need the fee expense.

811
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:31,954
There are no "free lunches" in this world.

812
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:33,935
Other than your daily expenses,

813
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,215
I am not responsible for giving you anymore money.

814
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,157
I knew you wouldn't give me money easily.

815
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:42,153
What do you want me to do?

816
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:45,432
You should know.

817
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,458
Dad has mentioned many times,

818
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,796
that you shouldn't waste the winter break.

819
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:51,793
During my first year in university,

820
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,276
dad had arranged for me

821
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:54,759
to be trained in the company.

822
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:58,301
Isn't this just to monitor me?

823
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:01,392
Huo Shi Department store doesn't need me at all.

824
00:50:04,057 --> 00:50:05,511
It seems like

825
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,050
you don't need the money.

826
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:11,105
Are you threatening me?

827
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,492
Should I say that you are awesome

828
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,615
or despicable?

829
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:20,888
Which division?

830
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:23,367
My general manager office,

831
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:25,582
or Yan Shu's marketing planning department?

832
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,080
Or do you want to ask dad for suggestions?

833
00:50:29,117 --> 00:50:30,701
I can make my own choices.

834
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,620
During this time, it is as busy as the holidays.

835
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:42,712
Unless you have an emergency,

836
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:43,758
you cannot skip work.

837
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:45,271
There are three shifts.

838
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:49,128
I will explain your jobs,

839
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:50,886
now that you are used to the area.

840
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,524
In the employee manual,

841
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,432
there are things that you need to be aware of.

842
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:55,412
If there are any questions,

843
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,097
check the employee manual.

844
00:50:57,205 --> 00:50:59,170
Or you can observe how others work.

845
00:51:01,682 --> 00:51:04,597
Basically it is because you two are experienced.

846
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,568
So,

847
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:08,220
I hope you will be able to handle the workload without instruction.

848
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:25,885
Welcome!

849
00:51:28,981 --> 00:51:30,279
Elevator's going up.

850
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:50,273
Standing for a whole day, so tired.

851
00:51:50,584 --> 00:51:51,727
Elevator's going up!

852
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,595
Which floor are you going to?

853
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:55,577
My throat has completely dried up.

854
00:51:57,837 --> 00:51:59,600
You two are wearing uniforms.

855
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:01,879
Does that mean you are working here?

856
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,297
Yes, Yan Shu.

857
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,184
please give us lots of advice in the future.

858
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:14,933
I'm really impressed.

859
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:17,384
I think your sentence isn't finished yet.

860
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:18,741
If you're impressed with Jia Di,

861
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,200
there should be a reason.

862
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,419
It is because she found so many means

863
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,729
of approaching Huo Yan.

864
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:28,164
Exchange coupon,

865
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:31,819
birthday wish, wanting his phone number,

866
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:34,202
becoming his nurse,

867
00:52:35,156 --> 00:52:36,562
study partner.

868
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:39,979
Now you are an employee in Huo Shi.

869
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,845
You've really tried hard.

870
00:52:43,563 --> 00:52:44,924
You got the wrong person.

871
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,384
You should be impressed with me.

872
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:49,430
All of the things mentioned above

873
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,691
were my brilliant plans.

874
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,125
These are all my merits.

875
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,810
So you should admire

876
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:56,931
Jia Di for having such a good friend!

877
00:52:57,743 --> 00:52:59,210
I don't think so.

878
00:53:00,152 --> 00:53:01,925
Mostly I have my own opinions.

879
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:04,841
I don't need friends who believe they are intelligent.

880
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:07,603
Ms. Yan Shu.

881
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,973
Although I really want to be impressed with myself.

882
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:13,256
I have to tell you that all of those incidents

883
00:53:13,514 --> 00:53:15,604
were purely because of the destiny they share.

884
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,910
Even though you have known the 10th guy for a long time,

885
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,563
and grew up together.

886
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:22,251
But,

887
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:24,346
Jia Di and him are truly destined to be together.

888
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,370
This is not true.

889
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:28,710
Yan Shu,

890
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,189
I've never had such intentions.

891
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:33,109
It's okay.

892
00:53:33,268 --> 00:53:34,543
The fact that you so vehemently defend youself,

893
00:53:34,732 --> 00:53:36,119
makes me more suspicious.

894
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:39,051
In retrospect,

895
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:40,596
I feel that your friend

896
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,703
is more honest than you.

897
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,086
Your personal life,

898
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:49,013
I have no need for an explanation.

899
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:50,892
Because I don't even want to listen to it.

900
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:53,404
That's wasting my time.

901
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:55,511
In your job,

902
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,567
please do what you should be doing.

903
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,643
Or else,

904
00:54:00,788 --> 00:54:02,265
it is also wasting time.

905
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,371
Even a peacock isn't that proud.

906
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:14,620
Wasting time...

907
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:16,179
you are wasting my air!

908
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:20,205
This is a washroom.

909
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:21,922
Oh yeah,

910
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:24,250
didn't you say you didn't want this job

911
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:25,976
just because you didn't want to see them?

912
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:27,557
Really?

913
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,457
I said that?

914
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,202
Although in my life,

915
00:54:31,327 --> 00:54:32,918
I have many principles that I follow,

916
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:35,462
if there are larger issues at play I

917
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:36,981
am willing to overlook them.

918
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,582
Then what are these larger issues?

919
00:54:40,968 --> 00:54:43,095
Of course it is getting over my money issues.

920
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,107
Right.

921
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,490
Money...

922
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:47,974
is very important.

923
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:53,621
Group leader,

924
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,307
thanks for hiring me as a substitute.

925
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:57,177
But,

926
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,127
I need to get part of my salary in advance.

927
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:00,437
If you need us,

928
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,917
Xiao Nan and I can come help.

929
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,228
Get your salary in advance?

930
00:55:05,788 --> 00:55:07,925
You have so many requests!

931
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:11,002
Fine.

932
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,963
Thank you group leader!

933
00:55:19,314 --> 00:55:20,674
At least we are already here.

934
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:21,871
Let's strive and make money!

935
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:23,557
Cheer up!

936
00:55:30,016 --> 00:55:31,232
Xiao Nan, my angel!

937
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:32,605
This is destiny!

938
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,869
Why are you here?

939
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:35,197
Not only me,

940
00:55:35,304 --> 00:55:36,615
also...

941
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,962
You...

942
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,520
I'm working in your family's department store.

943
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,017
Because of Huo Yan,

944
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,763
you've really sacrificed yourself.

945
00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:56,604
What?

946
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,131
Whatever.

947
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:00,694
I don't care what you think.

948
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:02,957
Want me to help you,

949
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:04,499
future eldest sister-in-law?

950
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,753
You...

951
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,233
I'm working in your family's department store.

952
00:56:28,288 --> 00:56:29,850
Because of Huo Yan,

953
00:56:29,988 --> 00:56:31,704
you've really sacrificed yourself.

954
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:33,373
What?

955
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:35,948
Whatever.

956
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:37,527
I don't care what you think.

957
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,753
Want me to help you,

958
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,313
future eldest sister-in-law?

959
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:45,807
I just want to work here.

960
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,647
That is my only purpose.

961
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,159
Devil Boy,

962
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:52,156
first it is Yang Yan Shu,

963
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:53,418
then it's you.

964
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:56,742
You guys are continuously mass-criticizing Jia Di.

965
00:56:56,777 --> 00:56:57,713
What is the deal?

966
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,723
Do you have to be this insulting?

967
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:01,269
It's me that made him misunderstood.

968
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:04,703
I think it is because,

969
00:57:04,994 --> 00:57:07,474
there are so many places in Taiwan that are hiring people.

970
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:08,972
But I chose here.

971
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,655
If you really think I have something else planned

972
00:57:11,718 --> 00:57:13,064
and cannot distinguish between personal and business matters,

973
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:14,350
I can leave.

974
00:57:16,472 --> 00:57:17,986
You want to show off your strength of spirit again.

975
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:19,514
Boring.

976
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,622
Even if someone cannot distinguish what's personal and business matters,

977
00:57:21,698 --> 00:57:22,512
it's not you.

978
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:24,116
It's him and Yang Yan Shu.

979
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:27,766
Do you know

980
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,190
your face looks like

981
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:30,520
it deserves a beating

982
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:31,853
right about now.

983
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:38,328
Beat me if you dare.

984
00:57:42,419 --> 00:57:44,155
I'm not the same type of person as you.

985
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:46,243
Good girls won't fight with a Devil.

986
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:47,926
I'm going back to work.

987
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:50,689
Xiao Nan!

988
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,231
Go away Si Da Bo.

989
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:52,953
Xiao Nan!

990
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:54,384
If you don't want to be killed in Huo Shi,

991
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:55,305
just buzz off!

992
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:55,865
Xiao Nan, let me and you...

993
00:57:55,944 --> 00:57:57,802
Go away! You're so annoying!

994
00:57:57,989 --> 00:57:59,189
Don't be like this.

995
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:00,157
Go away!

996
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:00,781
Xiao Nan.

997
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:02,216
So annoying!

998
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:12,541
At least this is the back stairs.

999
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:13,619
If this was a window,

1000
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:15,212
We would have fallen off the building.

1001
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,298
You're so scared that Yan Shu might see you.

1002
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,809
Then you could just treat me like air

1003
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:22,213
or an invisible person.

1004
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:25,770
You sure?

1005
00:58:25,863 --> 00:58:26,867
I'm sure!

1006
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:28,343
Then, we will not mind each other's business.

1007
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:29,441
Just what I wanted.

1008
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,009
I can make you regret now.

1009
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:34,881
You could still flatter me now.

1010
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:37,291
I will be a salesperson,

1011
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,806
and you be your Huo family Devil.

1012
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:41,409
We are not related at all.

1013
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,924
Why should I flatter you.

1014
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:46,277
Because I could help you.

1015
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:48,852
I could help you woo Huo Yan.

1016
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:51,921
Even you think that I work here

1017
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:53,090
to get his attention.

1018
00:58:54,214 --> 00:58:55,357
Good Family Virgin,

1019
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,460
you're good enough!

1020
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:57,645
Are you an unsalable product?

1021
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:58,973
You're an excessive person!

1022
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:09,844
Criticizing me,

1023
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:10,594
make fun of me,

1024
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:11,764
laughing at me.

1025
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,869
That is what makes you feel balanced right?

1026
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:15,913
Why wouldn't I be balanced?

1027
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:18,393
You like Ms. Yan Shu,

1028
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:20,407
Yan Shu likes the general manager.

1029
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,620
So you're venting your rage on me!

1030
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:23,543
I'm not.

1031
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,017
I'm treating Yan Shu like...

1032
00:59:29,454 --> 00:59:30,203
When I see her,

1033
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:31,046
my heart is...

1034
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:32,387
beating impulsively!

1035
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:34,732
Why are you giving suggestions

1036
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,286
about my relationship with her?

1037
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,799
Then stop spouting nonsense in front of me!

1038
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,874
Stop it! Let go!

1039
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,010
You...

1040
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:44,118
The person who likes Yang Yan Shu

1041
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:45,214
shouldn't be grabbing my hand.

1042
00:59:45,303 --> 00:59:46,395
It's not because of her!

1043
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:47,487
It's not because of her?

1044
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:48,814
You like her!

1045
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:50,546
If you don't shut up then I'll kiss you.

1046
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:52,339
The person who likes Yang Yan Shu...

1047
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:12,900
It's so easy to befuddle the senses of a Good Family Virgin.

1048
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,506
You almost fell into the trap.

1049
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:16,909
Why should I kiss you when I don't like you?

1050
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:21,200
It's so fun playing with you.

1051
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:23,919
So I won't treat you like air.

1052
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,065
I don't care if there's no exchange coupon.

1053
01:00:28,173 --> 01:00:29,547
I have already figured it out.

1054
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,759
You can't get rid of me.

1055
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:35,647
Good Family Virgin's miserable life

1056
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,398
is an extremely a sorrowful story of

1057
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,952
being tortured by the Huo Da Devil.

1058
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:12,090
Welcome!

1059
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:18,302
Elevator's going up!

1060
01:01:21,947 --> 01:01:22,671
Excuse me,

1061
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:24,459
which floor do you want to go to?

1062
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:27,329
General manager,

1063
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:28,889
I have some business matters

1064
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:30,046
to report to you.

1065
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:32,025
What can I do for you?

1066
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:33,370
I think

1067
01:01:33,476 --> 01:01:36,160
the general manager should care more about the lower level employees.

1068
01:01:37,703 --> 01:01:39,294
What do you think I should do?

1069
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:40,511
All of the solutions

1070
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,795
are written on this paper.

1071
01:01:48,113 --> 01:01:50,407
"Can the General Manager please care about the lower level employees."

1072
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,746
"Jia Di is working in the women's fashion section."

1073
01:02:01,478 --> 01:02:02,287
Devil,

1074
01:02:02,354 --> 01:02:03,521
so my angel, Xiao Nan is working here!

1075
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:05,562
Then what about this,

1076
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,826
tell your brother

1077
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:07,887
to let me work here

1078
01:02:07,996 --> 01:02:08,979
as payment for the fee.

1079
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,162
Don't even think about it.

1080
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,705
He just wanted to make me feel controlled, don't you get it?

1081
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:15,672
I finally have this chance.

1082
01:02:15,781 --> 01:02:17,824
Help me think of a way.

1083
01:02:18,046 --> 01:02:19,167
I'm just the same as you.

1084
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:20,725
What's the same?

1085
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,478
Having the advantage of being close to somebody.

1086
01:02:23,724 --> 01:02:25,067
Didn't I tell you already

1087
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:26,407
I've already spoke to Yan Shu

1088
01:02:26,468 --> 01:02:27,238
clearly about it.

1089
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,280
Her answer was a "zero" relationship.

1090
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:30,078
I'm not talking about her.

1091
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:33,286
What does that mean?

1092
01:02:33,647 --> 01:02:34,957
Did you really not realize?

1093
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:36,489
When you saw Jia Di,

1094
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:37,873
your facial expression

1095
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:38,874
changed almost 300 times in one second!

1096
01:02:38,948 --> 01:02:40,134
Anxious and nervous,

1097
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:41,742
astonished and delighted.

1098
01:02:41,882 --> 01:02:43,041
Continuously ever-changing.

1099
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,474
Who's listening to you talking crap?

1100
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:47,669
It's true alright?

1101
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:49,199
A whole complicated face.

1102
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:50,945
Young Huo Da's worries...

1103
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:51,653
You idiot!

1104
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:52,568
How can it be possible?

1105
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:53,893
Fine, if you don't admit it.

1106
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:56,724
The main point is me!

1107
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:58,764
Please help me.

1108
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,071
Have the advantage of being close to somebody.

1109
01:03:01,232 --> 01:03:02,835
When I say it three times.

1110
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:05,288
Then it's true.

1111
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:07,159
Bye bye bye.

1112
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:09,219
Fine...

1113
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:11,512
To be honest,

1114
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:13,197
help me if we're friends.

1115
01:03:13,614 --> 01:03:15,425
Can you hear me? Have the advantage of being close to somebody.

1116
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,897
<Why Why Love Behind the Scenes>

1117
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,253
Hey~this is the scene of Why Why Love

1118
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:35,705
Huo Shi department store.

1119
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:37,063
The part that we're screening is

1120
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,292
the first day that Huo Da is going to work.

1121
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:41,631
Let's see what's happening now!

1122
01:03:41,765 --> 01:03:43,700
<"Huo brothers break during their screening" version>

1123
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,285
Actually today I am...

1124
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,951
Today I have about 8 scenes,

1125
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,103
and I have a lot of lines to memorize.

1126
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,053
So...

1127
01:03:51,509 --> 01:03:53,238
I am a little distraught.

1128
01:03:54,174 --> 01:03:54,610
Is that because of your flu?

1129
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:55,546
There are a lot of lines.

1130
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,892
Is that because of your flu?

1131
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:57,967
Oh, yes.

1132
01:03:58,073 --> 01:03:59,104
Since I took pills already,

1133
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:00,740
I am feeling really dizzy now.

1134
01:04:01,224 --> 01:04:03,535
Now we are waiting for this...background music.

1135
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:06,279
We can only shoot after the music's turned off!

1136
01:04:06,872 --> 01:04:08,791
The background music is a large distraction

1137
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,025
to the shooting.

1138
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:11,385
But during this time, Chuan Yi

1139
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:12,509
started dancing.

1140
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,634
Then what about Xiao Mei who is standing aside?

1141
01:04:16,776 --> 01:04:18,647
What would I do if my family had a department store?

1142
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:19,382
Don't need to work.

1143
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,502
Don't need to work, everyday like this.

1144
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:22,718
You don't need to act in dramas anymore.

1145
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,908
No, I would still act in dramas.

1146
01:04:24,013 --> 01:04:25,169
Then many people would say:

1147
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,278
"He Jun Xiang, lend us your family's department store to shoot a drama!"

1148
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:28,990
Yes, yes, ok!

1149
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:31,412
Xiao Mei, you really know how to imagine!

1150
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:33,079
Then Chuan Yi

1151
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,559
suddenly started shopping!

1152
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,057
Do you like it?

1153
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:40,488
*Acting cute*

1154
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:42,409
Are you inspecting?

1155
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:44,626
Because I need to cultivate the feeling of

1156
01:04:44,857 --> 01:04:45,875
being a general manager.

1157
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:48,381
<The enemies who always like to argue>

1158
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:50,082
Xiao Mei and Cheng Lin are a

1159
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:52,204
pair of enemies who like to argue.

1160
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:53,857
Actually, outside of the drama,

1161
01:04:54,216 --> 01:04:55,355
they are also the same,

1162
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:56,555
and really like to argue.

1163
01:04:57,461 --> 01:04:59,489
Good Family Virgin, you're good enough!

1164
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:01,128
Are you an unsaleable product?

1165
01:05:01,205 --> 01:05:02,031
You're an excessive person!

1166
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:03,708
If he's excessive then you should beat him!

1167
01:05:03,926 --> 01:05:05,371
You're an excessive person!

1168
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:07,305
Raise your hand and slap, then

1169
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,505
-slap and then... -You're an excessive person!

1170
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:12,442
*It smashed into pieces!*

1171
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:15,903
Then the hand was smashed.

1172
01:05:16,823 --> 01:05:18,913
You could still suck up to me now!

1173
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:24,184
*Shaking*

1174
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:27,586
What are you doing?

1175
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,523
I'm shivering.

1176
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:29,597
These two

1177
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,870
when they are rehearsing,

1178
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:32,733
looks like they have great tacit understanding.

1179
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,014
But...

1180
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:35,173
<The real shooting>

1181
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,783
Good Family Virgin, you're good enough!

1182
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:37,904
You're an unsalable product!!

1183
01:05:38,092 --> 01:05:39,746
You're an excessive person!!

1184
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:40,817
Cut!

1185
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,147
What are you grabbing?

1186
01:05:42,223 --> 01:05:43,422
Grabbing what?

1187
01:05:43,533 --> 01:05:45,080
I grabbed her sleeve.

1188
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:47,245
Good that it was long (the background).

1189
01:05:47,468 --> 01:05:48,981
Great...

1190
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:50,553
What are you grabbing?

1191
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:51,646
Sorry!

1192
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:54,164
Director! By saying that,

1193
01:05:54,257 --> 01:05:56,129
Xiao Mei's pose now

1194
01:05:56,225 --> 01:05:57,461
looks like

1195
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,740
grabbing..."Just like the touch of a salty pig hand"~ (salty pig hand=perverted man)

1196
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:02,331
It's not because of her!

1197
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,673
It's not because of her?

1198
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,152
You like her!

1199
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,115
If you don't shut up then I'll kiss you.

1200
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:09,445
*Shyness*

1201
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:10,315
Idiot!

1202
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:11,362
Then I'll say

1203
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:13,683
why would the person who likes Yan Yan Shu want to kiss me?

1204
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:16,042
So annoying, I'm so immature~

1205
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:17,803
Why would the person who likes Yan Yan Shu want to kiss me?

1206
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,269
*Acting in a pettishly charming matter*

1207
01:06:20,472 --> 01:06:21,658
Aiya!

1208
01:06:21,935 --> 01:06:24,743
Aiyo, both of them even kissed before,

1209
01:06:24,886 --> 01:06:26,803
why would they be so shy

1210
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,191
after saying this line~

1211
01:06:29,938 --> 01:06:30,693
So immature!

1212
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,907
Why would the person who likes Yan Yan Shu

1213
01:06:32,544 --> 01:06:35,727
*Xiao Mei, what kind of face expression was that?*

1214
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,876
Ho ho ho...

1215
01:06:41,612 --> 01:06:42,515
It's so easy to cheat on a Good Family Virgin.

1216
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:42,570
You almost fell into the trap.

1217
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:43,942
Why should I kiss you when I don't like you?

1218
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,160
It's so fun playing with you.

1219
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,181
*He's crazy!*

1220
01:06:46,259 --> 01:06:47,248
So I won't treat you like air.

1221
01:06:47,344 --> 01:06:47,959
I have already figured it out.

1222
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,056
I don't care if there's no exchange coupon.

1223
01:06:49,129 --> 01:06:50,096
You can't get rid of me.

1224
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,115
Good Family Virgin's miserable life

1225
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,220
is extremly a sorrowful story of

1226
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:53,404
being tortured by the Huo Da Devil.

1227
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:55,104
An extreme sorrowful story.

1228
01:06:55,198 --> 01:06:56,352
An extreme sorrowful story.

1229
01:06:58,063 --> 01:07:00,140
Why should I kiss you when I don't like you?

1230
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,325
It's so fun playing with you.

1231
01:07:05,467 --> 01:07:06,506
Sorry!

1232
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,002
Forgot your line?

1233
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:08,939
Yeah, forgot the line.

1234
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:10,773
It's so fun playing with you.

1235
01:07:11,755 --> 01:07:13,077
Someone forgot their line!

1236
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:14,883
You just recorded it

1237
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:16,037
just because you're lucky.

1238
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:17,836
I rarely forget my line.

1239
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:19,592
Mostly it's her that forget lines.

1240
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:20,543
How could I?

1241
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,875
I'm the queen of memorizing!

1242
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:24,162
I'm a memory master!

1243
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:25,992
You're the wrong memory master.

1244
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:27,207
I'm a memory hunter!

1245
01:07:27,352 --> 01:07:28,478
Ha!

1246
01:07:29,113 --> 01:07:31,339
Those two started to argue because of NG.

1247
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,134
Also, the arguement continued to

1248
01:07:33,212 --> 01:07:34,289
the next scene.

1249
01:07:34,665 --> 01:07:36,409
-I've already memorized it at home. -Who is it?

1250
01:07:36,488 --> 01:07:39,092
-It's not your business. -Who is it?

1251
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:40,185
Don't need to record him.

1252
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:41,577
Don't record... don't record him.

1253
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,774
Everyone is getting their script booklet here.

1254
01:07:45,389 --> 01:07:46,370
Okay?

1255
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:47,707
You always get it and give it to the people in your company.

1256
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:50,220
I don't have people in my company~ So you know.

1257
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:52,411
I've already memorized it all at home!

1258
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:54,792
I'm recording!

1259
01:07:55,477 --> 01:07:57,653
She doesn't have people in her company right?

1260
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,941
Here, I'm recording.

1261
01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:00,812
I'm recording, people in her company, you see.

1262
01:08:00,938 --> 01:08:02,455
At last, Xiao Mei who's recording

1263
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,390
was blamed by Cheng Lin again.

1264
01:08:04,861 --> 01:08:06,991
He Jun Xiang doesn't have any abilities!

1265
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:09,176
He can't even record with a video camera!

1266
01:08:11,156 --> 01:08:13,231
I'll forgive Yang Cheng Lin today

1267
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,179
just because of that thing coming.

1268
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,245
Fine.

1269
01:08:16,382 --> 01:08:17,894
Even when they love to argue,

1270
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,656
the director also should be responsible.

1271
01:08:19,556 --> 01:08:20,649
Because director

1272
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:22,442
really likes to create arguements for them.

1273
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,907
Would this be to make them act more realistic in the drama?

1274
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,511
Director: At this time you can see them looking at each other,

1275
01:08:27,606 --> 01:08:28,915
and we went into a trance.

1276
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:31,161
When you chop me with a knife, I'll slash you with a sword!

1277
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:33,922
I thought you were professional.

1278
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:35,372
When you see them in the NG...

1279
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:39,554
Oh yes~ excuse me.

1280
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:41,041
It's Cheng Lin's fault.

1281
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:41,929
I hope so!

1282
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:45,888
-Because her mood affects the whole team's mood! -Because my shadow is too beautiful!

1283
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,822
-Her coming would affect the whole team's mood. -You really don't...

1284
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:50,661
Do you have to tell the whole world about this?!

1285
01:08:52,346 --> 01:08:54,204
Jiu gao su quan...

1286
01:08:54,906 --> 01:08:56,077
Quickly sing!

1287
01:08:56,392 --> 01:08:58,164
Singing is his weakness.

1288
01:08:58,728 --> 01:08:59,506
He can't sing.

1289
01:09:00,062 --> 01:09:00,810
Even in the elevator,

1290
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:02,088
they can continue to argue!

1291
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:05,770
*Hurts~(in Japanese)*

1292
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:08,080
It really hurts~

1293
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:10,169
Violent person.

1294
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:13,530
Quick! Take revenge!

1295
01:09:17,929 --> 01:09:19,653
Hey~ If you do that she'll feel uncomfortable.

1296
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:25,103
He is bullying me.

1297
01:09:28,212 --> 01:09:29,296
After seeing how you treat

1298
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:30,392
money as your purpose in life,

1299
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:31,917
my perspective and personality have changed.

1300
01:09:32,182 --> 01:09:33,663
I have decided that I want to improve myself,

1301
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,507
so during this winter break,

1302
01:09:35,647 --> 01:09:36,846
I'll be getting a job.

1303
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,734
The job that I will be taking on is...

1304
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,012
Huo Shi department store's management employee.

1305
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,559
You don't need me to remind you

1306
01:09:42,665 --> 01:09:43,731
that since you're working here,

1307
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:45,208
you should be aware of your actions.

1308
01:09:45,443 --> 01:09:46,884
I hope that you can meet our standards.

1309
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,535
I think that you're worried that I am causing trouble.

1310
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:50,451
Don't worry.

1311
01:09:50,675 --> 01:09:52,820
I know I'm really handsome.

1312
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,694
but I won't flirt with others.

1313
01:09:54,818 --> 01:09:56,238
But it works both ways,

1314
01:09:56,378 --> 01:09:57,738
I would like to see if you can pull off the same thing.

1315
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,812
I know that you wouldn't be

1316
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,138
dating with the

1317
01:10:01,635 --> 01:10:02,806
company's employees.

1318
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:03,725
Of course I won't.

1319
01:10:03,883 --> 01:10:04,709
I hope so.

1320
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,888
Why would Xiao Nan and the Devil be hugging together?

1321
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:13,523
Why would Xiao Nan look at me like that?

1322
01:10:14,194 --> 01:10:16,081
What happened?

1323
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:18,946
You may want to fire Jiang Xiao Nan,

1324
01:10:19,073 --> 01:10:20,166
but I don't agree.

1325
01:10:20,226 --> 01:10:21,148
I hope that today's incident

1326
01:10:21,226 --> 01:10:22,681
can teach you a lesson.

1327
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:24,065
You should now realize

1328
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,267
that if you are working,

1329
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:26,420
you can't just fool around,

1330
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:27,857
and do whatever you want.

1331
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,272
It would only affect more innocent employees,

1332
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,092
or potentially make them lose their job.

1333
01:10:32,223 --> 01:10:33,463
The person who is cutting jobs here

1334
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:34,596
is you.

1335
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:35,470
Correct.

1336
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:36,988
But before I do so,

1337
01:10:37,111 --> 01:10:38,869
there is a person who gets them into that situation.

1338
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:39,823
That accomplice is you.

1339
01:10:41,261 --> 01:10:46,097
<i>My lips curl into a smile unknowingly</i>

1340
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:51,279
<i>Are these the symptoms of bliss?</i>

1341
01:10:52,174 --> 01:10:57,166
<i>My heart starts to pound.</i>

1342
01:10:57,772 --> 01:11:02,609
<i>Thinking of you, I become breathless.</i>

1343
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:07,930
<i>I start to blush and breathe unnaturally.</i>

1344
01:11:08,504 --> 01:11:13,349
<i>Are these the symptoms of bliss?</i>

1345
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:18,660
<i>I become breathless, again.</i>

1346
01:11:39,204 --> 01:11:43,698
<i>Spring arrives slowly, bit by bit.</i>

1347
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:49,501
<i>The moonlight shines, but can't see the sadness.</i>

1348
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,142
<i>In the field in front of the merry go round.</i>

1349
01:11:55,635 --> 01:11:59,479
<i>Love starts to blossom.</i>
