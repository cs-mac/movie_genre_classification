[Train Whistle Blowing]
It's the inconvenience to the list.

611
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,400
It's the paperwork.
I somehow left
my work card at home.

612
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,200
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but--

I'm sorry, it was stupid!
What if I got here
five minutes later?

I woke up from a dream this morning.

619
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,500
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

620
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,900
only to discover I was broke and sharing

I have to laugh.

You are living behind walls.

624
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,200
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions
to my life I'm tired of.

625
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,400
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

626
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,200

There's a kind of,

ancestral squalor to it all.

You are a slave to these people.
No one envies us anymore.

Oh, yes, you're smart.

You're a real genius.
You had your chance.

631
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,200
Today, today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

632
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,100
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

You don't really have

This is it. This is the bottom.

The ghetto is... liberty.

641
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,400
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

642
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,900
Right side, Ghetto A:
civil employees,

the elderly and infirm mostly.

That's not a villa.
