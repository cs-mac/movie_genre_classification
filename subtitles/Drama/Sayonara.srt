00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,449
<i>Sayonara</i>

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:46,461
<i>Sayonara</i>

3
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:55,884
<i>Sayonara</i>

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:31,183
<i>Sayonara</i>

5
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:37,902
<i>Japanese goodbye</i>

6
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,437
Just like a bird!

7
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,994
How many did you get, sir?

8
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,916
Hey, he got two more!

9
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,953
Four? Old Gruver got two more...

10
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,912
Nice going there, sir!

11
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,216
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,811
Now, let's try the other lung. Breathe.

13
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,523
- Breathe.
- Hi, <i>padre.</i>

14
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,689
- Breathe.
- Two more MiGs today I hear, Lloyd.

15
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,895
Yeah.

16
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,198
Yeah, that's it. You can put it on.

17
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,365
Okay.

18
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,411
Well, Ace, you've had it.

19
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,954
Say what?

20
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,366
You're through flying, for a while, anyway.

21
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,701
Oh, no, nothing wrong with me

22
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,037
a little bottle of beer isn't going to fix up.

23
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,248
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back out.

24
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,209
Look, now,
just don't get yourself excited here.

25
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,714
Don't get pale, Gruver.

26
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,887
I was just giving you a rib.

27
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,090
But you could use some sleep.

28
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,764
Yeah, I could use a little nice Korean sleep.

29
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,845
Mmm, better than that.

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,306
You're going to Japan.

31
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,768
I'm going to Japan? What for?

32
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,061
Why not?

33
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,990
Wouldn't you like to tango with one
of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

34
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,366
Well, if it's your prescription, Doc,

35
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,115
then I'll certainly work at it the best I can.

36
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,409
You're going to Kobe.

37
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,911
Kelly has your orders.

38
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,584
What in the world am I going to do in Kobe?

39
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,206
Well, it's a special request

40
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,290
of General Webster himself.

41
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,382
Then this has all been pre-arranged.

42
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,968
Pre-arranged? Demanded.

43
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,301
Why shouldn't a three-star general

44
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,511
look out for a four-star general's son?

45
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,179
Now, don't be getting on my back.

46
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,768
I ain't bucking for favors.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,142
I know you're not. I was just kidding.

48
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,317
I'll see you, Doc. Thanks.

49
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,235
Could I have a word with you, Gruver?

50
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,405
Yeah, I'll bet you I know what the word is.

51
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,657
K-E-L-L-Y. Is that true or false?

52
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,074
He's got permission to go back

53
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,993
and marry that Japanese girl.

54
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,656
Well, I told him he can't
take her back to the States.

55
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,658
I explained the law in detail myself.

56
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,579
But there's no law
which says he can't marry her.

57
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,504
And he's appealed to his congressman.

58
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,249
His congressman?

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,251
I wish you'd
talk to him.

60
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,462
After all, he is one of your men.

61
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,593
And you're the only human being
he looks up to.

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,424
Now, listen, I...

63
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,092
You know, I'm going to tell you something.

64
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,643
That boy don't look up to anybody.

65
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,893
He has been promoted four times

66
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,103
and busted right back again.

67
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,861
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain't it, Major?

68
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,897
Chaplain says, "Don't marry the girl."

69
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,611
Colonel says, "Don't marry the girl."

70
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,693
You say, "Don't marry the girl."

71
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,073
Congressman says,
"You marry that girl, Kelly."

72
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,613
What can I do?

73
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,456
I'll tell you what you can do, boy.

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,117
You can go home
and marry your congressman.

75
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,956
You'd be better off.

76
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,455
Give me more coffee.

77
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,666
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,296
Hear you bagged two more today, Major.

79
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,969
- Yes.
- How was it up there?

80
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,850
Oh, it was splendid.

81
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,856
What's the matter? What happened?

82
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,319
There was a guy
with a face in one of those planes today.

83
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,949
Well, there was a guy with a face

84
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,825
in all the other seven you shot down.

85
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,495
Yeah.

86
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,162
That's exactly what
I've been thinking about.

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,664
Well, you can stop thinking.

88
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,956
You got a very well-written contract here.

89
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,550
General Webster's had you assigned

90
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,129
to the Interservice
Aviation Board over there.

91
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,345
Which means
you've got practically nothing to do

92
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,596
except, of course, marry
the General's daughter,

93
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,678
who is arriving in Kobe tomorrow.

94
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,356
You mean, Eileen...

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,516
That's right.

96
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,104
General's wife
and daughter both, from Tulsa.

97
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,811
Listen, don't fool me now.

98
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,069
I'm not fooling, Major.

99
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,944
You're not supposed to
know anything about it. Big surprise.

100
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,367
Eileen's coming to Kobe.

101
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,453
Yeah.

102
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,449
General Webster
arranges it for you to marry his daughter.

103
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,751
My congressman
arranges it for me to marry my girl.

104
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,954
Generals for the officers,

105
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,914
congressmen for the peasants.

106
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,213
Listen, I'm glad you brought that up, boy.

107
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,215
Because I think there's a little bit

108
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,547
of difference that we ought to talk about.

109
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,056
What do you mean?

110
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,804
Well, now, listen.

111
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,395
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

112
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,475
No.

113
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,900
Well, I'm gonna show you a picture of a girl.

114
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,902
It happens to be my girl,
but she's American.

115
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,815
And I want you
to take a long, long look at her

116
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,071
because I believe that maybe you've forgot

117
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,073
what an American girl looks like.

118
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,830
And this girl I'm going to show to you

119
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,329
is, first of all, an American girl,

120
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,086
a girl with fine character,

121
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,247
a girl with good background,

122
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,295
good education, good family, good blood.

123
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,803
I've known this girl
since I was about that high.

124
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,926
Our families are very close.

125
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,342
I've been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

126
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,554
Now, she's a girl of unusual character

127
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,639
and I'd like you to take a look at her,

128
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,225
a close look, and tell me what you think.

129
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,439
Tell me what your feeling is.

130
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,408
Kind of beat-up, ain't she?

131
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,115
I beg your pardon?

132
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,324
No, that... The beat-up one's
her mother, you idiot. Not...

133
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,955
Here's Eileen now. Wait...

134
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,286
That's... Now, now.

135
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,457
Hey. Boy, she sure
does something wicked to a bathing suit.

136
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,636
Well, she has an enormous capacity
to fulfill a bathing suit.

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,421
- I can see that.
- That's enough, that's enough.

138
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,300
Listen, I'm just,
you know, showing it to you,

139
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,977
but all kidding aside,
the reason I want to show you this girl...

140
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,101
Hey, you ever seen Katsumi?

141
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,602
Where's that?

142
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,100
It's not a "Where's that?"

143
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,643
That's the girl I'm marrying.

144
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,146
Oh. Well, no.

145
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,485
I mean,
I don't know Japanese names.

146
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,650
That's all right. Forget it.

147
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,739
- Well?
- Oh, yeah.

148
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,208
Looks like a bright girl.

149
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,336
She's a whole lot brighter than me.

150
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,164
Well, that ain't too hard to do, you know.

151
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,218
Listen, Kelly,
I want to say something seriously to you.

152
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,678
Don't you think you're taking a risk

153
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,300
in marrying this Japanese girl?

154
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,758
Risks don't scare me any.

155
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,720
Look, Major, the Army and the Air Force
and the State Department

156
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,101
have all ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

157
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,355
Oh, hold on, Kelly.

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,187
I mean, what do you mean ganged up?

159
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,485
Here, look at these pamphlets.

160
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,772
"Think it over, Americans.

161
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,030
"Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals."

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,156
Yeah.

163
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,070
Here's another piece of garbage.

164
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,372
"But will your family accept her?"

165
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,699
Will they, Kelly?

166
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,500
I ain't got any family.

167
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,539
Listen, Kelly, I haven't
got anything against this girl of yours.

168
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,420
I haven't got anything against
the Japanese anymore.

169
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,126
I mean, not really.

170
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,712
But, you know, when...

171
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,351
I just don't understand
how a normal, average American...

172
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,683
I mean, let's put it this way.

173
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,560
I think even your friends are gonna

174
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,100
put you down if you marry this girl.

175
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,318
If the friends I got are that kind,

176
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,193
they won't be friends of mine much longer.

177
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,782
Look, Major,

178
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm gonna marry my girl if I have to give up

179
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,701
my American citizenship to do it.

180
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,281
Oh, Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob!

181
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,790
I mean, go ahead and marry

182
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,836
this slant-eyed runt if you want to.
It'll serve you right.

183
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,079
Now, wait a minute, Major!

184
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,918
Don't talk to me that way!

185
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,800
I won't take that from you or anybody else!

186
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,006
I'm sorry, Kelly.

187
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,683
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,931
I'm just blowing my stack a little today.

189
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,771
But, boy, I mean it. I...

190
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,107
I want to tell you, when you tell me

191
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,032
that you're gonna give up your citizenship

192
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,235
for a girl, I mean any girl,

193
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,029
I think you're nuts.

194
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,497
I mean, I think you're crazy.

195
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,950
I am crazy.

196
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,956
I'm in-love crazy.

197
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,787
I think you're going to cut your throat

198
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,081
and I'd just hate to see you do it.

199
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,591
And I mean this with all sincerity.

200
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,711
Maybe that's because you don't feel

201
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,217
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

202
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,939
There's your orders, Major.
See you on the plane.

203
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,152
Okay.

204
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,162
Kelly.

205
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,996
Well, we're coming in, Major.

206
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,165
There's the Inland Sea. Beautiful, ain't it?

207
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,375
Yeah.

208
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,461
Boy, it sure is
nice scenery out there.

209
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,468
That's Kobe over there.
You see it, with all the docks?

210
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,506
Oh?

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,841
You know, what you're
looking at, Major,

212
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,260
really is three cities, you know,
all running together.

213
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,812
There's Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

214
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,684
They got Kabuki there.

215
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,232
What's Kabuki?

216
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,230
You never heard
of Kabuki theater?

217
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,186
- No.
- All men, no dames.

218
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,613
That's going to be dull, isn't it?

219
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,362
Oh, I don't know.

220
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,485
Well, if it's all dames you want,

221
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,779
I think we're going to get there in about...

222
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,784
Yep. Look down there.

223
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,034
See that? See that little park over
there with the little lakes around it?

224
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,619
That's Matsubayashi.

225
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,170
- Where?
- Right down in there.

226
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,705
- You see it?
- Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,374
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous girls in all of Japan.

228
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,800
You know, they sing, they dance,

229
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,718
they act all the parts, no men.

230
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,299
Katsumi knows all the actresses.

231
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,676
She's like a movie fan or something.

232
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,842
Listen, you're just blowing your top

233
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,976
about seeing Katsumi, aren't you?

234
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,269
Carrying on.

235
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,766
She's my girl, Major.

236
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,579
Well, GG, good to see you.

237
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,781
So long, Lloyd. Lots of luck to you.

238
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,242
Oh, good enough. Thank you. Bye-bye.

239
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,420
Lloyd! Lloyd, here we are!

240
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,247
- Lloyd!
- Come on.

241
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,753
Hey, there!

242
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,212
Don't forget to act surprised.

243
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,049
Yeah. Hi, there! Hot dog!

244
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,093
Oh, won't he be surprised!

245
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,217
- Major?
- Yeah. Huh?

246
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,146
How about being my best man?

247
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,857
Now, listen, Kelly, I told you
that I'm against this marriage.

248
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,278
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

249
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,204
Okay.

250
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,084
Consul's Office, 10:00, Saturday.

251
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,626
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

252
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,092
Well, now, hello! Come here, you!

253
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,477
- Ha, ha! You're good...
- Bless your heart.

254
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,058
- Certainly good to see you.
- Hi, Lloyd.

255
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,605
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

256
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,766
You know, I was getting off the plane.

257
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,684
And I said, "There's General Webster
standing over there.

258
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,815
"But who is that good-looking woman?"

259
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,729
Listen, tell me about Eileen. How is she?

260
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,908
Oh, she finds Tulsa terribly dull
without you, Lloyd.

261
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,736
Well, you know, I think...
I wish she could have come along.

262
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,117
Oh, now, Lloyd,
you couldn't expect us to bring her out here.

263
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,326
Well, I know that, but...

264
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,367
You're registered at the hotel
with us for the first few nights,

265
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,292
but you'll be stationed
out here at the field after that.

266
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,498
I see.

267
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,045
Come on, let's go. Now, you get in first.

268
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,213
No, you go ahead, Mrs. Webster, honey.

269
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,586
- No, you get in first.
- No, no, you got...

270
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,713
- Go on. Get in!
- No, no.

271
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,385
Ladies first. What's the matter with you?

272
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,848
Hi, Lloyd.

273
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,093
You devil.

274
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,228
Come here. Mmm-mmm!

275
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,351
Mmm.

276
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,154
I'm glad to see you, darling.

277
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,531
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

278
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,374
Lloyd, she's not ugly. She's a beautiful girl.

279
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,623
What are you talking about?
She's the ugliest girl I ever saw.

280
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,955
- Come here, you.
- Oh.

281
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,757
And that dress, I think it's terrible.

282
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,677
It just goes in and out... That's awful.

283
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,804
It's meant to go in and out.

284
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,472
I go in and out.

285
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,925
Well, we'll talk about that later.

286
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,652
Send Major Gruver's
luggage up to his room, will you?

287
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,324
That's beautiful, isn't it?

288
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,238
Are there any rules against it?

289
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,453
Oh, no, there are no rules against it.
But it's understood...

290
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,201
I thought the club would be honored!

291
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,292
Please, Mike, let's go.

292
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,291
What's she doing here?

293
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,588
Mother!

294
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,415
Well, isn't she with that young officer?

295
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,925
You know, this is a...

296
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,877
Kobe's a recreation center.

297
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,216
That's right, dear.

298
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,257
It degrades the uniform.
It's out-and-out fraternization.

299
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,425
Mother, she's beautiful.

300
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,761
All the more reason. Mark?

301
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,013
- Colonel Crawford?
- Yes, sir?

302
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,564
Let's get out of this clip joint.

303
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,771
Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

304
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,940
What's the trouble?

305
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,113
Oh, I didn't mean
to bother you with this, General.

306
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,071
But Captain Bailey here
is wanting to take her into the club.

307
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,236
General Webster, sir.

308
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,782
This young lady is one of
Japan's most famous dancers.

309
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,993
She's no ordinary...

310
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,458
Yes, I understand.

311
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,582
Even so, don't you realize

312
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,422
this club is only for American personnel?

313
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,840
Now...

314
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,091
We've been pretty easy
about fraternization in this area,

315
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,801
even though there are
very strict orders against it.

316
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,182
But, when an officer
who should be an example...

317
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,975
Am I to understand, sir,

318
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,311
that you personally refuse to allow me

319
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,650
to take this young lady into the club?

320
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,984
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I'm very embarrassed.

321
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,328
But I'm sorry.

322
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,491
Thank you.

323
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,118
Thank you, sir!

324
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,707
Don't you know that there's such a thing

325
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,329
as insolence through manner?

326
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,995
Thank you, sir.

327
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,510
Well, come on in, boys.
Eileen has to change.

328
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,509
Oh, Lloyd, Eileen's taking you
to the Kabuki tonight.

329
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,684
Oh, good.

330
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,970
We met Mr. Nakamura, the head actor,

331
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,638
and he invited her to come.

332
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,852
Now, Kabuki, isn't that the place
where there are no dames

333
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,525
and the men play all the women parts?

334
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,687
Oh, that's right.
The way they do at Princeton.

335
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,025
Come on, Mark.

336
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,439
Gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

337
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,766
You bring your lunch?

338
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,356
Miss Eileen Webster.

339
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,448
Who'd you find there?

340
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,452
Oh, that's Nakamura.
He's the one I met. He's very famous.

341
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,404
- That Nakamura?
- Uh-huh.

342
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,791
It's about a lady who turns into a lion.

343
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,333
He's going...
She's going to turn into a lion right here?

344
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,630
Uh-huh.

345
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,460
I want to see that.

346
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,147
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

347
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,902
I always have, and I guess I always will.

348
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,653
I love you, honey.

349
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,207
Awful glad you're here, too.

350
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,674
Everybody acting like nobody
ever kisses a woman.

351
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,794
She wouldn't be half so ugly

352
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,505
if she didn't stick her face
in that flour barrel.

353
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,638
She?

354
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,759
Well, whatever it was.

355
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,554
You got me.

356
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,313
He's a male actress.

357
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,195
It says here they've been
trained since childhood

358
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,576
to have the grace of a woman,

359
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,986
and yet the power of a man.

360
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,412
Oh, my word.

361
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,076
My Lord, that's my father!

362
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,065
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

363
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,617
Is that the same fellow?

364
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,911
Uh-huh.

365
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,468
All right, boy.

366
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,153
I am sure it must be very difficult

367
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,816
to enjoy theater so different from your own.

368
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,447
Well, we found it fascinating.

369
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,827
I am glad.

370
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,496
Kabuki is very old, isn't it?

371
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,621
Mmm. Some 300 years.

372
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,129
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

373
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,584
I should be happy to help you
know my country better

374
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,464
if at any time I can.

375
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:57,009
You did not enjoy the evening
so much, I fear, Major Gruver.

376
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,016
Oh, yeah, I thought it was a fine play.

377
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,559
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

378
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,945
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred

379
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,368
from Kabuki in the 17th century.

380
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,533
Well, I didn't mean to sound corny.

381
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,116
I just didn't know what to say about it.

382
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,452
Oh, please, do not apologize.

383
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,420
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

384
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,051
That's two of us. That's you and me, boy.

385
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,049
- Oh, no, don't do it to me.
- Oh, no, thank you.

386
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,685
I did real good. Thank you very much.

387
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,597
- Fine art.
- Let's go and see the garden.

388
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,683
Okay, you go on. I'll take this.

389
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,775
That's fine. Fine cooking. Very good.

390
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,655
Here you are, honey.

391
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,788
- No, thank you.
- Don't care for any?

392
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,248
Sit down, darling.

393
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,413
Mmm, you look awful pretty.

394
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,925
I've been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

395
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,426
Answer me one thing.

396
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,178
What's that, honey?

397
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,260
Why aren't we married now?

398
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,766
Isn't that a silly question?

399
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,393
No, not really.

400
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,066
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

401
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,022
Mmm, I suppose

402
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,730
the Korean War might have a little
something to do with it, don't you think?

403
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,946
Wasn't Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

404
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,905
Convenient?

405
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,866
What I really mean is,

406
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,083
do I mean everything to you,
as you do to me?

407
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,663
Of course you do, hon.
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,620
You see, I went to visit your mother

409
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,914
before I came here, there in Richmond.

410
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,047
My mother?

411
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,377
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives

412
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,804
and the way your father is content to go off

413
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,840
and leave her walled up
within a circle of friends

414
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,141
while he plunges off to the war...

415
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,184
Oh, honey, now, you just hold on a second.

416
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,512
You got to remember something.

417
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,643
My father's a general, honey.

418
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,895
And besides that,
my mother wants to live that way.

419
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,442
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

420
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,819
What do you mean? Now, don't tell me...

421
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,897
No woman wants to live any way except

422
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,482
body and soul with the man she loves.

423
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,863
Lloyd, you'll never tuck me away

424
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,569
in the corner of some little town.

425
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,154
Go ahead and become the greatest general

426
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,494
in Air Force history, but love me, too.

427
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,034
But I do love you, baby, I do.

428
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,585
Well, I guess all I'm trying to say is that,

429
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,588
and I really mean this, Lloyd,

430
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,930
if what you want is a family
like our fathers have,

431
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,426
and promotion in the Air Force,

432
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,513
and position in society
like our mothers have,

433
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,856
and you marry me
because I'm pretty and smart

434
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,526
and have guts and will know the ropes,

435
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,237
then I don't think
you ought to marry me, Lloyd.

436
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,871
I'm sorry.
I guess I've been thinking too much.

437
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,993
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

438
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,014
Now. Now, quit it.

439
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,398
Okay.

440
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,478
Oh, I don't know, maybe things
will turn out after all.

441
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,234
What do you mean
maybe it's going to turn out?

442
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,655
Sure it's gonna turn out.

443
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,607
It's just all that nonsense you talk about

444
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,739
every time we get together.

445
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,906
Nonsense? I...
I hadn't realized it was nonsense.

446
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,491
Of course it is, honey.

447
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,201
Listen, it's all very simple.

448
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,664
Now, lookit.

449
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,422
I want a wife and a family.

450
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,420
I want a home in America.

451
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,460
And every time I think of
having a home like that,

452
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,467
I always think about it with a girl like you.

453
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,390
I mean, a girl with a good
Army background like my own.

454
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,304
What do you mean a girl like me?
I'm not a type. I'm me.

455
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,598
Oh, Lloyd, it's me you've got to love.

456
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,689
Oh, Lloyd, haven't you ever felt

457
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,360
like grabbing me

458
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,814
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

459
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,024
What's the matter with you?

460
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,904
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

461
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,443
Then what's holding you back?

462
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,452
Oh, Eileen,
are you ever going to grow up, honey?

463
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,996
Don't you know there's a right time

464
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,789
and a wrong time to do things?

465
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,995
Aren't you ever gonna realize

466
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,792
that you have responsibilities
to other people,

467
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,624
that you have a position to fulfill,

468
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,629
that you're not alone in this world?

469
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,666
Oh, you defend yourself like a fort!

470
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,467
Listen, no matter how I defend myself,

471
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,797
hon, you've got to understand one thing,

472
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,754
that I am not in a position

473
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,970
to be hauling my fiancee away
to a shack somewhere

474
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,600
like an alley cat or something like that.

475
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,807
I wasn't brought up that way.

476
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,063
You're going to do everything
that's expected of you?

477
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,766
Well, I'm certainly going to try,
I'll tell you that.

478
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,396
Well, I don't expect you to marry me

479
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,695
just because it's expected of you.

480
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,192
Listen, you know sometimes I look at you,

481
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,864
and I don't understand you.

482
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,317
I don't know what's going on in your brain.

483
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,702
I think sometimes
I don't even know who you are

484
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,825
or what... Or what you're all about.

485
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,742
Maybe you don't. Maybe you never will.

486
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,805
"...so long as ye both shall live?"

487
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,060
I will.

488
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,184
Katsumi, "Wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband

489
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,891
"to live together after God's ordinance

490
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,692
"in the holiest state of matrimony?

491
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,610
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor

492
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,609
"and keep him, in sickness and in health

493
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,194
"and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him,

494
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,618
"so long as ye both shall live?"

495
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,204
She will.

496
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,916
"If any man can show just cause

497
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,622
"why they may not be
lawfully joined together

498
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,505
"let him now speak, or else hereafter
forever hold his peace."

499
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,724
Do you realize you waive
all your legal rights in this marriage?

500
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,888
Look, I signed all the papers, didn't I?

501
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,393
You'll look after your wife on your own.

502
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,399
The Air Force is not responsible.

503
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,901
Yeah, I know.

504
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,775
Romantic, ain't it, Major?

505
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,692
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

506
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,407
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

507
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,330
Just a minute.

508
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,142
That's it, Mrs. Kelly.

509
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,599
Just you and me now.

510
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,157
Where do we sign?

511
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,778
May as well witness this now, Major.

512
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,530
Yeah, all right.

513
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,626
Incidentally, it was a great honor
meeting you, Major Gruver.

514
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,793
Well, thank you.

515
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,334
Say, tell me, Consul,

516
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,084
are all these ceremonies
conducted like that?

517
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,804
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

518
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,139
We make the paperwork so difficult,

519
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,808
a good many of them lose steam.

520
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,184
Uh-huh.

521
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,888
Well, about how many, uh...

522
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,479
About how many GIs have gone
through this ceremony?

523
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,605
Oh, about 10,000.

524
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,113
Ten thousand? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn't you?

525
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,277
A few, yes.

526
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,319
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,243
How's your girl, Major?

528
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,662
Oh, Eileen?

529
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,288
I haven't seen her in a couple days.

530
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,671
I've been... You know, I've been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

531
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,092
And she's been hightailing it
with the brass, socializing.

532
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,754
Major,

533
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,430
ain't you going to kiss the bride?

534
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,762
Well, sure I'm going to kiss the bride!

535
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,595
Yeah.

536
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,392
Sure.

537
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,814
Now, listen, I want you
to take good care of this boy, hear?

538
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,198
Now, here's your ticket, honey.
Don't forget it.

539
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,861
Okay, boy.

540
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,706
Thanks, Major.

541
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,412
Took a lot of guts for you
to come here today.

542
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,038
Oh, quit.

543
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,879
If you want anybody taken care of,
or need a job done

544
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,376
that you West Point guys ain't allowed

545
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,799
to do yourselves, I'm your man.

546
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,464
Hold it. Now, I'm going to call on you, boy.

547
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,670
Come on. Let's get a belt.

548
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:54,758
All right.

549
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,635
- Nice to see you.
- How are you, Lloyd, dear?

550
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,466
Fine. Just fine.

551
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,801
That's a pretty dress you got on.

552
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,102
Thanks.

553
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,054
Lloyd, sit down, son.

554
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,681
All right.

555
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,103
Thank you for coming over
so promptly, Lloyd.

556
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,235
Well, that's all right.
I was just darning my socks.

557
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,317
Lloyd, um...

558
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,903
I don't know exactly how to put this.

559
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,572
It's a little embarrassing, for me, that is.

560
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,952
I understand you were a witness
at a marriage yesterday

561
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,625
between one of your men
and a Japanese girl.

562
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,626
Yeah, one man from my outfit in Korea.

563
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,048
Well, you realize, of course,
there's an Army policy

564
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,840
to discourage all such marriages.

565
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,434
Yeah, well, I think they couldn't
have been discouraged.

566
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,604
They're very much in love, and...

567
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,023
I dare say.

568
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,818
However, the fact that you personally

569
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,065
seemed to sanction the marriage...

570
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,774
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to give that impression at all.

571
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,403
I didn't sanction it, and as a matter of fact,

572
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,193
I tried to talk him out of it before.

573
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,954
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

574
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,532
Well...

575
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,122
You know, as long as
it's going to be inevitable,

576
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,670
I thought I might as well try
to make it as pleasant as possible.

577
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,131
Don't you see the position that puts me in?

578
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,294
And since I'm the Area Commander here, I...

579
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,133
No, you didn't do anything
to encourage this marriage, sir.

580
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,343
I believe I did all this on my own.

581
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,473
What do you mean on your own,
Lloyd, dear?

582
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,808
Everything you do reflects on the General.

583
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,890
After all, he is Eileen's father.

584
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,606
I'm afraid this places me in a position
of incompetence, Mrs. Webster,

585
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,193
when it comes to, you know,
doing anything to help my own men.

586
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,492
Let's stop beating around the bush.

587
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,906
What's wrong between you and Eileen?

588
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,705
You haven't been to see her
for several days.

589
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:49,952
Well,

590
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,415
you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

591
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,295
I'm embarrassed, too.

592
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,505
- What about?
- Well, about my whole situation here.

593
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,183
I'm a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.

594
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,641
Unfinished job. Now, suddenly,
I'm pulled off that job and sent over here

595
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,649
and plunked down at a desk
at this Interservice whatever it is,

596
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,184
and, you know, where, as far as I can see,

597
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,270
there's absolutely nothing to do.

598
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,400
You know, all so as I can be with Eileen.

599
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,823
There's nothing dishonest about it.

600
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,825
That is, if you plan to get married.

601
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,371
I think I know how Lloyd feels.

602
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,281
Do you plan to get married or not?

603
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,539
- Really, dear.
- Well, I'm her mother. I want to know.

604
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,918
Well, Mrs. Webster,

605
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,842
as of the moment,
Eileen isn't too sure about it.

606
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,339
And I...

607
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,342
Oh, we know, Lloyd, dear. Now, look.

608
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,975
There's evidently been some
slight strain between you two,

609
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,223
but don't let it become too important.

610
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,101
Now, this is Sunday night.
Why don't you call her up later

611
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,558
and ask her out to dinner or something?

612
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,893
Well...

613
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,729
Mother, I found the dearest little shop at...

614
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,946
Hi, Lloyd.

615
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,778
Hello, Eileen.

616
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,076
Lloyd just came in to see you.

617
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,028
- Oh?
- Oh, yeah.

618
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,573
Listen...

619
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,916
Listen, I thought
Sunday night, and I thought maybe

620
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,839
you and I can go out
and catch a movie or something.

621
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,258
Feel like it?

622
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,754
I'm sorry, Lloyd.
I'm having dinner with some friends tonight.

623
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,047
Well,

624
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,470
what about tomorrow?

625
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,182
That's booked, too, I'm afraid.

626
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,108
Well, looks as though
I'm holding some pretty tough cards.

627
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,106
What about next week?

628
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,822
Of course, Lloyd. Call me?

629
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,948
Okay.

630
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,165
Mrs. Webster, General.

631
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,287
Goodbye, Lloyd.

632
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,127
- Bye, Eileen.
- Bye, Lloyd.

633
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,346
Oh, Eileen. Why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

634
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,852
Because I don't want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

635
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,645
Besides,

636
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,810
I do have a date with that young Lieutenant

637
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,820
and his wife from Fort Bragg.

638
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,572
Whole bunch of us.

639
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,782
I hope you don't lose my man for me.

640
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,514
Boy, give me a martini, will you?

641
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,480
Nope, make it lemonade.

642
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,655
No, dog. Give me a scotch and soda.

643
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,694
- Scotch and soda.
- Yeah.

644
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,909
Scotch and soda, sir.

645
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,787
There's such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

646
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,960
Well, I hate to admit it,
but I guess that's what I said.

647
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,176
Well, I thought it sounded kind of strange

648
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,588
coming from a guy
who shot down nine MiGs.

649
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,306
Well, that's kind of a reflex action.

650
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,054
I'm a West Point man, you know.

651
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,228
I guess, it sneaks out sometimes.

652
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,312
Now, listen, Captain, what does a fellow do

653
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,394
around here after the sun goes down?

654
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,775
Why?

655
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,235
You on the loose?

656
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,487
Uh... Halfway.

657
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,073
Bring him another.

658
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,865
What part of the South are you from?

659
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,292
Almost any old place
that's got an Army post on it.

660
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,923
I was all set to take the exams at West Point

661
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,254
and there was a teacher there

662
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,462
who made me take a part in a school play.

663
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,132
They were doing one of those
Hungarian things by Molnar.

664
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,095
You never did hear a Hungarian play

665
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,103
played in a Southern accent, did you?

666
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,056
No, I'm afraid I missed that.

667
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,852
That's a shame,
because I was awful good in it.

668
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,611
Anyhow, I suddenly didn't want
to go to West Point

669
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,609
and didn't want
to have anything to do with it.

670
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,990
And my mother come up to the school,

671
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,286
and she said,
"We always expected you to go to the Point

672
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,289
"like your father and his father before him."

673
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,871
And I told her,

674
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,505
I said I had an idea about
a whole different way of life.

675
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,677
What did she say to that?

676
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,471
She said something like,

677
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,224
"If I ever once had that idea,

678
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,724
"I shouldn't let anything stop me."

679
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:04,476
And she couldn't come right out and say,
"Don't go to the Point."

680
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,564
You know, but I know what she meant.

681
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,231
Then, of course,
my father flew up from Texas and...

682
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,816
He put you straight, huh?

683
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,698
No, he just looked at me and said,

684
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,906
"If you don't want to go to the Point,
don't go to the Point.

685
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,617
"The unhappiest men I know are those

686
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,751
"who are forced into something
they got no inaptitude for."

687
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,883
How did he force you to go to the Point?

688
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,053
That's what I'm telling you.
He didn't force me. He just...

689
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,348
We just had a little talk,
and he flew back to Texas

690
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,509
and I went on to the Point.

691
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,307
I see.

692
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,641
Well, uh, I'll tell you
something though, Mike.

693
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,653
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

694
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,272
Except, just lately,

695
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,447
I've had some old feeling come back on me.

696
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,911
I don't know if I want to go on

697
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,910
in the Air Force and buck for a star

698
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,117
and get married in the Webster family

699
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,544
and get swallowed up by all that.

700
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,874
I think maybe my old lady was right.

701
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,335
Well, what does it all mean?

702
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,886
Eternal struggle, sex,

703
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,551
New York Yankees.

704
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,433
All right. Quit, now. Come on.

705
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,982
Isn't that a nice-looking bridge?

706
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,817
Yeah,
that's the Bitchi-Bashi.

707
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,239
Say what?

708
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,994
The Bitchi-Bashi.

709
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,368
<i>Bashi</i> is Japanese for "bridge."

710
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,125
We call this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

711
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,625
because there's so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

712
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,586
Did you say stuff?

713
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,092
Brother, I said stuff.

714
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,344
Will you kindly tell me what
we're standing in the bushes for?

715
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,596
- Can't touch it.
- Why not?

716
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,771
Well, you see, these girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

717
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,141
They just cross over there
on the way to the theater

718
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,272
from those cells over there,
those dormitories.

719
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,105
Oh, that's right.
Somebody told me about that.

720
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,443
Hey, boy, is that anything
going over there now?

721
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,540
Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

722
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,788
Wait for me, buddy.

723
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,032
There's Fumiko-<i>san.</i>
The one you saw me with.

724
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,905
- Yeah. The little one in pink.
- Yeah, that's the one.

725
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,783
You're not going over there and say hello?

726
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,998
What, in public?
A Matsubayashi girl? Are you nuts?

727
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,413
Well, you take her to the officers' club.

728
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,373
Well, that's for Americans.

729
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,505
Thought I could sneak her in there
without her being recognized.

730
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,007
What happens if they catch them?

731
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,760
Immediate dismissal.

732
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,511
- No fooling?
- Yeah.

733
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,393
No Matsubayashi girl
is allowed to have dates of any kind.

734
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,850
You were dating her, you.

735
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,227
Yeah, well, I'm different.

736
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,476
Oh, get out of here.

737
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,861
Well, like I told President Truman,

738
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,065
"Harry, you was wrong
when you sold the Marines short."

739
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,024
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, son,

740
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,860
but you Air Force men
just wouldn't understand.

741
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,119
Lord!

742
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,206
- Well, the Marines have got <i>l'amour.</i>
- Oh, Lord.

743
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,288
And these girls, they got fame and wealth

744
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,869
and bright lights.

745
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,541
But they ain't got <i>l'amour.</i>

746
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,418
- Well, you got <i>l'amour,</i> haven't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

747
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,220
What's going on there now?

748
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,097
- Hana-ogi's coming.
- Who?

749
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,679
Hana-ogi. She's the top, number one.

750
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,064
Come on. Let's go.

751
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,507
Well, how come she's dressed like that?

752
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,211
Well, the tall ones play men's parts, mostly.

753
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,509
They play women's parts, too.

754
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,465
How do you do?

755
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,099
What do you say let's see the show?

756
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,601
Well, come on, Ace.

757
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,561
- Hmm?
- I say, do you follow the plot?

758
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,472
Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

759
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,455
Listen, are you sure
they're coming back this way?

760
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,879
Just keep yourself in check, son.

761
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,633
Am I nuts, or is she
the greatest thing I ever saw?

762
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,178
Whatever you're thinking, forget it.
You ain't going anyplace.

763
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,803
Oh, yeah? How's this for an introduction?

764
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,475
She's coming along the walk
and I just kind of walk on by

765
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,013
and slip my arm around her, just cozy style.
What do you think of that?

766
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,769
I think we better go.

767
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,978
- Now, wait just...
- Major!

768
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,484
Hey, kiddo! How are you?

769
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,315
How's everything?

770
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,650
Saw you at the show.
We been looking for you.

771
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,486
Listen, I want you to meet Captain Bailey.

772
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,692
This is Airman Kelly.

773
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,276
How are you, Kelly? Nice to meet you.

774
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,069
- How do you do, sir?
- How you been, boy?

775
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,370
Oh, fine.

776
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,038
Hey. Here's Katsumi.

777
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,616
Hello there, Katsumi.

778
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,289
Say something, kid.

779
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,626
It is fine to see you among us tonight.

780
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,131
She's speaking better English
than you are, boy.

781
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,006
She's been taking English lessons,

782
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,046
and I've been studying a little Japanese.

783
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,801
Let's hear you go.

784
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,846
Uh...

785
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,638
Well, I hope he can get rid of it, don't you?

786
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,933
Means "My feet are cold."
She always laughs when I say that.

787
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,022
Listen, how you been?
How you getting along down there?

788
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,445
Oh, just fine, Major.

789
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,068
We got a wonderful house
down by the canal.

790
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,320
Hey, Kelly, didn't you tell me

791
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,111
that Katsumi knows
those Matsubayashi girls?

792
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,367
Oh, sure. She's a real fan.

793
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,866
Well, listen, I want you
to do something for me.

794
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:13,286
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi,

795
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,463
and I want you to ask her if she won't,
you know, kind of introduce me?

796
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,315
She says the rules are very strict,

797
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,437
but she'll go over and ask her.

798
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,443
Well, she will ask her?

799
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,610
Oh, yeah.

800
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,237
'Cause you know what I said, I said
to Truman when he came over to the house,

801
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,445
I says, "Harry," I said,
"don't ever sell the Air Force short."

802
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,754
All right, boy,
now you're going to see something.

803
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,844
Here comes Fumiko-<i>san.</i>

804
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,497
- Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

805
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,629
You ain't going to let me down, are you?
Go on.

806
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,006
- It's all right, Major.
- Hmm?

807
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,311
How do, Miss Ogi?

808
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,364
You think you made the grade, Ace?

809
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,449
Yes. She gave me a nice little look there.

810
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,329
Oh, she sure did.

811
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:36,312
Uh, she says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

812
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,023
Why not?

813
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,064
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

814
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,861
Oh, shoot. I didn't do it.

815
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,069
Sure you did, Ace.

816
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,033
We all did.

817
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,153
Come on.

818
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,034
Come on, Ace.

819
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,678
Listen, if they're so strict
with you girls over there,

820
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,185
how come you go out
with Mike on dates and fool around?

821
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,559
It is very bad of me,

822
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,891
but I cannot help myself.

823
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,859
He's so tall!

824
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,986
Well, he's a big boy, all right.

825
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,284
I mean, there's no fooling about that.

826
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,903
But, listen,

827
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,661
what I really want to know is,

828
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,625
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates?

829
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,792
You know, like you and Mike and...

830
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,916
No.

831
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,043
She is number-one girl.

832
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,170
Must be specially careful.

833
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,417
Well,

834
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,009
I want you to do me a favor.
Now, will you do it?

835
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,634
When you go back to the dormitory tonight,

836
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,931
I want you to tell Hana-ogi

837
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,231
that Major Gruver would
like to meet her and...

838
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,562
Now wait. Now wait. Just a minute.

839
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,229
I just want to talk to her for a little while.

840
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,442
Now, will you do that for me?

841
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,698
Never happen!

842
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,819
Hana-ogi-<i>san</i> never speak men,

843
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,617
and with American, never happen.

844
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,577
Well, honey, I am here to tell you

845
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,666
that it's going to
happen.

846
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,997
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.

847
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,085
I wonder if I could...

848
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,962
If I could have your autograph?

849
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,935
Thank you very much.

850
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,123
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

851
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,387
Hi, Major.

852
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,806
I've been looking for you.

853
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,271
Hello, Mr. Kelly.

854
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,811
Wife says to be at the house tonight.

855
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,240
Now, listen, I'll tell you, boy, I've got a...

856
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:43,616
I have an engagement this evening
with a friend of mine.

857
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,998
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi's coming.

858
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,041
Sir.

859
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,293
- Kelly!
- Be there early.

860
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,258
Kelly!

861
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,698
- Hello.
- Hello!

862
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,997
Hey. You know where Joe Kelly lives?

863
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,621
Over there?

864
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,080
Well, you show me, will you?

865
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,057
How do you do?

866
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,779
Oh. Hiya, Ace.

867
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,240
Hey, Kelly, is that you?

868
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,067
How are you, Alice?

869
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,865
- How are you, Ace? Nice to see you.
- Good. Fine.

870
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:07,994
Come in the house.

871
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,414
Wait a second.
Let me just take a check here.

872
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,116
- Did she come yet?
- No, not yet.

873
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,167
Katsumi.

874
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,765
- Okay.
- What did she say?

875
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,395
Don't ask me, son...

876
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,181
Hey! Off with the shoes.

877
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,274
You don't wear shoes in a Japanese house.

878
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,522
Okay, coming off. What about the pants?

879
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,945
The room on your right.

880
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,739
- Where, here?
- That's it.

881
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,703
Watch your head, Ace. Well, this is it.

882
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,907
Well, listen, this is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

883
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,372
Sit down over here, Ace. That's the
place of honor in a Japanese house.

884
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,498
Over there?

885
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,548
Listen, what's this thing?

886
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,629
Oh, this is an armrest.

887
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,086
Armrest?

888
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,300
Well, it'll be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

889
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,978
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

890
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,602
Yeah.

891
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,658
It is very nice to have you

892
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,501
among us.

893
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,331
Well, it's very nice to be among you, too.

894
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,140
Listen, I brought you a little couple of things

895
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,349
you can stick around the house.

896
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:58,810
Yeah, flowers.

897
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,608
You've made her very happy, Ace.

898
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,034
What has she got here?
We going to eat this or wear it? What is it?

899
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:15,039
No, this is a little towel
that they serve before a meal or a drink,

900
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,291
just a little refresher
for your hands and face.

901
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,369
Listen, that's a good idea.

902
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,295
Wash them up.

903
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,374
Okay, clean the ears well.
Do I pass, teacher?

904
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,882
Just dump it in the basket.

905
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,551
Yes, sir.

906
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,050
What's this, an eyecup?

907
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,390
We've got to wash our eyes out, too?

908
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,938
No, that's a cup for sake.
That's a wine made out of rice.

909
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,725
Rice? No fooling?

910
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,234
Yeah, no fooling.

911
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,438
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Here, taste it, you'll see.

912
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,735
Feels warm.

913
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,691
That's right,
we heat it up before we serve it.

914
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,407
Really? Well...

915
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,246
Katsumi, here's to your health.

916
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,078
And, Kelly, the very best to you.

917
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,704
That's all right, boy. It's not bad.

918
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,794
Told you, it's wonderful.

919
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,050
- Listen, aren't you going to have anything?
- Oh.

920
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,426
Yeah. I was just going to say, you know,

921
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,054
there's kind of a polite thing you do, like,

922
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,932
you take the cup
and you swish it around in the water,

923
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,093
and you pour some sake in it for her.

924
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,769
Okay.

925
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:19,928
That's right.

926
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,068
- It means "A little bit."
- Little bit, all righty.

927
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,230
Hold on now, wait.

928
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,773
Okay.

929
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,783
See? Didn't hurt.

930
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,455
Well, she's going to get me
under the table here in five minutes

931
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:42,584
if she's going like this.

932
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,961
- She'll keep pouring all night.
- How...

933
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,960
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-<i>san</i> now.

934
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,969
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

935
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,680
You go ahead, darling. Go right ahead.

936
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,135
Go right ahead.

937
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,308
Okay.

938
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,643
Present. Whiskey.

939
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,106
Whiskey?

940
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,112
Okay.

941
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,490
All right, darling.

942
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,925
Listen, boy, she's just as cute as a bug.

943
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,253
You ain't going...
You ain't going to lose with her.

944
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,181
See what I mean, Ace?
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

945
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,885
Hey. You want to see the rest of the house?

946
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,847
- Yeah.
- Come on, I'll show you.

947
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:51,187
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I'm showing him around the house.

948
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,783
The bathroom is back there.

949
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,361
We got a couple of extra rooms in here.

950
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,196
- Would you like to see them?
- Yeah.

951
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,241
Well, what have you got here, boy?

952
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,243
Oh, Lord.

953
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,166
We haven't done anything with these yet,

954
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,084
but maybe someday, if we expand.

955
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,386
Mmm-hmm.

956
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,922
Well, listen, it's really
working out for you, isn't it, boy?

957
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,382
Everything perfect,

958
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,889
except for that rat of a colonel
I'm assigned to.

959
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,055
You wouldn't be talking about
a fellow named Crawford, would you?

960
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,231
That's the guy.
He rides every guy around here

961
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,900
that's married to a Japanese girl.
Extra duty, everything.

962
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,102
Yeah...

963
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,939
Well, he's a rough carver.
There's no getting around that.

964
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:37,742
Ah, so what do I care?
I come home to my girl and I forget it.

965
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,069
- Let's go.
- Wait, listen, I forgot to ask you.

966
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:43,406
Does this Hana...
This Hana-ogi speak any English?

967
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,536
Because I'm going to be...

968
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,746
Well, I don't know.
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

969
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,752
I guess she'll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

970
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,794
- You nasty boy, you.
- Come on. Let's...

971
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,922
Wait a minute,
I've just got to take a look at my grass, now.

972
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,799
I want to know. Are we going to be,

973
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,178
you know, all four of us
going to be together all evening long?

974
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:04,100
Take it easy, Ace.
You're going to blow a fuse.

975
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,265
Well, uh...

976
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:09,765
Might be.

977
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,193
- Lord, one of us is wrong here!
- Watch your head, Ace.

978
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,071
You should walk in your house, Kelly...

979
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:19,529
Katsumi, you ready?

980
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:20,860
Stoop-shouldered.

981
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,617
In here? You're going to have to change...

982
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,626
Hey, Kelly...

983
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,675
Hana-ogi-<i>san.</i>

984
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,769
This is a great day for our house.

985
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,317
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

986
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,732
Hey. Where are you going?

987
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,113
Oh, I've got to help Katsumi with the...

988
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,322
Huh?

989
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,127
Well, it looks as though everybody
just ran off and left us alone here.

990
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,299
It certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

991
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,836
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

992
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,343
Uh...

993
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,175
I'll just sit down here.

994
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,101
Well, Miss Ogi,

995
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,026
let me fix you a little drink.

996
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,854
No, now, well...

997
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,272
Well, okay.

998
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,205
Here's to you.

999
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,367
Mmm!

1000
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,872
That's good.

1001
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,874
Now, don't tell me.

1002
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,039
I know you've got to slosh this
around in here a little bit

1003
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,175
and get the dribble off,
and give it right back to you.

1004
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,012
See, now you take that.

1005
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,134
All right.

1006
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,563
You know, I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

1007
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,394
We have
rice back home in America.

1008
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,982
Of course, we just...

1009
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,907
Well, we just make rice pudding out of it.
And we don't drink it.

1010
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,694
Uh, this is the first liquid rice I ever ran into.

1011
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,087
You know, did...

1012
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,171
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,

1013
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,343
that you're a fine-looking woman?

1014
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,801
I mean, real fine.

1015
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:52,603
You're even better-looking
off the stage than you are on.

1016
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,104
That's true.

1017
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,066
You get up there,
and sing, dance, act, everything.

1018
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,103
You're all-around great.

1019
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,945
I wonder, where did him and Katsumi...

1020
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,534
I'm getting kind of hungry in here.

1021
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,045
Look, Miss Ogi, um...

1022
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,467
I'm not up too good
on Japanese ways of doing things,

1023
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,136
and maybe I'm saying the wrong thing.

1024
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:30,300
I mean, maybe
my American manners are embarrassing.

1025
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,518
But I figure, as long as you
came over here tonight,

1026
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,722
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me, too.

1027
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,067
Now, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm wrong,

1028
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,271
then you've got to tell me.

1029
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,154
Where do we go from here?

1030
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,607
'Cause I don't know what to say.

1031
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,651
I'm running out of things to say.

1032
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,332
My father was killed

1033
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,915
by American bomb dropped on my country.

1034
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,294
You have been my enemy.

1035
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,924
I have hated Americans.

1036
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,681
I have thought they are savages.

1037
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,845
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

1038
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,685
Miss Ogi.

1039
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,477
There were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed, too.

1040
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,406
And I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

1041
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,278
You have been watching me at the bridge.

1042
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,118
Watching me dance,

1043
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,789
watching me as I go back to the dormitory.

1044
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,547
But I have been watching you, too,

1045
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,007
and you have not looked like a savage.

1046
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,137
And when Katsumi-<i>san</i>
told me how gently you'd kissed her,

1047
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,469
the day she became a bride,

1048
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,977
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

1049
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,028
I realized the hate was of my own making.

1050
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,448
That is why I came

1051
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,323
to ask you to forgive me

1052
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,620
for what I have been feeling.

1053
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,242
Gruver-<i>san,</i> will you forgive me?

1054
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,045
Well, you make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

1055
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,464
I really feel that I ought to

1056
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,434
ask you to forgive me
for some of the things that...

1057
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,103
I've been thinking.

1058
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,938
I come from the north of Japan.

1059
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,771
And my father was a farmer,

1060
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,152
and there were nine children.

1061
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,696
And we were very poor.

1062
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,822
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

1063
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,701
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

1064
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,961
and now I am first dancer of all.

1065
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,087
When I am too old to dance,

1066
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,252
I will become head teacher.

1067
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,593
My life is planned.

1068
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,184
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi

1069
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:23,264
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

1070
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,814
I have never been in love.

1071
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,318
But I have dreamed

1072
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,991
and thought about it,

1073
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,486
and waited.

1074
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,492
The danger that lies ahead of us,

1075
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,748
we must face now.

1076
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,799
The danger of discovery for both of us,

1077
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,711
danger of weakness

1078
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,714
when it is over.

1079
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,974
I will never fall in love again.

1080
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,820
But I will love you, Ace-<i>san,</i>

1081
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,111
if that is your desire.

1082
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,116
- Hello, how do you do?
- How do you do?

1083
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,490
Ah, Miss Webster.

1084
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,117
Oh, hello.

1085
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,124
Oh, Mr. Nakamura,
how nice of you to come.

1086
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,455
It is a great pleasure.

1087
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,087
And may I say that
you look especially beautiful today?

1088
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:15,467
Thank you.

1089
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,385
I haven't been to see
this month's Kabuki program.

1090
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,093
I know. You see,
I have been waiting.

1091
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,468
Eileen.

1092
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,846
- Eileen.
- Oh, Mother, you remember Mr. Nakamura.

1093
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:24,972
How do you do,
Mrs. Webster?

1094
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,429
Oh, yes, of course.
Now, listen, you two,

1095
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,355
this party isn't
given especially for you.

1096
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,104
You've got to
circulate around

1097
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,401
and do more to cement
Japanese-American relations.

1098
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,735
Mother, that's exactly
what Mr. Nakamura and I are doing.

1099
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,115
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, Nakamura-<i>san,</i>

1100
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,284
my little girl
wants your autograph.

1101
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,614
She admires you so.

1102
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,116
Of course.

1103
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,451
Will you please
excuse me?

1104
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,910
- Yes, of course.
- Certainly.

1105
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,119
Has Lloyd come yet?

1106
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,794
Oh, Mother, how many
weeks are you going to keep on pretending?

1107
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,716
Lloyd is not coming.

1108
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,294
I'm absolutely furious at him.

1109
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,220
How can he ignore
the General's invitation?

1110
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,549
I had it delivered
personally to his office.

1111
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,884
I'm stuck with that
Farrington woman. Can you help me out?

1112
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,310
Uh-oh. There's Crawford.

1113
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,608
Whenever he shows up,
there's always something.

1114
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,395
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute, General?

1115
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,730
Certainly, Colonel.

1116
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,236
- Major, do you have that list of the...
- Yes, ma'am.

1117
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,194
I want to see if
the Williams have come yet...

1118
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,403
Yes, they have.

1119
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,747
Oh, waiter.

1120
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,914
The reason I took
this up with you personally, General,

1121
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,545
is because
it concerns Major Gruver.

1122
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,002
Now, we think
he's hooked on to a Japanese dame.

1123
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,340
Shh! Colonel!

1124
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,005
Well, I'm sorry, General,
but this thing's gotten me all riled up.

1125
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,549
Do you realize what it will mean

1126
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,179
to the enlisted men in this area

1127
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,387
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with some...

1128
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,349
I've known
Major Gruver all his life.

1129
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,435
I'm a close friend of his father's.
I assure you must be wrong.

1130
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,566
He was seen going
into that house.

1131
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,865
Now, my men have been
watching a troublemaker named Kelly.

1132
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,033
He shacked up with
another native girl...

1133
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,406
"Shacked up," Colonel?

1134
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:08,614
Kelly's married to a Japanese girl.
Major Gruver was the best man.

1135
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,037
Seems quite natural
to me that he'd visit them.

1136
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,084
All right.
How am I going to handle the situation?

1137
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,334
Well, don't handle it.
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

1138
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,255
Well, General, is it all right with you
if I post an order

1139
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:23,052
to keep these
officers from being seen

1140
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,384
with indigenous personnel?

1141
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,467
Then if they are seen,
there's something we can do about it.

1142
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,802
All right.
All right.

1143
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,535
Lloyd.

1144
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,345
Look at you, Hana.

1145
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,607
No one saw you come?

1146
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:22,854
No, there's no military
personnel around here,

1147
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,280
except me.

1148
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,109
We must go to the tea ceremony.

1149
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,573
Yeah, I know.

1150
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,738
I know.

1151
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,201
Good afternoon.

1152
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,798
This getting up
and down likely to kill me.

1153
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,625
You make such
a production of everything.

1154
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,256
The pleasure does not
lie in the end itself.

1155
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,627
It's the pleasure of
all steps to that end.

1156
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:27,886
Oh, I see.

1157
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,328
That you, Ace?

1158
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,584
Yeah, Kelly.

1159
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,836
Come on in here.

1160
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,296
I can't right now.

1161
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,547
He'd be surprised
you come in this way.

1162
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,215
He'd faint.

1163
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,344
Just a little
lower, little lower, Katsumi.

1164
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,384
- You always seem to be a little above it.
- Oh?

1165
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,513
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1166
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,115
Kelly-<i>san,</i> now you get in tub?

1168
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,658
Okay, all right.

1169
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,447
Is Hana-ogi
coming over tonight?

1170
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,869
Yeah, if she can get away.

1171
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,625
We're going to cook up
some fine Saint Louis goulash

1172
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,578
with a little Memphis
greens in there.

1173
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,630
What are you doing
tonight after dinner

1174
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,804
when Hana-ogi goes
back to the theater?

1175
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,847
Nothing.

1176
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,471
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

1177
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,349
Oh, I'll be delighted
to take your money and your pants.

1178
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,435
This is the life,
ain't it, Ace?

1179
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,182
There you are.

1180
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,523
How do you do?

1181
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,663
Listen, I got
one word for you.

1182
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,798
What is that?

1183
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,550
- Food.
- Oh.

1184
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:28,937
<i>Sayonara</i>

1185
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:33,902
<i>Japanese goodbye</i>

1186
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:39,119
<i>Whisper sayonara</i>

1187
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:43,285
<i>Lover, don't you cry</i>

1188
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:49,416
<i>No more we stop to see</i>

1189
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,417
<i>Pretty cherry blossom</i>

1190
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,306
<i>No more we beneath the tree</i>

1191
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:03,264
<i>Looking at the sky</i>

1192
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:09,061
<i>Sayonara</i>

1193
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:14,396
<i>Sayonara</i>

1194
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,985
<i>Goodbye</i>

1195
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,116
That's the cutest
thing I ever saw, honey.

1196
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,576
I must go.

1197
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,504
Good eating.

1198
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:35,709
Bye-bye.

1199
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,094
Are you going back
to the officer's quarters tonight?

1200
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,181
No, I think I'm going
to just fool around here.

1201
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,263
What will you
do all evening?

1202
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,020
What am I going to do?
I'm going to get some beer,

1203
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,641
some pretzels,
and some girls up here.

1204
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,394
I'm going to have
a little fun for a change.

1205
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,483
Good.

1206
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,435
I don't like
you to be lonely.

1207
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,571
Take care.

1208
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:27,893
Come on in, Katsumi.

1209
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,651
I'm sorry,
Lloyd, I had to come. It's important.

1210
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,941
Hello, Eileen.

1211
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,650
How are you?

1212
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,703
Listen, sit down,
will you?

1213
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,533
Take this stuff
out of there, just getting a little...

1214
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,131
Go on, sit down here.

1215
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,845
How are you?

1216
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,273
They're after you, Lloyd.

1217
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,819
Who's after me?

1218
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,857
There's a colonel.
His name's Crawford.

1219
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,485
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,363
I know him.

1221
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,582
He's the one that's riding Kelly.
This is Kelly's house.

1222
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,369
Yes. Yes, I know.

1223
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,373
You want to hear this,
don't you, Lloyd?

1224
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,084
Yeah. Sure, I want to.
Of course I do.

1225
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,677
I overheard
Colonel Crawford say

1226
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,964
that he's been having
this house watched,

1227
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:51,557
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

1228
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,931
Anyhow, that's how
I knew where it was.

1229
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:58,063
Well, then they...

1230
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,274
They seen me coming
in and out of here.

1231
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,606
Yes.

1232
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,244
I just felt that
I had to tell you.

1233
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,084
Eileen, uh...

1234
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,584
There's something that I feel that...

1235
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,999
I must go, Lloyd.

1236
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:25,303
I just wanted to warn
you to be particularly careful about...

1237
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,261
About what, honey?

1238
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,563
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

1239
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,772
Oh, Lloyd, they'll do
anything to hang something on you, to...

1240
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:42,611
To keep you in line.

1241
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,155
After all, you're
the Air Force's pinup boy, you know.

1242
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,665
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

1243
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,964
You know, more than
anything else I could think of, I...

1244
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,667
I must
go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

1245
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,138
Wait a minute,
let me help you off...

1246
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,809
Eileen, I know...

1247
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,186
Lloyd.

1248
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,683
Lloyd, you've really
thought seriously

1249
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,184
about what you're
doing, haven't you?

1250
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,604
Oh, yes.

1251
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,156
I think I have.

1252
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,526
Oh, I hope so.

1253
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,620
You have a brilliant
record in the Air Force.

1254
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,373
More people depend
upon you than you'll ever know.

1255
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,833
Before you throw all that
you've worked for away, Lloyd, be sure.

1256
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,505
Please, be sure.

1257
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:50,430
Eileen, I don't think
if I had a million years,

1258
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,347
I could tell you
how all this happened.

1259
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,350
I'd better go before
I lose all my charm.

1260
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:31,053
Do you like this old,
curious play?

1261
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,929
Yeah, I'm beginning
to get a kick out of it.

1262
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,141
See the rope
between the rocks?

1263
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,727
Yeah.

1264
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,905
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

1265
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,656
What, the rocks?

1266
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,280
Yes.
They've been together so long,

1267
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,703
our people thought
it was time they should get married.

1268
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,448
They look well
together, don't you think?

1269
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,080
Yeah, they make
a handsome-looking couple.

1270
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,665
Do you like my country?

1271
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:06,247
Yeah. Was all these...
All these funny things here before

1272
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,790
when I came to Japan?

1273
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,091
Yes.

1274
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,932
Well, hello.

1275
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,105
Hello there, Double Ugly.
How are you?

1276
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,232
To what do we
owe the honor of this visit?

1277
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:30,105
Laundry. Gonna put down
the dirties and pick up the cleans.

1278
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,403
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1279
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,533
This came in
the office this morning.

1280
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,704
Thought you might
like to see it.

1281
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,709
"This is a routine reminder
of the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe."

1282
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:47,163
Quote, "Any public display,
whatever, of affection

1283
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,750
"for a Japanese national
by a member of this command is forbidden.

1284
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,636
"Officers should not even
appear on public streets

1285
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:57,136
"accompanied by indigenous
female personnel." Unquote.

1286
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,341
Hooray for Christmas.

1287
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:01,185
Come on, Ace, this is
serious. Everybody got one of these things.

1288
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:05,265
Oh, listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I are
just as careful as we can be.

1289
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,731
We never go anyplace where we're gonna be
seen by anybody that matters.

1290
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,646
We don't even walk
down the same street.

1291
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,986
We just go out
in the country and fool around.

1292
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:18,569
See, listen, you never been to the
country around here, have you?

1293
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,911
Awful pretty country around here.
I mean it.

1294
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,493
You know what
I saw yesterday?

1295
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,170
I saw two rocks
that just got married.

1296
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,626
You what?

1297
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,836
I saw two rocks
that got married.

1298
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,672
And they looked very
happy together, too.

1299
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,344
Oh, I'll bet they did.

1300
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:36,804
Oh, they did.

1301
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,800
If you gonna be smart,
I'll tell you what you do.

1302
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,727
You get your little shoes shined,
you go out tonight,

1303
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:46,305
'cause tonight is
gonna be Tanabata.

1304
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,684
Okay, what's Tanabata?

1305
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,987
You mean you're gonna
sit there with your bare face hanging out

1306
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,693
and tell me
you don't know what Tanabata is?

1307
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:55,773
Yeah.

1308
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:58,155
Well, my word, boy.

1309
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:01,196
I'm ashamed of you. I thought
everybody knew what Tanabata was.

1310
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,198
Tanabata is
the night of love.

1311
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,875
You told me
all about it one time.

1312
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,954
You were telling me
about Harry Truman

1313
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,289
and New York Yankees
and sex

1314
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,925
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

1315
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,547
And I'll see you...

1316
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,048
Sex!

1317
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,524
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

1318
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,903
I have seen this night of
Tanabata come and go many times,

1319
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:47,788
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

1320
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,790
Tanabata.

1321
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:55,125
Oh, my heart is so
full of love for you.

1322
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,961
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

1323
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,506
Nakamura-<i>san</i> gets your note.

1324
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,841
Here is reply.

1325
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,924
Thank you.

1326
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:49,516
He wishes if you will have
dinner with him and his guests.

1327
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,097
Thank you very much.

1328
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:26,265
They have a rather
pleasant garden here, Miss Webster.

1329
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,176
Would you like to see it?

1330
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,554
Yes, I think I would.

1331
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:57,713
How beautiful.

1332
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,892
What are you
really afraid of, Miss Webster?

1333
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,436
You don't think
it would enter Major Gruver's mind

1334
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:15,560
to marry a Japanese girl?

1335
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,893
I don't know.

1336
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:22,192
Then permit me
to reassure you.

1337
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,697
I think Major Gruver
is brave

1338
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:28,110
but not brave enough
to face the censure

1339
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:30,742
that would result
from such a marriage.

1340
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,583
As for our famous,
honored Hana-ogi,

1341
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,628
there are many Japanese,

1342
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:39,080
most of them, in fact,

1343
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:43,301
who look upon marriage
to an occidental with as much distaste

1344
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:46,299
as your people do
to one of us.

1345
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,595
I do not feel that way.

1346
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,725
But, then,
I have had the privilege

1347
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,635
of traveling
in your country

1348
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,564
and knowing some
great people there.

1349
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:01,732
And I am especially
conscious at this moment

1350
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,693
that beauty
is not confined to any one race.

1351
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,413
Do not turn away,
Miss Webster.

1352
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:17,869
I am not necessarily
making love to you.

1353
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,048
I am only stating a very

1354
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,214
obvious fact.

1355
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:30,635
May I see you again,
Miss Webster,

1356
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:34,806
and acquaint you
with more Japan?

1357
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,513
Of course.

1358
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:40,099
I need to know more,
much more,

1359
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,810
about everything.

1360
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,503
There she is.

1361
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,135
Hello, honey.

1362
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,104
Are you tired?

1363
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:29,489
No, I just...
I just been lying here

1364
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,366
thinking about myself.

1365
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,160
You know,
I can't believe I'm really here.

1366
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,622
It's hard to believe that...

1367
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:41,202
You know, it's hard
to believe me being the same Lloyd Gruver

1368
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,042
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

1369
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:48,633
You know, I been thinking

1370
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,881
that all my life

1371
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,130
I been so busy

1372
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:57,306
snapping to,
and giving orders, and taking orders,

1373
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:00,729
and being a general's son,
and doing the job

1374
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:06,068
and all that,
I just never took time to sit right down

1375
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:12,071
and, you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

1376
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,992
And I been spending
some afternoons here just

1377
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:20,908
being peaceful

1378
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,043
and easy and thinking.

1379
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,916
And I believe
for the first time,

1380
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,347
I'm just beginning
to understand

1381
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,174
what it's all about,

1382
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,095
what I really am,
what I really want.

1383
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,226
It's a nice feeling.

1384
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,450
Yeah, come on in.

1385
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,325
Ace, excuse me.
I hate to bother you.

1386
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,122
I just got the news.

1387
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:02,620
You got what news?

1388
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,201
I'm getting shipped back.

1389
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,003
You being shipped
back where?

1390
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:08,755
Stateside.

1391
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:10,965
I've been reassigned
to a new duty station.

1392
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:14,299
Well...

1393
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,514
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1394
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,716
No.

1395
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,348
All right. Well, don't tell her, because
maybe we can work something out.

1396
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,305
What reason did
he give you for it?

1397
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,732
No reason.
I know what it is.

1398
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,691
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

1399
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,824
I'm sorry, Major.
There's nothing you can do.

1400
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,623
We're sending Kelly
to the States Thursday, and that's that.

1401
01:38:49,465 --> 01:38:51,206
Well, what about
his wife, Colonel?

1402
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,629
Well, she stays here.

1403
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,846
He knew he couldn't take her back with
him when he married her.

1404
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,880
Mmm-hmm.

1405
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,511
Didn't you?

1406
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,808
That's right.

1407
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:05,604
Well, you'd be busting up
his home then, you know.

1408
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,764
I'm not busting up anything.

1409
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:14,397
Oh, I admit Kelly's
been a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1410
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:15,943
Well, could you tell me

1411
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,117
why he didn't have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1412
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:20,694
Don't ask me, Major.

1413
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:23,656
There are lots of reasons
for these things.

1414
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,330
Anyway, it is an order.

1415
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,541
And there's nothing
you can do about it

1416
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,707
even if you are
a four-star general's son.

1417
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:35,884
Yeah, well...

1418
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,216
Would it make any difference
if I told you my wife's going to have a baby?

1419
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,679
Well, that's tough,
I admit.

1420
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:51,983
Colonel, under these circumstances,

1421
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:54,231
don't you think
that you'd be able to

1422
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,234
postpone this
for a little while?

1423
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,158
Maybe I could be
transferred back to Korea.

1424
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,153
No, you're going home.

1425
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,291
All the boys
on this list, going home.

1426
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,244
Where is your home?

1427
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:13,834
That house by the canal.

1428
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,334
I mean your real home.

1429
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,252
That house by the canal.

1430
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,920
Yeah, all right.

1431
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:25,725
I've taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1432
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,100
Now, you listen
to me, wise guy,

1433
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:33,939
that house by the canal
is off-limits from now on.

1434
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:37,695
Whole street's off-limits.

1435
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:39,815
You want a court-martial?

1436
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:42,992
That mean I could
stay in Japan?

1437
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,115
Come on, Kel.

1438
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,529
You're shipping out
of here on Thursday.

1439
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,159
And don't you
try to help him.

1440
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,461
You remember that
house by the canal

1441
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,289
is off-limits to all personnel.

1442
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:59,214
Would you tell me,
Colonel, just exactly

1443
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,465
what you mean
by that last remark?

1444
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:04,134
Well, that's all
I'm prepared to say at the minute,

1445
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,387
except you watch your step.

1446
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,605
So, I don't know
what else to say to you, General.

1447
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,144
I've known this boy
a long time,

1448
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:20,064
and if he has to go back without
Katsumi, he's gonna be in trouble.

1449
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,690
And...

1450
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:24,326
Well, I mean,
that's about it. That's it.

1451
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:26,237
What about his wife?

1452
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:28,864
- I don't know.
- And the baby?

1453
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:34,082
So it comes down to
the fact that the Army lets them get married

1454
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,003
and then forces
them to desert their wives and babies.

1455
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,506
That's not fair, Eileen.

1456
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,841
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1457
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,513
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches.

1458
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,683
In most cases,
with a girl from the streets.

1459
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:50,635
It's up to the service
in some measure

1460
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:52,896
to be fathers
and mothers to these boys

1461
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,689
and try to head off
these marriages.

1462
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,604
But after they're married
why should they be sent home?

1463
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:03,486
The man's being transferred
to a new duty station, Eileen,

1464
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:04,695
along with many others.

1465
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,361
Now, don't ask me
the reasons for changes of duty.

1466
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,366
There are thousands of them.

1467
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,870
But Lloyd said
that most of the men on this particular list

1468
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,533
are married to Japanese girls.

1469
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,202
That can't be just
a coincidence, Father.

1470
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,537
Why not?
It could easily be.

1471
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,714
There have been
lots of marriages.

1472
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:21,007
Frankly, with some
of these men,

1473
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:24,045
I think they might
welcome the transfer.

1474
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:25,845
Why is that, sir?

1475
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:30,016
There have been unfortunate
aftermaths to many of these marriages.

1476
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,053
Recriminations, regrets.

1477
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,223
A boy gets married
impulsively, then feels caught,

1478
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:38,604
doesn't know how to get out of
it, doesn't know what to do.

1479
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:41,232
Change of duty
gives them both a chance to think it over.

1480
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,483
To cool off.

1481
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,778
Now, I don't mean to
imply that that's the reason

1482
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:48,030
these men are being
transferred, but...

1483
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:49,744
Well...

1484
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:52,990
The whole thing's

1485
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:55,325
a messy business.

1486
01:42:56,962 --> 01:43:00,581
General Webster, there is no regret in the
case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1487
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:03,588
You can have
my word on that.

1488
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,001
Lloyd,

1489
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:08,096
three officers
came to me today

1490
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,219
with identical requests
for their men.

1491
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,513
It's not our policy
to interfere with decisions

1492
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,845
made by immediate
commanding officers.

1493
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:17,556
The basic structure
of the whole military service would collapse

1494
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:19,520
if we started doing
things like that.

1495
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,187
Your father would
understand that, even if you don't.

1496
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,115
Are you going to
ask me to make an exception of Kelly

1497
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:28,775
when I've refused
these other men?

1498
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,456
I am going to ask you
to do that, sir.

1499
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,248
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1500
01:43:42,299 --> 01:43:45,258
I'm afraid
it's a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1501
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:51,715
Well...

1502
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,935
That's the end of Joe Kelly.

1503
01:43:57,523 --> 01:44:00,687
You told me yourself
that Kelly's past record was against him.

1504
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,563
I couldn't even use that,
don't you see?

1505
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,111
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1506
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:11,535
Kelly's from my outfit, Mrs. Webster.
I was his best man.

1507
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:14,906
And I'm planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1508
01:44:19,754 --> 01:44:21,837
Come into the other room, Eileen.

1509
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:24,039
This is something
for your father to handle.

1510
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,510
No, Mrs. Webster, I don't think it's
anything for anybody to handle.

1511
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,430
I'm sorry, Eileen.

1512
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:42,975
Mrs. Webster.

1513
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:45,102
Good afternoon, y'all.

1514
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:55,370
I don't think I'll ever love anyone
again as much as I love Lloyd.

1515
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:58,866
But I'll tell you something
that's rather ironic.

1516
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:03,670
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1517
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,415
and hauling me off
to a shack somewhere.

1518
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,126
That's just what
he's done, isn't it?

1519
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,382
Only it's with somebody else.

1520
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,553
Don't go out, Eileen.

1521
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:16,762
Stay and talk.

1522
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:18,218
I'm sorry, Mother.

1523
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,725
There's only one person
I'd like to talk to at the moment,

1524
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:23,394
and oddly enough,
he's Japanese.

1525
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:29,901
Ace, I've been
waiting for you.

1526
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,401
Hey, Kelly, listen.

1527
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:34,951
I just came from
General Webster's house

1528
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:36,573
and there's a whole
big mess there.

1529
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:37,905
- No good, huh?
- No.

1530
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:40,907
He didn't...
He didn't go for it.

1531
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:44,411
Matter of fact,
I think I even messed it up a little.

1532
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:47,622
That figures.

1533
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:50,007
Did you tell
Katsumi yet?

1534
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:51,130
No.

1535
01:45:51,929 --> 01:45:53,636
I'm chickening out fast.

1536
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:57,721
Besides, she's got her heart set on
something she planned for us tonight.

1537
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,892
Wants us both to take
the train to Osaka

1538
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,099
and meet the girls
at the puppet show.

1539
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,060
Why spoil it?

1540
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,986
Maybe I'll tell
her late tonight when we're alone.

1541
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:16,159
Kelly, don't give up on it.
I think there's gonna be a way out of it.

1542
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:17,235
- There's got to be.
- You think so?

1543
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,654
- Yes, I do.
- I don't.

1544
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,457
- I'll see you, Ace.
- Hi, hon.

1545
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:23,491
Kelly-<i>san.</i>

1546
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,420
Hey, tell Katsumi
we'll be there with bells.

1547
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,631
Were you able to help?

1548
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:35,879
No. I wasn't.

1549
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:37,464
How terrible.

1550
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,970
I know this is hard, honey.

1551
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,309
It's hard,
but it's not gonna last long.

1552
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:49,101
I mean, the Army's got to change that
law next year or the next one.

1553
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:53,105
I mean, it just has to be.
I'm sure of it.

1554
01:46:55,117 --> 01:46:57,154
And, as a matter of fact,

1555
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,945
I'm so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1556
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:02,660
and I signed
some papers here

1557
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:05,041
that mean that you and I
are gonna get married.

1558
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,291
What's the matter?

1559
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,002
We never spoke of marriage.

1560
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,963
I know we didn't, darling.

1561
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:19,257
I know we didn't.
I been going round and round with that

1562
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,342
every day for a long time.

1563
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:25,554
And I didn't feel I could
speak about it until now.

1564
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,356
Now I can.

1565
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:33,736
Now, of course,
I won't be able to take you back to America,

1566
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,530
but they're bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1567
01:47:37,993 --> 01:47:40,531
And until then,
I'm gonna stay here with you.

1568
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:45,957
I'm not stuck in the Air Force.
I can resign.

1569
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:49,207
Of course,
I'm not trained to do anything else,

1570
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:51,163
but I'd find something.

1571
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,833
We never spoke of marriage.

1572
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:59,880
I know we didn't, darling,
but we're speaking of it now.

1573
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:10,357
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1574
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:14,937
I said there would
be danger of weakness when it is over.

1575
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,655
Over?
What are you talking about?

1576
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:27,453
I am tempted.
With you, I could become a woman.

1577
01:48:28,419 --> 01:48:31,878
And a mother.
And I could love you.

1578
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,502
That's right.

1579
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,710
Do you think I haven't
thought about it?

1580
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:42,259
Do you think
I want to become a lonely old woman

1581
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:45,926
who teaches dancing,
now that I have known you?

1582
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:50,017
But it is no good.

1583
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,482
You must know it, too.

1584
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:56,315
No, no. I don't know
anything of the kind.

1585
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:00,653
The way you talk about
leaving the Air Force,

1586
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:04,368
finding some pitiful
way of earning living

1587
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,993
just to be here with
your Japanese wife.

1588
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,324
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1589
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:15,839
I think we're too far
in this thing to be talking like that.

1590
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,468
Matsubayashi has been
kind to me, Lloyd.

1591
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:23,971
I am obligated to them.

1592
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:28,143
No, you ain't.
You... No, no. You obligated to me.

1593
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:31,304
They are my life.

1594
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:34,808
I will bring shame
to them, disgrace.

1595
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:37,981
Lloyd, you know
what I mean?

1596
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:41,656
Yeah, I think
I'm beginning to know what you mean.

1597
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:45,569
I think you mean you simply don't love me
enough to go on through with it.

1598
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:47,870
That's what you mean,
don't you?

1599
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:50,369
Why don't you
just come on out and say it?

1600
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:52,325
It is not what I mean.

1601
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:59,670
I'm leaving for Tokyo
in six days.

1602
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,003
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1603
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:04,804
You what?

1604
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:11,140
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1605
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:16,396
Any other girl, they would have
dismissed, but because they like me,

1606
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:20,820
because they feel I am important
to them, they are being lenient.

1607
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,657
Well, I'm not gonna be
lenient with you.

1608
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,902
I want you to
tell me right now

1609
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:29,863
why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do?

1610
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:35,835
Lloyd, there is something
about myself

1611
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,370
I have not told you.

1612
01:50:38,799 --> 01:50:41,132
I have no right
to marry anyone.

1613
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:44,211
My father was very poor.

1614
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,055
To save his other children,

1615
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,680
he was forced to sell
one of his daughters.

1616
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,560
The man from the houses
of Yoshiwara came to him.

1617
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:59,275
Because I was the oldest,

1618
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:02,904
he agreed I should
go with them.

1619
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,075
Your father sold you?

1620
01:51:08,245 --> 01:51:12,159
Yes, but I was saved
from starting this life

1621
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,957
by my best friend,
Fumiko-<i>san.</i>

1622
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:20,080
Her father paid
money to free me

1623
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:24,167
and she brought me
to Matsubayashi.

1624
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:30,598
There, I not only
earn my living,

1625
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,594
I brought honor
back to my family.

1626
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:39,732
Matsubayashi has
been kind to me.

1627
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,356
They have trusted me.

1628
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,609
I cannot leave them.

1629
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:48,615
I cannot marry anyone.

1630
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:54,865
Don't you understand?

1631
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:02,873
I don't know.

1632
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,092
I don't know
what to think.

1633
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:10,595
I'll kill you!

1634
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:12,098
You ever do
anything like this,

1635
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,508
and I'll kill you,
you understand?

1636
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:15,685
Get that straight, now!
I'll kill you!

1637
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:17,933
Wait a minute. Listen.
Just take it easy, now.

1638
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,392
Ace, look at this.

1639
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,893
- It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1640
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,819
She was gonna
have it done, too.

1641
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:28,402
Tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1642
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:30,700
- What?
- For 8 bucks, she slashes her eyelids

1643
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:32,903
and sews them
back up again.

1644
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:35,113
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done.

1645
01:52:35,165 --> 01:52:36,747
She was gonna surprise me.

1646
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:38,449
Well...

1647
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:39,663
Then...

1648
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:43,622
Then I have good eyes.
I fool everybody.

1649
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:46,875
I look American, like Joe.

1650
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:53,131
Hana-ogi, will you tell
that stupid dame I love her the way she is?

1651
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,140
I don't want her changed.

1652
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:57,017
Will you tell her
I love her mouth

1653
01:52:57,062 --> 01:53:00,305
and her nose
and her ears and her eyes

1654
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:02,098
just the way they are?

1655
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,435
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I'll...

1656
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:07,482
Wait a minute.
Calm down, Kelly.

1657
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:09,944
I want him
be proud of me.

1658
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:11,194
Listen, listen. Listen.

1659
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,067
I am sorry.

1660
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,199
Listen, if you want him
to be proud of you, you got to quit this stuff.

1661
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,701
'Cause you want to be
a good wife, don't you?

1662
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:19,866
You're making him
very unhappy when you're doing that.

1663
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,202
Now, tell him you're sorry
and you're not going to do it anymore.

1664
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:23,540
Tell him that.

1665
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:24,620
Joe...

1666
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,715
I so sorry.

1667
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:34,222
Okay. Now, we're gonna
forget about that, all right?

1668
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,466
Now, listen.
I came over here tonight,

1669
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,176
I thought we were gonna
have a fish fry.

1670
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:40,436
We were gonna have some fun right
here, and dancing and yelling,

1671
01:53:40,522 --> 01:53:41,808
and what do I find?

1672
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,389
What's gonna happen to us?

1673
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:44,519
Puppet show.

1674
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,480
- Yeah, we had a surprise...
- You like?

1675
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,277
Sure, I do.
Been looking forward to it.

1676
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:51,235
I know everybody tonight.

1677
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:52,532
Yeah.

1678
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:56,569
And

1679
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,408
we will be late.

1680
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:07,542
Look.

1681
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:12,923
The lover is leaving the city,
walk to the wood.

1682
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:54,214
Lloyd, don't think
of anything now.

1683
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:56,966
Watch the play.

1684
01:54:57,808 --> 01:54:59,595
It's a tender story.

1685
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:11,854
When gong sound,
it is done.

1686
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:17,113
And then she will
bind her body.

1687
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:20,114
Bind her body?

1688
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:23,452
So that she will not fall
in an ugly position

1689
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,662
of dishonor when she dies.

1690
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:27,167
- When she dies?
- Mmm.

1691
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,586
Yes, <i>shinju.</i>

1692
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,685
It is custom for lovers

1693
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:52,109
to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1694
01:56:02,998 --> 01:56:05,115
It is so beautiful.

1695
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:08,876
Beautiful?
They're gonna die, aren't they?

1696
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:13,958
They will live
in another world on a beautiful lake

1697
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,884
floating always together

1698
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,386
like water lily.

1699
01:56:22,601 --> 01:56:23,717
Sure.

1700
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:48,888
Kelly-<i>san!</i> Kelly-<i>san!</i>
Kelly-<i>san!</i>

1701
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,651
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1702
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:08,700
That's the MPs, boy.

1703
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,531
- What happened? What's wrong?
- Come here, come here.

1704
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:12,207
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1705
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,246
Go to Matsubayashi.

1706
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,171
- Please, please tell me. I will not leave.
- I will, I will.

1707
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:19,673
Now, get in the car.
I'll tell you later.

1708
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:21,250
Matsubayashi.

1709
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:25,255
Hey, Ed, look.

1710
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,647
Look at that.

1711
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:47,360
You're Major Gruver,
aren't you?

1712
01:58:48,163 --> 01:58:49,199
That's right.

1713
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:50,780
Sorry, Major, you'll have
to come with us.

1714
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,035
General Webster's orders.

1715
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:54,370
So, what right do
you have to board up this man's house?

1716
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:55,910
He won't be needing
it anymore, Major.

1717
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:57,085
He's shipping out Thursday.

1718
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:58,203
Joe?

1719
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,540
Come on, Major.

1720
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,301
You'll hear from me, Kelly.

1721
01:59:18,777 --> 01:59:20,359
Come on, kid.

1722
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:24,147
We'll get in through the garden.
I got something to tell you.

1723
01:59:47,389 --> 01:59:48,925
You were seen
in public with her tonight,

1724
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:51,090
violating the orders
of the area.

1725
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:53,350
This has given
me the right to put you under arrest.

1726
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:57,062
And, for your own sake,
I think I'd better do it.

1727
01:59:58,233 --> 01:59:59,223
Well,

1728
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:01,233
you have anything to say?

1729
02:00:03,738 --> 02:00:06,856
Well, just as soon I'm out of this,
I'm going to be married,

1730
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:08,361
and have a house of my own.

1731
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,406
I'm afraid not.

1732
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:15,159
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but it's all settled.

1733
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,664
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1734
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,753
The girl goes
to Tokyo, and you fly to Randolph Field,

1735
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:23,379
day after tomorrow.

1736
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:25,836
Here are your orders.

1737
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,337
Until that time,
you're under house arrest.

1738
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:34,680
You're not to leave
your quarters until further notice.

1739
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:43,314
I'm doing this because I feel you're not
responsible at the moment, Lloyd.

1740
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:45,816
After all, I've known
your father for years.

1741
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:53,652
Well, that's all.

1742
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:30,446
Mike...

1743
02:01:31,576 --> 02:01:32,692
Did you see her?

1744
02:01:32,786 --> 02:01:34,152
No, Ace. I couldn't even get
near the place.

1745
02:01:34,204 --> 02:01:35,240
They've really clamped down.

1746
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:37,538
I went to the stage
door and I couldn't even see Fumiko-<i>san.</i>

1747
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:40,287
Well, listen, I've got to see her.
I'm being shipped out of here tomorrow.

1748
02:01:40,668 --> 02:01:42,079
Major Gruver?

1749
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,286
What is it?

1750
02:01:43,379 --> 02:01:44,540
Would you do
something for us?

1751
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:45,830
What do you want?

1752
02:01:46,633 --> 02:01:48,215
Airman Kelly's disappeared.

1753
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:51,294
No, that's impossible.
I was with him just last night.

1754
02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:52,423
We know.

1755
02:01:52,514 --> 02:01:53,971
He was scheduled to fly out
in a couple days.

1756
02:01:54,057 --> 02:01:57,596
But a special plane came through, and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1757
02:01:57,685 --> 02:02:00,098
I took him to
the airport at 12:50.

1758
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:03,022
When the plane took off,
Kelly wasn't on it.

1759
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:04,398
Figured you might
know where he is.

1760
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:07,810
How should I know where he is?
His house has been boarded up, hasn't it?

1761
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,738
We know.
Neighbors won't talk to us.

1762
02:02:10,824 --> 02:02:12,486
We figure maybe
they're hiding him.

1763
02:02:13,076 --> 02:02:15,614
They'll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1764
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:19,246
Well, would you give
me one good reason why I should?

1765
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:23,200
We figured we'd
give him a break.

1766
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,915
We haven't reported
him as yet.

1767
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:27,046
We could get him
on another plane.

1768
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:29,127
We might not have
to turn him in for desertion.

1769
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:33,043
- Desertion?
- Yes, sir.

1770
02:02:36,933 --> 02:02:38,094
Well...

1771
02:02:39,811 --> 02:02:41,427
I'll go with
you in a minute.

1772
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:43,141
Major?

1773
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:46,098
The neighbors won't
talk if they see an MP.

1774
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,266
I'll go with him.

1775
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,896
Thank you, sir.

1776
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:50,746
Kelly?

1777
02:03:54,093 --> 02:03:55,675
Kelly, Gruver out here.

1778
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:59,513
I think he's in there.

1779
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:02,849
Kelly?

1780
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:06,603
I'm going on in.

1781
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,743
Kelly?

1782
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:30,206
Kelly?

1783
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:39,386
Kelly, you in there?

1784
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:04,987
Oh, my God.

1785
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:09,908
Oh, my...

1786
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:19,876
Oh...

1787
02:05:21,889 --> 02:05:22,879
Oh.

1788
02:05:31,107 --> 02:05:32,223
Oh.

1789
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,441
Oh.

1790
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:41,110
I'll call the police, Ace.

1791
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:00,342
Oh, God.

1792
02:07:37,733 --> 02:07:40,567
Go home! Go home!

1793
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:46,066
Go home! Go home! Go home!

1794
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:50,403
Ace, there's no police around.
We'd better get out of here.

1795
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:53,197
Hey, look.

1796
02:08:01,299 --> 02:08:02,756
Doesn't look too good, boy.

1797
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:09,088
Go home! Go home!

1798
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:11,302
Come on, take it easy.

1799
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:46,090
We're getting help, Ace.

1800
02:08:59,857 --> 02:09:01,894
- You okay, boy?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1801
02:09:01,984 --> 02:09:03,225
You all right?

1802
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:04,400
Yeah.

1803
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,395
Listen, I'm going to...

1804
02:09:07,448 --> 02:09:09,610
I want you to take care of everything.
Will you?

1805
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:11,321
- Oh, yeah, I'll get it...
- Okay.

1806
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:13,531
I'll see you later.

1807
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:02,660
Hey, where's Hana-ogi?

1808
02:10:02,712 --> 02:10:03,953
Hana-ogi's not here.

1809
02:10:04,046 --> 02:10:05,662
Oh, I know she's here.

1810
02:10:05,715 --> 02:10:07,251
She is on her way Tokyo.

1811
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:09,708
No, she wasn't... She wasn't
supposed to go to Tokyo till next week.

1812
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:10,967
She went today.

1813
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:12,510
I don't believe you.

1814
02:10:12,555 --> 02:10:14,717
- Mr. Gruver...
- I don't believe you.

1815
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:15,880
I don't care...

1816
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:04,312
Hana-ogi?

1817
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:17,988
Hana-ogi. Hana-ogi.

1818
02:11:18,662 --> 02:11:19,948
Hana-ogi.

1819
02:11:30,383 --> 02:11:31,464
Hana-ogi?

1820
02:11:38,849 --> 02:11:40,181
Gruver-<i>san!</i>

1821
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:42,475
- Hey, where's Hana-ogi?
- She's gone.

1822
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,011
- Where's her room?
- She's gone.

1823
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:45,937
Listen, where's her room?

1824
02:11:46,857 --> 02:11:48,189
Come here.

1825
02:11:51,904 --> 02:11:54,021
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1826
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:56,277
I don't believe you.

1827
02:11:57,034 --> 02:11:58,445
Hana-ogi.

1828
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,324
I give you my word.

1829
02:12:07,002 --> 02:12:08,914
You go now, too, Major.

1830
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:11,087
It's over.

1831
02:12:12,258 --> 02:12:14,500
Listen, leave me
alone a minute, will you?

1832
02:12:31,026 --> 02:12:34,360
The hoodlums who attacked
you weren't all your Japanese neighbors.

1833
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:36,696
For the most part, they were
professional troublemakers

1834
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,199
sent to your street
to create an incident specifically with you.

1835
02:12:40,995 --> 02:12:42,907
Now, if you're important
to those who hate us,

1836
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,411
don't you see how
important you are to us?

1837
02:12:49,378 --> 02:12:51,370
Do you understand
any of this, Lloyd?

1838
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,291
I know how you feel.

1839
02:12:56,635 --> 02:12:57,876
It was...

1840
02:12:58,679 --> 02:13:01,467
It was dreadful about
your friend Kelly and...

1841
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:03,927
And his wife.

1842
02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:08,224
Must be hard to take.

1843
02:13:10,858 --> 02:13:11,939
And I...

1844
02:13:12,026 --> 02:13:16,316
I hate to tell you
something else, because it's

1845
02:13:17,239 --> 02:13:19,231
almost too grotesque.

1846
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:24,820
Almost unforgivable in
your eyes, I imagine.

1847
02:13:25,748 --> 02:13:27,489
I got word today that...

1848
02:13:29,168 --> 02:13:31,751
There's a law being passed
in a month or two

1849
02:13:32,713 --> 02:13:35,205
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1850
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:40,135
to take their
Japanese brides back to the States.

1851
02:13:44,725 --> 02:13:46,261
That can't be true, General.

1852
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:49,393
Well, it happens
to be true, Lloyd.

1853
02:13:54,944 --> 02:13:56,185
Listen.

1854
02:13:57,071 --> 02:13:59,609
How do you get
the guts to come here and tell me that?

1855
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:03,237
It takes time to get
laws passed, Lloyd.

1856
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:07,450
And a lot of people have died
in this world needlessly, waiting for them.

1857
02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:09,702
Well, it's...

1858
02:14:09,792 --> 02:14:12,455
It's harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1859
02:14:15,506 --> 02:14:16,622
Lloyd...

1860
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,962
You're lost. You're confused.

1861
02:14:21,971 --> 02:14:25,385
Don't you think it's time you got back
to the main stream of your life?

1862
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:27,132
Back to your roots?

1863
02:14:27,184 --> 02:14:29,141
What you were born for,
and raised for?

1864
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,603
You'll feel better
about everything when you get back home,

1865
02:14:32,648 --> 02:14:34,605
back to your work.

1866
02:14:37,903 --> 02:14:39,735
Appreciate you
coming over, General.

1867
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:24,322
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1868
02:15:30,205 --> 02:15:31,992
That must be him.

1869
02:15:32,499 --> 02:15:34,035
Would you hold it,
so we can get a picture, General?

1870
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:36,664
- Where would you like me? Right here?
- What about there? Yeah.

1871
02:15:38,756 --> 02:15:39,872
Smile, please.

1872
02:15:46,472 --> 02:15:48,338
Hey, Bill, isn't
that Ace Gruver?

1873
02:15:49,308 --> 02:15:50,389
Looks like him.

1874
02:15:53,228 --> 02:15:54,309
Sir?

1875
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:58,147
Excuse me, aren't
you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1876
02:15:58,233 --> 02:15:59,349
Yes, that's right.

1877
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:00,733
Well, we're
from <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

1878
02:16:00,819 --> 02:16:02,230
What are you doing
in Tokyo?

1879
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:05,446
Well, I'm just passing
through, boys.

1880
02:16:05,532 --> 02:16:07,023
Just seeing the sights, huh?

1881
02:16:07,076 --> 02:16:10,569
That's right. Listen, I'm in a hurry.
Do you mind if I excuse myself?

1882
02:16:10,621 --> 02:16:12,408
- You're excused.
- Sorry.

1883
02:18:30,886 --> 02:18:31,922
Lloyd-<i>san.</i>

1884
02:18:54,284 --> 02:18:55,900
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1885
02:18:59,164 --> 02:19:01,747
I'm going back to
America on Friday.

1886
02:19:03,168 --> 02:19:05,080
And I probably won't

1887
02:19:06,296 --> 02:19:08,253
get back in Japan again.

1888
02:19:11,426 --> 02:19:13,793
And before I go,
there was just...

1889
02:19:15,681 --> 02:19:17,764
Just one thing
I wanted to know.

1890
02:19:20,769 --> 02:19:23,432
You remember one
time you said to me...

1891
02:19:25,983 --> 02:19:27,975
That you could love me

1892
02:19:29,945 --> 02:19:32,107
and be a wife and a mother?

1893
02:19:33,782 --> 02:19:35,114
I remember.

1894
02:19:38,078 --> 02:19:41,287
You said that since
you'd known me, you'd been afraid

1895
02:19:42,624 --> 02:19:44,957
of being
a lonely old woman, teaching dancing.

1896
02:19:45,794 --> 02:19:47,285
Remember that?

1897
02:19:48,797 --> 02:19:50,163
I remember.

1898
02:19:51,967 --> 02:19:55,051
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1899
02:19:56,597 --> 02:19:57,963
I meant it.

1900
02:19:58,891 --> 02:20:00,757
It is already happening.

1901
02:20:00,809 --> 02:20:03,973
Love has gone out
of my work, out of me.

1902
02:20:05,689 --> 02:20:08,147
Oh, Lloyd, please go now.

1903
02:20:09,067 --> 02:20:11,650
This will only
bring pain and trouble.

1904
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:15,397
Hana-ogi,

1905
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,779
you and I are going
to have more trouble

1906
02:20:18,827 --> 02:20:20,819
than we ever
thought of having in our whole lives

1907
02:20:20,871 --> 02:20:23,830
unless you're
absolutely honest with yourself.

1908
02:20:26,668 --> 02:20:30,161
Please, Lloyd, can't we
talk about this later?

1909
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:34,833
There isn't
going to be any later.

1910
02:20:34,927 --> 02:20:36,884
There's only going
to be right now.

1911
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:38,920
Oh, uh,

1912
02:20:39,181 --> 02:20:40,171
excuse me, Mother.

1913
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:42,298
Excuse me.

1914
02:20:45,938 --> 02:20:47,600
I must return this robe.

1915
02:20:47,689 --> 02:20:49,055
Listen to me.

1916
02:20:49,149 --> 02:20:53,018
I want to know.
Do you love me, or don't you?

1917
02:20:55,113 --> 02:20:57,025
Because if you don't,

1918
02:20:57,115 --> 02:20:59,732
then I'm going to
have to find a way to live with it.

1919
02:21:00,827 --> 02:21:02,864
- And if you do, then...
- Please, Lloyd.

1920
02:21:05,207 --> 02:21:07,494
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1921
02:21:11,004 --> 02:21:14,372
Now, I don't want you
to tell me anything more,

1922
02:21:14,424 --> 02:21:18,088
or anything less than
you feel in the very deepest part of you.

1923
02:21:19,262 --> 02:21:20,878
Because what you
answer to me now

1924
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:23,639
is going to affect us
for the rest of our lives.

1925
02:21:26,603 --> 02:21:29,266
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don't you love me?

1926
02:21:33,443 --> 02:21:35,730
I'm so frightened
and confused.

1927
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:37,941
I cannot think.

1928
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,232
I cannot even
understand your thinking.

1929
02:21:40,325 --> 02:21:42,032
I'm not thinking!
I'm not thinking...

1930
02:21:42,077 --> 02:21:45,366
For the first time in my life,
I'm not thinking, and I don't care.

1931
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:48,998
But, Lloyd, we must
do the right thing.

1932
02:21:49,084 --> 02:21:51,747
Oh, what are you talking
about, the right thing?

1933
02:21:51,837 --> 02:21:53,578
We've been wasting
two good lives

1934
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:54,788
trying to do
the right thing.

1935
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:56,247
The right thing
for Matsubayashi,

1936
02:21:56,341 --> 02:21:58,924
the right thing
for my father,

1937
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:00,176
the right thing
for the military,

1938
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:03,096
the right thing for
Japanese tradition.

1939
02:22:03,181 --> 02:22:05,594
The right thing for
the great white race.

1940
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:08,347
But we have duties
and obligations.

1941
02:22:08,437 --> 02:22:10,178
That's right, we do.

1942
02:22:10,689 --> 02:22:12,055
We have duties
and obligations.

1943
02:22:12,107 --> 02:22:15,271
And the first obligation we have
is to love each other.

1944
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:19,195
To become man and wife,
and raise some clean, sweet children.

1945
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:21,489
And give them
the very best that we know how.

1946
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:24,617
And if we don't
meet that obligation,

1947
02:22:24,661 --> 02:22:26,778
we ain't going to be
any good to anybody.

1948
02:22:27,789 --> 02:22:31,453
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1949
02:22:31,918 --> 02:22:33,079
Oh.

1950
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:37,838
Honey, I want you
to be my wife.

1951
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:43,469
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1952
02:22:44,056 --> 02:22:45,263
What would they be?

1953
02:22:45,807 --> 02:22:48,049
They'd be half Japanese,
half American.

1954
02:22:48,143 --> 02:22:50,635
They'd be half
yellow and half white.

1955
02:22:51,188 --> 02:22:53,805
They'd be half you,
they'd be half me.

1956
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:56,436
That's all they're going to be.

1957
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:12,331
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1958
02:23:14,252 --> 02:23:17,495
I want you to come with me now,
down to the American Consulate,

1959
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:20,498
here in Tokyo.

1960
02:23:20,926 --> 02:23:24,419
We're gonna filling out those papers,
'cause we've only got a few days

1961
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:27,176
to get this whole thing done,
and get it out of the way.

1962
02:23:36,483 --> 02:23:37,599
Will you come?

1963
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,866
I'm going to wait
for you outside.

1964
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:23,606
Didn't I tell you
he'd be here?

1965
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:25,233
- Look at this crowd!
- Wow!

1966
02:24:25,323 --> 02:24:27,280
And look who's here,
our rivals.

1967
02:24:27,367 --> 02:24:28,403
What do you know?

1968
02:24:28,493 --> 02:24:30,701
Oh, you guys heard
about it, too, huh?

1969
02:24:30,745 --> 02:24:31,781
No secrets.

1970
02:24:31,872 --> 02:24:34,080
- No secrets in this country!
- Well, what are you gonna do?

1971
02:24:39,296 --> 02:24:42,334
Hello, Major.
Well, what a coincidence!

1972
02:24:42,424 --> 02:24:44,040
You got a story
for us, sir?

1973
02:24:45,594 --> 02:24:47,756
No. As a matter
of fact, I don't.

1974
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:50,672
Oh, now, Major, you're
not going to try to deny it, are you?

1975
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:52,757
- Deny what?
- Well, the story.

1976
02:24:52,809 --> 02:24:55,597
Why won't you give us a story?
You're big news now, sir.

1977
02:24:55,687 --> 02:24:57,929
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

1978
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:02,354
Here's Hana-ogi.
Maybe she'll talk.

1979
02:25:20,086 --> 02:25:23,454
Come on, Hana-ogi, that's not fair.
What did you say?

1980
02:25:24,716 --> 02:25:28,551
It is very difficult
for a Japanese woman to speak in public.

1981
02:25:29,930 --> 02:25:31,717
I have never done so.

1982
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:35,015
But perhaps now
it is the time.

1983
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:39,308
Major Gruver has
asked me to be his...

1984
02:25:39,814 --> 02:25:40,975
His wife.

1985
02:25:45,153 --> 02:25:47,520
He knows there
are many people in his country

1986
02:25:47,614 --> 02:25:50,106
who will be
disturbed by this.

1987
02:25:50,158 --> 02:25:52,775
I know my people
will be shocked, too.

1988
02:25:53,161 --> 02:25:55,995
But I hope they will
learn to understand

1989
02:25:56,706 --> 02:25:58,493
and someday approve.

1990
02:25:59,626 --> 02:26:03,370
We are not afraid
because we know this is right.

1991
02:26:04,714 --> 02:26:07,127
I hope I can
continue as a dancer.

1992
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:10,168
And I hope, when I am old,

1993
02:26:10,428 --> 02:26:13,216
I will be able to
teach children to dance.

1994
02:26:14,182 --> 02:26:15,514
My own children.

1995
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:18,134
Major?

1996
02:26:18,186 --> 02:26:20,223
The big brass are
gonna yell their heads off about this.

1997
02:26:20,313 --> 02:26:22,521
And the Japanese
aren't going to like it much, either.

1998
02:26:22,607 --> 02:26:24,894
Have you got anything
to say to them, sir?

1999
02:26:27,362 --> 02:26:28,398
Yeah.

2000
02:26:29,864 --> 02:26:31,355
Tell them we said <i>sayonara.</i>

2001
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:35,200
<i>Sayonara</i>

2002
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:38,989
<i>Japanese goodbye</i>

2003
02:26:39,291 --> 02:26:42,875
<i>Whisper sayonara</i>

2004
02:26:43,086 --> 02:26:46,750
<i>Lover, don't you cry</i>

2005
02:26:47,173 --> 02:26:50,712
<i>No more we stop to see</i>

2006
02:26:50,969 --> 02:26:54,553
<i>Pretty cherry blossom</i>

2007
02:26:54,889 --> 02:26:58,803
<i>No more we beneath the tree</i>

2008
02:26:58,893 --> 02:27:02,307
<i>Looking at the sky</i>

2009
02:27:02,897 --> 02:27:06,140
<i>Sayonara</i>

2010
02:27:06,735 --> 02:27:10,399
<i>Sayonara</i>

2011
02:27:10,613 --> 02:27:14,653
<i>Goodbye</i>
