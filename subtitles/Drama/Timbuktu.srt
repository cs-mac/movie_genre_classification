1
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,688
Peace be upon you.

2
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:40,631
And upon you Peace.

3
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,692
Peace be upon you.

4
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:49,933
Here.

5
00:03:58,632 --> 00:03:59,615
Cheers.

6
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,823
Medications.

7
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,615
Two tablets in the morning,

8
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,447
two in the evening.

9
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes...

10
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,865
They replaced that one.

11
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,114
Yes, I know. A generic.

12
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,156
Let's go.

13
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,447
Attention !

14
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,072
Important information !

15
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,990
Cigarettes are prohibited.

16
00:04:57,324 --> 00:04:59,365
Music is prohibited.

17
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,906
Women must wear socks.

18
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:05,657
Attention !

19
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:11,573
Women must wear socks and gloves!

20
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,114
For those who speak Bambara...

21
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,532
No cigarettes.

22
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,697
No music.

23
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:29,242
For those who go to the market,

24
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,532
socks are required.

25
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:32,949
Understood ?

26
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,115
I just said it in Bambara.

27
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,825
- Roll up your pants.
- All my pants are like that.

28
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:45,823
Roll them up, it's the new law.

29
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:49,949
I said roll them up !

30
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:43,804
Peace be upon you.

31
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:45,990
What brings you here?

32
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,658
We have a new announcement.

33
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,908
And you just enter like that?

34
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:54,782
One does not enter the house of God

35
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,658
with shoes and weapons.

36
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:00,033
It's not right.

37
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,199
We can. We do jihad.

38
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,782
You do jihad? And you want to do it here?

39
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,241
In the house of God?

40
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,908
Here in Timbuktu, one dedicated to religion

41
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:19,282
does it with his head and not with weapons.

42
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:23,367
It is the hour of prayer, we want to pray peacefully.

43
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:26,407
Please get out.

44
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,282
Get away from my nets!

45
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,326
You hear me?

46
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,158
Guess what I'm thinking,

47
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,700
at this moment.

48
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,658
What ?

49
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,075
About your cattle.

50
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,325
About GPS, your favorite!

51
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,660
GPS...

52
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:29,367
- This is your answer?
- Yes.

53
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,325
Do you know something ?

54
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,243
If GPS has a calf

55
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,034
and if it's a bull,

56
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,243
I will give it to Issan.

57
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,698
He deserves all your flock.

58
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:45,950
All cattle?

59
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:46,742
Yes.

60
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:49,700
He deserves it, he's a good boy.

61
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:55,951
He will be happy just with the calf of GPS.

62
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,200
Don't you think?

63
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,908
He will.

64
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,950
Will you give him all the flock?

65
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,076
He deserves it, that boy!

66
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,866
I swear he deserves it.

67
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:30,659
Thank you.

68
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,617
I'll pay you later.

69
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,324
Thank you, see you.

70
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,283
Sister, you must wear these gloves!

71
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,493
Wear gloves to sell fish?

72
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:41,535
How will I water them with gloves?

73
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,535
Our parents raised us with honor.

74
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,867
Without gloves.

75
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,343
That's enough!

76
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:49,458
You want to cut hands?

77
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:50,393
Here are two! Cut them off!

78
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:51,364
We do no cut hands here !

79
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,220
For gloves, we need hands!

80
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,034
We do not fight with these people.

81
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,201
We're sick and tired!
They already forced us to wear veil.

82
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,283
How to work with gloves?

83
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,991
Calm down.

84
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,826
Not today, not tomorrow!

85
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,951
- In this case, we take you away.
- Take me.

86
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,243
What needs to happen will happen!

87
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,409
Give this to my mother.

88
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,908
Release the handbrake.

89
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:29,991
To the right.

90
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:32,492
Go ahead.

91
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,575
Look in front of you.

92
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,242
We start again.

93
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,909
Again!

94
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,369
Abdelkrim!

95
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:04,493
Can I tell you something ?

96
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,451
Yes, please.

97
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,743
You see ?

98
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,909
You do not know everything.

99
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,136
Only God Almighty knows everything in this life.

100
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:16,664
God be praised.

101
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:23,785
Did you drink ?

102
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,117
Yes, with mom.

103
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,158
Where were you this morning?

104
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,284
With the goats.

105
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,618
You watched the herd?

106
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,659
You're a good girl.

107
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,827
My little bird ...

108
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,909
Wait for me until I return.

109
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,076
I'll bring you gifts.

110
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,575
Look at me. Is it okay?

111
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:17,452
Watch over the herd.

112
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:20,993
See you later.

113
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:27,744
Daddy!

114
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:35,952
My bird ...

115
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,701
Daddy will make a trip and return.

116
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,493
Watch the house and wait.

117
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,160
Dad has left.

118
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,368
I told him

119
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:08,285
not to forget us.

120
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,702
You want to convince me to give up the jihad.

121
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:20,618
Me ?

122
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,077
Who am I to say, "Give up the jihad" ?

123
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,036
The jihad of others is not my business.

124
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,078
I do jihad for myself.

125
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:35,286
I swear, I do not have time for the jihad of others.

126
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,452
If I was not committed

127
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,952
to my moral improvement,

128
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:43,327
I would be the first among you.

129
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,160
I pray to Allah, the Almighty,

130
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,992
and hope he forgives me and forgive you.

131
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:56,117
Help us to turn away from the vanity and pride.

132
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,535
Stop what you are doing.

133
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:01,369
You damage Islam and Muslims.

134
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,827
You endanger the children

135
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,743
in front of their poor mothers.

136
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,036
You even hit

137
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,869
the mother of two children,

138
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,452
without an acceptable reason.

139
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:18,243
Before you

140
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,619
a woman came here to complain

141
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:26,619
that you forced her to wear gloves ...

142
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,494
like that ...

143
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:30,743
without explanation,

144
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,452
without demonstrating their utility,

145
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,827
as prescribed by Allah and His Prophet.

146
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:40,119
Remember the words of Allah Almighty:

147
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:43,494
"Forgive them.

148
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:45,868
"Involve them in decisions.

149
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,827
"Talk with them.

150
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:50,786
"Once you have decided,
put your trust in Allah,'

151
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:53,537
"Because He loves those who trust him."

152
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:56,327
Where is the mercy?

153
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,576
Where is forgiveness?

154
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,869
Where is the piety?

155
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:04,035
Where is the change, the change?

156
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,702
Where is God in all this?

157
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,036
These are the people that I do not like.

158
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:21,994
I do not like them.

159
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,244
But the driver is nice.

160
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:30,785
Who told you he was nice?

161
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:56,342
Peace be upon you !

162
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,244
How are you doing?

163
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,370
Good.

164
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,952
You always come when my husband is gone.

165
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,828
I am a married woman.

166
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:18,035
You go to see her every day after her husband leaves.

167
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,910
She is a married woman.

168
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:30,536
She must cover her head, it's indecent.

169
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,370
He tells you to cover your head.

170
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,786
If it displeases him, he should look away.

171
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,160
A man who harms a woman is ungodly.

172
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,160
She says ...

173
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,494
nobody invited you here.

174
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:55,993
And do not look at what you don't like to see.

175
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,702
If she needs something, she can ask me.

176
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:05,079
If you need something, you can ask him.

177
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,203
Have a good day!

178
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,245
We joined in 1990,

179
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,411
and we beat them in 2001, 2003 and 2005.

180
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,245
2005 ? I don't agree.

181
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:22,954
In 2005 they beat us.

182
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,495
Are you sure about that ?

183
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:25,829
Of course.

184
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:26,995
No, you need to review this.

185
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,620
In 2001 he already left.

186
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:30,744
Who says he left ?

187
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,577
Scumbags.

188
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,411
I respect Zidane, he is a great player.

189
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,620
But he doesn't have the record Messi has.

190
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,411
Messi scored three or four goals per match.

191
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,078
Comparing Barcelona with Real Madrid is pointless.

192
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:46,994
Never !

193
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,454
I'm not comparing,

194
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,162
I just set the record straight.

195
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,995
At that time, France was the only team

196
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:56,077
in the world, that defeated all its rivals.

197
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:58,954
And also won the World Cup.

198
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,412
No... let me tell you about France,

199
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:03,538
it's the only country so well known

200
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,329
that hasn't really ever won anything !

201
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,453
They paid money to Brazil in '98,

202
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,370
or sent them a ship loaded with rice because they are so poor.

203
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,869
And told them: go to bed and let us score three goals.

204
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,078
And so they won the World Cup !

205
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:39,062
Me... I need to leave.

206
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:56,811
I need to leave.

207
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:09,723
Stop, stop.

208
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:21,537
Satima is beautiful, she has a strong spirit.

209
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:24,747
Her husband is a good man.

210
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,497
What are you talking about,

211
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,412
a strong spirit, a good man?

212
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:33,453
One should be a good believer.

213
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,871
They are believers, and that's enough.

214
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,705
Omar, how bad is your Arabic !

215
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:45,745
Yes, I know.

216
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:49,362
I can speak Tamasheq and English.

217
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,170
It's a stormy day.

218
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:45,788
Yes... it makes us think of the past.

219
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:47,747
The neighbors left.

220
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,162
Everyone fled.

221
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:55,204
There's nobody left.

222
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,997
There is only us.

223
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:09,121
I rather stay here.

224
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,413
Where should we go?

225
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:19,663
Why should we always run?

226
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,246
Where to go with Toya

227
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:25,246
facing thirst and drought?

228
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:30,081
Still, we should be closer to others.

229
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,204
The neighbors will eventually return.

230
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,248
All this will stop one day.

231
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,704
These people scare me.

232
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,496
When you're not here, they come.

233
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:53,996
Here?

234
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:56,454
Inside the tent?

235
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,079
No.

236
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,830
I'd like you to support me.

237
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,331
To have patience.

238
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:21,705
If we stick together,

239
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,496
we will fight and we will make it out.

240
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:37,412
I know you're scared.

241
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,454
Me too, I'm afraid.

242
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:51,455
Admit that you miss your friends !

243
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:52,788
That is true.

244
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:07,830
Lift up the lamp, my brother.

245
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:10,621
To the right... to the right.

246
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,455
You need to look at me.

247
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:15,055
In the name of God, the merciful.

248
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:16,527
Peace be upon you brothers.

249
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,247
As you know,

250
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,080
the Prophet said:

251
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:23,581
Believers are parts of the same body...

252
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,413
... when one is hurt ...

253
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,413
... the others suffer too.

254
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:31,454
In the past,

255
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,456
I was doing music

256
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,373
I was a rapper.

257
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,247
In other words, I was a sinner.

258
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:43,040
But thanks to God ...

259
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,497
The problem is you lack of focus.

260
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,831
I don't feel any persuasion in what you say.

261
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:50,206
Are you convinced of what you say here?

262
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,789
- No.
- There you go, tell it to me straight.

263
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:53,623
It's not worth the pain of filming it.

264
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,789
Let me do it.

265
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,081
Brothers,

266
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,122
In the past I was doing rap.

267
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,040
Today, God be praised,

268
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,956
I am on the road of God.

269
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,247
The road of Jihad.

270
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,206
Do you see my eyes ? There's no movement,

271
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,747
no extraneous gestures.

272
00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:17,164
I am convinced of what I say.

273
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,665
This is how you should say it.

274
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,872
Don't move like that or like this.

275
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,664
We're not doing rap, this is serious.

276
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,539
Come.

277
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,455
In this world,

278
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,581
everything perishes...

279
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:48,249
Stop. What is bothering you in this world ?

280
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:53,622
Firstly, the West...

281
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:56,957
The injustice ! You decry injustice.

282
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:02,373
Injustice... You've seen parents suffering,

283
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,704
You've seen the abuse.

284
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:07,664
It must stop today. You're done waiting.

285
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,873
In this world...

286
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,248
Where is this music coming from?

287
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,374
Abu Hassan sent us to find where it comes from.

288
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,206
Go there. We are searching here.

289
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,749
Let's go.

290
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:31,122
You're going that way, me this way, we meet in the square.

291
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:32,192
Ok.

292
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,957
Good evening, Abu Hassan.

293
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:51,041
Good evening.

294
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:54,082
I know where the music comes from.

295
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,915
I found where the music comes from.

296
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:02,165
There are praises to God and His prophet.

297
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:10,540
Should I hold them?

298
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:52,581
Pay attention to my nets!

299
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:09,249
GPS !

300
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,207
Daddy !

301
00:34:56,375 --> 00:35:00,290
Issan returned crying without his stick.

302
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,707
Where?

303
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,166
What happened, my boy?

304
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,583
Where are the animals ?

305
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,041
Why are you crying?

306
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,707
Where are the animals ?

307
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:29,333
GPS is dead.

308
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,290
what about GPS ?

309
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:34,792
Who killed her?

310
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:38,916
She was killed ...

311
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,458
by Amadou, the fisherman.

312
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,084
Get up.

313
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,125
Come.

314
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,333
Stop crying.

315
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,042
Tell me what happened.

316
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:13,667
I led the animals to the river,

317
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,834
to drink...

318
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:21,624
GPS escaped and went straight

319
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:24,500
into the nets of Amadou.

320
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,042
I went to get her,

321
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:34,708
but I arrived too late, he had killed her.

322
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,250
Don't cry, Issan.

323
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,000
Amadou killed GPS.

324
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,793
Why did he kill her?

325
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:38,583
To prevent the herd from drinking.

326
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,917
I do not understand.

327
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:46,292
You should go talk to him.

328
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,917
Go without your weapon.

329
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:51,083
That weapon, I've had it since you met me.

330
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,210
When I met you, you did not have Toya.

331
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:02,167
Weep not, it will not bring GPS back.

332
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,084
Do not cry.

333
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,125
We will have another cow

334
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,418
and we will call her GPS too.

335
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:41,459
Come what may.

336
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,709
But all this ...

337
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,084
should stop.

338
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,375
The humiliation should not continue.

339
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:00,251
What I don't say, you know.

340
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:29,377
Issan, why are you worried ?

341
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,209
I think of my father.

342
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:34,292
How was your father?

343
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:36,458
My father was big,

344
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,918
strong and kind.

345
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,459
A better stockbreeder than yours.

346
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,626
He knew more about the animals.

347
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:50,001
My father is also

348
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,084
big and strong,

349
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,501
and if he's still alive,

350
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,919
it's because he plays guitar and he sings.

351
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:05,085
He is not with the warriors.

352
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,335
Those who wage war die quickly.

353
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,709
If he is there or not,

354
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:16,500
I know he sings, but don't tell anyone.

355
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,127
I will not tell anyone.

356
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:40,711
Here...

357
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:42,376
...under Islam...

358
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,399
..it is forbidden...

359
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,668
Peace be upon you.

360
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,460
- Is this ball yours ?
- No, I swear!

361
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:56,084
It is forbidden...

362
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,626
... sitting...

363
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,210
...in the streets...

364
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,335
...and in front of houses...

365
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,044
...and doing idle things...

366
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,961
...to waste time...

367
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:10,585
...in the street.

368
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,460
Come on, baby.

369
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:15,502
The sin of adultery

370
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:18,668
and uncleanness.

371
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:20,459
Adultery...

372
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:24,460
...during the month of Ramadan...

373
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,002
...major sins...

374
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,918
The punishment is

375
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:34,961
death by stoning.

376
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:45,679
You played football; do you know it's prohibited ?

377
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:49,502
Did you know football is prohibited ?

378
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,463
Yes.

379
00:42:52,760 --> 00:43:00,343
Since you knew that football is prohibited, you are sentenced to 20 lashes.

380
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:03,043
Because you knew that it's prohibited,

381
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,794
you will be punished with 20 lashes.

382
00:45:07,252 --> 00:45:08,586
You bastard!

383
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:12,337
Amadou, is the water yours or your grandfather's ?

384
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,336
By what right?

385
00:45:16,837 --> 00:45:19,670
Are you crazy or what?

386
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:22,627
What are you doing?

387
00:48:54,086 --> 00:48:55,962
Peace be upon you, Abdelkrim.

388
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,587
Hello.

389
00:48:57,754 --> 00:49:00,171
Peace be upon you also Abu Jaafar.

390
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:03,547
There was a murder here.

391
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:05,504
What ?

392
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:07,337
There was a murder here.

393
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:11,629
Your Arabic is incomprehensible.

394
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:14,045
Speak in English.

395
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,838
There was a murder here.

396
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:17,796
No, no, no... tell me in English!

397
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:19,921
Ok, sir.

398
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:22,878
I say that somebody killed somebody here.

399
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:24,587
What ?

400
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,171
Who killed who?

401
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,296
Somebody killed somebody here.

402
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:32,587
I will call you back.

403
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,554
Peace be upon you.

404
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:50,004
Your name?

405
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,421
Kidane.

406
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,755
Do you have a gun?

407
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:59,337
Your phone too.

408
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:03,712
Go up.

409
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:59,170
Mom, when will daddy return?

410
00:51:00,797 --> 00:51:02,004
Soon.

411
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:05,338
Let's wait where there's network signal.

412
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:11,338
Call my wife, I want to let her know.

413
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,838
I do not understand!

414
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,213
Who speaks Tamasheq here? Please, help me!

415
00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:28,364
Peace be upon you.

416
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,214
Please, call my wife.

417
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,256
Her name is Satima.

418
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,380
At 70 52 52 11.

419
00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:41,922
I promised. They have no news.

420
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:48,547
70 52 52...

421
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:51,296
May God help you.

422
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,409
<i>This is my land and this is my Timbuktu...</i>

423
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:52,706
<i>It's children are mourning and suffering</i>

424
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:57,226
<i>It's the land of love and warmth and dignity</i>

425
00:55:15,508 --> 00:55:21,714
<i>So tell me, why are the children crying ?</i>

426
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:28,620
<i>Because of the injustice, violence, and fear of the future</i>

427
00:55:30,488 --> 00:55:33,951
<i>Stop crying, my Timbuktu will always be here</i>

428
00:55:56,673 --> 00:55:58,672
Everything will go very fast.

429
00:55:59,048 --> 00:56:00,672
You've got little time left.

430
00:56:02,257 --> 00:56:04,173
You will be judged very quickly.

431
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:10,631
Sharia law will be applied.

432
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:21,047
The judge is a just man, he will apply the law of God.

433
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:29,339
You will have to obtain forgiveness

434
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:31,923
from the family of Amadou.

435
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:40,215
We will also settle the price of blood.

436
00:56:46,965 --> 00:56:48,840
Do you have cattle?

437
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:53,757
Tell him I had eight cows.

438
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:56,132
GPS is dead.

439
00:56:57,215 --> 00:56:59,090
I only have seven left.

440
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:06,172
He said he had eight cows but one was killed.

441
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:13,966
Regardless, he has to give at least forty.

442
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:17,381
You will be required to give forty cows.

443
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:22,007
You are a stockbreeder, you have cattle.

444
00:57:24,383 --> 00:57:25,840
Forty cows?

445
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:27,465
Exactly.

446
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:32,506
I cannot stop fate.

447
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:36,590
My life is in the hands of God.

448
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:45,174
That is right.

449
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,298
Now, I would like...

450
00:58:03,424 --> 00:58:05,006
to ask him a question.

451
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:10,756
No disrespect. I just want to know ...

452
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:22,340
Go on.

453
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:28,590
Tell him I want to know

454
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:30,299
if he has children.

455
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:49,048
God blessed him with two,

456
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,423
one is a boy of eight.

457
00:59:02,298 --> 00:59:05,006
The Almighty has given me a single girl,

458
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:07,131
which is twelve

459
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:08,883
and she is called Toya.

460
00:59:25,506 --> 00:59:27,882
She is everything to me.

461
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:31,341
She brings me milk to drink in the morning.

462
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:36,049
She brings the cattle back at dusk.

463
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:39,091
I have nothing in life

464
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:43,049
that is more precious than her.

465
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:04,050
God gave him a boy.

466
01:00:04,217 --> 01:00:06,882
I have not had that chance,

467
01:00:07,049 --> 01:00:09,465
He only gave me a girl.

468
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:12,508
But she fills my whole being.

469
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,132
I speak to you.

470
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:31,882
Tell me.

471
01:00:32,507 --> 01:00:34,632
You look like someone I know.

472
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,174
Like who ?

473
01:00:39,423 --> 01:00:42,717
Mohamed Ag Elgimit, of the tribe Kel Assouk,

474
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,132
of Lere.

475
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:47,924
I do not know him.

476
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:50,882
I come from the green country,

477
01:00:51,175 --> 01:00:52,300
from Libya.

478
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,008
Libya?

479
01:00:55,299 --> 01:00:58,757
It was here that my family lived until now.

480
01:01:03,008 --> 01:01:04,925
What have you to do with these people?

481
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:09,591
A long history connects us.

482
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,007
They brought me here.

483
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,635
What is written will be done.

484
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,384
I am at peace with death.

485
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:30,800
We are all His children.

486
01:01:34,592 --> 01:01:36,674
We must protect our children.

487
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,590
My daughter will not be protected.

488
01:01:42,843 --> 01:01:45,926
That hurts my whole being.

489
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,132
Down in the grave without knowing what will happen to her.

490
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,842
Most of our relatives have already left.

491
01:01:57,216 --> 01:01:58,883
But in all this,

492
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,634
since there is only one God,

493
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:06,425
I worship,

494
01:02:10,384 --> 01:02:12,633
He will make justice.

495
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,342
No one escapes his fate.

496
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:39,842
Tell him that it's not death that scares me

497
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:43,466
but not being able to look back

498
01:02:44,132 --> 01:02:45,676
and find her face.

499
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:50,384
Not seeing her before I die, it hurts.

500
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:15,800
Knowing that his daughter

501
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:19,301
will soon be an orphan

502
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:21,133
really makes me sad,

503
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:23,341
but do not translate that.

504
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,466
Understood.

505
01:04:55,384 --> 01:05:00,925
Do you know that yesterday evening
you were caught in a room playing music ?

506
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:02,968
Yes.

507
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:04,634
Do you know it's prohibited ?

508
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:06,301
Yes.

509
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:09,633
Since your parents were not present,

510
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,677
you will be convicted to forty lashes

511
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:13,926
for playing music,

512
01:05:14,093 --> 01:05:17,133
and another forty for meeting by yourselves.

513
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:33,426
Look what I found.

514
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:36,968
Abdelkrim...

515
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:40,386
Everyone knows that you smoke.

516
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:43,510
There's no need to hide from me.

517
01:07:58,969 --> 01:08:00,051
Who told you that I smoke ?

518
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,386
It was twelfth of January -

519
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:26,133
2010, six fifty three in the afternoon, exactly

520
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,135
the same time as Miami.

521
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:31,969
At six fifty three, time of Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

522
01:08:32,386 --> 01:08:33,886
the Earth trembled,

523
01:08:34,051 --> 01:08:35,801
and I found myself here,

524
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:40,594
at precisely nine fifty three.

525
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:44,051
Nine fifty three from Gonaives, Haiti, is that right ?

526
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:48,719
You've been there before

527
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:51,135
Take this, it's for you.

528
01:08:51,302 --> 01:08:53,927
- It will bring you luck.
- Thank you.

529
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,219
Regardless the passage of time,

530
01:08:58,387 --> 01:09:00,052
the trembling of the earth is my body,

531
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:02,052
I am the cracks !

532
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:04,760
Cracks everywhere from my head to my feet

533
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:07,927
From my head to my feet to my stomach to my arms to my ass.

534
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:09,552
On my face.

535
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:11,970
Regardless of weather...

536
01:09:13,052 --> 01:09:14,469
I am cracked.

537
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,927
Me and Gonaives both,

538
01:09:17,094 --> 01:09:19,261
filled with cracks.

539
01:09:19,426 --> 01:09:21,885
Come baby, come.

540
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:29,261
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes.

541
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:30,220
Cover your face.

542
01:09:32,553 --> 01:09:35,052
- What are you doing here ?
- Nothing.

543
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:36,385
Nothing ?

544
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:39,177
- I said what are you doing here ?
- I was talking on the phone.

545
01:09:39,636 --> 01:09:40,803
With who ?

546
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:42,885
With my brother.

547
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:44,219
You lie.

548
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:46,635
I told you I was talking with my brother, you say I lie.

549
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,718
It's a lie, take her.

550
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:52,343
Don't touch me, don't touch me !

551
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:20,095
Abu Jaafar, speak please.

552
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:39,846
He says

553
01:13:40,263 --> 01:13:42,595
he saw the girl in town,

554
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:46,428
she has a decent behavior and she's a beautiful girl

555
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:49,637
and he wants to marry her.

556
01:13:56,386 --> 01:13:57,345
She says

557
01:13:58,303 --> 01:14:00,512
that this way of doing things is not right.

558
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:02,137
Not with the tradition.

559
01:14:03,262 --> 01:14:05,054
And the father was not there.

560
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:27,262
He said:

561
01:14:27,636 --> 01:14:28,594
why?

562
01:14:29,555 --> 01:14:31,887
He asks why.

563
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:33,721
Why?

564
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,428
Why should I give my daughter

565
01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:39,178
to a stranger?

566
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:42,304
Who is he for me to give him my daughter?

567
01:15:01,138 --> 01:15:02,012
He came

568
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:05,096
peacefully.

569
01:15:05,554 --> 01:15:07,971
Your refusal obliges him

570
01:15:08,428 --> 01:15:11,388
to use the force.

571
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:14,346
I'm not afraid of him.

572
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:16,554
I'm afraid of God.

573
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:36,221
He goes away now.

574
01:15:36,388 --> 01:15:39,555
He will use force if necessary.

575
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,721
It's good.

576
01:16:22,928 --> 01:16:24,971
Good, good.

577
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:26,471
Did you see that ?

578
01:16:26,637 --> 01:16:32,178
- Is it good ?
- Yes, God bless you.

579
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:48,388
33...

580
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:49,846
34...

581
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,012
35...

582
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:56,097
36...

583
01:16:57,556 --> 01:16:58,596
37...

584
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,011
38...

585
01:17:02,428 --> 01:17:03,470
39...

586
01:17:04,429 --> 01:17:05,513
40.

587
01:17:14,886 --> 01:17:16,555
Hello.

588
01:17:20,805 --> 01:17:22,388
No network...

589
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:30,763
Hello... hello...

590
01:17:43,388 --> 01:17:45,929
Peace be upon you.

591
01:18:25,096 --> 01:18:29,264
And upon you Peace.

592
01:18:26,558 --> 01:18:30,849
Please ask the mother of Amadou if she forgives the killer or not.

593
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:37,054
I do not forgive. His death made me too ill.

594
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:39,514
Maybe tomorrow, but not today.

595
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,305
It felt too bad.

596
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:44,806
His blood is still warm.

597
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,638
She will not forgive, she is still in shock.

598
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:24,764
Ask him to raise his head.

599
01:19:25,389 --> 01:19:26,222
Raise your head !

600
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:31,848
Satima.

601
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:36,597
I'm listening.

602
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:39,471
I am the driver of Abdelkrim.

603
01:19:40,638 --> 01:19:42,847
I have a message from him.

604
01:19:43,889 --> 01:19:45,556
There is nothing he can do.

605
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:48,181
It's over.

606
01:20:18,472 --> 01:20:19,556
Tell him ...

607
01:20:21,389 --> 01:20:24,556
the death of Amadou hurt me badly.

608
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:28,013
I did not want it.

609
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,056
As the sun rose this morning

610
01:20:34,848 --> 01:20:38,597
and that I am still alive,

611
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,347
another day that God gave me,

612
01:20:41,722 --> 01:20:43,514
what is going to happen,

613
01:20:44,099 --> 01:20:45,265
I accept it.

614
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:52,597
Only one thing I will miss.

615
01:20:55,431 --> 01:20:56,848
A face.

616
01:20:58,556 --> 01:21:00,138
The face of my daughter,

617
01:21:01,806 --> 01:21:03,430
that of my wife.

618
01:21:06,806 --> 01:21:08,598
I ask God ...

619
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:11,306
If you have children,

620
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:14,389
it will help you

621
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:20,139
to understand my pain.

622
01:21:22,848 --> 01:21:25,015
I do not fear the death you give me.

623
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:26,848
It has a place in me.

624
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:31,848
As you say, follow the law of Allah,

625
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:34,682
do it.

626
01:21:36,682 --> 01:21:37,765
I'm ready.

627
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:26,848
You gave her daughter in marriage

628
01:22:27,182 --> 01:22:29,306
to one of you,

629
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:33,596
without her consent or the presence of her guardian.

630
01:22:34,098 --> 01:22:35,472
I had already asked

631
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:40,305
my brother here

632
01:22:40,849 --> 01:22:42,598
to convey to you the case.

633
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:45,306
This action

634
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:48,639
was improvised during the night,

635
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:51,932
under the cover of darkness,

636
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:54,348
which is legally unacceptable.

637
01:22:55,973 --> 01:22:58,014
Regarding her daughter

638
01:23:00,139 --> 01:23:03,764
you have married her without her consent

639
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,806
to one of your young men ...

640
01:23:08,724 --> 01:23:09,850
My sister,

641
01:23:10,141 --> 01:23:13,848
what is the name the person who imposed the marriage?

642
01:23:14,098 --> 01:23:15,640
His name is Abu Jaafar.

643
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:19,391
She says he is called Abu Jaafar.

644
01:23:21,515 --> 01:23:22,640
That is why

645
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,014
I preferred to come myself

646
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:28,390
to explain the issue

647
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,807
this case,

648
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:35,890
and for you to clarify your position.

649
01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:37,473
That's right.

650
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:42,139
We have married Fatima ...

651
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:44,015
Her name is Safia.

652
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,807
Safia, with Abu Jaafar.

653
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:49,974
It was a wedding ...

654
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:53,223
legal.

655
01:23:54,389 --> 01:23:56,598
Based on Islamic law.

656
01:23:57,974 --> 01:24:00,766
Regarding the absence of the guardian,

657
01:24:01,766 --> 01:24:03,140
we are here

658
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:05,597
the guardians of any action

659
01:24:06,889 --> 01:24:09,307
since we act in this territory.

660
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:14,557
We married Abu Jaafar

661
01:24:17,973 --> 01:24:20,890
taking inspiration the words of the Prophet ...

662
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:25,307
"If anyone comes to you and you recognize his faith,

663
01:24:25,682 --> 01:24:26,765
"Marry him."

664
01:24:27,723 --> 01:24:30,557
Abu Jaafar is a pious young man,

665
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,432
a dove of the mosques, a fighter,

666
01:24:35,765 --> 01:24:36,765
he is perfect.

667
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,224
On this basis, we have married them

668
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:44,181
and it's a perfect marriage.

669
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:47,265
The case was repeated

670
01:24:48,473 --> 01:24:50,849
more than once in Timbuktu

671
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:53,350
this has troubled the people

672
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:55,975
and caused

673
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,723
many frustrations and anxieties.

674
01:24:59,223 --> 01:25:00,973
We do not see

675
01:25:01,558 --> 01:25:05,766
frustration or anything like that.

676
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:08,682
We apply the law of Allah

677
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,099
and the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him.

678
01:25:12,682 --> 01:25:14,932
We have consulted

679
01:25:17,057 --> 01:25:18,598
and acted

680
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:21,515
with full legality.

681
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,433
Mecca is in that direction.

682
01:29:26,642 --> 01:29:27,600
I know.

683
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:32,642
My daughter and her mother are there.

684
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,642
Get me the motorcyclist !
