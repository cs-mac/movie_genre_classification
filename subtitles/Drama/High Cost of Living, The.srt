1
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,815
They ought to make the day the time
changes the first day of summer.

2
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,155
What?

3
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,416
Well, it's eight o'clock
and it's still light.

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,262
A lot of good
the extra daylight does us.

5
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:26,020
Now we've still got
a three-hour drive back.

6
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,030
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

7
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,792
Well, if it really bugged you,
Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

8
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,681
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

9
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,858
You know, I figure we're either
gonna have to move mother out here,

10
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,495
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

11
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,588
She can't make
a trip like this.

12
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,848
I don't know that she can't.

13
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,909
- Is there any candy left?
- No.

14
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,671
Look at this thing.
"We still remember. "

15
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,267
I don't. You know,
I don't even remember what the man I

16
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,067
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

17
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:59,173
5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave
and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

18
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,476
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the count

19
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,569
and she stays at home.

20
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,536
Well, we're here, John, all right?

21
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,750
Radio: Testing... back on...
Ah, ladies and... We're coming back

22
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,262
on the air after an interruption
due to technical problem...

23
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:33,792
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

24
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,136
Which row is it in?

25
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,447
There's no one around.

26
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,335
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

27
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,265
Oh, look, I already lost
an hour's sleep in the time change.

28
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,405
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

29
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,122
There it is.

30
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,707
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

31
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,097
Each year we spend
good money on these things.

32
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,777
We come out here, and the
one from last year is gone.

33
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,744
Well, the flowers die,

34
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,549
And the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:42,106
Yeah, a little spit and polish,

36
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,404
he can clean this up sell it next year.

37
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,711
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one?

38
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,804
Hey, come on, Barb,
church was this morning, huh?

39
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,078
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church, huh? Come on.

40
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,134
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

41
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,278
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

42
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,548
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,557
It was from right over there.

44
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,566
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

45
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,329
And grandpa got all excited, and
he shook his fist at me, and he said,

46
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,715
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "

47
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,561
Remember that?
Right over there.

48
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,403
Well, you used
to really be scared here.

49
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,376
Johnny.

50
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:02,268
- Well, you're still afraid.
- Stop it now. I mean it.

51
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,217
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

52
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,154
Stop it. You're ignorant.

53
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,450
They're coming for you, Barbra.

54
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,505
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,389
They're coming for you.

56
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,696
Look! There comes one of them now.

57
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,379
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes. I getting out of here.

58
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,636
Johnny!

59
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,607
Johnny!

60
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,449
Help me!

61
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,600
It's all right.

62
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,833
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

63
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,931
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

64
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,702
Truck is outta gas.

65
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,796
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

66
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,735
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

67
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:23,791
I suppose you've tried this.

68
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,884
Do you live here?

69
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,958
We've gotta get out of here.

70
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,260
We have to get where there
are some other people.

71
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:08,121
Maybe we better take some food.

72
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:12,349
I'll see if I can find some food.

73
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:58,897
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

74
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:00,361
What's happening?

75
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,389
Two of them.

76
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:23,678
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

77
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:25,854
I can take care of those two.

78
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,449
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

79
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:30,543
What's happening?

80
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,866
They know we're in here now.

81
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:09,526
Don't look at it.

82
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:25,041
Get some more lights on in this house.

83
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,106
Why don't you see if you can find
some wood, some boards,

84
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,199
something there by the fireplace,
Something we can nail this place up?

85
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,226
Well, goddamn...

86
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:21,469
Look. I know you're afraid.
I'm afraid too.

87
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:24,991
But we have to try
to board the house up together.

88
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,621
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

89
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:30,308
We'll be all right here.

90
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:33,900
We'll be all right till someone comes to
rescue us. But we have to work together.

91
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:35,031
You'll have to help me.

92
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:38,337
Now I want you to go in and get
some wood so I can board the place up.

93
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:40,221
Ok?

94
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,524
Ok?

95
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:23,349
They're not that strong.

96
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:26,865
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

97
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:35,028
There, this room looks pretty secure.

98
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,009
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

99
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,330
Won't be long before those things'll
be back, pounding their way in here.

100
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:49,888
They're afraid now.

101
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:54,451
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

102
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:10,651
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's diner?

103
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,446
Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

104
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,506
There's a radio in the truck.

105
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:27,897
I had jumped in to listen to it,

106
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,502
When a big gasoline truck came
screaming right across the road.

107
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:36,562
Well, there must have been
10-15 of those things chasing after it.

108
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,744
Grabbing and holding on.

109
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,101
Now, I didn't see them at first.

110
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,873
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

111
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:53,222
And those things
were catching up to it.

112
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:58,747
Truck went
right across the road.

113
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:02,724
Slammed on my brakes to keep
from hitting it myself.

114
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,152
It went right through
the guard rail.

115
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:15,324
I guess... I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

116
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,673
into that gas station
by Beekman's diner.

117
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:22,775
It went right through the billboard.
Ripped over a gas pump,

118
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:23,745
and never stopped moving.

119
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,585
By now it's like a moving bonfire.

120
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:33,450
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

121
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:40,189
I can still hear the man, screaming.

122
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,933
This thing is
just backing away from it.

123
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:52,831
I look back at the diner to see

124
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:55,175
If there was anyone there
who could help me.

125
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:59,828
That was when I noticed that

126
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:02,291
The entire place
had been encircled.

127
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,230
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

128
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,300
by now, there were no more screams.

129
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,361
I realized that...

130
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:20,381
I was alone.

131
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:21,631
With 50 or 60 of those things.

132
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:26,026
Just standing there,

133
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:28,788
staring at me.

134
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,388
I started to drive. I...

135
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,988
Just plowed right through them.

136
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,830
They didn't move.

137
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:43,607
They didn't run, or...
Just stood there, staring at me.

138
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:48,044
Just wanted to crush them.

139
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,457
They...
Scattered through the air, like bugs.

140
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,858
We were riding in the cemetery.

141
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:04,285
Johnny and me.

142
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:06,713
Johnny.

143
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:17,137
We... we came to put a wreath
on my father's grave.

144
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:22,955
Johnny and...
and he said,

145
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:27,099
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

146
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:32,457
And we didn't have any.

147
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,517
And...

148
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:42,545
Oh, it's hot in here.

149
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,303
Hot...

150
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:53,826
And he said, "Oh, it's late. "

151
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,401
"Why did we start so late?"

152
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,213
And I said, "Johnny,

153
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,968
"if you'd gotten up earlier,

154
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,810
"we wouldn't be late. "

155
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:07,954
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

156
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,387
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny. "

157
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:17,080
And then this man
started walking up the road.

158
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:22,731
He came slowly, and Johnny
kept teasing me and saying,

159
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:25,996
"He's coming to get you, Barbra. "

160
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,093
And I laughed at him, and said,
"Johnny, stop it. "

161
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,656
And then Johnny ran away.

162
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,042
And I went up to this man,

163
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:38,344
and I was going to apologize,

164
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:41,694
Why don't you just keep calm?

165
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:45,586
And I looked up,
and I said, "Good eve... "

166
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:48,558
And he grabbed me!

167
00:29:49,814 --> 00:29:53,581
He grabbed me!
And he ripped at me!

168
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:57,182
He held me and he ripped
at my clothes!

169
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:59,568
I think you should just calm down.

170
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:04,214
Oh, I screamed,
"Johnny! Johnny, help me! Oh, help me!"

171
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:07,604
And he wouldn't let me go.
He ripped...

172
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:13,381
And then Johnny came and he ran

173
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,771
And he... he fought this man,

174
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,497
And I got so afraid I ran.

175
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,297
I ran... I ran...

176
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,037
And Johnny didn't come.

177
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,558
We've got...
we have to wait for Johnny.

178
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,846
Maybe... we'd better go out
and get him.

179
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:45,445
We have to go out and get Johnny.

180
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:46,994
He's out there.

181
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:52,059
Please, don't you hear me?
We've got to go out and get him.

182
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,209
Please!
We have got to go get Johnny!

183
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,636
Please help me!

184
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,994
Look, don't you know what's going on out
there? This is no Sunday school picnic.

185
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,387
Don't you understand?
My brother is alone.

186
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:11,566
- Your brother is dead.
- No! My brother is not dead!

187
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,077
Radio: Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,

188
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:11,300
and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,

189
00:32:11,342 --> 00:32:14,314
this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.

190
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,867
This station and hundreds of other
radio and TV stations

191
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,960
throughout this part of the country
are pooling their resources

192
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:24,151
Through an emergency network hookup
to keep you informed of all developments.

193
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,876
At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.

194
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,676
There is an epidemic of mass murder

195
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:32,775
being committed by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.

196
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:35,370
The murders are taking place
in villages, cities,

197
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:40,476
Rural homes and suburbs with no apparent
pattern or reason for the slayings.

198
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:43,657
It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.

199
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:46,511
We have some descriptions
of the assassins.

200
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:49,371
Eyewitnesses say they are
ordinary looking people.

201
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:52,197
Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.

202
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,704
Others describe them as being...

203
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:09,694
So, at this point there is
no really authentic way for us

204
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,704
to say who or what to look for
and guard yourself against.

205
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:15,639
...reaction of
law enforcement officials

206
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:19,741
is one of complete
bewilderment at this hour.

207
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:25,852
Police, sheriffs' deputies,
and emergency ambulances

208
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,903
are literally deluged
with calls for help

209
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,373
The scene can best be described
as mayhem.

210
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,802
Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,

211
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,606
Along with the governors of several
eastern and midwestern states

212
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:39,122
have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,

213
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,378
but that has not happened as yet.

214
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:44,899
The only advice our reporters have been
able to get from official sources

215
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:48,917
is for private citizens to stay
in their homes behind locked doors.

216
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,561
Do not venture outside,
for any reason,

217
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,396
until the nature of this crisis
has been determined

218
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,619
and until we can advise
what course of action to take.

219
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:59,383
Keep listening to radio and TV

220
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:02,689
for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.

221
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,912
Thousands of office and factory
workers are being urged

222
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,796
to stay at their places of employment,

223
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,391
not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.

224
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,454
However, in spite of this
urging and warning,

225
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,791
streets and highways are packed
with frantic people

226
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:19,475
trying to reach their families,
or apparently to flee just anywhere.

227
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:25,168
Repeat: The safest course of action at
this time is simply to stay where you...

228
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:45,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word

229
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:47,939
that the president has called
a meeting of his cabinet

230
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:50,542
to deal with
the sudden epidemic of murder

231
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:53,088
which has seized the eastern
third of this nation.

232
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,600
The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.

233
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:58,070
Members of the presidential
cabinet will be joined

234
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:01,963
by officials of the FBI and the joint
chiefs behind closed doors.

235
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,767
A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,

236
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,819
says there will be
an official announcement

237
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,870
as soon as possible
following that meeting.

238
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:11,339
This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.

239
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:16,488
Latest word also from national
press services in Washington, D.C.,

240
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:21,009
that the emergency presidential
conference which we've just mentioned

241
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,693
Will include high-ranking scientists
from NASA.

242
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:38,590
Radio and TV stations across
the eastern part of the country

243
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:40,599
including the one
to which you are listening

244
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:43,738
have joined their facilities
in an emergency network

245
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,790
to bring you this news
as it develops.

246
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,469
We urge you to stay tuned
to radio and TV

247
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:50,436
and to stay indoors at all costs.

248
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,204
Late reports
reaching this newsroom

249
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,255
tell of frightened people
seeking refuge

250
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:58,306
in churches, schools
and government buildings.

251
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:00,071
Demanding shelter
and protection

252
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:01,697
from the wholesale murder
which apparently

253
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,538
is engulfing
much of the nation.

254
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,887
Law enforcement officials
are at a loss to explain or,

255
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,855
even at this hour, even to theorize

256
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:11,074
about the reasons
for this wave of murder...

257
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:18,190
Chief T.K. Dunmore of Camden, North
Carolina, is quoted as saying, quote,

258
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:22,836
"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets. "

259
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,234
"Tell 'em to go home and lock
their doors and windows up tight. "

260
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,784
"We don't know what kind of murder-happy
characters we have here. " End quote.

261
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,887
That's chief Dunmore of Camden,
North Carolina.

262
00:36:34,598 --> 00:36:37,362
So far the only descriptions,
the only clues,

263
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,547
anyone has of the killers
come from frightened witnesses.

264
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,765
These eyewitness accounts
variously describe

265
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,900
the murderers
as "ordinary looking people,"

266
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,575
"Misshapen monsters. "

267
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:49,675
"People who look
like they're in a trance. "

268
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,394
And "things that look like
people but act like animals. "

269
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:56,031
Some eyewitnesses tell
of seeing victims

270
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,626
who look as though
they had been torn apart.

271
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:03,147
This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago

272
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:07,249
with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven...

273
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,426
Since then, reports
of some senseless killings

274
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,477
began snowballing
in a reign of terror

275
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:12,356
which has hopscotched...

276
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,760
...keep track of
the murder reports

277
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:20,770
by the placing of markers on a map

278
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:22,654
seem to indicate
a general spreading

279
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:26,254
from the extreme southeastern
and states north and west.

280
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:28,514
Our newsmen,
who have been on the telephone

281
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,488
talking with officials
of other cities

282
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,495
have determined that none
of this kind of mass murder

283
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:36,844
has yet been reported west of
the Mississippi river,

284
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:40,026
except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.

285
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:42,035
Similar killings
have been reported

286
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:43,834
around the Houston
and Galveston areas

287
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:44,930
but nothing like the...

288
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,472
I found a gun
and some bullets out there.

289
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:50,532
Oh, and these.

290
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,620
This place is boarded up
pretty solid now.

291
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,634
We ought to be all right here
for a while.

292
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,276
We have a gun and bullets,

293
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,327
Food and the radio,

294
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,146
Sooner or later, someone's bound
to come and get us out.

295
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,709
So again, we join
with law enforcement agencies

296
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:21,928
in urging you
to seek shelter in a building.

297
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,789
Lock the doors and windows
securely.

298
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:25,569
Hey, that's us.
We're doing all right.

299
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:27,578
Be cautious
of any suspicious strangers,

300
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,629
and keep tuned to your
radio and television

301
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:30,850
for survival instructions

302
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:33,146
and further details
of this continuing story.

303
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,029
Look, I don't know
if you're hearing me.

304
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,709
But I'm going upstairs now.

305
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:42,522
If anything should try to break in,
I can hear it from up there.

306
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:44,322
I'll be down to take care of it.

307
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:47,929
Everything is all right for now.

308
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:51,229
I'll be back to reinforce
the windows and doors later.

309
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:53,783
But you'll be all right
for now, ok?

310
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:57,383
Ok?

311
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,699
Radio: Civil defense
officials in Cumberland

312
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:03,954
have told newsmen
that murder victims

313
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:08,978
show evidence of having been
partially devour by their murderers.

314
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:50,753
Consistent reports from witnesses
to the effect that people

315
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,642
who acted
as though they were in a kind of trance

316
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,407
were killing and eating
their victims.

317
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:59,083
Prompted authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.

318
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:02,726
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases

319
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:07,037
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they murdered.

320
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:11,098
Repeating this latest bulletin just
received moments ago from Cumberland.

321
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,484
Civil defense authorities
have told newsmen

322
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,535
that murder victims show evidence

323
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,465
of having been partially
devoured by their murderers.

324
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:22,274
Medical examination of victims' bodies
shows conclusively that

325
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:25,330
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.

326
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,814
And so this incredible story
becomes more ghastly with each report.

327
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:33,039
It's difficult to imagine
such a thing actually happening

328
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,757
but these are the reports we have been
receiving and passing on to you,

329
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:40,065
Reports which have been verified
as completely as is possible

330
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,697
in this confused situation.

331
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:57,688
- Hold it!
- Don't shoot. We're from town.

332
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,776
A radio!

333
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,801
Radio: The Butler county sheriff
has verified that reports

334
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:06,981
of murder victims being partially
eaten by their slayers is true.

335
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:12,171
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

336
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:13,601
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

337
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:15,980
You mean you didn't hear the
racket we were making up here?

338
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,032
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

339
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:20,041
Could've been those things
for all we knew.

340
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,178
That girl was screaming.

341
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:23,473
Surely you must know what
a girl screaming sounds like.

342
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:24,562
Those things don't make any noise.

343
00:41:24,897 --> 00:41:27,122
Anybody would know
somebody needed help.

344
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:29,710
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

345
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,054
We thought we could hear screams,
but for all we knew,

346
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,901
that could have meant those things
were in the house after her.

347
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:38,124
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

348
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,385
The racket sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

349
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,101
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

350
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,649
Now wait a minute.

351
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:46,286
You just got finished saying you
couldn't hear it from down there.

352
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:48,673
Now you say it sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

353
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,017
It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

354
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,320
All right, now you tell me.

355
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:57,254
I'm not going to take that kind of a
chance when we've got a safe place.

356
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,933
We luck into a safe place,
and you're telling us

357
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,198
we've gotta risk our lives just because
somebody might need help, huh?

358
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:06,422
- Yeah. Something like that.
- All right, why don't we settle this...

359
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:07,468
Look, mister!

360
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,184
We came up, ok? We're here.

361
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:11,996
Now I suggest
we all go back downstairs

362
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,040
before any of those things
find out we're in here.

363
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,380
They can't get in here.

364
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:17,263
You got the whole place boarded up?

365
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:18,100
Yeah, most of it.

366
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:21,323
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

367
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:24,338
You are insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

368
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,144
I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

369
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,193
And I'm telling you, those
things turned over our car.

370
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:30,993
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

371
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:34,969
Now you tell me those... things can't
get through this lousy pile of wood?

372
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:39,114
His wife and kid's downstairs.
The kid's hurt.

373
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:43,007
Well, I still think
we're better off up here.

374
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,397
We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

375
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:49,119
With all of us working, we could
fix this place up in no time.

376
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,834
We have everything we need up here.

377
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:53,639
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

378
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:55,271
Man, you're really crazy,
you know that?

379
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,778
You got a million windows
up here.

380
00:42:56,813 --> 00:42:58,118
All these windows.
You're gonna...

381
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,839
You're gonna make 'em strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

382
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,514
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

383
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:05,234
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

384
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:08,918
Did you hear me, what I told you?
They turned over our car.

385
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,801
Oh hell,
any good five men can do that.

386
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:12,016
That's my point...

387
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:14,109
Only there's not going to be
five, or even ten.

388
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:17,039
There's gonna be twenty, thirty,
maybe a hundred of those things.

389
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:18,218
And as soon as they know we're here,

390
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:19,676
this place
is gonna be crawling with them.

391
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,983
Well, if there're that many, they'll
probably get us wherever we are.

392
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:25,829
Look, the cellar.

393
00:43:26,164 --> 00:43:27,797
The cellar.
There's only one door, right?

394
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,685
Just one door.
That's all we have to protect.

395
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:33,909
Tom and I fixed it so it locks
and boards from the inside.

396
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,373
But up here, all these windows,

397
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:37,969
Why, we'd never know where
they were gonna hit us next.

398
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:39,392
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

399
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:42,323
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

400
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:46,006
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

401
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:48,811
We can get out of here
if we have to.

402
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:52,159
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

403
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:54,301
But down there, with no windows,

404
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:56,638
if a rescue party did come,
we wouldn't even know it.

405
00:43:56,722 --> 00:43:59,066
But the cellar
is the strongest place.

406
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,657
The cellar is a death trap.

407
00:44:00,824 --> 00:44:04,425
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

408
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:06,852
You know how many's out there?

409
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,568
I don't know,
I figure maybe six or seven.

410
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:12,294
Look. You two can do
whatever you like.

411
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:16,103
I'm going back down to the cellar
and you better decide,

412
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,322
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

413
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,540
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

414
00:44:20,582 --> 00:44:21,963
Now wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.

415
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:25,061
No, I'm not gonna wait! I've made
my decision, now you make yours.

416
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,656
Now wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

417
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:29,959
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

418
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:34,019
And if we do decide to stay down there,
We'll need some things from up here.

419
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:36,573
So let's at least
consider this a while.

420
00:44:40,717 --> 00:44:41,888
If you box yourself in the cellar

421
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,316
and those things get in
the house, you've had it.

422
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:46,619
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

423
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,814
Yeah, looks like about
eight or ten of them now.

424
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:56,833
That's more than there were.
There're a lot out back, too.

425
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,418
Harry?
Harry, what's happening?

426
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:43,715
It's all right!

427
00:45:58,492 --> 00:45:59,664
Now take it.

428
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,854
We've gotta fix these boards.

429
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:42,822
You're crazy!

430
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:45,836
Those things are gonna be at every
window and door in this place!

431
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,426
We've got to get down
into the cellar.

432
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:49,603
Go down into your damn cellar
and get out of here!

433
00:46:52,491 --> 00:46:54,800
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

434
00:46:54,835 --> 00:46:57,598
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

435
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,236
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

436
00:47:00,278 --> 00:47:02,705
and the radio and the food is
part of what I'm fighting for.

437
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:05,008
Now if you're going down
in the cellar, get.

438
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,305
The man's insane.
He's insane.

439
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:10,909
We've... we've got to have food
down there. We've got a right.

440
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:12,751
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

441
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:14,761
You going down there with him?

442
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:18,779
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

443
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:21,416
Listen, I got a kid down there.

444
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,719
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

445
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:26,146
She can't possibly take
all the racket from those things

446
00:47:26,181 --> 00:47:27,737
smashing through the windows.

447
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:29,084
Well, you're her father.

448
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,175
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

449
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,602
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

450
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:38,119
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

451
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:41,174
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

452
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,062
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

453
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:47,830
You bastards!

454
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:52,686
You know, I won't open
this door again. I mean it.

455
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,993
- Mr. Cooper, with your help...
- With my help.

456
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:59,258
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up.

457
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:02,229
Wait a minute.

458
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,457
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

459
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:15,583
You're gonna let them
get her too, huh?

460
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:17,592
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

461
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:30,820
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

462
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:34,002
There's lots of places
we can run to up here.

463
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:37,580
Mr. Cooper?
We'd all be a lot better off

464
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,323
if all three of us were working together.

465
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,760
Hey.
Hey, kid.

466
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,680
He's wrong, you know.

467
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,526
I'm not boxing myself in
down there.

468
00:49:04,727 --> 00:49:06,862
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

469
00:49:09,164 --> 00:49:10,419
What about Tom and Judy?

470
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,220
They wanna stay up there.
Let 'em.

471
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:21,721
There are... two other people upstairs.
A man and a girl.

472
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:23,396
We heard the screaming.

473
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:26,284
Yeah, but I didn't know
who they were,

474
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:28,545
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

475
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:30,094
Of course not, Harry.

476
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:47,675
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

477
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:49,098
She feels warm.
Maybe it's shock.

478
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:51,401
Where'd you get the bandage?

479
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:55,418
Some laundry in the basket.
I tore a sheet.

480
00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:05,047
Let them stay upstairs.

481
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:07,098
Let them.

482
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,074
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

483
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:14,298
We'll see who's right.

484
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:17,897
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

485
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:20,535
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

486
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:22,628
To be right.
Everybody else to be wrong.

487
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:24,427
What do you mean by that?

488
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:31,083
Does anyone up there
know why we're being attacked?

489
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:34,600
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

490
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,529
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

491
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,041
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?

492
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,888
Radio, upstairs.
I heard the news bulletin.

493
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:45,902
There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in down here?

494
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:48,204
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

495
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,381
Nothing! Nothing.
They don't know anything yet.

496
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:52,516
The... there's mass murder
everywhere, and

497
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,781
people are supposed to
look for a safe place to hide.

498
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,622
Take the boards
off that door.

499
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:00,511
We are staying down here, Helen.

500
00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:03,357
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

501
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:05,409
If the authorities know
what's happening,

502
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:08,506
Well, they'll send people for us,
or they'll tell us what to do.

503
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:10,432
How are we going to know
what's going on,

504
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:12,232
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

505
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:24,832
We may not enjoy living together...

506
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:28,891
But dying together isn't
going to solve anything.

507
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:31,780
Those people
aren't our enemies.

508
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,287
Mr. Cooper!

509
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:38,394
Mr. Cooper? They found
a television set upstairs.

510
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:41,952
Let's go up.

511
00:51:42,203 --> 00:51:43,292
Tom?

512
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,547
Yes?

513
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:48,189
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

514
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,408
Harry and I
could come upstairs.

515
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:52,835
Ok. Yeah. Right away.

516
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:56,938
Will you do it?

517
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:58,912
Do I have to?

518
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:02,715
Look, honey. Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

519
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:06,943
- Do this. For me.
- Ok.

520
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:09,705
Ok, open up.

521
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,565
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

522
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,379
She's all I have.

523
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,895
Why don't you go upstairs now?

524
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:11,449
Her brother was killed.

525
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:14,128
Hey... give me
a hand with this thing.

526
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:17,434
I gotta go help Ben
with the television.

527
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:02,308
Don't be afraid of me.

528
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:06,243
I'm Helen Cooper. Harry's wife.

529
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,628
This place is ridiculous.
Look at this.

530
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,763
There's a million weak spots up here.

531
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:23,238
Give me one of those.

532
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:29,434
Her brother was killed.

533
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:39,438
And they talk about these windows.

534
00:54:40,149 --> 00:54:41,656
I can't see a damned thing.

535
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:44,419
There could be 15 million of
those things out there.

536
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:46,303
That's how much good
these windows are.

537
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:53,586
Why don't you do something
to help somebody?

538
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:01,163
Here, I have it. Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

539
00:55:01,582 --> 00:55:03,089
There's a socket over here.

540
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:11,293
Now, you'd better watch this and try
to understand what's going on.

541
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,809
I don't want anyone's life
on my hands.

542
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:16,365
Is there anything
I can do to help?

543
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,074
I don't want to hear any more
from you, mister.

544
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:20,292
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

545
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,553
And that includes
leaving the girl alone.

546
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:24,018
It's on! It's on!

547
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:25,149
There's no sound.

548
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:27,744
Play with the rabbit ears.

549
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:31,260
<i>Reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

550
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:33,814
<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

551
00:55:33,856 --> 00:55:36,995
"Mass hysteria. " What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

552
00:55:37,037 --> 00:55:37,874
Shut up.

553
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,507
In all parts of the country.

554
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,065
The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation

555
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:45,374
is being committed by creatures

556
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,837
who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.

557
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:51,276
First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development

558
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:55,539
came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.

559
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,181
Officials and newsmen
at first discounted

560
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:02,027
those eyewitness descriptions
as being beyond belief.

561
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:04,706
However, the reports persisted.

562
00:56:04,874 --> 00:56:07,351
Medical examinations
of some of the victims

563
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:11,236
bore out the fact that they
had been partially devoured.

564
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,422
I think we have
some late word just arriving

565
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:17,808
and we interrupt
to bring this to you.

566
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:21,701
This is the latest disclosure in a report

567
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:24,422
from National civil defense
headquarters in Washington.

568
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,608
It has been established
that persons who have recently died

569
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,752
have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.

570
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:38,278
A widespread investigation of reports
from funeral homes, morgues & hospitals

571
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,380
has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

572
00:56:42,422 --> 00:56:44,556
and seeking human victims.

573
00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:48,450
It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,

574
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:50,082
but it does seem to be a fact.

575
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:52,929
When this emergency first began,

576
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:56,738
radio and television was
advising people to stay inside,

577
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,131
behind locked doors, for safety.

578
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,266
Well, that situation
has now changed.

579
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:04,440
We're able to report a definite
course of action for you.

580
00:57:04,565 --> 00:57:07,077
Civil defense machinery has been
organized to provide

581
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:10,307
rescue stations with food, shelter,

582
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:13,817
medical treatment and protection
by armed National Guardsmen.

583
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:17,542
Stay tuned to the broadcasting
stations in your local area

584
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:19,391
for this list of rescue stations.

585
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:22,523
This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.

586
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:25,998
Look for the name of the rescue
station nearest you,

587
00:57:26,082 --> 00:57:29,515
and make your way to that
location as soon as possible.

588
00:57:29,724 --> 00:57:32,570
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

589
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:35,416
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

590
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:36,386
But it's locked.

591
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:38,933
...called this afternoon
by the president.

592
00:57:38,975 --> 00:57:42,281
Since convening, this conference
of the presidential cabinet,

593
00:57:42,323 --> 00:57:45,254
The FBI, the joint chiefs of staff,
the CIA

594
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:48,226
has not produced
any public information.

595
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:51,365
Why are space experts
being consulted

596
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,165
about an earthbound emergency?

597
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,184
So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question

598
00:57:57,225 --> 00:58:00,323
centers on the recent explorer
satellite shot to Venus.

599
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:04,132
That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth,

600
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:05,514
but never got here.

601
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,318
That's the space vehicle
which orbited Venus

602
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,683
and then was purposely
destroyed by NASA,

603
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:13,006
when scientists discovered
it was carrying

604
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:15,309
a mysterious,
high-level radiation with it.

605
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:18,197
Could that radiation
be somehow responsible

606
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,918
for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?

607
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:24,016
Newsman Don Quinn in Washington

608
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:25,105
has posed those questions.

609
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:27,449
It's obvious. Our best move is
to try to get out of here.

610
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:29,164
How're you gonna get
over to that pump?

611
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:30,462
Look!

612
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,314
You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe,

613
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:35,150
is that right?

614
00:58:35,276 --> 00:58:37,794
Yes, yes, that was the subject
of the meeting.

615
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:40,090
Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon...

616
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:42,979
There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.

617
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,490
In other words, you feel that the
radiation on the Venus probe is enough

618
00:58:45,616 --> 00:58:46,836
to cause these mutations?

619
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,545
It was a very high
degree of radiation.

620
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:51,517
Well, just a minute. I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.

621
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:54,490
I don't think that has been...
It's the only logical explanation

622
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:55,243
that we have at this time.

623
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:57,169
In other words, it is the military's
viewpoint that this...

624
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:59,931
the radiation is not
the cause of the mutation.

625
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:02,904
I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.

626
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:06,043
I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,

627
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:08,680
until we, until this
is irrefutably proved.

628
00:59:09,015 --> 00:59:11,024
Everything is being done
that can be done.

629
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:13,033
We'll have to hurry
for our next meeting.

630
00:59:14,457 --> 00:59:17,136
Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between...

631
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,400
A definite connection as far as
Dr. Keller and myself...

632
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:23,541
Doctor, please. I thought we decided
that is not proved yet.

633
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:25,383
Was it... was the satellite...

634
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:28,312
- When the satellite was exploded...
- It was an unusual amount of radiation,

635
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:30,991
enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.

636
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:33,377
Could have happened
to have a bearing on it.

637
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:35,428
It does seem to have a bearing on it.

638
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,527
Will there be a reply for the...

639
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:40,535
- There will be a reply?
- Yes.

640
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,540
Later this afternoon?

641
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,438
There will be
a report this afternoon.

642
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:48,907
Perhaps there will be
a report later...

643
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:49,912
Will you close the window?

644
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,549
We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.

645
00:59:58,703 --> 01:00:01,131
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

646
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:04,646
He said the rescue stations have
doctors and medical supplies.

647
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:07,116
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

648
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:13,228
Willard. I saw a sign.
That said Willard.

649
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,495
It's only about 17 miles from here.

650
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,665
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

651
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,423
Judy and I are both from around here.

652
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:21,977
We were on our way
to the lake to go swimming.

653
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:25,117
Judy had a radio, and we heard
the first reports about this.

654
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:27,251
So we knew the old house
was here and we came in,

655
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:29,218
And found the lady upstairs, dead.

656
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,693
Then these other people came.
We went down into the basement

657
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:35,414
and put a bar across the door,
and it is pretty strong.

658
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:37,800
How could we possibly
get away from here?

659
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,316
We've got a sick child, two women,
one woman out of her head,

660
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:44,623
three men, and the place is
surrounded with these things.

661
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:48,809
For NASA.
Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,

662
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:52,576
has been working very hard
to find some solution

663
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,628
to these things that are happening.

664
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:56,602
Do you have any answers at this time?

665
01:00:56,637 --> 01:01:00,949
Yes, we have some answers.
But first let me stress the importance

666
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,589
of seeking medical attention for anyone
who's been injured in any way.

667
01:01:04,624 --> 01:01:08,190
We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.

668
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,492
How bad has your kid been hurt?

669
01:01:15,348 --> 01:01:18,403
Look. You go down there and tell...
Judy?

670
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:21,669
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here
and you stay with the kid, all right?

671
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,933
Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.

672
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:29,454
In the cold room at the university,
we had a cadaver.

673
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,682
A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.

674
01:01:34,143 --> 01:01:35,692
Sometime early this morning,

675
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:39,131
it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.

676
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:42,640
It was dead, but it opened its eyes
and tried to move.

677
01:01:45,404 --> 01:01:46,826
They want you upstairs.

678
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,966
- Did she ask for me?
- She hasn't said anything.

679
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,478
I don't understand.

680
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,166
Baby? It's mommy.

681
01:01:58,254 --> 01:01:59,385
I hurt.

682
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:03,445
I'll come back down as soon as
I find out what they want.

683
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,538
Thank you, Judy.

684
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,436
The bodies should be disposed of
at once, preferably by cremation.

685
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:14,496
Well, how long after death, then,
does the body become reactivated?

686
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,596
- It's only a matter of minutes.
- Minutes?

687
01:02:16,631 --> 01:02:18,564
That doesn't give people time
to make arrangements...

688
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,198
No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.

689
01:02:22,491 --> 01:02:26,677
The bodies must be carried
to the street and burned.

690
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:30,696
They must be burned immediately.
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.

691
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,965
The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts

692
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,807
that a funeral service will give.

693
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:40,114
They're just dead flesh.
And dangerous.

694
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:43,254
Judy, I need you to find
some bedspreads or sheets

695
01:02:43,296 --> 01:02:45,053
to tear up into small strips, ok?

696
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:47,649
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

697
01:02:47,817 --> 01:02:49,121
We need some bottles or jars

698
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:52,086
to make Molotov cocktails to hold
them off while we try to escape.

699
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:54,053
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

700
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:56,691
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

701
01:02:56,775 --> 01:02:58,575
There's a big key ring down there.

702
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,961
There may be a key
to the gas pump on it.

703
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,634
I'll check.

704
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:05,146
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

705
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:08,077
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

706
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,835
then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

707
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,634
But that'll leave
a door open someplace.

708
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:14,188
Yeah, that's right.
It better be this door.

709
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:16,113
It's closer to the truck.

710
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,923
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

711
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:21,765
While we're gone, the rest of you
can hole up in there.

712
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:23,649
I found some fruit jars
in the cellar.

713
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:26,746
And there's a key on here that's
labeled for the gas pump out back.

714
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:31,434
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

715
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,029
I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

716
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:39,681
You're it, then.
You and I'll go.

717
01:03:45,164 --> 01:03:47,844
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

718
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,610
You can go upstairs and toss
the cocktails from a window.

719
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:54,290
Tom, you and I will have to
unboard this door.

720
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:56,006
After you toss the cocktails,

721
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,973
you hustle back down here
and lock this door.

722
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:00,820
It's no good to board it up because
we'll have to get back in quickly.

723
01:04:02,117 --> 01:04:05,215
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

724
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,853
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

725
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:10,245
Now, let's move it.

726
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,880
No place to flee for safety,
except for the rescue stations

727
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:14,801
which have been set up.

728
01:04:15,136 --> 01:04:18,736
Indications are that
before this emergency is over,

729
01:04:18,778 --> 01:04:22,294
we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.

730
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:33,031
You always have a smile for me.

731
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:36,680
How can you smile like that
all the time?

732
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,873
How many do you have done?

733
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,300
Come on, honey, we gotta move.

734
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:47,424
Tom, are you sure about the phone?

735
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:51,648
The phone is dead out.
All you get is a recorded message.

736
01:04:52,157 --> 01:04:55,913
If I could only call the folks. They're
going to be so worried about us.

737
01:04:56,873 --> 01:04:58,417
Everything'll be all right.

738
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:02,048
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

739
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:03,927
I know.

740
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:13,568
Tom... Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

741
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:15,738
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

742
01:05:16,615 --> 01:05:18,744
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

743
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:21,039
We've got to get
to a rescue station.

744
01:05:21,415 --> 01:05:22,625
I don't know.

745
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,171
Come on. You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

746
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,306
But why do you have to go out there?

747
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:31,056
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

748
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,185
Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

749
01:05:34,945 --> 01:05:36,329
But we're safe in here.

750
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:38,910
For how long, honey?
We're safe now.

751
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,581
But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

752
01:05:41,623 --> 01:05:43,418
I know.
I know all that.

753
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:51,890
Listen. Remember when
we had the big flood?

754
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:56,607
Remember how difficult it was for us to
convince you that it was right to leave?

755
01:05:56,983 --> 01:05:59,612
Remember? Remember we had
to go to Willard then?

756
01:05:59,904 --> 01:06:02,033
This isn't a passing thing,
honey.

757
01:06:03,076 --> 01:06:05,789
It... it's not like
just a wind passing through.

758
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:08,669
We've got to do something,
and fast.

759
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,392
I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

760
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:20,397
Hey... smile, honey.

761
01:06:21,399 --> 01:06:23,152
Where's that big smile for me?

762
01:06:27,827 --> 01:06:30,122
You sure are
no use at all, are you?

763
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:35,381
We've got work to do, honey.
And you... you...

764
01:06:51,783 --> 01:06:53,453
We better get her downstairs.

765
01:06:53,703 --> 01:06:55,957
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

766
01:06:57,794 --> 01:07:00,048
She's right. You have
to go downstairs now.

767
01:07:00,173 --> 01:07:02,594
Just for a little while,
until we get back.

768
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:08,020
- Then we can all leave.
- Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

769
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:29,097
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

770
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,851
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

771
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:22,146
Ok, toss 'em!

772
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:04,384
Go ahead! Go on!

773
01:09:20,453 --> 01:09:21,330
I'm going with him!

774
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:25,002
Get back in the cellar!
It's too late. Too late!

775
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:34,769
Well, is she coming?
Come on.

776
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,774
Get in!

777
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:52,232
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

778
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:53,817
Watch it.

779
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,915
Watch the torch!

780
01:11:08,551 --> 01:11:10,096
We've gotta get away from the pump!

781
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:22,741
Hang on!

782
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:26,584
Stop! I'm telling you guys
to get outta the truck!

783
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:46,824
Let's get outta here!

784
01:11:48,744 --> 01:11:49,912
Come on, come on!

785
01:11:49,947 --> 01:11:51,082
My jacket's caught.

786
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:00,820
Let me in!

787
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:02,782
Cooper!

788
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:10,147
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things.

789
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,929
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

790
01:15:47,603 --> 01:15:50,776
There's supposed to be another
broadcast at three o'clock.

791
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:52,194
Ten minutes.

792
01:15:54,866 --> 01:15:56,618
Oh. Only ten more minutes?

793
01:15:57,037 --> 01:15:59,291
We don't have very long to wait.

794
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,419
We can leave.

795
01:16:03,422 --> 01:16:05,008
Or we better leave soon.

796
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:07,304
It's ten minutes to three.

797
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:15,067
You know anything
about this area at all?

798
01:16:15,693 --> 01:16:17,238
I mean,
is Willard the nearest town?

799
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,785
I don't know.

800
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:25,584
We were...

801
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:30,844
Just trying to get
to a motel before dark.

802
01:16:32,012 --> 01:16:33,724
You said those things
turned your car over.

803
01:16:33,932 --> 01:16:36,353
You think we can get it back on
its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

804
01:16:36,395 --> 01:16:38,774
Seems like it was pretty far away.

805
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:41,571
Seems like we ran.

806
01:16:42,046 --> 01:16:44,174
Forget it.
It's at least a mile.

807
01:16:44,549 --> 01:16:46,219
Johnny has the keys.

808
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,764
You're going to carry
that child a mile?

809
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:50,766
Through that army
of things out there?

810
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:51,809
I can carry the kid.

811
01:16:52,769 --> 01:16:54,271
What's wrong with her?
How'd she get hurt?

812
01:16:55,773 --> 01:16:58,819
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

813
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:01,907
What's wrong?

814
01:17:02,491 --> 01:17:05,077
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

815
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,457
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

816
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,044
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

817
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:16,468
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

818
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:18,304
You gonna turn it over
by yourself?

819
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:22,059
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

820
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,067
You have a car?
Where? Where is it?

821
01:17:28,318 --> 01:17:32,114
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. I know. But where is it?

822
01:17:45,382 --> 01:17:46,468
Good lord.

823
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:05,660
At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation

824
01:18:05,785 --> 01:18:07,830
continues to increase steadily.

825
01:18:08,373 --> 01:18:10,418
So long as this situation remains,

826
01:18:10,543 --> 01:18:13,171
government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies

827
01:18:13,213 --> 01:18:16,634
will continue to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.

828
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:20,890
All persons who die during
this crisis, from whatever cause,

829
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:23,601
will come back to life
to seek human victims.

830
01:18:23,686 --> 01:18:27,107
Unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.

831
01:18:27,774 --> 01:18:29,818
Our News cameras
have just returned

832
01:18:30,277 --> 01:18:33,365
from covering such a search and
destroy operation against the ghouls.

833
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,869
This one conducted
by sheriff Conan McClellan

834
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:37,871
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

835
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:39,666
So now let's go
to that film report.

836
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:43,587
All law enforcement agencies
and the military

837
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,384
have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.

838
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,762
The survival command center
at the Pentagon

839
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:53,101
has disclosed
that a ghoul can be killed

840
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:57,231
by a shot in the head
or a heavy blow to the skull.

841
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,610
Officials are quoted as explaining

842
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:03,322
that since the brain of a ghoul has
been activated by the radiation,

843
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,829
the plan is, kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.

844
01:19:08,997 --> 01:19:12,501
- Want anything from the supply wagon?
- No, we're all right.

845
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:16,138
Hey, Cass, put that thing
all the way in the fire.

846
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:18,802
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right, I gotcha.

847
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,805
Chief McClellan,
how's everything going?

848
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:23,893
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

849
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,646
You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.

850
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:29,066
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

851
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:32,237
Well, we killed 19 of them
today, right in this area.

852
01:19:32,445 --> 01:19:35,700
Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.

853
01:19:35,742 --> 01:19:38,496
They must have thought somebody
was in there. There wasn't, though.

854
01:19:38,537 --> 01:19:40,130
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.

855
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:42,710
We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.

856
01:19:42,752 --> 01:19:44,963
Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

857
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:45,839
Yeah, ok.

858
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:48,969
Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,

859
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,303
would I stand a chance with them?

860
01:19:50,345 --> 01:19:52,933
Well, there's no problem. If you
had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.

861
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:54,107
That's a sure way to kill 'em.

862
01:19:54,142 --> 01:19:56,312
If you don't, get yourself
a club or a torch.

863
01:19:56,353 --> 01:19:58,356
Beat 'em or burn 'em.
They go up pretty easy.

864
01:19:58,898 --> 01:20:01,276
Well, chief McClellan,
how long do you think it'll take

865
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:03,029
until you get the situation
under control?

866
01:20:03,154 --> 01:20:06,326
Well, that's pretty hard to say. We
don't know how many of 'em there are.

867
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:08,119
We know when we find 'em,
we can kill 'em.

868
01:20:09,663 --> 01:20:10,874
Are they slow-moving, chief?

869
01:20:11,082 --> 01:20:14,009
Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.

870
01:20:14,044 --> 01:20:18,258
Well, in time, would you say you'd be
able to wrap this up in 24 hours?

871
01:20:18,634 --> 01:20:21,220
Well, we don't really know.

872
01:20:21,262 --> 01:20:24,892
We know we'll be into it most of the
night, probably into the early morning.

873
01:20:24,934 --> 01:20:26,687
We're working our way toward Willard

874
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:28,731
and we'll team up with the
National Guard over there,

875
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:30,734
and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.

876
01:20:30,901 --> 01:20:32,653
Thank you very much,
chief McClellan.

877
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:36,283
This is Bill Cardille,
WIC-TV 11 news.

878
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:38,119
Thank you, Bill, for that report.

879
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:41,088
Official spokesmen
declined to speculate

880
01:20:41,123 --> 01:20:44,127
just how long it may
take to kill off all the flesh-eaters

881
01:20:44,336 --> 01:20:46,089
so long as the heavy ra...

882
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,099
Is the fuse box in the cellar?

883
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:55,977
I don't know. I...

884
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:01,525
Is... isn't the fuse...

885
01:21:02,652 --> 01:21:03,737
The power lines are down.

886
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:09,662
Helen?
I have to get that gun.

887
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:13,167
Haven't you had enough?

888
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:17,088
Two people are dead already,
on account of that guy.

889
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:18,757
Take a look out that window.
Look at...

890
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:18,756
Get over here, man!

891
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:21,426
Come on!

892
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:43,748
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You wanna stay up here now?

893
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,835
Helen, get in the cellar.

894
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,174
Get in the cellar now!
Move!

895
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:35,610
Karen?

896
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,292
Oh, baby.

897
01:24:48,712 --> 01:24:49,754
Baby.

898
01:25:52,089 --> 01:25:55,386
No... no...
No! Johnny!

899
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:02,270
Somebody help me.

900
01:30:35,051 --> 01:30:36,137
Hey, Vince, Bill,

901
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:39,391
you wanna get about four
or five men and a couple dogs?

902
01:30:39,474 --> 01:30:42,354
There's a house over here behind those
trees. We wanna go check it out.

903
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:44,022
You still here, Bill?

904
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:45,608
Yeah, chief,
we're going to stay with it

905
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,075
till we meet up
with the National Guard.

906
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:49,321
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

907
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:51,081
- You're doing all the work, take it.
Thank you.

908
01:30:51,116 --> 01:30:53,827
We should be wrapped up here.
About three or four more hours,

909
01:30:53,953 --> 01:30:55,294
we'll probably get into Willard's end.

910
01:30:55,329 --> 01:30:57,549
I guess you can go over there
and meet the national guard.

911
01:30:57,584 --> 01:30:59,769
Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

912
01:31:00,604 --> 01:31:02,440
Bill, I'm checking the office
to see what's happening.

913
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:05,193
All right, Steve, tell 'em
we're going to stay with it

914
01:31:05,228 --> 01:31:08,155
and everything appears
to be under control.

915
01:31:58,057 --> 01:32:00,269
They need you down there
by the barn.

916
01:32:04,148 --> 01:32:06,276
You guys can follow the wagon down.

917
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:08,822
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

918
01:32:11,743 --> 01:32:15,038
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

919
01:32:54,259 --> 01:32:56,053
He's a dead one.
Get up here!

920
01:32:57,554 --> 01:32:59,599
Nick! Tony! Steve!

921
01:32:59,682 --> 01:33:01,977
You wanna get out in that
field and build me a bonfire?

922
01:33:14,912 --> 01:33:17,665
You. Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

923
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:18,625
Nothing down here.

924
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:20,587
All right. Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

925
01:33:20,837 --> 01:33:22,130
Let's go check out the house.

926
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:23,799
There's something there.
I heard a noise.

927
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,351
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head.
Right between the eyes.

928
01:33:35,273 --> 01:33:38,611
Good shot. Ok, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

929
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,197
That's another one for the fire.

930
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:03,395
All right, send a wagon through...

931
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,557
Keep those dogs back off
of those things.

932
01:35:15,558 --> 01:35:19,564
Come ahead with the motorcycle,
please. Let's go!

933
01:35:23,358 --> 01:35:25,653
Hey Randy,
light these torches over here.

934
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:31,654
