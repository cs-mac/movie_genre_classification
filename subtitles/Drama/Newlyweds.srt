2
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:37,980
I really think that what you two
are doing... I just think it's fantastic.

3
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,786
You both, you know, been
through this before,

4
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,667
so you know the crap that
you have to deal with when you see

5
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,780
the same person every single day.

6
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:45,822
No, it's absolutely the
perfect setup for us,

7
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,318
because, you know, we're both very busy...

8
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,999
Yeah.
I work days, she works nights...

9
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,481
So essentially, We only get to see
each other on the weekends ...

10
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:55,106
And I get to watch my Nick games
without any intteruptions...

11
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,252
Yeah, I get up at noon,

12
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,359
I have my coffee in peace,
I don't talk to anyone...

13
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:00,573
We all know how much I love the mornings.

14
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:01,942
So, the real upside to
this you never actually...

15
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:04,343
have to see each other.

16
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:05,775
That's exactly right.

17
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,288
Therefore never get on
one anothers' nerves.

18
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:07,897
Hmm!

19
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:10,916
I will say, absence really does
make the heart grow fonder.

20
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,174
And makes for much hotter sex, I might add.

21
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:14,713
No, David, the details!
It's true.

22
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,953
You don't what to hear
about last night, Marsha?

23
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:18,829
- Tell us.
- It's pretty nice..

24
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:20,247
How's your forehead?
... like, baby?

25
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,291
Oh. It"s a little tender,
a little bruised.

26
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,492
Your sort of like
"Leagally bound fuck buddies", is that it?

27
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,403
No, no! Listen we...

28
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,681
we just are both on our second marriages,

29
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,503
and we're trying to be like,
a little more realistic

30
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:31,723
this time around, what we need ...

31
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,724
Or what we don't need.

32
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,170
Like I am fully aware

33
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,713
that I have since recieved my last
blowjob and I'm okay with it.

34
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,441
Stop. That's enough already!

35
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:39,242
Please, this is supposed
to have a nice lunch!

36
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:40,999
You know what Laverne says though.

37
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,824
What?
The best laid plans of mice and men,

38
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,749
often go astray.

39
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:46,918
I have no idea what that means.

40
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:47,563
Can you translate, please?

41
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,107
No... I think he might be
saying that eventually you will

42
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,172
want a blowjob and your needs downplayed.

43
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,311
We're the first to admit
that we're hardly like...

44
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,034
a perfect match.

45
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:59,436
But we see one another infrequently
enough that I think, um

46
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,549
we can go the distance here, Huh Bev?

47
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:04,734
He's kidding, he's kidding.

48
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,052
Oh my god.
Of course. We are very much in love!

49
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,554
We're just ... we're being a
little more sensible, somehow.

50
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:11,324
Oh, that ...You know their
whole relationship upsets me.

51
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,909
I mean that my sister and I

52
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,962
we were brought up in a very strict,
Catholic household.

53
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,445
And ... we were taught
to believe that ...

54
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,492
marriage is ... is ... sacred!

55
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,761
And to be respectful of that.

56
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,921
And ...I don't know ...

57
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,489
talking about oral sex over brunch ...

58
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,783
is not being respectful.

59
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,770
I heard that if you do not wake up at least

60
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,063
one morning a week, and look
at your partner and think:

61
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,998
"I have made a terrible mistake".

62
00:02:36,194 --> 00:02:37,158
Then there's actually something wrong.

63
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,209
With your marriage.

64
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,961
Yeah well, Marsha feels
that way every morning.

65
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,346
So what is that is normal for you?

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,773
Okay, Listen ... Look,
this whole conversation is very,

67
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:45,190
very upsetting to me.

68
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,342
No... It is.

69
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,969
Marriage is something that's very special.

70
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,428
Oh Marsha. It is.

71
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,705
It's a sacrament, it is!

72
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,548
You should get married because ...

73
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,674
you you want to share your life together!

74
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,968
You know, not because she gives good head.

75
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,346
I think you missed the point I was making.

76
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,189
Um...she doesn't give good head.
In fact she doesn't give head at all!

77
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,065
Enough!

78
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:02,650
The problem with your argument is that

79
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,116
we didn't actually get married because...

80
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,915
it was so special ...
and it was a sacrament ...

81
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,946
and we were so in love.

82
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,990
That's why I got married!

83
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,428
I mean after 18 years together

84
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,027
and you didn't ever feel some
other motervating factor?

85
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,371
You've been married18 years?
Wow. Sounds awesome!

86
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,932
I know. I'm just saying ...that...
Okay.

87
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,853
When I proposed were in love. Great. But...
Yeah?

88
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,258
Okay ... when I was picturing my life...

89
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:25,648
you know, mapping it out in front of me...

90
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,859
I thought, you know "maybe" ...
just "maybe"

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,803
that I could be a bit of
a music career for me.

92
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:32,539
What musical career!? Ha ha! Come on.

93
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,647
I do not know "what musical
career," that's my whole point.

94
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,651
That's my fault, you didn't
have a music career.

95
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,511
I'm just saying if you
hadn't of got pregnant,

96
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,070
we wouldn't have got married
right away, would we?

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm just not understanding
what your saying.

98
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,133
It's sounding like your
regretting getting married to me.

99
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,426
I'm not regretting anything!
I'm just saying

100
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:48,119
let's not pretend that it was this
beautiful lovey lovey thing...

101
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,794
when we have practicalities to deal with.

102
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:53,215
We didn't get married, then, who knows?

103
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,752
We would have got to know each other,

104
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,487
and started a career maybe ...

105
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,509
Right, and then you never
would have married me.

106
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,042
Yeah, I hear you. No I hear what you say.

107
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,136
Look! You've been married for 18 years!,

108
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,330
You know, You got that terrific kid,

109
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:07,557
he's in a great school ...
I would say like ...

110
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,635
I don't know ... if it...
if it ended today

111
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,131
you could probably call
it a success, right?

112
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,366
Look, I didn't mean to put
a damper on the brunch

113
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:18,676
but quite honestly, you know ...

114
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,236
They're miserable.

115
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,589
I mean, maybe what I should have
done was just... been honest.

116
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,841
No, actually that would
have made things worse...

117
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,758
because then I would have said:

118
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:28,310
"Look, you two hate one another,
just get a divorce already,"

119
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,788
And then... I don't have to go to these
miserable lunches any more.

120
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,798
I Don't know why we don't
do that more often.

121
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,683
You know, so much fun.
Once a week just isn't enough.

122
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,061
Oh! I know! Can you believe he
said that, about thier marriage?

123
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,704
In front of us???

124
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:41,015
I know. Even if you feel that way...

125
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:42,950
you should try to keep
that shit to yourself.

126
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,761
Truely! I don't like your blowjob comment.

127
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:49,244
Just for the record, I would give you
a blow job if you really wanted one.

128
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,767
Really? I wouldn't be happy
about it, but I would do it.

129
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,460
Well that is good to know,
because as you know

130
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,914
I have a birthday coming up ...so.
I never told you that.

131
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:58,016
Yeah ... look what I've done ...

132
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:00,696
Well, you know, you can forget the uh ...
the tie?

133
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:01,785
I got you some really nice socks.

134
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,665
Socks?

135
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:08,571
Yeah.  You'd rather have ...You would rather have a blow job?
You know, I jacked off into those socks.

136
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:09,996
No.  I'd much rather have a blow job.

137
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,963
I think relationships should be easy.

138
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,632
I mean, my first marriage was full of drama,

139
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,426
and um.... it was a nightmare.

140
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,027
So it was such a relief to meet someone so ...

141
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,680
So ... "drama free".

142
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,348
Yeah you know. A lot of these relationships

143
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,846
have so many unnecessary complications

144
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,562
like my first wife, was ...

145
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:30,484
Insane.
A Challenge.  Alright?

146
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,772
So it was very nice to meet someone

147
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,523
with a very even keel personality,

148
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,226
In all, a rational human being, haha!
Thank you.  Um....

149
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,648
I really think those are for like
people that are like...

150
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,950
on each other all the time , you know..
they're knit picking.  and um...

151
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:46,413
we made a promise, day one, that we
were'nt gonna do that, you know?

152
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:50,750
We were'nt gonna...
micro manage, and sweat the small stuff and. ...

153
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,221
Yeah  Yeah.
I don't know, maybe it's unrealistic.

154
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:57,546
But the thing is...
maybe this honeymoon period that were in...

155
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,643
could, you know....
Last forever.

156
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,740
There you go.

157
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,552
Hey!, Dara?

158
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,364
Hey,  what can I do for you?

159
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:15,160
Uhhhh ...Yeah, hold on.

160
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:18,034
Hey babe   It's your call.
It's Dara.

161
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:20,240
Fine.  Let him up.

162
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:23,229
Alright, ah....Come on up, man.

163
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,027
What do you, what do you want me to tell him?

164
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,550
Are you here?  Are you at work?

165
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,663
- No, no. Tell him... tell him um...I'm taking a nap.
- Okay.

166
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,769
Okay, and baby
please don't give him any money.

167
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,948
I won't give him any money, I promise.

168
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,870
Yes, right.
I promise!  I don't have any to spare!

169
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,779
I got married  to Dara....in a moment of ...
confusion.

170
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,751
I don't know,  he sort of seemed....
dark and mysterious.

171
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:52,012
And then I grew up and he didn't,
and... I realized

172
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:53,406
he wasn't dark and mysterious.

173
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,129
Just mostly an alcoholic.

174
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,004
Hey there, Shakespeare!

175
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,910
Hey!  Is Katie in?

176
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:01,992
I just wanted to ask her something.

177
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,743
You know, she is, but she's
actually taking a nap.

178
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:07,148
Ah.  Look, just for the record....

179
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,665
I don't have any money to give you,
as you know.

180
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,130
And Katie ...

181
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,641
I know already told you
she can't give you another cent.  So.....

182
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,587
Why must you assume I'm looking a handout?

183
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,820
A gentleman can't just pop by and say hello?

184
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,099
You know,  the unannounced
visit from the ex-husband

185
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,253
on a Sunday evening ... usually not ah...

186
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,012
the best idea...

187
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,600
as much as I am
always very happy to see you.

188
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,191
So.  What can I do for you?

189
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,372
Oh, nothing.  I was just in the area.

190
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,732
Have an audition for a Broadway play, actually.

191
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,221
Thou Nature Art by Go Death.

192
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,921
to thy law thy services are bloud.

193
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:45,213
Yeah Dara is not a terrible guy.
He's just ummm....

194
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:46,838
An actor.

195
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,457
Alright, look, to be perfectly truthful here...

196
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,770
There was no audition.

197
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,272
I am a little low on funds.

198
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,320
So if you got a couple of bucks...
I'd really appreciate it.

199
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,621
How are you even surviving?

200
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:59,384
I mean, where do you even live, these days?

201
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:01,835
A girl...
she's out of town doing resell theatre

202
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,164
at the moment,
so she aloowed me to crash at her place.

203
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,026
You know what I can do for you?

204
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:14,327
I got a bunch of shit here that was going
to give to St. Vincents for Paul.

205
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,332
Alright?  Maybe you can sell it on E-Bay

206
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,533
get yourself, 50 bucks, 100 bucks.

207
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,197
still works ...so...

208
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:25,284
Okay ... I'll take it.

209
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:28,319
Alright.  Thanks buzz.

210
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,652
Always a pleasure.

211
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,269
I know Buzzy was trying to do the right thing

212
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,571
by giving me the vacuum cleaner to sell....

213
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,799
But I don't own a computer, so...

214
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,412
I'm not gonna have much luck
selling it on websites.

215
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,951
but I'll certainly try and sell it on the streets.

216
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,098
Coast is clear.

217
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,383
Hey babe, look.
For the rexcord..

218
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:50,599
I have no idea what you
ever saw in that guy.

219
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,221
Oh, I was very young.

220
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:55,222
I was, you know,
trying to do my tortured artist face.

221
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,313
How much did you give him?

222
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,526
Why do you assume
I gave him anything?

223
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,046
Because, I know you.

224
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,475
How much?

225
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:09,770
You know the uh ... the old vacuum cleaner?
That I was gonna drop off at St. Vincents, to Paul?

226
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,617
What?

227
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,300
Why?
Look,  he can sell it on E-Bay!

228
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,720
He can get a couple of bucks for that.

229
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,476
Oh my God, you're such a pushover.
He seemed desperate.

230
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:20,411
Why do you have such a soft
spot for my ex-husband?

231
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,183
Look, I feel bad for the guy, alright?

232
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:25,006
Look, he had a shot at glory
with you and he blew it,

233
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:26,710
and now I've go you.

234
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:29,536
so I am somewhat
empathetic for the cause.

235
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:33,720
When I married you, I inherited
your family, right?

236
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,760
So I got to deal with the crazy Irishman,

237
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,366
I got your nutty sister, her looney husband,

238
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,081
and I am just trying to do the right

239
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,817
thing by all of them?

240
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:48,954
Okay?  Besides, I'm sure if the roles were reversed
you would do the same thing for me, would you not?

241
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,800
I don't know about that, actually.

242
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:54,443
You don't  see me inviting
your psycho ex-wife over, for tea.

243
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,963
Do you think  that's true,
what we were talking about at brunch,

244
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:02,162
that we're a successful couple,
because we never see each other?

245
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:03,505
Yes, absolutely

246
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:04,506
I think it's important to maintain

247
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,169
a safe, but a distance, because otherwise

248
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,488
your gonna get completely sick of me.

249
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,282
Wait, but, what if like something happens...?

250
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:12,630
Where we had to see each other alot?

251
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,802
Like what if I got pregnant, or something?

252
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,057
Are you pregnant?
No!  No.

253
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,435
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

254
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:24,303
I sure.
No, because I remember that one night

255
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,309
a month ago, we both had
a little too much to drink.  I...

256
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,684
I'm not pregnant

257
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:29,185
I was just...it was a hypothetical.

258
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:33,317
If we suddenly like, you know,
had to spend a lot of time with each other.

259
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:34,455
Would we fall appart?

260
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,286
No, we would not fall appart,

261
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,887
but I'm just a...a  little... confused ...

262
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:43,063
that you ...We were definitely on the
same page about children.  I mean...

263
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:44,268
Yeah, I.. I.. don't want children.

264
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,302
It was..it was purely hypothetical.

265
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:47,639
All right.

266
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,092
That's all.  Just, you know,

267
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,040
Want to make sure we'd be...
we could roll with it.

268
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,363
Absolutely, yeah. I mean... yes!

269
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,824
We can handle whatever
life throws at us.

270
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,389
Do me a favor.

271
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,527
How do you spell vasectomy, though?

272
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:39,146
Hello? 'Hi, I'm looking to Buzzy O'Rourke.

273
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,781
Ok ... ahh ... is working, who is?

274
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,923
I'm his sister, Linda.

275
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,583
Right.  His sister ... okay um....

276
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,126
Hi.

277
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:50,827
Oh, well his half-sister anyway.

278
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,098
we have the same piece of shit father.

279
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,148
Hey.  Listen uh...Can I come up?
It's pretty cold out here

280
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,841
and I'm not exactly appropriately dressed.

281
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,170
Sure um... I'm actually about
to go to work, but ...

282
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,870
Yeah, uh.   Come up.  Come up.

283
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:11,839
Hi, Oh my god!   Hello, you must be Katie!

284
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,496
Hi.
And you must be Linda!

285
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,224
Oh my god, you are gorgeous!

286
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,968
Thank you, thank you.  Wow.
You're welcome.

287
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,223
Oh, you know.  I just wanted to say I'm so sorry
that I missed the wedding.

288
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,503
Oh.  Don't worry about it.
I really wish I could have been there,

289
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:25,928
but I... I just couldn't get off work.
You know how it is.

290
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:30,446
Ah, Come in, come in.
Oh, Wow!  Look at this place!

291
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:35,068
Oh my god,  It's huge.
You guys must be loaded!

292
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:38,751
Hey.  Do you have something to drink?
Like a beer or something maybe?

293
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,644
Yeah, sure.
Oh Thanks!

294
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,265
Cause you know, I just got off the plane...

295
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,782
and...um... it's so errr... stressful, you know,
traveling and everything.

296
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,334
and all that traffic in New York.

297
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,723
Is Heineken good?
Oh yeah, that's great.

298
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,048
Just as long as it's cold.  um....

299
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:54,784
And you know,
That's actually one of the reasons I had to get out of LA.

300
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:55,485
Thank you.

301
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:58,766
Cause ah...You know, the traffic is just awful.

302
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,862
Yeah, totally.  um...did...did....

303
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,624
You tell Buzzy that you were coming?
Cause he didn't mention it to me.

304
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,221
Really?, I mean, I called him
like a month ago

305
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,822
and told him that I was thinking about coming.

306
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,723
Oh.
Oh.  What time does he get off of work, anyway?

307
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,178
Um....In a couple of hours, around 7.

308
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:15,524
Oh.  Okay great!  Well ah....
I'm just gonna go take a shower, freshen up.

309
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,926
Is there a good place
I can put my stuff down?

310
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,727
Uh....yeah um...The.. the ...

311
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:21,882
There's a spare bedroom,
over in back.

312
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,083
Perfect, I'll go get out of your way.

313
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,532
I know you said you have to get to work

314
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,484
and um... thank you so much
for letting me stay here.  I just...

315
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:32,479
Yeah.
And I want you to know, uh...don't be worried ...

316
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm only gonna stck around
until I find my own place.

317
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,520
Beautiful, totally beautiful.

318
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,587
Um.....You know, he had really talked about having a sister,

319
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:47,605
I mean I,   I  sort of vaguely knew he had one

320
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,450
I think we invited her to the
wedding but she didn't come.

321
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:55,543
so when she just arrived
and then expected to stay

322
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,685
I was a little surprised.

323
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:03,849
Hey! I have a surprise for you.
Guess who I rang our buzzer this morning?

324
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,521
Your sister!

325
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,086
My ss.....oh shit.

326
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:10,918
Don't tell me that she actually showed up.

327
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,082
Yep!  Um... I just left
her in the appartment.

328
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,814
I'm assumig my jewelry is safe?

329
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,066
I don't know that I can
actually garauntee that.

330
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,417
Well, then you better get home.

331
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,498
Alright, look.   I got..I got one more client

332
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:25,147
I gotta finished up with,
and then, I promise, I will race home, I will take care of this.

333
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,759
Did you um....Did you
koew that she was coming?

334
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,030
She called me a couple of months ago and said

335
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,442
she was thinking about leaving LA,

336
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,286
saving up for an air fare.

337
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,768
but I mean, I  never thought that she
would actually show up.

338
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,369
Well she did and, she is
under the impression that she's staying with us.

339
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,626
She made herserlf right at home, in the guest room.
Fuck!

340
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,687
Alright babe, look.   I will take care of this.

341
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,658
We'll put her up in a hotel or ...

342
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,406
No, no.  It's totally fine.
I mean, you know, she's your sister.

343
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:54,933
I'm your wife, so....
We'll do the right thing.

344
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,128
Cool.  Thank you.

345
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:57,985
Alright.  See you tonight.

346
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,163
See you.

347
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:04,349
I know Linda was a pretty
screwed up kid.

348
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,290
You know, our dad died when she was 16 and...

349
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,291
then she ran away from home after that,

350
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,751
moved out to LA, so ...

351
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:16,214
16 year old, runaway in Los Angeles ...

352
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,752
Not a recipe for success.

353
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,988
Guess who?

354
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,681
Ah....You know, I'm just....
I'm in town!

355
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:33,837
And ah....I just wanted to call and say hi.

356
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:38,650
See how you've been.
How you been?

357
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:42,483
I need to see you.   I'm here.
I'm in New York.

358
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,723
I thought maybe we could get together.

359
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:48,126
I'm did hear actually.

360
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,988
Where'd you guys go on your honeymoon?

361
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,389
Was it nice?

362
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:01,982
Come on.   I just....
I just want to see ya.

363
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:04,884
You still there?

364
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,165
Listen don't be an jackass.

365
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,660
Just meet me for a drink, okay?

366
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:14,491
Yeah, okay.   Hey!

367
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,486
Thanks.

368
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:30,413
Are you kidding me?

369
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,202
Oh my god!

370
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:33,986
I don't believe this!

371
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:35,141
Hi.
Your in N.Y.

372
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,731
Yeah.  Here I am.

373
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,084
Wow.  All the luck.
I was just rushing home

374
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,585
from work, to say hello.
But where are you off to?

375
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,906
Yeah.  I'm on my way to meet a
friend for a drink right now.

376
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,319
But I'm really glad that I ran into you.

377
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,377
I'm kind of in shock.

378
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:48,965
Look at you, your all grown up.

379
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,213
When was the last time I saw you?

380
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,108
God.   I must have been a teenager still, huh.

381
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,786
You know when it was?
It was Dad's funeral.

382
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:57,098
Yeah, that's right.
Neither one of us cried.

383
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:00,552
You still speak to your mom at all?, Or ...

384
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,676
No.   No I don't.

385
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:06,842
You know, and I don't have any plans to ah....
reach out to her anytime soon either.

386
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,336
I can not say I blame you, either.

387
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,086
Um.....Is that Katie's coat?

388
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,778
Oh, yeah, oh you know ...1

389
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:17,300
I just ....I came right from LA
and I was really unprepared for the weather,

390
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,405
Which is crazy, by the way, and um...

391
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,519
I hope she doesn't mind.
Do you think it will be alright?

392
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,892
No, no.  I'm sure it's cool.

393
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:24,918
You should know, though, that

394
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,206
I did not....I forgot to mention
maybe that you might be coming.

395
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,431
Because I didn't know that it was set in stone.

396
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,793
Oh! ... Well that explains
why she was so wierd this morning...

397
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,082
I mean, a little weird.

398
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,711
Um, look.   I got to run, actually.

399
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,349
to go meet my friend but um....

400
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,150
I'll see you later, we'll catch up,

401
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,980
maybe we can talk some more, you know.
I will be home all night so.

402
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:47,615
Excellent!  Okay.
So see you then, alright!

403
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,089
Yeah.
Welcome to N.Y. and see you tonight, right?

404
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,888
Yeah absolutely.  Yeah.  I'll see you later.
Alright.

405
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:56,588
I don't know what Buzzy
would say if you asked him this, but

406
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:59,386
I felt really close to him growing up, you know.

407
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:02,978
He... He um....was in the house all the time,

408
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:07,382
and when I was a kid...
and uh...I'm really glad that I can come and...

409
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,001
see him for a little bit,  I think and...

410
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,036
I don't know.....reconnect with him.

411
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:15,649
Linda ... What can I say about Linda?

412
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,746
You know what.
I...I can't say I really know her that well.

413
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,544
I was already off in college

414
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:24,176
when she was a little kid and.....

415
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:28,434
You know I don't...
I don't really have any memories of her.

416
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,845
I miss him.  I really do.

417
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,852
How does one book like more studio time here..
cause my band um.....

418
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,318
How many in your band?

419
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,487
Um....There's me and three other guys.

420
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,360
You know, my wife owns the studio
we live upstairs so. ...

421
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,624
Oh cool.
She's out at, you know she goes to the country on the weekends.

422
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,380
It's this time that you know, I can sort of sneak you in.

423
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,087
How old are you?

424
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,779
Well ... How old are you you?
23.

425
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,257
Really?
Yeah.

426
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,864
Well that's good.
I was born in '87

427
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:02,730
87 ?
Mmmm.  hmmm.

428
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,746
I see.
And where were you in '87?

429
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:08,813
Well that's ah......
it's a long history, actually.

430
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:12,644
Yeah.   I think I have a good daddy complex.

431
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:14,352
Oh my god, you're giving me a heart attack.

432
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,277
But I can't believe you did that in one stint.
I know   And he did't even get this part here...

433
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:20,616
What?
See you later.

434
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,606
- What?
- What are you doing?

435
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,499
What do you mean?   Nothing.

436
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,137
Why don't you just ask her out?
You know.

437
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,774
I mean, I'm sitting right here,
but you know....

438
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,353
why don't her just ask her out?
I mean you know.

439
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,754
What do you mean ask her out?
I'm not...I'm going over....

440
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:39,707
No.  I can see you!
Through the glass, I can hear....P.T.

441
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,432
P.T.  Did you see him?

442
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,797
Did he not try to fuck or what?

443
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,688
Don't....Get drawn into this!

444
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:47,063
Marsha, we've just gone over the lines

445
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,672
and you're making a big deal about this.

446
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,141
I do not understand this.
Don't lie to me.

447
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:51,673
I'm not lying to you!

448
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,674
That's all we were talking about it!

449
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:55,512
Okay.  Now you're the writer?
Your the writer?  And the musician?

450
00:19:56,513 --> 00:19:57,650
and the owner of the studio ?

451
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,150
Marsha.
You know what?  No.  That would be my job, okay?

452
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,072
You are here because of me.

453
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:03,826
You know nothing!
you know nothing!

454
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,165
You have this job because of me.

455
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,209
Don't you?
Alright?

456
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,409
Because I shouldn't really
sit here and have to watch you

457
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,783
try to fuck some girl

458
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,077
while I'm standing right here in the room!

459
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:18,057
if you're gonna do it,  do it in private!

460
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,688
You're just turning into a disgusting old man.

461
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:28,560
I am a musician, I....I had
ideas, I had dreams

462
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,429
that I could ah... do something creatively, but ...

463
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,330
I don't know ...they got squashed.

464
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,626
Thanks for keeping me waiting
here for 2 hours, by the way.

465
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,692
I couldn't get a cab and I
had to come all the way from Queens.

466
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,333
Ok! But I mean ... 2 hours!   Really?

467
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,588
So what are you doing in New York?

468
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,479
I came for you.

469
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,227
You came for me?

470
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,638
I think your about 10 months
too late for that.

471
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:17,904
Yeah,  so I see.
Why didn't tell me you were getting married?

472
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:20,376
Well,  I told you I met someone
and it was getting serrious.

473
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,286
I told you that.

474
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:24,696
Yeah, but that's a lot different than saying "I do".

475
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:27,904
When you left L.A. I didn't think
the next time I saw you,  you'd be married.

476
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,338
You know, I should get out of here.

477
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,267
What is this?  Do you still hate me?
Is that what this is about?

478
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:35,417
No, I don't hate you,

479
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,637
But I don't want to have
these conversations, Linda.

480
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,384
Well,  he took the job after
I said I wouldn't marry him.

481
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:45,058
I guess um.... I didn't think I was ready.

482
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,662
But um ... I think maybe now that was a mistake.

483
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:52,066
You broke my heart once already.

484
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,835
Why don't you just.... get on with your life?

485
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:57,046
Because I'm still in love with you.

486
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,179
No, no.
I do not want to hear that.

487
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,669
Why not?  It's true.

488
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,131
Because I'm fuckin' married now, okay?

489
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:02,585
That's not my fault, alright?

490
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:03,778
Just because you couldn't marry me,

491
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,813
doesn't mean you have to run
out and marry somebody else.

492
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:08,913
I didn't know you were a guy on a timeline.
No! No! Is not it, that's not what happened!

493
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:11,313
Okay.  That's not what happened.

494
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,996
Let me just want to ask something.

495
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:21,330
What are you doing here?

496
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:23,618
I don't know.

497
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,696
Well, I do.

498
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:42,830
You know, your still fuckin' crazy.
You know that?

499
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,946
So what do you say?

500
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:53,969
I can't.

501
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:58,061
Really?

502
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,694
Yeah.

503
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:09,140
Yeah, really.

504
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:25,970
He is about to go home

505
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,651
and get into bed with his new wife.

506
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,500
You know I just....
I wanted him to see that maybe...

507
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:34,046
I could go get into bed with
somebody too, if I wanted.

508
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,636
That's what guys respond to.

509
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:42,066
Get a guy jealous and they'll do pretty
much anything you want him to, right?

510
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,901
Nice !
Real nice.

511
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:48,927
Are you kidding me?

512
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,387
Hey baby!

513
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:06,688
Hello babe!

514
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:07,689
Hey!

515
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,632
Good night?

516
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,818
Really good night!

517
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,762
We did 94 covers.

518
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,594
Wow.   Wow!

519
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:18,553
Get in here and get a
glass of red, yeah?

520
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,194
How was your night, huh?

521
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,357
Rende' with the sis'?

522
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:24,615
Yeah, not quite.   Honestly,
I don't even know what to do about her.

523
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:25,997
Alright?  I mean grated, she's my sister

524
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,830
but I don't know her from Adam ...

525
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,136
I mean, you've met her,
she's half fuckin' deep end.

526
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,538
I'm really glad to hear you say that

527
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,170
because I think she's
a little bit in trouble.

528
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,888
She's a, like trouble, a mean a little bit of trouble.

529
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:38,113
Just a tiny bit.

530
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,226
Yeah,  I know.

531
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,627
Is she here?

532
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:42,128
No, no, she actually... she went out.....

533
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,084
Does she happen to have friends here or something?

534
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,071
She doesn't.....
I have no idea, but

535
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,866
she showed up in New York
in the middle of the winter

536
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:49,867
without a coat ...

537
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,272
I let her grab something from your closet ...
I hope that's....

538
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:54,446
Oh.
That's alright.

539
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:57,360
Yeah.   Do you....
Do you know which one she took?

540
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,735
No I.... don't know.
Long.   Looked warm.

541
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:01,972
Is that bad?
No !

542
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:04,069
There you go
Welcome to New York.

543
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,751
Why do you come from Los Angeles
to New York in the middle of winter

544
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:09,764
without a coat?

545
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,964
I don't understand that.

546
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:13,189
I think a week is good.  Huh?

547
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,230
Totally,  I mean that's...
super generous so.....

548
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:18,693
Thank you.

549
00:25:18,794 --> 00:25:20,507
No, no! Of course.

550
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:21,658
You're the boss.

551
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,039
I'll drink to that.

552
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,814
And now I'm gonna take a bath.

553
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,821
A bath?
Yeah, and I'm gonna take this with me.

554
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,035
Do you um....Want ah company ...?

555
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,104
No, I'm good.

556
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,181
Oh look.  It's right here!

557
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,406
I can't....

558
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,982
Fuck !

559
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,083
What the fuck are you....!

560
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,264
Bucky.  Fuckin' put the bat down !

561
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:32,113
Stop it!
He's my friend !

562
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:35,118
Stop it !  What are you doin to me?  Who's the fuckin' guy !
 Shut the fuck up!

563
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,819
Shut up!
Get the fuck out of here !

564
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:37,620
Noel !  Wait a second !

565
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:41,621
Get the fuck out !   Get the fuck out of here!
What the fuck !  Are you trying to be my father right now?

566
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:43,245
What the fuck !  Jesus Christ !

567
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:47,389
Get out of my house.  Get the fuck out of here !
Fuck you, dude !

568
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,381
Take this fuckin' scales hat.

569
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:52,015
What the hell is your problem!

570
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:53,916
Fuck you, man !

571
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,607
Come back here.  Wait  wait  wait.

572
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,793
I don't know how Katie is gonna
react to this news.

573
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:16,052
Because she... obviously was upset
that Linda took the coat

574
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:19,227
and I even lied to Katie
and told her that I gave her the coat.

575
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:21,669
Steals a coat, brings the dude home,

576
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,187
All within the first 12 hours of being here?

577
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:27,505
I mean.  This is not....
This does not boad well for her visit.

578
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:30,477
You should just be thankful
that you didn't hear hercome in last night.

579
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:33,123
Why? What happened?

580
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,906
I wake up at 5 o clock in the morning

581
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:37,005
to find her and some random dude

582
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:39,465
totally going at it on our kitchen counter.

583
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,166
What?
Yeah, I know, it's fuckin' nuts.

584
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,091
So that's what that scream was.
Very...Very funny.

585
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,373
Yeah, alright.  And just for good measure

586
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,534
I gave the kitchen counter a thourough wipe down
Thank you.

587
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:52,404
But that is not the kind of thing
you really want to see your lilttle sister doing.

588
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,406
What did you do?

589
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,007
I kicked them out.
I mean he at least was scared shitless.

590
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,986
and ran out of there, but

591
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:59,698
she was so fuckin'
drunk and screwed up.

592
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:00,747
I don't know how you didn't wake up.

593
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:02,575
She was screaming and yellin' in the hallway.

594
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:06,388
And totally went off on me.
Wow.  Well,  I think your being really harsh.

595
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,776
Is why.  Because I this is what
the kids are doing these days.

596
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:12,159
I think they go to the club,
and they meet random guys,

597
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,360
and they bring them home and ...

598
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,196
You know ...fuck em on the kitchen counter.

599
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:17,500
So that's what the kids are doin'.

600
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:18,501
Totally !   I read it in a magazine.

601
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,295
You are not being at all helpful here, alright?

602
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:23,649
This is my sister.
I am....

603
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,569
I did not need that imagery in my mental files.

604
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:29,722
No, I'm not mad, I mean...

605
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:32,518
I...Why shouldn't she make herself at home?

606
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,178
She's been here for ... 12 hours and...

607
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,452
Um...I Never eat breakfast on that counter, so ...

608
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,431
that's why.

609
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:41,900
I all seriousness

610
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:43,956
maybe  it makes me a prude,

611
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:46,034
but I think bringing a guy home,

612
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:49,618
on the first night your in a stranger's house is....

613
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:53,896
slightly ... ah promiscuous?
Dare I say ...

614
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,336
I still don't know how you slept through

615
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,866
the insanity last night.

616
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,342
It was a ruckus ruckus affair.
A bomb could of....

617
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:46,378
I almost took a
head with a baseball bat.

618
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,688
But I love that you went out
there to like... protecting me!

619
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,309
I didn't know what it was!
I heard some noise.

620
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,984
I thought someone
broke into the apartment.

621
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,939
I mean, thank god there was a light on, you know.

622
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,678
Hold up.

623
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,918
Speaking of....
Ah! There she is.

624
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,886
Hello.

625
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,384
Buzzy? ... Hey, so um ...

626
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:11,638
Are you like....... reallly mad about last night ?

627
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,006
Yeah, yeah.

628
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:14,830
I'm more than a little mad.

629
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:16,812
Look.  I'm sorry.  Alright.
I got so drunk.

630
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,869
and we were closer to your
apartment than his place

631
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,507
so I figured it would be more
easy, or something ...

632
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,603
So look.  Can I uh....

633
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:25,982
Can I come back there or ...?

634
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:27,036
Hang on.

635
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:31,948
She wants to know is it cool
if she stays with us.

636
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:33,372
Is she welcome to come back?
Yeah.

637
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:34,874
You sure?
- Uh hm.

638
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:39,326
Hey! Good news,  Yes.

639
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:42,501
You are welcome to come back.

640
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:44,466
I am going to work in a little while

641
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,467
but when I get home....

642
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,645
You and I need to
have a looong talk about....

643
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,637
guidelines, if you're gonna stay with us

644
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:52,638
for a little while.

645
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,312
Okay.

646
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,313
Sure.  What ever you want.

647
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:08,223
When I get mad, I just...
I see red.

648
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:12,253
You know.  I don't think I just.... react.

649
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:16,119
I get that from my father,
he was very impulsive.

650
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,493
and, you know, sometimes
really great, exciting things happen

651
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:24,859
from being like that.
Other times, shitty things.

652
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:27,904
Good morning.

653
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:33,246
No.  No, I didn't.

654
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:36,903
It was supposed to be with you.

655
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,741
Why?

656
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:42,693
We can still try again, can't we?

657
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:47,810
I know! But ah....
I made a mistake!

658
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:49,957
I was wrong.

659
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,349
I didn't think you would move to New York

660
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,468
And get married in 10 months.

661
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,669
I thought maybe we'd
have another chance.

662
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,637
I was wrong.

663
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:59,317
Is that what you want to hear?

664
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,545
I made a mistake and I was wrong.

665
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:07,636
Okay.
Fine.

666
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:10,705
If you are 100 percent sure

667
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,590
that you are ready to walk away

668
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:15,012
and say goodbye to me forever...

669
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,428
then I'll leave tomorrow

670
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:17,321
and I'll go back to L.A.

671
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:18,232
and I'll leave you alone.

672
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,635
but if you're not,
then you call me up, okay?

673
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:39,390
Hey! Buzzy is that you?

674
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,343
Nope, nope, it's me.

675
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,232
Hey!

676
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:48,777
Yeah, yeah, I know.  Walk of shame, right?

677
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:49,909
It happens to the best of us.

678
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,678
Did you um..., you have fun anyway?

679
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,324
You know.  It was not the best night.

680
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:57,462
Oh, Buzzy said he lent you one of my coats.

681
00:32:57,763 --> 00:32:58,839
Oh ...fuck ...!

682
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,249
Fuck me.
I must have left it someplace.

683
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,150
You left it someplace?

684
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:07,751
Do you remember where?
Maybe we could call them, something?

685
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,606
No, I don't.  I don't know where it is.
Um...

686
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:13,506
But maybe ...I could replace it for you?

687
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:14,878
Was it really expensive?

688
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:16,458
It was ... yeah.

689
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,459
Um...Hey.  It's okay.  It's really fine.

690
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,058
We're just so happy that you're here.

691
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,854
Ah, but there are a couple
of things you could do for me

692
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:23,855
that would be reallly helpful.

693
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:25,447
and the first is not

694
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:28,261
use so many towels when you take a  shower

695
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:30,702
because I really hate laundry.

696
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:32,936
and the other thing is ...

697
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:35,828
if you could not bring strange guys home?

698
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,768
That would be awesome.

699
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:39,171
Buzzy told you about that?

700
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:42,581
Yeah ... yeah, yeah, of course he did.

701
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:44,663
Oh!  Okay.

702
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,119
Um....Well, first of all....

703
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,789
uh.....I'm sorry about the towels.

704
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,741
I um... thought that's what they were there for.

705
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:54,422
ah.....and second of all ...

706
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,508
You never had a crazy night?

707
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,569
Yeah, yeah ... of course we did.

708
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,424
I just.... do not want strange men in my

709
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:07,825
apartment late at night, if that's cool.

710
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,288
Understood.

711
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:14,488
Alright um....I have got to go take a shower.

712
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,450
and ... I will let myself air dry.

713
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:20,754
Oh, hey.   You know.
Do you have any water in here?

714
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:26,724
Perfect.

715
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,291
You saw that, right?

716
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,792
I mean that was like hostile ...!

717
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:40,061
She opened the door in my face!

718
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,862
I was just trying to be nice.
Make a simple request.

719
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:45,665
And she.... really didn't like that.

720
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,335
Okay ...
Well...

721
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,769
It's officially on ... I officially don't like her.

722
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,625
I know I was being bitchy but

723
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:54,314
I had this monster hangover
and,

724
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:55,878
I come home

725
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,474
and the first thing she
comes at me with is towels?

726
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:01,303
I mean, who gives a shit about towels?

727
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:03,885
I had my heart ripped out last night!

728
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:05,898
Just for the record....

729
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:07,776
I did have crazy nights
before I got married.

730
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:19,083
Hey,  It's me.   I need to talk to you.

731
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,294
Hi.
Hi.

732
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:29,238
Hey, honey um...
Listen.  Is Buzzy at home?  By any chance?

733
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,308
No,  He's training Max today, I thought.

734
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,871
Okay, I just thought I'd check.

735
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:34,992
No,  I don't believe a word that Max says these days.

736
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:35,639
Honey, listen.

737
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,304
Um...Has Buzzy mentioned
anything to you about Max

738
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,305
being unfaithful?

739
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,942
No!  Why?  What's going on?

740
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:43,565
Do you think he would tell you if he knew?

741
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,659
Yeah, of course!
He wouldn't keep anything like that secret....

742
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,860
from me.

743
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,368
I Don't know, that's naive Katie.

744
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,369
I mean guys, you know guys.

745
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,615
They don't share that shit.

746
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,443
Marsha! You are my sister!

747
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:53,620
I'm his wife!

748
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:54,465
His allegence to us.

749
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,529
Okay.  You want something to drink?

750
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,953
Yeah.  Water, please.

751
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,927
When I graduated college

752
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:04,293
I ah... married Max, we met at school

753
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,872
and had our son shortly after.

754
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,873
He is not the colledge.

755
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:12,780
Um.....So we're , empty nestors.

756
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,641
For me.... I was so involved in John's life

757
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:19,656
really I mean, you're a mom you're
very involved in the kids life

758
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:20,757
and Max was too.

759
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,317
So now I feel like all that sort of passion

760
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:26,784
for my child has to be focused somewhere else.

761
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,953
I am a little worried about you and Buzzy.

762
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,716
Oh, Marsha don't start, not today.  Please!

763
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:32,534
Please.
How well do you really know him?

764
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,408
I mean this whole rushed wedding
happened way too quickly for my liking.

765
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:37,460
I know him just fine, thank you.

766
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,783
Trust me, you never really know them.

767
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:41,858
I mean, I've been with Max for fuckin' ever.

768
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,259
and I still don't know him.

769
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,975
Why do you insist on doing this, Marsha?

770
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,300
I swear to god.  I mean I know
you don't like him, but he's my husband.

771
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,074
and I love him.
No.

772
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,351
Honey, here's the thing.

773
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:51,011
Why didn't he tell you

774
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,846
that his sister was
coming to stay with you?

775
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,206
I mean, don't you think that's wierd?

776
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:55,462
No, I don't.

777
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,906
If she's a complete flake.
And she called him like 3 months ago

778
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:58,207
and said she was coming

779
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,608
and then never called to confirm!

780
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:01,574
No.
So it's an honest oversite.

781
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,099
 Remember what dad used to always say?

782
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:05,100
Better to beg forgiveness,
then ask permission.

783
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:09,102
Marsha, I feel like you are projecting
your relationship onto my relationship.

784
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:11,547
No!  I'm not.
If something happened with Max?

785
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:14,922
I'm hypersensitive to dishonesty, right now.

786
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:16,827
I mean, I can smell it a mile away.

787
00:37:18,992 --> 00:37:20,409
Why would he be afraid to tell me

788
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,407
that his sister was coming to stay?

789
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,922
Well,  I do not know ...
maybe, maybe he thought you'd say no...

790
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,435
or maybe he...
he knew what a pain in the ass she is.

791
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:30,277
I don't know.  The point is
he knew and he didn't tell you.

792
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:31,753
You have to start looking for all those

793
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:34,010
little lies, that's what they do.
Men lie.

794
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:36,262
Yeah, I know, actually you might be right.

795
00:37:36,263 --> 00:37:38,675
He might not have told me because he
didn't want me to know

796
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,684
what a complete and total slut...
his sister is.

797
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:44,390
Last night, she brought a guy home
at 3 in the morning,

798
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,803
and was hooking up with him on my kitchen counter.

799
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:50,049
and actually all of that I'm okay with ... sort of....

800
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,063
Except that today, when she came home,
I tried to talk to her about it...

801
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,826
and she gave me a fuckin' attitude.

802
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:58,451
Like I was making an unreasonable request
that she not bring strange men home.

803
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:00,662
Look, honey, house guests are always a problem,

804
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:02,537
but, when it's a relative, like a...

805
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:06,458
bitchy English shrew of a mother in law,

806
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:09,664
or a, you know,  slutty L.A. sister in law,

807
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,466
then it's a really bad idea.

808
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:12,567
So what did Buzzy say?

809
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:13,890
I haven't told him yet.

810
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,533
I don't know what to say.
I don't know how to tell him

811
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,180
I want his baby sister
to get the fuck out of my house?

812
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:21,767
Well, I thought you said you could tell him anything.

813
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,416
Yeah, no I can, but this is different
I mean, it's his sister,

814
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,410
and he's always so understanding

815
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,983
about Dara and you ...

816
00:38:26,984 --> 00:38:28,468
And I just feel....
Me?

817
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:30,721
Why does he need to
be understanding about me?

818
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:34,957
No ... you know ... he just ...He...
What'?

819
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,748
He thinks you don't like him.
He thinks you don't like him.

820
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,583
Oh.  Well I don't.

821
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,314
At least he's smart enough to recognize that.

822
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:44,349
Why?
What has he done?

823
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,738
He hasn't done anything ...
it's just...look at you,  I mean...

824
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:48,960
You're a...You're a  amazing catch.

825
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,111
You're beautiful, you're successful,

826
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:52,761
you're wealthy.
I mean...

827
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:55,216
I don't know, he was just in too
much of a rush

828
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:56,803
to get a ring on your finger.

829
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,058
A ring that you paid for.

830
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,773
I just think Marsha doesn't think

831
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,536
I'm good enough for her sister.

832
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,902
Ah...We come from different worlds....

833
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:12,400
I don't know ... she's never really
opened up to me, and

834
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:15,968
You know, it's funny, I can see that
she takes it out on Max

835
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:19,996
a little bit, because he's the one
 that set Katie and I up.

836
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:21,721
Swear to god,  That woman hates me!

837
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:22,752
I don't think she hates you!

838
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,685
She's probably not madly in love with you
anymore.  But I don't think she hates you.

839
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:26,968
I've got to get out of this marriage.

840
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,433
I already told you,
I don't want to hear this shit, okay?

841
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:30,634
I don't want to have to go home

842
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,673
to Katie and have her asking me

843
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,964
about you guys, and then I'm forced to lie.

844
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,547
Just tell her the truth!

845
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:38,296
Seriously!,  I'm done with it.

846
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:39,397
and it's because of you, really.

847
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:41,365
Me!  What did I have to do with this?

848
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:43,436
When you said "18 years is a success"

849
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:44,426
That's right !

850
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:48,181
I mean, John is in college now,
he doesn't need us to be together anymore.

851
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:50,057
Hey, do me a favor, okay?

852
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,705
Don't pin this shit on me.

853
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,439
I was trying to smooth over

854
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,653
what was becoming a
very awkward conversation, alright ?

855
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,073
Yeah,  but what you said was right.

856
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:58,377
Well, forget that I said it!

857
00:39:58,378 --> 00:40:00,910
I can't forget it!
I'm...I'm done!

858
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:02,510
I'll gunna ask Marsha for a divorce!

859
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:03,387
No, you're not.

860
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,488
I don't need your nutty wife

861
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,907
thinking I'm somehow responsible....

862
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,576
for planting the seed in your sick mind

863
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,377
that you are going to divorce!

864
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:11,707
There's this girl at the studio

865
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,911
I swear to god she's gorgeous.

866
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,051
Every time I look at her..
I do not want to hear this shit.

867
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:17,850
I just want to fuck her brains out!

868
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:20,258
Get back to work, you're a fucking skel.

869
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:23,762
How much longer on this?

870
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:33,517
....phone rings...
     Hello.

871
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:36,496
I was hoping I might hear from you.

872
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,416
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

873
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:41,469
but, you know how I get.
I lash out.

874
00:40:41,494 --> 00:40:44,069
No.  Nothing happened with that guy.

875
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,984
I was just....
I was trying to make you jealous.

876
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,030
I wanted you to come run after me

877
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,363
and tell me not to go,
but you didn't.

878
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,570
No, I am not gonna leave you alone.

879
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,270
because I'm still in love with you

880
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,773
and I want to be with you.

881
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:02,496
You can't just meet me, for one night

882
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,048
just one night.

883
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:07,719
I don't care ... whatever you want.

884
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,205
We can get a hotel room, it doesn't matter.

885
00:41:13,078 --> 00:41:14,950
I'll see you then.

886
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:27,475
...phone rings...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:29,531
Hello.

888
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:30,532
Hi, it's Dara.

889
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:32,300
Dara, who?

890
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:34,589
Dara Flynn, who's this?

891
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,619
This is Linda.  I'm Buzzy's sister.

892
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,358
Who are you?

893
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,108
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm Katie's ex-husband.

894
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,401
I have this vacuum cleaner
that I have to drop back to them.

895
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,493
Can you let me up?

896
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,776
Oh, well apparently, I am not suppose

897
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:47,752
to let men up into the appartment.

898
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:50,532
so, maybe I just better
come down and get it, huh?

899
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,861
Grand, cool, thank you.

900
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:54,303
Alright, just give me 5 minutes.

901
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,140
You know, my nature is my nature.

902
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,398
I see a beautiful woman

903
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,250
I react, I respond.

904
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:03,751
I just had to ask her out ...
You know?

905
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:12,203
So....go ahead love.
It's almost like ...ah...you know....

906
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:13,428
Hello.  Good afternoon.  Come.

907
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,650
What was it about?

908
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,729
I mean, she's absolutely stunning.

909
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,837
I mean, you could sense there was
that sort of, you know,  hurt.

910
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:25,267
in those sea blue eyes of hers'.

911
00:42:25,268 --> 00:42:27,950
You know, a need, you know, for kindness.

912
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:31,212
and she had that kind of Blanche Dubois

913
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:36,701
like quality.  You know, someone who depends
on the kindness of strangers.

914
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,002
so to speak.

915
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:44,507
Well, you know, I was uh...
I was excited and a little nervous

916
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,197
to go meet Miles

917
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:47,803
and uh....there was beer here in the fridge

918
00:42:47,804 --> 00:42:51,325
I figured it would be good to go
get a couple of free drinks or something.

919
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:55,807
Oh, Katie just never understood the
temperament of an artist.

920
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:59,528
You know, she just really was never emotionally in tuned

921
00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:01,581
I think, to....
to  really understand where I was coming from.

922
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:04,890
Yeah, they're like, the're so organized

923
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:07,469
you know, they like to have
everything in it's place and stuff.

924
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,642
No room for spontaneity.

925
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:12,335
Yeah! Yeah! You know,
I just like to let life take me

926
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:13,436
on a wild ride.

927
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:16,123
The road of excess leads
to the gates of wisdom, type of thing.

928
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:20,183
for example I don't drink anymore...
You know, cuz I....

929
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:21,808
I took that to the gates of wisdom.

930
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,705
Because uh...For me as an artist, I..I feel that...

931
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:27,325
it's just more truthful, more honest...

932
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:31,293
and that's that's I...
I think that's important, you know?

933
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:34,420
Um....What kind of artist are you?
Like a painter or something?

934
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:37,030
I'm an actor.   Theatre actor.

935
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,149
Have you ever heard of Mizner?

936
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,018
Oh, No.  Is he a writer?

937
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,564
Oh, no...no ... Mizner was um ...

938
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:46,565
God.  How would you describe Mizner.

939
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:51,738
He was just a god, of sort of...
the rich...of the craft.

940
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,241
Indulge me for a second.
We'll do a small little exercise.

941
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,016
Alright, just breath, shake yourself out, try to relax.

942
00:43:58,117 --> 00:43:59,117
Center yourself.

943
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:04,219
Okay, right.
Stare into my eyes, okay?

944
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:07,117
Now just breath.

945
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:10,611
and allow whatever comes out, comes out.

946
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:11,612
whatever time.

947
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,391
Like talking?

948
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,516
Like talking.   Perfect.

949
00:44:30,246 --> 00:44:32,086
Wow, this is intense!

950
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:35,002
Wow, this is intense.

951
00:44:35,587 --> 00:44:37,072
Was I hitting on her?

952
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:40,436
Ah, you know...
Look.   It's hard to say cuz..

953
00:44:40,437 --> 00:44:43,501
as an artist, it's what I felt
with her.... was that sort of connection.

954
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:45,857
It's a very spontaneous reaction.

955
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:51,490
and looking into her eyes, you know,
it seems...appropriate for the moment.

956
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,694
Oh, oh, there it is.

957
00:44:55,695 --> 00:45:00,826
Hey! I...just met Katie's ex-husband, Dara.

958
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,690
Dara? Where'd you meet him?

959
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:07,264
Here. He came by to drop off a vacuum cleaner.

960
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:10,631
But ... I did not let him up....

961
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:12,696
because Katie said I'm not suppose to have

962
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:14,136
strange men in the appartment.

963
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,262
Then you spoke to Kate.

964
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:16,731
And she was a little snippy with me.

965
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:18,498
Do me a favor, don't give me any shit aboout Katie, alright?

966
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:20,423
She is being very generous letting you stay here.

967
00:45:20,424 --> 00:45:22,235
Yeah! Well she and I wouldn't have a problem

968
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:24,254
if you hadn't told her
anything about last night.

969
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,548
Of course I'm gonna to tell her!

970
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:27,336
She's my wife!  This is her appartment!

971
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:29,999
Yeah! But she....comes at me with all her judgements

972
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,868
and everything and I don't need that from her.

973
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:33,880
Seriously, can you blame her?

974
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:35,708
I mean, given your performance
on the kitchen counter, I think ...

975
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:37,595
Wow!
And I really, really don't need that from you!

976
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:39,283
What is that suppose to mean?

977
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:40,484
Do you need which is supposed to mean?

978
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:42,617
Do you even remember at all
what it was like when we were kids?

979
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,727
You bringing home a new girl every night

980
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:46,858
and dad friggin' congradulating you about it?

981
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:48,454
Yeah, I was in college.

982
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,086
That was acceptable behavior,

983
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:52,803
you're an adult, staying
in this appartment.

984
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:55,206
No listen to me.   I'm not mad at you!

985
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:57,479
Okay?  And I'm not judging you.

986
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,980
But she is going to be on my case

987
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:00,862
if that kind of behavior continues.

988
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:03,629
Alright now look.   I am happy to have you here

989
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,500
I miss you, it's great to see you

990
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,719
but can you please do me a favor

991
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,856
and just ...
you know, chill out a little bit while you're here.

992
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:13,346
Okay ... Okay.

993
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:14,880
I'll chill out a little bit.

994
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:21,307
Oh ... I should tell you...

995
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:23,608
I lost Katie's coat.

996
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:27,377
You lost the coat that you took?

997
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:29,103
Yeah, but um...I said I'd replace it.

998
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:31,284
Trust me, you can not afford to
replace that coat.

999
00:46:31,885 --> 00:46:33,329
Alright.  I will take care of that, but um ...

1000
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,310
I appreciate you making this easy on me.

1001
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:41,525
You want to tell the story?

1002
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:46,126
You know, we met ...uh I was training um..
Max at the gym...

1003
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:49,114
So ah...
Listen to me ... I been meaning to tell you.  My sister in law...

1004
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:51,907
She is ....hot piece of ass , right?

1005
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:55,515
and the other day she mentions how horny she is,

1006
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:57,374
so uh...if you want me to hook you up?

1007
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:01,294
Why is your sister in law
telling you how horny she is?

1008
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:03,340
No, she told Marsha,
Marsha told me, you know.

1009
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:05,137
That's marriage for you.
What's the catch?

1010
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:07,335
I mean, If she's such a great
looking girl, why is she single?

1011
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:10,205
Obviously, I thought there must
have been something wrong with you,

1012
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:12,636
Either you're mentally unstable
or maybe have the clap,

1013
00:47:13,137 --> 00:47:14,981
fortunately neither is true.
Both of which appealed, apparently.

1014
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,982
cause you signed right up
for the first date, so.

1015
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:20,583
Yeah.
And then, yeah, we went out and um....

1016
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:24,628
pretty soon after ahh....
it got very serious and then,

1017
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:27,981
I impetuously....
proposed one day,

1018
00:47:27,982 --> 00:47:30,577
as we were coming back from dinner.

1019
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:32,417
and...
What do you say?

1020
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,728
Yes.

1021
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:36,806
I said yes.

1022
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:37,628
And here we are.

1023
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:38,845
Here we are.

1024
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:43,219
I was...I was pregnant

1025
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,982
um so....it was a big surprise but....

1026
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:49,509
and I remember he had this gig
at this tiny little club.

1027
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,066
and so, we went...

1028
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:56,011
and um....he was up there
and he wrote this song

1029
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:56,961
for me,

1030
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:58,317
You did!
It was really sweet.

1031
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:00,512
And he...he um...
proposed to me right there

1032
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:01,708
in front of every body.

1033
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:05,004
Yeag I...I remember being totally freaked out.

1034
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:08,704
about the popspect of
becoming a father, and then....

1035
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:10,650
I don't know.
The whole thing was kind of a blur.

1036
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:13,351
It just happened so quickly.
But it was still sweet.

1037
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:15,892
Those were some good times.
Back then.

1038
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,792
Yeah.

1039
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:24,400
I think the thing that she's
most upset abouit...

1040
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,779
is that we can't our freak on.

1041
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,926
and the room next door...
It's true.  I like to be loud.

1042
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,307
I'm sorry.
I can't  do these dinners any more,

1043
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,569
If you insist on talking
like that at the dinner table.

1044
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:37,718
I mean, it's fine in the locker
room, that your room is accessable,

1045
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:38,719
but we we're it bothers me.

1046
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,549
Marsha, please!  What?
Just lighten up!

1047
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,213
You sound like an old woman!

1048
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:46,162
People talk about sex
and they curse at dinner table, okay?

1049
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah.
Just get over it.

1050
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:48,899
No, I'm not gonna get over it.

1051
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
Because I find it offensive,

1052
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:53,876
more importantly,
did you just call me an "old woman"?

1053
00:48:53,977 --> 00:48:56,139
No, I didn't.
I said you sounded like an old woman.

1054
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,044
Well, please explain to me
how I sound like an old woman.

1055
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:00,731
I don't need this,
coming from you.  Of all people.

1056
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:04,855
Everything and everyone
just irritate and upset you the whole time.

1057
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:08,265
Everything?   Wow.
It's infuriating.  We're all walking around on eggshells,

1058
00:49:08,266 --> 00:49:10,436
terrified that everything we say
might upset you.

1059
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:11,871
That's not true!

1060
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:13,598
I mean, Katie.  Do you feel that way?

1061
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,513
No, not at all.

1062
00:49:14,514 --> 00:49:16,732
No.  See.
And clearly, Buzzy doesn't.

1063
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:19,669
I mean, otherwise he'd heed
my request to speak like a gentleman.

1064
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,188
Gentleman? ...Yeah that would never happen!

1065
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:25,342
No.  I think the only person
who's terrified of me, is you.

1066
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:27,019
- You know what Marsha?
- What?

1067
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,480
You have lost your zest for life.

1068
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:30,481
My zest.

1069
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,298
Zest, yes!  The fun,  happiness, joy

1070
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:35,299
it's all gone!

1071
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,227
Bitching and complaining.

1072
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:39,315
That's become your personality traits.

1073
00:49:39,316 --> 00:49:40,316
I'm sick of it!
Wow.

1074
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:42,422
Nothing's fun or funny to you, anymore.

1075
00:49:42,423 --> 00:49:44,520
I mean, I don't even know when the
last time you laughed was.

1076
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:45,521
When was the last time you laughed?

1077
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,298
No really.  When was the last time?

1078
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:48,142
You want to know?
I do.

1079
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:49,564
Oh.  When I found your
pathetic passes at

1080
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:52,535
that young girl in the studio,
hilarious.

1081
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,378
I mean you should of seen him!
He's was all being charming and

1082
00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:55,843
sucking in his gut.

1083
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:57,243
I mean I laughed my head off, at that one.

1084
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,211
Hey, hey.
Let's change the subject, huh?

1085
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:02,319
Buzzy!  Tell us about one of those
freak shows, from your gym, that you train.

1086
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
Something funny.

1087
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:06,680
Okay ...Yeah.  Let's see.  Um...

1088
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:09,729
Oh.  Alright, yeah.
There's this guy,  Aaron Luben, he's a law student.....

1089
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,742
Guys.
Sleeping with his cleaning lady.

1090
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:12,985
That's funny!

1091
00:50:12,986 --> 00:50:14,568
Um....I want a divorce.

1092
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:17,547
Yeah. ... No ... you know what? ...

1093
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:18,597
Buzzy, you're right

1094
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,369
Your right.  We had 18 years
we can consider that a success.

1095
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,656
Don't bring me into this.

1096
00:50:24,657 --> 00:50:26,574
You know.   Did I say that?
I don't remember saying that.

1097
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:28,253
Let's just end it, right now.

1098
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:31,658
Fine.  That is music to my ears.

1099
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:34,045
Oh it is?   Well good!
Good riddence.

1100
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:35,517
Yeah.  Oh, but I'm keeping the appartment.

1101
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,901
That's fine, because I'll sleep in the studio.

1102
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,249
Great, perfect.

1103
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,175
Max, Max! Wait! Wait!

1104
00:50:41,176 --> 00:50:45,095
What just happened?   Go after him!
Do something!

1105
00:50:45,096 --> 00:50:48,549
I kind of ... I got my sister to deal with.
Right?   So maybe....

1106
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,577
Great ...

1107
00:50:51,078 --> 00:50:54,199
It's alright.
I'm fine.

1108
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,986
You know.
What you have to look forward to.

1109
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,812
Yeah!   I think 18 years is a
hell of a success.

1110
00:50:58,813 --> 00:51:00,679
I mean, my first marriage
ony lasted 6 years

1111
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,495
Yours was what?   4 years?

1112
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:04,600
So,  If you can go 18???

1113
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:07,737
I'd say, you did a pretty damn good job.

1114
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:08,896
Just out of curiosity...

1115
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:10,446
how long do you see us going?

1116
00:51:10,747 --> 00:51:15,184
Hopefully longer than
18, I mean, forever, I hope.

1117
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:17,956
That what be really what I imagined, but ....
Yeah, me too!

1118
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:19,577
When I said ... "I do"

1119
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,818
Yeah!  I'm agreeing with you completely.

1120
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:26,406
but, 18, if we made it to
18  I'd , you know, I..I..

1121
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,631
think we'd both be pretty happy.

1122
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,505
Why am I here now to get
Miles back, you know?

1123
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:41,539
Umm ... I think maybe knowing
that he got married was um....

1124
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,875
a motivating factor, for sure.

1125
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:49,074
It got me to see what I really want

1126
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:50,853
and to um...go after it.

1127
00:51:53,264 --> 00:51:55,591
Why don't you have something
a  little bit stronger, huh?

1128
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:06,904
And one for me.

1129
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:08,795
Okay.

1130
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,856
Cheers.   Cheers.

1131
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:22,302
That's better.
How about another one?

1132
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,493
One more.

1133
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:51,889
I miss you.

1134
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:04,751
Wait.   What?
I want to play a song for you.

1135
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:06,452
I think you're really gonna enjoy it.

1136
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:09,730
Let's go.

1137
00:53:22,712 --> 00:53:25,352
Remember it?
Remember this one?

1138
00:53:27,922 --> 00:53:29,970
You know you want to dance.

1139
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,584
I know you do.

1140
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,390
Let's go.

1141
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:03,712
Your still in love with me.

1142
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:06,680
So what?

1143
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:09,078
Doesn't matter.

1144
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,345
Of course it matters.

1145
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,369
I brought something for you.

1146
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,494
Yeah?   Um  Hm.
What?

1147
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:24,781
Well, you just have to wait and see.

1148
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:26,382
Don't go anywhere, okay?

1149
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:27,607
Oh, your pulling all the stops, tonight.

1150
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,987
Don't move.
I'll be right here.

1151
00:54:32,012 --> 00:54:32,912
Okay.

1152
00:54:40,807 --> 00:54:43,568
Men are pretty predictable, I find.

1153
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:48,130
And um...
if you use your sexuality in the right way....

1154
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:53,548
then you can get them to do,
pretty much anything you want them to do.

1155
00:54:58,345 --> 00:55:01,153
Oh.  Hi guys.  I didn't realize
you uh...still here.

1156
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:06,820
We're going down to Walkers for a couple
drinks, if you want to come with us.

1157
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:09,941
What, now?
Yeah!

1158
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:10,702
Come on.  Come out with us!

1159
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:11,703
Yeah?   Yeah.

1160
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:15,456
Yeah ... Uh ...
Come on.    Okay.

1161
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:18,291
I could do with a drink.
In fact, you know what?

1162
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,468
I buy you all a drink.
How does that sound?

1163
00:55:21,357 --> 00:55:25,829
Oh my god!   I really can't believe
that just happened!

1164
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,394
Divorce! ... Over dinner? ... What?

1165
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:32,425
I'm gonna have another glass
of wine, yeah?  Yep.   Yes.

1166
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:34,781
I actually thought they were happy.

1167
00:55:34,882 --> 00:55:36,906
Really?  Yeah.
Why do you think they are happy?

1168
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:39,251
I mean, come on.
I've never saw them smile at one another.

1169
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:42,031
They've never said a nice thing
to one another.

1170
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:44,090
At least not in my presence.
No, no! In the beginning,

1171
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,262
way before you knew them.

1172
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:46,523
Back when they were had Johnny.

1173
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:48,867
They were like ...I mean,
I've never seen two people more in love.

1174
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,700
The way he used to look at her.

1175
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:53,169
He used to bring her flowers like every day!

1176
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,648
You forget that was what uh... 18 years ago?

1177
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:58,144
Then why did you call their
marriage a success?

1178
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:01,886
I was just trying to smooth over
another uncomfortable meal.

1179
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:04,558
God! I mean, I knew
they had problems

1180
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,984
but I thought they were just like
everybody else that has problems.

1181
00:56:07,985 --> 00:56:08,852
I had no idea

1182
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:12,281
Wow.  Did you?
Did you have a sense of this?

1183
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:16,752
Uh....No... no ... not really.

1184
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,490
Not really?

1185
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:20,222
Look, sometimes ...
What?

1186
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,939
Sometimes in the gym,
Max will talk shit about her.

1187
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,408
You know?  I mean,
But, I thought he was harmless,

1188
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:29,145
the same way most guys
will talk shit about their wives.

1189
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:31,393
Do you talk shit about me at the gym?

1190
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,743
No, I do not talk shit about you.

1191
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:34,468
We're newlyweds.

1192
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,663
I not gonna talk shit about you
for at least another 2 months or so.

1193
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:39,769
Oh.
Cheers.  Cheers.

1194
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:42,771
Oh.   A prince.
A prince among men.

1195
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:44,851
Yeah.  But you know,
you should of told me that one.

1196
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:46,076
That was one to tell me.

1197
00:56:47,034 --> 00:56:48,393
look ... I didn't know

1198
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:51,174
You know, he was going to ask for
a divorce at dinner!

1199
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,537
We did say we were gonna tell
each other everything.

1200
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:55,854
and this one,
this time around.  Even the hard stuff.

1201
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:59,095
Really.   I know everything.
You don't have to be afraid.

1202
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,812
Agreed.  I will in the future...
you know,  tell you.

1203
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:05,315
Yeah.  Because I really don't want to be
blindsided in the restaurant

1204
00:57:05,316 --> 00:57:07,576
That would really suck for me.

1205
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:11,039
Got it.   I will.
I got it.   Loud and clear.

1206
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,899
Okay?
Got you.

1207
00:57:17,624 --> 00:57:18,824
Wow.

1208
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,631
Well. I think for a  relationship to work...
you have to have total honesty.

1209
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:25,875
You know?    Tell each other everything.
Down to the littlest detail.

1210
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,610
I mean I....I totally agree,
up to a point.   I think...

1211
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,605
I think there are some things that...

1212
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:35,892
you know, most people admit,
that are better to keep to yourself.

1213
00:57:35,893 --> 00:57:37,409
Yeah?  Like what?

1214
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,151
Well, I don't know.
I don't think you'd want to hear like

1215
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:43,328
my deepest and darkest thoughts
that I might just happen to have.

1216
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:46,647
Yes, I do.
I mean, I tell you everything.

1217
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:50,410
I don't know,  let's say you ...
I don't know,  ..you...

1218
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,294
you have a passing fantasy
about, I don't know,

1219
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,119
like a sexual situation.

1220
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:57,007
having a 2 on 1, with
you know, two guys at the deli.

1221
00:57:57,008 --> 00:57:59,204
Yeah, I don' t want to hear that.
I don't have those fantasies

1222
00:57:59,205 --> 00:58:01,781
about two guys at the deli.
Do you?

1223
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:06,526
No!  I don't have any
fantasies about 2 guys at the deli.

1224
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:09,742
I mean, there's the girl at Starbucks,
not so bad.

1225
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:15,429
Like I said... Better to keep
these things to yourself.

1226
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:26,504
Wow ... you look amazing.

1227
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:30,656
Why didn't you say "yes" when I asked you?

1228
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:32,659
Ask me now.

1229
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,999
Ask me again.
Ask me again, right now.

1230
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,008
You know, you were
the only thing that I ever wanted.

1231
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:41,388
We could have been so happy together.

1232
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,244
We could still be happy together.

1233
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:46,711
How can we be?
I'm married, now.

1234
00:58:46,812 --> 00:58:49,723
So get a Divorce!
Who gives a shit!

1235
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:51,490
You're still in love with me.

1236
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:54,166
I can't. Why not?

1237
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,408
You've only been married
 a few weeks.

1238
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,708
It's not even real yet.

1239
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,758
People get divorced every day!
It's not a big deal.

1240
00:59:00,759 --> 00:59:02,739
Oh fuck, you don't understand.

1241
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,134
We're having a baby.

1242
00:59:05,435 --> 00:59:08,380
That's why I got married so fast.

1243
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:10,488
I'm having a baby.

1244
00:59:13,822 --> 00:59:17,638
What?
In a few weeks.

1245
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:18,839
I'm gonna be a father.

1246
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:47,079
I'm angry at Linda because.....

1247
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,503
she said she wants
to be with me now!

1248
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:50,950
But it's way too late.

1249
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:53,658
I asked her to marry me.
I ...I gave her my.. my heart.

1250
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:55,459
and she just didn't take it.

1251
00:59:56,539 --> 01:00:01,664
Um....
I really wanted to spend some time...

1252
01:00:01,689 --> 01:00:03,489
with ah....Linda.

1253
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,555
and uh....

1254
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:09,948
I'm ...I'm happy though, it
turned out the way it did.

1255
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:12,049
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

1256
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:17,256
Uh...you know ... now...
now your just picking on me, alright?

1257
01:00:17,257 --> 01:00:19,913
Hey! Three towels...
three towels, wet on the floor.

1258
01:00:19,914 --> 01:00:20,558
Uh....Proof.

1259
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,135
Look, I used that towel, first
of all, alright. That's not...

1260
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:24,439
No you didn't.  No,  because you always

1261
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,139
hang your towels up half
his and hers.

1262
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,121
What are you saying?
That she purposely......

1263
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:30,311
used alll three towels and then
threw them on the bathroom floor?

1264
01:00:30,412 --> 01:00:32,011
Yes, exactly what I'm saying.
Why would she do that?

1265
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:34,042
Because I asked her
very nicely not to,

1266
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:36,509
and she clearly doesn't like
to be told what to do.

1267
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,588
I think you're starting
to get a little paranoid

1268
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:40,221
but here.
Give me the towels.

1269
01:00:40,246 --> 01:00:41,821
I will go clean them, alright?

1270
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:43,464
Baby.  It's not about the towels.
I just....

1271
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:47,876
Can we talk about like a....
a check out out date, for her?

1272
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:50,747
Oh my ..
what am I supposed to say to her?

1273
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:53,105
Just ask her how long she plans to stay here !

1274
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:55,651
And then maybe suggest
that it be a shorter

1275
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,451
amount of time
rather than a longer.

1276
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:01,404
Is Thursday fair?

1277
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:04,060
Thursday would be great.
Thank you.

1278
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,216
I'm going to go take a shower, now.

1279
01:01:06,513 --> 01:01:08,561
and use a washcloth
to dry myself with.

1280
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:10,986
I will do some laundry.

1281
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:16,491
My sister is annoying, occasionally.

1282
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:20,561
Buzzy's sister is on a...
whole other level.

1283
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:24,244
She'd try the patience of a saint.

1284
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:28,773
You know, this kind of shit, is the stuff
that guys....can't get their head around.

1285
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:33,317
I mean really, who cares if you lost
my coat or you used too many towels.

1286
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:36,308
I think for guys...
you know, almost anything goes.

1287
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:38,854
Maybe with exception of
sleeping with um....

1288
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:40,514
you know, one of your ex-girlfriends.

1289
01:01:40,515 --> 01:01:42,215
that's probably the only
thing that's out of bounds.

1290
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:14,786
Hi.
Hi.

1291
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:15,999
Come on in.

1292
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:23,368
You know, as an actor...
I once heard a line

1293
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:27,167
Live life boldly, and extreme
forces will come to you.

1294
01:02:27,168 --> 01:02:31,070
Linda's a pure force, man.
Pure force.

1295
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:33,174
You know what I really need?

1296
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:37,503
What do you need?
I really need a drink.

1297
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:41,928
I'm sorry, look, I don't
have it on the home.

1298
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,019
But I don't have a
lot of minutes

1299
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:49,404
What is real, you know?

1300
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:52,284
Just like the way
you and I are real you know,

1301
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:53,485
sparce and raw, as you can see

1302
01:02:54,286 --> 01:02:55,561
there's not a lot of stuff

1303
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:59,363
that I keep so I
don't really get distracted

1304
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:01,288
so I can just focus on work.

1305
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:08,791
It is really fucking sexy

1306
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:09,976
when you talk like that.

1307
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,141
We shouldn't be doing this, love.

1308
01:03:15,142 --> 01:03:16,551
We're kind of like family?

1309
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:20,343
No, no!  We're not.
We're not related.

1310
01:03:20,444 --> 01:03:22,643
No!  But you're my ex-wifes'
sister in law.

1311
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:25,211
That's a relationship that they would not encourage.
Oh.   Oh.

1312
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:26,912
particularly your brother!

1313
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:30,179
This, this is not a relationship.

1314
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,850
Now, take me to the bedroom, or
do you want to talk about it some more?

1315
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:53,391
Upstairs.
Okay.   Watch your head.

1316
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:02,865
God it's... Dark.
No, no..wait, wait!

1317
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:06,363
No.  No  no.   Don't go up there.
Alright.

1318
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,031
Is so sad!

1319
01:04:08,232 --> 01:04:09,687
What part?

1320
01:04:09,688 --> 01:04:12,237
Oh ... the whole fucking thing is sad!

1321
01:04:12,238 --> 01:04:14,124
You said it's 15 years???

1322
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:17,900
I did get one ...
when I was in Hamburg but it cost...money.

1323
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:22,127
Right.
Is your wife, like, Is she still living upstairs?

1324
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:26,399
She gonna live upstairs.
I gonna live down here in the studio.

1325
01:04:26,907 --> 01:04:28,269
You know ...

1326
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:33,585
15 years is too fucking long.

1327
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:36,001
I'm gonna do something really nice for you.

1328
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,209
Let's go.

1329
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:45,858
Let's just.... do it right here.

1330
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:56,944
Oh ... sweet Jesus!

1331
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,206
You awake?

1332
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:07,906
Yeah.

1333
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:08,902
Still crying.

1334
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:09,903
No.

1335
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:11,185
Want to talk about it?

1336
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:14,374
Not really.

1337
01:05:16,648 --> 01:05:17,677
Can I ask who my rival is?

1338
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,702
He is just some boy I used to know.

1339
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:28,210
You could have told me about him.

1340
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:30,811
Why?

1341
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,203
What does it matter to you?

1342
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:47,091
Yes, Linda did cry the first time we had sex but...

1343
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:49,824
To tell you the truth, that's not
the first time that's happened.

1344
01:05:50,225 --> 01:05:52,055
You know,  I uh...
whatever it is,

1345
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:54,216
I just seem to have that sort
of impact on women.

1346
01:05:57,241 --> 01:06:00,528
Hey babe, look.
I don't think she ah....is gonna be home tonight

1347
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:03,394
so why don't we uh.....

1348
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:05,580
you know, have a little make up sex?

1349
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:07,981
What do you think
I think it would be good for us.

1350
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:12,048
I know babe, but I'm...  just... I'm
really not in the mood, tonight.

1351
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:15,337
Oh, I can get you in the mood?

1352
01:06:16,296 --> 01:06:20,037
You want me to uh....
Slip under the covers?  Go downtown and uh....?

1353
01:06:20,062 --> 01:06:21,862
I can get you in the mood pretty quickly.

1354
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:26,842
Ha ha! Sounds great,
and I think we should do it when she leaves.

1355
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,666
after Thursday.

1356
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:33,898
Touche

1357
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:42,806
I don't want to think of it as
withholding sex or punishment.

1358
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:45,867
I'd like to think of it as um...incentive.

1359
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,724
To get his sister the fuck
out of my house.

1360
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:57,146
So, guess what?
Max brought somebody home with him

1361
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,811
to the studio, last night.
What?

1362
01:06:58,812 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.
Oh my god.  You are kidding me.

1363
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:03,202
No, no.   I'm not.
I could hear them.

1364
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,302
Oh my god!

1365
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,781
I know!   I  mean, I couldn't be sure,
but, you know,  it was pretty fuckin' obvious.

1366
01:07:07,782 --> 01:07:10,268
Oh, Marsha.  That is really too soon!
I know!

1367
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:11,381
I can't stay in the appartment.

1368
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:14,016
I mean, if he'as gunna do
shit like that, I.....

1369
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:15,976
Listen.  Can I stay with you guys?

1370
01:07:15,977 --> 01:07:17,909
Just for a little while.

1371
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:21,004
Yeah, you know ah....
Buzzy's sister is still staying with us.

1372
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:24,061
She's in the spare bedroom, though, so
you could go on the couch?

1373
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:25,199
The couch?

1374
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:29,432
Do you remember
what I did for you,

1375
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,432
when you went
through your divorce?

1376
01:07:31,433 --> 01:07:33,300
How you moved in with us?

1377
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:36,038
and I held you every night
while you cried yourself to sleep?

1378
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,780
You remember that?
Yeah.

1379
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:39,468
Put that little bitty on the couch.

1380
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:41,393
Full sisters get dibs over half sisters.

1381
01:07:42,262 --> 01:07:44,685
I mean, when would it be to soon
for me to start dating?

1382
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,067
Well, I waited a few months.

1383
01:07:46,068 --> 01:07:47,840
I know, but you were young.
You could afford to.

1384
01:07:47,841 --> 01:07:52,281
Oh.  Do I need to get waxed?
I mean, what's this um...Brazilian...

1385
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:53,081
Oh god.
Do I need to do that?

1386
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:56,605
Uh.....
I just want to do alll the things that I haven't done in years.

1387
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,400
You know, and I want to do now ...
like.... like tonight!

1388
01:07:59,899 --> 01:08:02,787
You know, maybe it's gonna be good.

1389
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:07,133
I mean, I think in a way ...

1390
01:08:07,134 --> 01:08:10,030
There are, you know, possibilities out there

1391
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:16,853
that could be fun and exciting and...
who knows.

1392
01:08:16,854 --> 01:08:19,768
I'm more grown up and
much more experienced.

1393
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:36,143
What the hell is this all about?

1394
01:08:36,644 --> 01:08:38,143
Please don't tell me you two ...

1395
01:08:38,444 --> 01:08:39,444
This is happening!

1396
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:41,583
It's not what you think.
It's not what I think?

1397
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,281
What is this then?

1398
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:45,068
Come with me, we need to talk.

1399
01:08:48,403 --> 01:08:49,975
What the fuck?
What?

1400
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:53,293
What is happening here?
We're hanging out.

1401
01:08:53,894 --> 01:08:54,856
"Hanging out"?

1402
01:08:54,857 --> 01:08:56,402
There are 8 million people in this city

1403
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,003
and you have to "hang out"  with him??

1404
01:08:58,204 --> 01:09:01,037
Listen, I appreciate you trying
to be my big brother and all....

1405
01:09:01,038 --> 01:09:01,899
I'm not trying to do shit, here!

1406
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,900
But you are being crazy!
We talked yesterday!

1407
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:08,792
I know, I know, but it happened, okay?
Like, things happen, sometimes!

1408
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:09,825
but I'm handling it ...

1409
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:11,618
No, You know what?
You're not handling shit.

1410
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:14,924
What you're doing is
sleeping with my wife's ex-husband.

1411
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:17,029
No, no, I'm not!
I'm not sleeping with him,

1412
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:19,183
I just... I slept with him.
There is a difference.

1413
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:22,329
Alright, obviously I can't talk to you.
Hey asshole!

1414
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:25,329
Look, you understand
that this needs to ends today.

1415
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,907
You are never to see her again!

1416
01:09:27,908 --> 01:09:29,484
No, you don't understand.
I love her.

1417
01:09:29,485 --> 01:09:31,196
You love her?
You don't even fuckin' know her!

1418
01:09:31,197 --> 01:09:32,296
What are you talking about?

1419
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:34,423
Your sister and I were cut
from the same cloth.

1420
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,341
We're from here, the gut.
You and Katie, you're up here.

1421
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,953
You're tinking'.
Always rationalizing and planning.

1422
01:09:39,954 --> 01:09:41,990
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

1423
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:44,533
Are you aware that this
asshole in love with you?

1424
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:46,634
That's what he just told me
No, he's not.

1425
01:09:46,635 --> 01:09:49,114
That what he just said!
No! No.  You're not!

1426
01:09:49,115 --> 01:09:52,124
Listen, you're a really sweet guy, but I...

1427
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,921
You need to turn around and
go home.  Right now.

1428
01:09:57,354 --> 01:09:59,342
Do you mind if I take my coat, please?

1429
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:00,443
Are you kidding me?

1430
01:10:01,044 --> 01:10:02,568
Please give him the fuckin' coat.

1431
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:10,728
Good bye!
You.  Let's go.  We need to talk.

1432
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:18,987
Alright.  So you understand
that you have just put me into

1433
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:21,174
an insane shit storm, alright?

1434
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:22,275
So here's what needs to happen.

1435
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,769
You need to go over and tell Katie

1436
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,105
because I'm not going to.

1437
01:10:26,106 --> 01:10:28,072
Wait.  Why does anybody have to
tell her anything?

1438
01:10:28,773 --> 01:10:30,901
I have to tell her,
and I don't want to tell her.

1439
01:10:30,902 --> 01:10:32,866
You're the one who put us into this situation.

1440
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:34,566
so you got to explain it to her.

1441
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:35,490
this is what we do.

1442
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:37,410
We tell each other everything.
It's called honesty.

1443
01:10:37,411 --> 01:10:40,074
Really?  That sounds like a terrible idea!

1444
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:42,776
You have to promise me that
you're gonna go over there now,

1445
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:44,861
I got to get back to the gym,
and you've got to tell her!

1446
01:10:44,862 --> 01:10:46,878
If I tell her, then she's gonna kick me out!

1447
01:10:49,196 --> 01:10:50,660
You should have thought of that before.

1448
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:59,561
Hey!, There she is, um....

1449
01:11:00,162 --> 01:11:01,619
Linda, this is my sister Marsha....

1450
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,439
Marsha, this is Buzzy's sister, Linda.

1451
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,246
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, finally.

1452
01:11:08,561 --> 01:11:10,579
Um....Listen Katie, I just um ...

1453
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,301
I wanted to talk to you, actually

1454
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,398
if that's alright.  um..

1455
01:11:16,099 --> 01:11:18,049
I just...I have something I wanted to say, and I...

1456
01:11:18,062 --> 01:11:21,318
thought ah.....I should tell you ...

1457
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,312
You know what, Linda. Can I just ...
stop you because I...  I...

1458
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:26,947
I'm actuallly kind of in the middle
of a family crisis, right now.

1459
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:29,449
Yeah.   My...My husband of 18 years just left me.

1460
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,221
Oh no.   I'm sorry!

1461
01:11:31,222 --> 01:11:33,663
Yeah, and we need to talk about
the sleeping arrangments.

1462
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,224
because I'm gonna have to put you
on the couch.  If that's alright.

1463
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:37,448
I can't stay at my place.

1464
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,383
and he's still there and....

1465
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:43,742
Right!   Yeah, um... because
 what I wanted to tell you

1466
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:46,691
just now, is um....
I'm moving out, today!

1467
01:11:46,692 --> 01:11:49,856
You are!
Yep!    That's amazing, great!

1468
01:11:50,257 --> 01:11:51,257
Thank you, Linda!

1469
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:54,448
Oh, No.   Thank you, you've been
so generous, um...

1470
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:56,372
I just...I didn't want to overstay my welcome.

1471
01:11:56,373 --> 01:11:58,900
No, no, not  at all.
No, I'm sure you haven't.

1472
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:03,877
Well ... I am just gonna
I'll go pack my bags.

1473
01:12:03,878 --> 01:12:06,154
Oh uh...can you uh...change the sheets?

1474
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,271
I'm sure they need to be changed.

1475
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:11,011
Yeah.
Thank you.

1476
01:12:12,312 --> 01:12:13,312
Thank you, Linda!

1477
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:23,881
Yeah.  Hi, it's Max.

1478
01:12:24,182 --> 01:12:26,337
Yeah,  No, I know we don't have a session,
I want to talk.

1479
01:12:26,838 --> 01:12:27,838
Thanks.

1480
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,881
Look.  What the hell were you thinking,
dropping that on the table,

1481
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,323
in the middle of dinner, man.

1482
01:12:34,324 --> 01:12:35,914
That's not the place for that shit!

1483
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:38,587
I ...I didn't think about it,
it just came out, that way.

1484
01:12:38,662 --> 01:12:40,268
but you saw what she's like.
She's so demeaning.

1485
01:12:40,293 --> 01:12:42,493
But the timing worked out so well.

1486
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:43,962
when I got to the studio,

1487
01:12:43,963 --> 01:12:47,181
Vanessa, that girl I was talking about...
she was still working there.

1488
01:12:47,282 --> 01:12:49,461
The thing about Max is uh...
he's a poor reflection

1489
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:51,168
on my ability as a trainer.

1490
01:12:51,169 --> 01:12:53,713
I've added absolutely no muscle to him.
He's lost no weight.

1491
01:12:54,014 --> 01:12:57,261
All he likes to do is come
to the gym and bullshit.

1492
01:12:57,262 --> 01:12:59,668
I tell him all the time, you know,
you don't need a trainer...

1493
01:12:59,669 --> 01:13:00,669
you need a shrink.

1494
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:04,988
I do not want to hear these stories....
alright? So, here's the deal....

1495
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,611
I don't think I can train you any more.

1496
01:13:06,612 --> 01:13:08,743
This is gonna put me in too
awkward a position.

1497
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:11,613
I went over there because I was excited!

1498
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:13,747
I thought he'd like to hear
this news, of mine , you know?.

1499
01:13:14,048 --> 01:13:17,166
I mean, this guy ... 18 years I've been married.
He knows that.

1500
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,784
I get one blow job...
I want to tell him, share the good news...

1501
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:23,769
and then he says
"Oh, I'm not gonna train you any more".

1502
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,700
I don't know, he just took it all the wrong way.

1503
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:35,955
Hey,  it's me.  Um...
I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up.

1504
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:41,475
Um....I just... I wanted to call ...

1505
01:13:42,735 --> 01:13:45,208
I...I  wish I could of said this last night?

1506
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:51,679
I um....I just had to get out of there.
but I wanted say it now.

1507
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:59,059
Look, if ...if I had known that you um....
you know, the situation ...

1508
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,387
I really... I never would have come.

1509
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,644
I never would have come to New York.

1510
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:10,266
I want you to know ...
I'm really happy for you.

1511
01:14:11,922 --> 01:14:14,898
I think you are gonna be a great dad.

1512
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:19,504
And I wanted to call and say goodbye.

1513
01:14:19,505 --> 01:14:20,705
So, bye.

1514
01:14:34,147 --> 01:14:36,165
I do not know, I think I got to get out of here.

1515
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:39,396
I think I just...I got to get back to L.A., I think.

1516
01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:59,128
Marsha is gonna stay with us,
for a while.   Yeah.

1517
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:01,061
What happened to the.... other plan?

1518
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:04,627
I thought you were gonna sleep
upstairs and Max was gonna sleep in the studio?

1519
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:07,816
I was.   But last night,  I think
Max brought someone home

1520
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:11,780
And I could hear them, and I can't ...
I mean, can you believe that?

1521
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:13,939
I don't know, I don't care.
Can you....

1522
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:16,120
Where is my sister, by the way?
Her stuff....?

1523
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:18,692
Oh, um.....Linda left.
Linda left.

1524
01:15:18,893 --> 01:15:22,098
Yeah. She...We were sitting in the
kitchen, she came home and she said

1525
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:25,027
she was going to move out.
Wait, what do you mean she moved out?

1526
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:27,728
Did she say where she was going or
where she was gonna stay?

1527
01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:29,530
No.
No.

1528
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:32,976
No she packed her bag and left.
She seemed happy.  Yeah, she did.

1529
01:15:33,377 --> 01:15:36,101
Did she say ... anything else?

1530
01:15:36,702 --> 01:15:38,869
About what?  Oh.

1531
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,647
Today, when I....was going to work,

1532
01:15:41,648 --> 01:15:46,987
I'm comin' out of the deli and I run into her,
and......Dara.

1533
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:49,534
My ... wait...they were together?

1534
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:53,092
I don't know, I mean, I guess the
date that she went on last night...

1535
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:54,717
must have been with him.

1536
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,136
What?   It's just like...
are they in a relationship?

1537
01:16:01,137 --> 01:16:02,937
I don't...
How long have you known about this!?

1538
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:04,421
Oh my god!
Look, I think it was...

1539
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:06,621
She takes the word sluttiness, to whole other level.

1540
01:16:06,622 --> 01:16:09,957
But she is also a coward.
And she came in here and siad she had to leave.

1541
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,061
all of a sudden.
and packed her bag and fucking fled!

1542
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:15,325
because she didn't want to tell
me that she was sleeping with my ex-husband.

1543
01:16:15,326 --> 01:16:19,507
I'm sure it was just a matter of
she was afraid to say something, to you, okay?

1544
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,922
She's a young kid, she's vulnerable.

1545
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:24,673
vulnerable? ... Vulnerable! ...vulnerable.

1546
01:16:25,474 --> 01:16:29,841
So vulnerable means she has to
fuck everyone in New York

1547
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,141
and fuck up my life?

1548
01:16:31,142 --> 01:16:34,408
I didn't like her when I met her.
I mean, she... her eyes were shifty.

1549
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:35,714
You're calling my sister a shifty.

1550
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:36,689
She's completely shifty!

1551
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:39,973
She fucking stole my coat,
and used all my fucking towels!

1552
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:42,029
and slept with someone on the kitchen counter!

1553
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,979
and now she's sleeping with my ex-husband!

1554
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,163
That is completely fucked!
Buzzy, that is completely fucked!

1555
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:48,739
Look! I'm as upset about this as you are, alright!

1556
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,484
I don't like the idea of my little sister sleeping with Dara.

1557
01:16:51,485 --> 01:16:54,739
Who, mind you, is not without any blame here, alright?

1558
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,269
Your reaction, quite honestly,
is a little big.

1559
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:00,063
I mean, I'm thinking maybe I
shouldn't even have said anything.

1560
01:17:00,064 --> 01:17:02,890
And I was like the asshole
who doesn't know!  To who?

1561
01:17:02,891 --> 01:17:05,504
And then I'm the one at the deli
and I run into him.

1562
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:10,301
You would do that to me?
You would let me be ignorant about this?

1563
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:14,034
This is what I've been telling you.
You know, that you guys...you didn't know each other,

1564
01:17:14,035 --> 01:17:16,455
before you got married.
That's why I've been so against it!

1565
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:20,098
My god, Marsha, shut up!
Do not tell my sister to shut up!

1566
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:22,860
My sister is a good person.

1567
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:25,828
Where as your sister is ... the devil!

1568
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:28,251
Look, you're being a little irrational, okay.

1569
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:31,155
So why don't we just...
why don't we just agree to talk in the morning.

1570
01:17:31,256 --> 01:17:34,301
when we don't have to deal with
comments from the fuckin' peanut gallery, alright?

1571
01:17:34,302 --> 01:17:36,799
I'm going to work, and tomorrow

1572
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,108
you and I are going to have a conversation

1573
01:17:38,109 --> 01:17:42,704
because I think.... we might...
want different things, in the relationship.

1574
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:44,548
and we might think that
different things are important.

1575
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:46,916
Really?  I mean, if that's
where you're gonna take this.

1576
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:50,614
I told you the truth!
It's not my fault my sister didn't?

1577
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:55,039
Bye, honey.

1578
01:17:58,317 --> 01:17:59,405
How the fuck did you do that to her?

1579
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:01,332
Why wouldn't you tell her about that?

1580
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:03,030
Oh my god.

1581
01:18:03,331 --> 01:18:07,283
Really.
I mean, it's no wonder Max ran for the fuckin' hills.

1582
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,531
Jesus.

1583
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:12,663
Can you believe this girl?

1584
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:14,519
First, she... steals my coat

1585
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,642
and then uses all the towels, 2 times...

1586
01:18:18,343 --> 01:18:19,413
and then she sleeps with my ex-husband?

1587
01:18:19,414 --> 01:18:21,123
I mean, my ex-husband?

1588
01:18:21,124 --> 01:18:26,150
I feel like if I had a pet rabbit right
now she would be boiling the shit out of it on my stove!

1589
01:18:34,488 --> 01:18:35,765
Oh hey!   How are you doin'?

1590
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:38,801
Ah...Thank you for fucking up my marriage.

1591
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:40,919
I'm so glad that you decided to visit me!

1592
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,597
What do you want!?!
I Just wanted somebody to talk to.

1593
01:18:45,698 --> 01:18:48,322
Oh!   Why don't you give
your new friend Dara a call, maybe?

1594
01:18:48,723 --> 01:18:50,190
I'm sure he's free tonight.

1595
01:18:50,191 --> 01:18:53,444
I'm sorry about that.  I told you I wasn't thinking straight.

1596
01:18:53,445 --> 01:18:55,916
Yeah,  I'd  say you weren't thinking at all.

1597
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:58,261
Why didn't you tell Katie,
like you said you were gonna do?

1598
01:18:58,662 --> 01:18:59,750
I couldn't.

1599
01:19:00,906 --> 01:19:03,838
I was scared, and her
mean creepy sister was there

1600
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:07,968
giving me this attitude, and I just
figured it would be better if I left.

1601
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,018
Ok, well now you have gotten me
into a shit load of trouble, so...

1602
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:17,798
thanks alot.
I'm sorry about that.   I'm a fuck up.   I know!

1603
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:20,956
But I don't have anybody else, you're my brother.

1604
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:22,529
I need your help.

1605
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,076
Yeah!  And I have been trying to help you,

1606
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,732
and all you've done is screw me over.

1607
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:33,756
I don't know what to do.
I don't have any money

1608
01:19:33,957 --> 01:19:35,923
and I just wanna go home.

1609
01:19:35,924 --> 01:19:41,723
I just really want to go home.
I want to go home.

1610
01:19:43,415 --> 01:19:44,844
Where are you?

1611
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:50,724
I'm at some hotel, I'm at the um...
the Cosmopolitan, by your house.

1612
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,571
Why don't you meet me
for breakfast in the morning?

1613
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,649
There's a diner on the corner.
Alright, let's say 9 o'clock and ...

1614
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,634
We'll figure something out, alright?

1615
01:20:00,835 --> 01:20:04,130
Okay.
You gonna be alright?

1616
01:20:05,327 --> 01:20:06,868
Um...Yes.

1617
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:09,569
Alright, I'll see you in the morning.

1618
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:12,100
Okay.

1619
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:27,726
Hey Buzzy!  Are you awake?

1620
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,636
No!   I'm sleeping!

1621
01:20:30,937 --> 01:20:33,463
Hey!  You know what I'm gonna do tomorrow?

1622
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:38,374
You know what?
I could care less, because ah.....

1623
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,375
I'm sleeping?

1624
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,897
I'm gonna go and give myself
a day of beauty.

1625
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:47,194
I'm gonna get a.... maniputty
I'm gonna get a wax.

1626
01:20:47,595 --> 01:20:51,669
I'm going to color my
roots, it's gonna be fabulous!

1627
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,299
Guess what?    I could give a shit!

1628
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,242
And then you know what I'm
gonna do after that?

1629
01:20:56,743 --> 01:21:00,413
You know what Marsha?
I think I said I was sleeping, right?

1630
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:05,899
I'm gonna go to a bar and
I'm gonna drink a ton of margaritas.

1631
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,835
and I am gonna pick up a guy...
a young, young hot guy.

1632
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:14,777
And I am gonna suck him.
And then I'm gonna fuck him in the stall.

1633
01:21:16,278 --> 01:21:19,119
Yeah ... well, that sounds wonderful.
Do me a favor?

1634
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,706
Make sure he wears a rubber.

1635
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:23,208
Okay.  You don't want to have to
end up getting married again!  Right?

1636
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:26,439
Oh and.  Guess what I'm gonna
do with him after that?

1637
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,126
Oh fuck!    You know what?
I really could give a shit, okay?

1638
01:21:31,127 --> 01:21:33,275
I thought you would like it?

1639
01:21:33,276 --> 01:21:37,609
I mean you're always going on and on about
your, you know, sexual exploits with my sister.

1640
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:41,104
I thought that you would appreciate this.
No?

1641
01:21:45,855 --> 01:21:48,684
Marsha ... Good night!

1642
01:21:50,137 --> 01:21:51,198
Good night!

1643
01:21:52,721 --> 01:21:54,437
It's 1 oclocck in the morning and obviously

1644
01:21:54,438 --> 01:21:55,651
I'm not gonna get any sleep

1645
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:59,299
with uh....Marsha chirping in my ear all night so ...

1646
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:03,587
I can either lay in bed and think about

1647
01:22:03,588 --> 01:22:06,160
how I'm gonna try and fix things with Katie or

1648
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:11,118
go over to the restaurant and
actually try and fix things with her.  So...

1649
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:34,319
Can we talk for a minute?
Really busy right now, Buzzy.

1650
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,161
You can't give me a minute?

1651
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:54,760
So look ...alright,  I understand
that I should have come home

1652
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,255
after I saw them, and told you about it.

1653
01:22:57,256 --> 01:22:58,946
I should not have let it out her,

1654
01:22:58,947 --> 01:23:00,447
I am sorry, I screwed up, okay?

1655
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,851
Really scared, Buzzy.  Really scared.

1656
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:05,169
What are scared about?

1657
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:07,893
I think maybe we jumped
into this, prematurely.

1658
01:23:08,694 --> 01:23:11,231
That's craziness, babe!   We are a great couple.

1659
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:13,193
We have the perfect set up
and your blowin' this...

1660
01:23:13,194 --> 01:23:15,507
No.  But I don't want a "set up"!
way out of proportion!

1661
01:23:15,508 --> 01:23:17,175
Buzzy.  I want a marriage.

1662
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:20,312
and we...we joked, all the time,
about how things are so casual

1663
01:23:20,313 --> 01:23:22,114
between us, and there's
no drama, we never

1664
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:24,495
have to see each other.  And I just....
I think maybe we're being naive.

1665
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:26,558
I think we've been avoiding something.

1666
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,233
What are we avoiding?
We have a great, great relationship.

1667
01:23:31,234 --> 01:23:33,590
I mean what....
We are avoiding real life!

1668
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,030
I mean, true intimacy.

1669
01:23:35,131 --> 01:23:37,521
And I'm not just talking about sex.

1670
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:42,420
I think.... I have been lying to myself.

1671
01:23:43,221 --> 01:23:46,193
I think I need a lot more....than this.

1672
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:48,568
What more do you need?
Okay.    I love you.

1673
01:23:48,669 --> 01:23:50,741
I love you!
What more you need than that!?

1674
01:23:50,742 --> 01:23:52,877
Then why...why can't you be honest with me.

1675
01:23:52,878 --> 01:23:55,159
I am honest with you!  Okay?

1676
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,889
I mean, sometimes I don't tell you little things!
I need.....

1677
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,361
Like I just forget to mention some things!
Right.  But it's those lttle....

1678
01:23:59,362 --> 01:24:02,986
those things add up, and I
am worried that after 18 years,

1679
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:06,012
we are gonna be so full of
resentment and hatred towards each other!

1680
01:24:06,013 --> 01:24:11,676
Just like Max and Marsha, and
I'm gonna.... look at you and not know who you are.

1681
01:24:11,777 --> 01:24:14,188
This is like your sister talking, okay?

1682
01:24:14,389 --> 01:24:17,064
You know me!   I mean,
look at me, you know me!

1683
01:24:17,065 --> 01:24:19,789
I don't know, I've seen a lot of
unfamiliar behavior this week.

1684
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,099
Unfamiliar behavior?
Yeah!

1685
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:26,163
I was protecting my sister.
You can't understand that?  She's my little sister!

1686
01:24:26,164 --> 01:24:28,875
Right.  Right.   Instead of protecting me....

1687
01:24:28,876 --> 01:24:30,265
your wife

1688
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:34,300
And I get it, I get it.  You ...
you care about your sister but....

1689
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:35,849
Yeah.
But that's surprising to me

1690
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:38,459
because I had never heard you talk about her

1691
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,523
up until this week,
until she arrived on our doorstep

1692
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,722
and I... I just...
I feel like I don't know you

1693
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:48,823
the way that I should know the person that I married.

1694
01:24:52,663 --> 01:24:55,429
I have to get...I have to go to work.
This is crazy.  This is crazy.

1695
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,727
You totally blew this out of proportion, babe.

1696
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:02,575
I just can't believe that this happened this quickly.

1697
01:25:03,276 --> 01:25:06,423
Two days ago we were happy ...

1698
01:25:06,424 --> 01:25:10,080
and now ah... she's questioning

1699
01:25:10,081 --> 01:25:11,081
whether or not she knows me.

1700
01:25:13,436 --> 01:25:16,101
I don't...You know... I don't even....I'm at a loss for words.

1701
01:25:36,226 --> 01:25:38,969
Hey.   Good morning.

1702
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:41,947
Morning.
You want a coffee?

1703
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:43,416
Thank you.
Sure.   Great.

1704
01:25:47,169 --> 01:25:49,226
How'd you sleep?
Not so good.

1705
01:25:49,627 --> 01:25:51,442
I had a shitty night.

1706
01:25:52,822 --> 01:25:54,318
Well Buzzy was out, early this morning.

1707
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:58,058
Yeah.  He um...he trains a lot of clients,
before they go to work, so.

1708
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,509
Do you want to hear something really funny?

1709
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:07,322
Last night, I was totally teasing
him, and I told him that um....I was gonna go to a bar

1710
01:26:07,323 --> 01:26:09,477
and pick up some guy and screw him in the bar.

1711
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:13,212
Anyway, I just wanted to get
 him back his stupid  sex talk, but....

1712
01:26:13,613 --> 01:26:17,352
He hated it! ... It was so funny!
Oh my god.  So funny.

1713
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:21,852
Yeah, you know what, Marsha?
It's not gonna work to have you stay here.

1714
01:26:21,853 --> 01:26:25,221
Right now.
What?  Whoa?  Where's this coming from?

1715
01:26:25,222 --> 01:26:27,829
You don't like Buzzy, and
Buzzy doesn't like you,

1716
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:30,069
and I just got rid of his sister

1717
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:32,528
and that drama, and I can not
have more drama

1718
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:34,204
in my house, I'm trying to

1719
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:35,205
make my marriage work.

1720
01:26:35,206 --> 01:26:36,860
So you're taking his side in this?

1721
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:38,675
Yeah, I am, because he's my husband

1722
01:26:38,676 --> 01:26:40,124
and we're trying to work through something

1723
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,723
and I have to make that the priority.

1724
01:26:41,824 --> 01:26:42,948
Well, absolutely not!

1725
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:45,199
You know, you stayed with me when you needed a place.

1726
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,229
And now I need a place, so I'm staying!

1727
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,197
I'm staying!

1728
01:26:52,116 --> 01:26:55,487
Okay.
I'm gonna go back to bed.

1729
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,681
Okay.
You know, I'm going through a divorce!

1730
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:00,359
I have problems too, you know.

1731
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:07,377
I just took out, you know, 2000 in cash to give her.

1732
01:27:07,478 --> 01:27:09,291
Look, she's got to get back to L.A. and I don't even

1733
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:10,640
know what kind of life she's got in L.A.

1734
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:16,224
So.....better that she uh....has a little money in
her pocket when she gets home.

1735
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:19,796
Alright?   This is 2000 dollars.

1736
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:23,230
Do me a favor?  Don't
tell Katie I gave you this.

1737
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:24,619
I don't need this much.

1738
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,960
Yes, you do, alright.
It'll cover your flight

1739
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:28,358
and then if you ever decide
to come back to New York...

1740
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:31,989
your gonna to buy yourself a nice coat
before you show up here.   Alright?

1741
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,277
I remember when I was a kid, you'd

1742
01:27:37,278 --> 01:27:39,538
come home and your life was a mess

1743
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,755
How did you...how did you turn it around
and become a good guy,

1744
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:46,064
with a normal life.

1745
01:27:46,065 --> 01:27:49,046
When I was in my 20's,
I was a complete screw up too.

1746
01:27:49,047 --> 01:27:51,917
I recognized....
if I continued with that kind of behavior...

1747
01:27:51,918 --> 01:27:53,381
I was gonna end up alone.

1748
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:56,567
Alright, and I see you now,
and I see your behavior

1749
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:58,440
and the same thing is gonna happen to you.

1750
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:00,490
Because, you know, you're hurting yourself,

1751
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:02,046
And your hurting the people that care about you.

1752
01:28:02,347 --> 01:28:03,247
Like me.

1753
01:28:05,057 --> 01:28:06,985
I really fucked things up for you, didn't I?

1754
01:28:07,686 --> 01:28:09,037
A little bit, yeah!

1755
01:28:09,638 --> 01:28:12,362
But, you know,  in a weird way, um...

1756
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:16,577
A blessing in disguise.
Oh yeah.  Like how?

1757
01:28:16,578 --> 01:28:20,506
It forced me.... to reevaluate some things ...

1758
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:24,018
You know, I need to make some changes in my life.

1759
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:27,637
Yeah, maybe....maybe I feel a little guilty

1760
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:30,823
I mean, I'm her big brother and I
have no relationship with her.

1761
01:28:30,924 --> 01:28:33,744
You know.  Ah....I haven't seen her in years and....

1762
01:28:33,945 --> 01:28:37,427
I make no effort
to stay in touch, but ah...

1763
01:28:37,428 --> 01:28:39,875
I think now, what I'm gonna do is....

1764
01:28:40,076 --> 01:28:41,149
make more of an effort.

1765
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:43,356
and try and check in on her periodically

1766
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:46,257
and maybe even get out to L.A.and see her.

1767
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:58,880
You're still here.   Where's Katie?

1768
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:01,608
You know, she's still sleeping.

1769
01:29:02,945 --> 01:29:05,897
Obviously, she's very upset
about something.

1770
01:29:12,244 --> 01:29:14,276
Oh.  So you're...you're leaving?

1771
01:29:14,577 --> 01:29:17,118
You know, I had you pegged
from day one!

1772
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,119
Coward!

1773
01:29:19,453 --> 01:29:20,813
Men are cowards.

1774
01:29:21,914 --> 01:29:23,586
I think Max is a coward.

1775
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:26,155
I think uh....Katie's first husband, Dara

1776
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:27,351
was definitely a coward

1777
01:29:27,352 --> 01:29:31,543
and I ...I think Buzzy ...you know,  could be a coward too.

1778
01:29:31,644 --> 01:29:34,109
I mean, I think if things get too complicated he'll...

1779
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,288
he'll split.
And she'll be devastated.

1780
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:45,659
What are you doing?

1781
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,183
Oh, hey, you're up.

1782
01:29:47,184 --> 01:29:48,339
I um...I'm packing a bag.

1783
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,095
Why?   What's happening?

1784
01:29:50,096 --> 01:29:51,844
Hey.  Do you think you have any underwear left?

1785
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,559
Or did my sister steal everything?

1786
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:56,323
Buzzy, stop!
What...what are you're doing?

1787
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:57,510
I need to get out of town.

1788
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:59,516
And I would love it ...if you'd join me.

1789
01:29:59,617 --> 01:30:02,026
So....the car is parked outside.

1790
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,917
I can't go anywhere.
I have to work!

1791
01:30:11,634 --> 01:30:15,086
On my first thought, after I said "I do"

1792
01:30:16,091 --> 01:30:17,949
I.... wished that my parents were still alive.

1793
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:22,165
to see it.
They were at my first wedding

1794
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:23,862
which..... didn't work out.

1795
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:28,132
Ah....And I think .....I think they
would really like Buzzy.  A lot.

1796
01:30:31,244 --> 01:30:32,779
uh....My first thoughts, after we said:

1797
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,642
"I do", well, I was pregnant

1798
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:38,097
when we got married.  Um... 4 months pregnant

1799
01:30:38,098 --> 01:30:40,162
and I couldn't wait to get my dress off.

1800
01:30:40,263 --> 01:30:41,201
Me too.

1801
01:30:42,002 --> 01:30:43,835
Yeah, but not for the same reason.

1802
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:47,932
My heart was thundering, pounding.
Boom, boom, boom!

1803
01:30:48,588 --> 01:30:50,677
After I said "I do" I was genuenlly happy.

1804
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:54,127
You know, I got a...I got a great girl, she's beautiful

1805
01:30:54,528 --> 01:30:56,521
She's very different, from Linda!

1806
01:30:56,522 --> 01:30:58,695
I mean the opposite, complete opposite.

1807
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:04,744
from Linda. Responsible ...
responsible and loving ...

1808
01:31:05,588 --> 01:31:07,883
You know, my real first thought ...

1809
01:31:08,278 --> 01:31:10,855
was.... there's one more blow job I could've got.

1810
01:31:12,987 --> 01:31:16,611
I...you know...my...my whole life prior to meeting Katie

1811
01:31:16,612 --> 01:31:19,029
was always...somewhat chaotic.

1812
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:21,781
My childhood, my college years, my twenties

1813
01:31:22,382 --> 01:31:23,682
certainly my first marriage.

1814
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,880
and ... after meeting Katie

1815
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,134
a peacefulness.  Finally
entered my life.

1816
01:31:30,135 --> 01:31:32,002
So, I think the first thought I had

1817
01:31:32,003 --> 01:31:34,074
after I said "I do"

1818
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:38,424
was probably ... a sense of ...

1819
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,644
tranquility or serenity?

1820
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:42,638
You know, Katie's a rock

1821
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,339
and that is really what I needed in my life.

1822
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:50,280
I guess I finally felt...
at peace.

1823
01:32:02,515 --> 01:32:04,168
So ... Where to?

1824
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:08,987
I have no idea, but I think
we need to get as far away

1825
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:11,107
from any of our relatives as possible.

1826
01:32:12,432 --> 01:32:13,449
And then what?

1827
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:15,390
