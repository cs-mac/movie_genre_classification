Subtitle: AXIS THE SIAMESE CAT

1
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:23,905
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ’s living in China than there are people of any kind living in the
United States?

2
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,156
That can't possibly be true.

3
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:25,920
It is true.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,824
What would account for that?

5
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:27,936
Well first of all, a lot of people live
in China. But here's my question:

6
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:29,205
Question?

7
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:33,078
How do you distinguish yourself in a
population of people who all got 1600 on
their SAT's?

8
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,885
I didn't know they take SAT‘s in China.

9
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,215
They dont,I wasn't talking about China anymore, I
was talking about here.

10
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,536
You got 1600?

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,524
Yes I can sing in a Acapella group. But I cant sing.

12
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:42,914
Does that mean that you actually got
nothing wrong?

13
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:44,720
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar
PC.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,971
Or you get into a final club.

15
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:47,222
Or you get into a final club, exactly.

16
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:51,164
You know from a womans perspective sometimes not being in an Accapella group can be a good thing.

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:51,736
This is serious.

18
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:53,983
Well I am admitting I do like guys who row crew.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,241
I like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,492
Well I cant do that.

21
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,370
Im kidding.

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,012
Yes I
got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,939
Have you ever tried?

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,773
I'm trying now.

25
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:01,815
To row crew?

26
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,483
To get into a final club. To row crew?

27
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,081
No. Are you, like-—whatever--delusional?

28
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,096
Sometimes,

29
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,969
Sometimes, you say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're aiming at.

30
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,740
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

31
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,447
NO.

32
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:12,500
Okay, we1l_they’re bigger than me.

33
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,753
They're world class athletes. And a

34
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:14,953
second ago you said you like guys who row crew

35
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:16,320
crew so I assumed you'd met one.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,657
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.

37
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:19,678
The way a girl likes cowboys.

38
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:21,569
Okay.

39
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:23,247
Can we get something to eat.

40
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,641
would you rather talk about something

41
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:25,268
else?

42
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:30,490
No, it's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have missed a birthday.

43
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,420
There are more people in China with genius

44
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,639
IQ's than the entire population of»-

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,183
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt
punched the Pore.

46
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,198
Which one?

47
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,198


48
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,104
The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.

49
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,265
I actually meant which Roosevelt.

50
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:43,062
Theodore.

51
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,921
Is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party wth the next -----

52
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:49,856
You can see why its so important to get in.

53
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:51,962
Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?

54
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,047
Why would you ask me that?

55
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,527
I was just asking.

56
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,234
None of them thats the point

57
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:03,151
Our freind Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oilfutures last sumer and

58
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,589
Eduardo wont come close to gettingin. the ability to makemoney doesn't impress anybody around here.

59
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,272
Must be nice.

60
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,117
He made $300,000 in a summer?

61
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:10,916
He likes meteorology.

62
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:11,918
I thought it was oil futures.

63
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:13,630
you can read the weather you can
predict the price of heating oil.

64
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,118
I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.

65
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,575
I what...

66
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:25,220
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.

67
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:29,250
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.

68
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,544
You didnt ask which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest.

69
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,891
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask.

70
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,055
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

71
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:38,715
Erica~—

72
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:47,887
You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe
some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness,

73
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,289
Final clubs.

74
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,534
Final clubs.

75
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:54,412
and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.

76
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:55,942
Yes

77
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:57,258
there is.

78
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,464
Well you do-—that was cryptic—~so you do speak in code.

79
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:00,354
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

80
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,840
All I'm saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attentionof the clubs.

81
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,504
Why?

82
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,418
Because they“re exclusive. ' (beat) And fun and they lead to a better life.

83
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,904
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the
Phoenix Club?

84
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,754
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.

85
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,258
Well why dont you concentrate on being the best you, you can be.

86
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:19,634
Did you really just say that

87
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:20,346
I was kidding

88
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:23,230
Im just stating the fact that, does'nt make it any less.

89
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:32,388
I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the EVENTS and the Gatherings and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet .

90
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,849
You would do that for me?

91
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:37,856
Indeed

92
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:43,861
Okay I want to try and be straight forward with you and let you know that were not anymore

93
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,540
What is

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,696
Were not dating anymore, Im sorry

95
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,300
Is this a joke?

96
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,568
No,  it's not.

97
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,725
You're breaking up with me?

98
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:55,550
You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet? What the
fuck is that supposed to mean?

99
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,363
Settle down

100
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:57,229
What was it supposed to mean?

101
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,914
-Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.

102
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:12,618
The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a
friend of mine. He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long _
Island are you from——Wimbledon?

103
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,683
I'm going back to my dorm.

104
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,638
Wait is this true

105
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:16,169
Yes.

106
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,397
Then I apologize, okay?

107
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:18,023
I have to go...

108
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:18,402
Erica

109
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:18,794
Yes.

110
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,478
I'm sorry and I mean it..

111
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,116
I appreciate that but—I have to study

112
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,026
You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

113
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:24,761
I can't.

114
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:25,545
Why?

115
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,487
Because it's expausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

116
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:34,565
All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to—~currently I wasnt making acoment on your appearance——I was saying you
go to B.U. I was stating a fact thats all.

117
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,291
I have to go study.

118
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:37,556
You don't have to study.

119
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:38,702
Why do you keep saying I dont have to study

120
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:39,227
Because you go to B.U.!

121
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:43,214
Do you want to get some food?

122
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:47,701
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.

123
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,847
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.

124
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:49,850
So were even.

125
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,378
I think we should just be friends.

126
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,619
I don't want to be friends.

127
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,911
I was being polite, I had no intention ofbeing friends with you.

128
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,153
Im under some pressure right now  from my OS class.

129
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,277
If we could just order some food. I think we should

130
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:17,063
Listen. You're going to be a very succesful computer person. But you're going to go through life
thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want
you to know, from the bottom of my heart,that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole,

131
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,934
Erica Albrightls a bitch. You think
that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U. girls are bitches?

132
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:40,158
For the record, she may look like a 34C but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret. She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.False advertising.

133
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,189
The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her.

134
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,000
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

135
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

136
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:02,073
So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night?

137
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:07,015
The Kirkland facehook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.

138
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:13,341
Billy Olson's sitting here
and had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter.

139
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:15,580
Good call Mr.Olson

140
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:34,936
Yea, it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing_a number to
represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com.

141
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,017
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.

142
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:42,675
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.

143
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,588
Let
the hacking begin.

144
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:10,401
First up is Kirkland. They keep
everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little WGET magic is all that's necessary to ~download the entire Kirkland facebook.

145
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:11,499
Kids’ stuff.

146
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:35,873
Next is Elliot. They're also open but
with no indexes on Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.

147
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,657
Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.

148
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,779
Excellent.

149
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,092
Moving right along.

150
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:09,442
Lowell has some security. They require a username/password combo and I'm going to go ahead and say they don't have access
to main fas user database, so they have no way of detecting an intrusion

151
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:14,050
Adams has no security but limits the number of results  to 20 a page­

152
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,443
All I have to is breakput the same script I used on Lowell and its done

153
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,310
Quincy has no online Facebook what a sham.

154
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,599
There is nothing I can do about that

155
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:27,923
Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public directory but there's no directory at all

156
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:31,459
You have to do searches and if your search returns more then 20 matches nothing gets returned

157
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,257
Once you do get results they dont link directly to the images, they link to a php that redirects or something
Weird

158
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,120
This maybe diffucult i,ll come back later.

159
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:47,432
Leverett is a little better. Its a lenghty search but you can do an empty search and gets links to pages with a precceding picture

160
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,202
Its slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time

161
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:53,353
And theres no way I am gonna go to 500 hundred pages, to download pics 1 at a time.

162
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:56,366
So its definitely necessary to break out the emacs and modify that perl script.

163
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:14,516
Done

164
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:16,688
What's going on?

165
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:20,747
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient.

166
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:21,725
Mark

167
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:22,370
What up,

168
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:23,587
You and Erica split up?

169
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,903
How did you know that?

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,264
It's on your blog.

171
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:29,298
Oh yeah.

172
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,014
Are you alright?

173
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:30,850
I need you.

174
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,234
I'm here for you.

175
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:34,836
No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures.

176
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:35,600
Are you okay?

177
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:36,985
We're ranking girls.

178
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,638
You mean other STUDENTS

179
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:41,231
Yeah

180
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,998
You think that's such a good idea?

181
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,717
I need the algorithm?

182
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:46,245
I need the algorithm?

183
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:54,536
Give each_gir1 a base rating of 1400. At any time "Girl A" has a rating R~a and
"Girl B" has e rating R-b.

184
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,714
When any two girls are matched up there's an expectation of which will win based on
their current rating.

185
00:12:58,834 --> 00:12:59,287
Yeah

186
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,462
And Those expectations are expressed this way.

187
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:03,806
Let's write it.

188
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,705
The one on the left.

189
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:21,878
on the right.

190
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:23,835
the right.

191
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:25,841
Who should we send it to first?

192
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:26,461
Dwyer

193
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,130
Neal

194
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,276
Who are you gonna send it to?

195
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:33,246
Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to‘?

196
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,058
Hey guys check this out

197
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:07,782
The one on the left.

198
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:09,432
These girls

199
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,341
Right or Left

200
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:11,771
Left

201
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:15,949
Right or Left

202
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:17,477
Thats my roommate.

203
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:20,843
ALL On the left.

204
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,302
This isnt funny

205
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:24,328
Right

206
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:25,665
Left

207
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:27,575
Left

208
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:34,332
All night he blogged about you

209
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,910
You dont want to read this.

210
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:46,579
Erica is this yours.

211
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:49,157
I stole it from a train.

212
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:50,525
Get the hell out of here.

213
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,941
Thats an awful lot of traffic.

214
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:08,167
You think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble.

215
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:18,184
Hello

216
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,743
Wait you say

217
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:24,892
At 4 in the morning

218
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:28,210
Well there is an unusual amount of traffic which occured.

219
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,642
Your saying its unusal for 4 in the morning.

220
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,435
No this would be unusuall for half time at the superbowl.

221
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,488
Alright

222
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,144
I gotta go in.

223
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,316
Whats going on.

224
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,632
The Harvard network is about to crash.

225
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,494
You dont think.

226
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,311
I do.

227
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,104
God saves us everybody.

228
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,266
Cant connect.

229
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:07,868
The network.

230
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:11,380
Unless this a coincidence I would think this is us.

231
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,455
Its not a coincidence.

232
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,699
O shit.

233
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,571
So your called in front of the add board.

234
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,622
Thats not what happened.

235
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:23,938
You were'nt called in front of the administartive board.

236
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,826
No I was back at the bar with Erica Albright

237
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:27,827
She said all that.

238
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,546
She said all that.That I said that stuff to her.

239
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,694
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.

240
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,174
Why wold you even need to depose her.

241
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,607
Thats really for us to decide.

242
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,567
You think if I know she could make me look like a jerk I'll be more likely to

243
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:38,212
Mark dont.

244
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,694
Why dont we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that.

245
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:47,310
Its been almost 3 hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarassing Mr.Zuckerburg with the girls testimony from the bar.

246
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,173
I am not embarassed, she just made alot of that up.

247
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:50,151
She was under Oath.

248
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,610
I guess that would be the first time someone lied under oath

249
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,619
They got 2200 hits within 2 hours.

250
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:07,700
Thousands

251
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:08,400
What

252
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,731
22 Thousand

253
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,150
Those guys are really fast.

254
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:42,163
Is there anyway to make this a fair fight.

255
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,339
Jump out and swim.

256
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:46,973
We'd have to jump out and drown.

257
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,961
We are genectically identical we would stay in one place.

258
00:17:54,226 --> 00:17:55,307
just row the damn boat.

259
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,355
You hear about this?

260
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:04,746
What

261
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:09,098
Two nightss ago, a sophomore choked the network with a laptop from kirkland.

262
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:10,510
At four am

263
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,913
He set up a website were we vote the hotness of female undergrads

264
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,549
What were we doing,that none of us heard about this

265
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,387
I do not know, 3 hour technical row before breakfast

266
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:22,308
full course load studying.

267
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,820
Another 3 hours in the tank then studying.

268
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,508
Im not sure how we missed it.

269
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,811
How much activity was on this thing.

270
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,440
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

271
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,196
Twenty-two thousand

272
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:33,598
This is half of facebook, 7 houses

273
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,754
He developed the site in 1 night and he did it while he was drunk.

274
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:37,708
Twenty-two thousand

275
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:39,757
How do you know he was drunk

276
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,284
He was blogging, while doing this.

277
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:43,568
Know what it think

278
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:44,815
Way ahead of you.

279
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,457
This is our guy.

280
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:53,695
Cameron Worth, WINKLEVOSS, Cameron spelt the usuall way.

281
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:58,902
Taylor WINKLEVOSS, Taylor spelt the usuall way. My last nameis the same as my brother

282
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,692
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative board hearing.

283
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:09,224
Your being accused of intentionally breaching security Violating copyright, Violating individual privacy

284
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:13,090
By creating the website WWW.FACEMASH.COM

285
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,053
You also charged with being in  violation of universty policy on distribution of digitsed images.

286
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:22,237
Before we begin with our questioning, your allowed to make a statement, Would you like to do so?

287
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:30,415
Uh ... ... I have already apologised in the Crimson,to the AVHW

288
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:35,504
To"Harvard Latino Women's Association," and to any women at harvard who might have been insulted, as I take that they were'

289
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,423
As for any charges stemming from the breach of security

290
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,966
I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

291
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:45,504
Im sorry

292
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,643
I dont understand.

293
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:49,215
Which part?

294
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:51,633
You deserve recognition.

295
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,929
I believe I pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system.

296
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:56,596
Scuse me may I.

297
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:03,088
Mr. Zuckerberg. Im in charge of security for all computers on the  Harvard network.

298
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,537
I can assure you of its sophistication

299
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:09,469
In fact it was that level of sophistication, that led us to you in less then 4 hours.

300
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:10,284
- Four hours?

301
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:11,047
Yes sir.

302
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,674
That would be impressive except if youd known what you are looking for you would seen it written on my dorm room window.

303
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,676
So six months Academic probation.

304
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:27,336
Wow,they had to make an example out of you.

305
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,099
They have my blog

306
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:31,257
I should have written nothing about the farm animals,that was stupid.

307
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:34,527
I was kidding for gods sake doesnt anybody have a sense of humor

308
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,282
- I tried to stop you

309
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:37,491
- I know

310
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:41,054
How do you do this thing were you manage to get all girls to hate us

311
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,250
Why do I love China:

312
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,353
OK Lets look at a sample problem

313
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:53,945
Suppose were given a computer a 16 bit virtual address, and a page size of 256-bytes.

314
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:58,991
The System uses a one level page table that starts at address 0x0400

315
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:02,478
Maybe you want dna on your 16-bit system who knows.

316
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:06,263
The first few pages are reserved for the hardware flag etc..

317
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:09,202
assume page table ENTRIES HAVE 8 STATUS BITS

318
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,671
Eight-bit status code will then be ...

319
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,239
Ah I see we have our first surrender

320
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,960
Dont worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men then you have tried and failed this class

321
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,312
One valid bit, One modified bit, One reference bit, 5 permission bit

322
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,357
That is correct

323
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,864
Does evrybody see how he got there

324
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:38,403
Mark?

325
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,075

We should

338
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,147

356
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:32,509
Hi

357
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,024
Were really impressed with"Facemash"

358
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,786
We checked you out., you also built"CourseMatch"

359
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:37,728
What is "CourseMatch"

360
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:39,993
You go online and see what courses your freinds are taking.

361
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,304
Really harmless.

362
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:45,007
- Mark?

363
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:45,593
- Yeah?

364
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:46,954
We were talking about "CourseMatch"

365
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,326
Kind of a no brainer.

366
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:52,579
you --- in high school to right?

367
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:56,219
Asked for an MP3 player, that recognises your taste in music.

368
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:57,746
Any body try to buy it?

369
00:22:58,778 --> 00:22:59,554
Microsoft

370
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,768
How much?

371
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,766
Didnt sell it, I uploaded for free.

372
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:04,606
- For free?

373
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:04,899
- Yeah

374
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,286
Why?

375
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:13,995
OK well we have something we have been working on for a while idea. We think its great It is called "the Harvard network"

376
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:16,795
You can create your own page, interests, bios, freinds

377
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,500
Then people can go online and see your bio.

378
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:19,723
Requests ... ...

379
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,230
Yeah How is that different then  "My Space" and "Freindster"

380
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,459
Harvard. Edu

381
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,017
Were going to use the most prestigious e-mail in the country.

382
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:32,065
Based on the idea that girls ...

383
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,845
Girls want to only go out with guys who go to Harvard.

384
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:38,341
Me and my brother dont have trouble getting ...

385
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:43,482
Basically what were talking about is MYSPACE, FREINDSTER any of those other social networking sites.

386
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:44,660
Its exclusivity.

387
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:46,404
Right.

388
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,816
Right.

389
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:49,572
Yeah wed love for you to work with us Mark.

390
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:51,586
We need a programmer who is creative.

391
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,329
And we know who can take the initiative.

392
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:59,259
This could help rehabilitate your image.

393
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,798
Wow you would do that for me.

394
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:05,794
WE'd like to work with you.

395
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:08,670
Our first program  graduated and went to work for Google.

396
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,236
Our second programer is overwhelmed with school work.

397
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:14,837
We would need you to build the site, write thwe code we will provide ...

398
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:15,193
Im in

399
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:17,918

400
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:20,346
Im in

401
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,911
Awsome

402
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:23,515
Thats what you said?

403
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:26,734
It was three or four years ago, I dont know what I said.

404
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,541
When did you come to Eduardo?

405
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:30,329
I dont understand that question.

406
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,199
You remeber answering in the affirmative.

407
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:33,994
the affirmative.

408
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,691
When I did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook.

409
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,575
It was called"TheFacebook"then.

410
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,484
This doesnt need to be that diffucult.

411
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:43,245
Im currently in the middle of two different lawsuits

412
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,518
Did you answer affirmatively?

413
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:49,023
When Taylor and Cameron Winklevoss Did in November ask you to build, "Harvard Connection,"

414
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:50,992
Did you say yes?

415
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,258
I said I'd help.

416
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:56,808
When did you approach Mr. Savarin with the idea for the FACEBOOK

417
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,373
I wouldnt say I approached him.

418
00:24:58,493 --> 00:24:59,060
SY?

419
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,626
You can answer the question

420
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:03,066
At a party at ALPHA EPSILON PI.

421
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,109
Whats that

422
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:05,967
JewishFraternity

423
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,760
It was Caribbean  night.

424
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:29,327
Why are guys like me generally attracted to Asian girls

425
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,592
But  Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me

426
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:34,942
I dont know if an algorithm could find the connection to you

427
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,106
Its not that complicated there hot, there smart, they are not Jewish, they cant dance.

428
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:43,497
Hey Mark is here!

429
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,540
Mark

430
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,024
I think ive come up with something

431
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:00,793
I have to tell you something your not going to believe

432
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:01,620
Come on

433
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,709
I got pinched by the "Phoenix Club"

434
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,432
Are you kidding?

435
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,232
Its the first in a 4 step process

436
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,838
Send the invitation on monday

437
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:13,981
My first puch party tommorow

438
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:16,717
You got pinched by the "Phoenix

439
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:24,193
What did you want to talk to me about.

440
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:27,731
Mark you said you come up with something.

441
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:30,238
Yeah Ive think I come up with something.Come outside.

442
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,243
20 degrees outside

443
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:36,088
I cant stair at that thing NIAGRA FALLS, it has nothing to do with the Carribean

444
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:49,962
People came to "Facemash"-----, right?

445
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,402
It wasnt because hey saw pictures of hot girls

446
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,311
You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.

447
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:57,696
Because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

448
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:03,513
People want to go on the internet ot check out their freinds so why not build a web site that offers them freinds, pictures, profiles

449
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:07,443
whatever you can visit just browse around, maybe someone you just met at a party

450
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:09,682
Im not talking aboput a dating site.

451
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,584
Im talking about taking the entire social experience of college.

452
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:15,200
And putting it online.

453
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:16,574
Cant feel my legs.

454
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:17,071
I know.

455
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,367
Im totally psyched about this to Eduardo.

456
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,268
"It would be exclusive."

457
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:26,336
You would have to know the people on the site to get past your own page like.

458
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:27,685
Getting pinched.

459
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:29,220
Thats good

460
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,923
Its like "Final Club", but were president/

461
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,119
I told him I thought it sounded great,

462
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:36,867
was a great idea

463
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:41,383
There was nothing to hack people were gonna provide their own pictures,their own information.

464
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:46,384
And people would have the ability to invite or not invite their freinds to join.

465
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:50,168
In a world were social strucrure was everything.

466
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:52,560
That was the thing.

467
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:57,698
It was a big project, and he was going to have to write 10s of thousands lines of code.

468
00:27:57,818 --> 00:28:00,422
So I was wondering why he was coming to me and not his roomates.

469
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,995
Dustin Moscovitz, Chris Hughes they were programmers.

470
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,707
Were gonna need a little start up cash to rent a server to get it online.

471
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,541
So that was why.

472
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:09,894
Did he offer terms.

473
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:12,435
Well split it 70/30.

474
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:16,710
70 for me 30 for you for putting up the 1000 dollars and for handling everything on the business end.

475
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,507
Youe CFO

476
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:18,784
And you said.

477
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:19,821
I said, "lets do it"

478
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:22,691
OK did he add anything else?

479
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,617
YES

480
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:29,219
It probably was a diversity thing

481
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:31,963
So what.

482
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:33,969
Why you think he said that?

483
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,295
Gretchen, excuse me for interupting, whos discovery is this.

484
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,938
SY, if you let me continue with my line of questioning.

485
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:44,299
They are suggesting that I was jealous of jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the PHOENIX
And began a plan to screw him out of a company that I had'nt even invent yet.

486
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:44,880
Were you.

487
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,171
Gretchen!

488
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,233
- Jealous of Eduardo?

489
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,518
Stop typing were all...

490
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:50,524
I know you've done your homework and know money is not a big part of my life.

491
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:54,971
But at the moment I could buy Mount Auburn street, take the PHOENIX club and turn it into my PING-PONG room.

492
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,754
I'll let you know how the party ends.

493
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,214
We recognise thatYour A plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook

494
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,805
And a witness in another.

495
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:13,626
Yes, sir

496
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:16,724
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark telling you his idea

497
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:21,701
Did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,Cameron Winklevoss,
Dedre revedra or HARVARD CONNECTION

498
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:22,371
Yes,

499
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,471
He said they asked him to work on their site.

500
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:28,349
But that he looked at what they had and decided it wasnt worth his time.

501
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:32,512
He said even his most pathetic freinds, knew about getting people interested

502
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,091
in the website
then these guys.

503
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:36,061
These guys means my clients

504
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:36,705
Yes

505
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:39,057
Yes he resented, Mark resented that

506
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,973
they your clients that he thought that he needed to rehabilitate his image after FACEMASH

507
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:45,740
Mark didnt want to rehabilitate anything with FACEMASH

508
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:49,241
Hacked into the Harvard computers, he blew his nose at the add-board.

509
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,816
He got alot of notoriety
FACEMASH did exactly what he wanted to do.

510
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:57,700
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was buliding the"TheFacebook"
He was also communictaing wth the plaintiffs

511
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,431
Not at the time I wasnt

512
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,514
It really did not have much to do with the Winklevoss dating site

513
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,003
How would you know, you were'nt even there.

514
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,271
Were you aware that while  Mr. Zuckerberg was building the "TheFacebook"

515
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,275
He was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building "the Harvard Connection

516
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,285
Conclusion not found in evidence

517
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:17,487
We are about to find this new evidence.

518
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:25,887
From Mark Zujerburg to Tyler Winklevoss November 30, 2003, I read over all the stuff you sent me RE: HARVARD CONNECTION

519
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,479
and it seems like it should'nt take to long to implement

520
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,122
so we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tommorrow night

521
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:38,074
From Mark Zujerburg to Tyler Winklevoss December 1, 2003

522
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,819
sorry I was unreachable tonight

523
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:44,044
I just got about  3 of your missed calls, I was working on a problem then my system collapsed.

524
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:49,059
From Mark Zujerburg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss December 10, 2003

525
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:52,282
this week has  been pretty busy,between HARVARD, classes and work."

526
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,687
So I think its probably best to postpone the meeting.

527
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,092
Im also really busy tommorow

528
00:30:57,212 --> 00:31:00,337
OK anybody else feel like there is somethin up with this guy

529
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,167
Tell him OK.

530
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:05,208
But we do have to make sure we all meet up before we go off for break.

531
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:07,009
I know, I know.

532
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:07,709
Yeah watch out.

533
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,339
Hey Mark...

534
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:43,673
I need a dedicated LINUX box
running APACHE with------backend

535
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,175
Its gonna cost a little more money.

536
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:45,849
How much more.

537
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,956
About 200 hundred more

538
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,356
Do we need it.

539
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:50,647
Its gotta handle the traffic.

540
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:53,993
Do it.

541
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:54,821
I already did.

542
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,751
Hey guess what

543
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:03,689

544
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:05,674
Thats good.

545
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,741
You should be proud of that right there, dont worry if you dont make it any further.

546
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,623
I'll get out of here.

547
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,512
From Mark Zuckerburg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss

548
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:19,784

I have a CS problem set that I am just getting started with and it should be about 15 hours of coding so I'll be busy tommorow night.

551
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,320

552
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,894
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

553
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:36,070
I've basically been in the lab this whole time.

554
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,148
And I also wont be able to do staurday as I have to meet up with my parents.

555
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,451
As the plaque reads "John Harvard"

556
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,352
Founder of HARVARD UNIVERSITY
in 1638.

557
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,350
Some call this the statue of 3 lies.

558
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:55,426
What are the 3 lies?

559
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:57,233
MR.Dowd

560
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,523
3 lies, first.

561
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,101
Shit

562
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:01,941
Take yor pants off.

563
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:02,654
OH No

564
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,084
AH Mr.Sabourin

565
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:07,729
1 - Harvard was founded in 1636.

566
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:08,811
Not 1638

567
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:11,471
2 - Hravard was not founded by John Harvard.

568
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:12,985
3 - That is not John Harvard.

569
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:13,825
Who is it.

570
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:18,631
Freind of the scupture Daniel Chester.

571
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:20,693
Keep your jacket on.

572
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:28,143
39 days after Mr.Zucermans initial meeting with my clients.

573
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:30,942
And he still has'nt completed work on HARVARD CONNECTION.

574
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:34,442
But on Jan 11 2004

575
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:41,105
Mr.Zuckerburg registered the domain name the FACEBOOK, by network soloutions.

576
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:45,991
To the best of your Knowledge had he even begun work on HARVARD CONNECTION.

577
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,790
Not to my knowledge.

578
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,325
NO

579
00:33:57,123 --> 00:34:02,429
Hey Cameron Im still a little sceptical that we have enough fuctionality in the site to really draw the attention

580
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,812
and to gain the criticla mass neccessary to get a site like this to run.

581
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:08,739
Will speak soon.

582
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:13,570
This is the 1st time he mentioned any problems.

583
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,270
Yes it was.

584
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:16,306
You sent 36 e-mails

585
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:17,286
To Mr.Zuckberg

586
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:19,244
And received 16 e-mails in return

587
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:22,030
And this is the 1st time he indicated he was not happy.

588
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,845
Thats correct.

589
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:25,721
he had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead ...

590
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,553
Do you see any of your code on Facebook,

591
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:29,605
Did I use any of your code?

592
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:31,653
You stole our whole godamn idea!

593
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:32,086
Fellas

594
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:35,363
- Hows dot com site used? - Can I continue with my deposition?

595
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:38,009
You know you really dont need a forensic team to get to the bottom of this

596
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:40,224
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

597
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,723
you invented FACEBOOK

598
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,757
I cant wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check

599
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:47,966
Bullshit

677

00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:54,711
Welcome to the "TheFacebook"

696
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:55,003
"TheFacebook"

697
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:58,032
, is an online directory to connect with different social networks

698
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:00,942
Must have an Harvard .EDU adress to register

699
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:01,731
Thats right , yes sir

700
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:03,984
I called earlier. Im looking for Mark Zuckerberg

701
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:06,363
Yes, sir he actually quoted----

702
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:06,707

703
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,087
Everyone is talking alot about
Universal FACEBOOK withing HARVARD

704
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:10,626
Meaning what

705
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:14,088
I think its knd of silly that it would take the universty a couple of years to get around to it

706
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,971
I can do a classier job then they can

707
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:16,747
and I gave

708
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:26,208
As of yesterday evening"Zuckerberg said that over 650 students registered to use the Facebook.com,

709
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:29,326
He said that he  anticipated 900 would join by this morning

710
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:32,993
Yes,he was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the 1st day

711
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:37,318
God If I was a drug dealer, I could not give free drugs to  650 people in a day

712
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,586
This guy doesnt have 3 freinds to rub together

713
00:40:39,706 --> 00:40:40,528
to make a fourth

714
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,717
Allright yes thts what well do Mr.Hotchkiss

715
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:44,155
well put it all together and well e-mail it to you

716
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:46,609
You wont be able to go on the web site yourself

717
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:49,841
Because you dont have a ... Harvard ...

718
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,884
You know it would just be easier for us to email it to you

719
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:56,275
Im sure You're right, he is a good guy and hes very bright and Im sure he didnt mean to...

720
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:56,898
WOW

721
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:58,620
What he did

722
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:02,018
Well thank you very much and dad...

723
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,934
Id like to

724
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:03,927
This is a good guy?

725
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,250
We dont know that hes not a good guy

726
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:06,497
We know he stole our idea

727
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:07,553
We know lied to our faces ...

728
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:08,313
for a month and a half ...

729
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,445
NO..He never lied to our face

730
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:11,914
OK he never saw our faces fine. he lied through our e-mail accounts

731
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,077
And he gave himself a  42 day head start

732
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,101
Because he knows and apparently you dont

733
00:41:16,102 --> 00:41:17,895
Which is that getting there first is everything

734
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:21,754
Im a competitve racer dave I dont think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first

735
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:22,213
THANK-YOU

736
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:22,722
ALL RIGHT

737
00:41:22,723 --> 00:41:24,070
That was your father's lawyer?

738
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,948
He is our counsel

739
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:28,164
He is going to look at all this and if he thinks its appropriate, hes going to send a cease and desist letter

740
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:28,712
Whats that gonna do

741
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,646
What you want to hire an IP  lawyer and sue him?

742
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:33,967
No, I want to hire the SOPRANOS to beat the shit out of him with a hammer

743
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:34,705
- We dont have to do that

744
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,252
Thats right

745
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,307
We can do that ourselves

746
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,521
I m 6.5 220 and theres 2 of us

747
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:42,097
Well whatever Im saying lets calm down until we know what were talking about

748
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,311
How much more information are you waiting for

749
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:47,162
We met with Mark 3 times, we exchanged 52 e-mails

750
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:48,511
we can prove that he looked at the code

751
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:50,420
What is that on the bottom of the page

752
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:51,606
Mark Zuckerberg production

753
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:52,790
On the home page?

754
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,795
On every page.

755
00:41:57,784 --> 00:42:05,190
They wrote Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy option would help restore his reputation following student out rage over Facemash.com outrage committed after

756
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,616
Exactly what we said to him

757
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:08,845
- Hes giving us the finger in the Crimson

758
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:12,955
While we are waiting for dads lawyer to look this stuff over we can get something going in the paper

759
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:13,075
NO

760
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:15,590
People know that this is in dispute

761
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,436
Were not starting a knife fight in the Crimson

762
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:19,038
Were not suing

763
00:42:19,432 --> 00:42:20,272
Why not

764
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,926
Again Why not

765
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:26,674
Hes gonna say  stupid

766
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:28,621
Me?

767
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,244
Say it, why not?

768
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,705
Because we are gentlemen of Harvard

769
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:38,261
This is Harvard, were you dont plant stories, and you dont sue people

770
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,647
You thought he was goona be the only one that thought that was stupid?

771
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,093
During the time when you say you had this idea

772
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:48,644
Did you know Tylor and Cameron, came for a family of means?

773
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,654
A Family of means?

774
00:42:50,774 --> 00:42:52,334
Did you know their father was wealthy?

775
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,086
I not sure why your asking me that

776
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,364
Its not important that you be sure why I am asking

777
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:58,344
Not important to you

778
00:42:58,624 --> 00:42:59,336
CY

779
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,085
Did you know that they came from money?

780
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,581
I had no idea weather they came from money or not

781
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:09,963
In one of your lead ups Mr. Narendra, you refernced Howard Winklevoss consulting firm

782
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:10,791
If you say so

783
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:14,852
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions

784
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:19,944
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members of the Harvard finals club called THE PERCILLE

785
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,089
You pointed that out

786
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,476
Excuse us for inviting you in

787
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:23,440
To the bike room

788
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:27,539
So its safe to say that you were aware that my clients had money

789
00:43:29,593 --> 00:43:29,987
YES

790
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:34,150
Let me tell you why I am asking,
Im wondering why if you knew you needed a thousand dollars

791
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:36,733
for an internet venture you didnt ask my clients for

792
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:39,533
they had demnstrated an interest inthat kind of thing.

793
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,387
I asked my best friend for the money because thats who I wanted to be partners with

794
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:46,993
Eduardo was the President of the Harvard Investers Association, and he was also my best friend

795
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:51,524
Your best friendis suing you for  six hundred million dollars

796
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,962
I didnt know that tell me more

797
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,563
Eduardo,what happened after the initial launch?

798
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:59,252
Im Sorry CY, would you mind adrssing him as Mr. Savarin?

799
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,308
Gretchen their best freinds

800
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:00,970
Not anymore

801
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,993
We  already went through this never mind ...

802
00:44:03,113 --> 00:44:05,807
Mr. Savarin, what happened after the initial launch

803
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:06,787
It exploded

804
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:11,755
Every body on Campus Facebook me has become a common expression

805
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,402
And ah Mark?

806
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,502
And Mark was the biggest thing on campus?

807
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,672
That included 19 Nobel laureates and 15 Pulitzer Prize winners

808
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:23,019
Two future Olympians,and a movie star

809
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:24,381
Who is the movie star?

810
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:25,742
Doesnt matter?

811
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:12,446
Mark

812
00:45:13,553 --> 00:45:15,144
Your friend, is Mark Zuckerberg ?

813
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:16,416
Yeah

814
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:17,667
He made the"Facebook"?

815
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,570
Yeah

816
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:26,447
Cool. I am a Christy, this is Alice

817
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,745
Nice to meet you

818
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,079
maybe we can go out get a drink

819
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:35,255
Yeah Certainly,

820
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:47,136
Because, first, she said on the Facebook to find her. The second is that we can all go out for a drink

821
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:48,281
This is so great

822
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:48,905
For 2 reasons

823
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:51,119
1 cause she likes FACEBOOK and the other

824
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:52,519
They want to have drinks later

825
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,924
Have you ever heard so many good things packed into one regular sized sentence

826
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:56,852
Excuse me,Mark?

827
00:45:58,303 --> 00:45:58,621
Yeah

828
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:01,484
I am Stewart • Singer im in your OS class

829
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:02,390
SURE

830
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:04,630
Awsome job with the Facebook

831
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:04,960
Awsome

832
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:06,322
Thanks

833
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:07,200
I'm Bob

834
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,867
How are you doing?

835
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:10,127
You know, I can swear he was looking at you

836
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,460
When he said "the next Bill Gates could be right in this room

837
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:14,229
I doubt it

838
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,748
I showed up late I didnt even know who the speaker was

839
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,651
Bill Gates

840
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:22,552
Shit that makes sense

841
00:46:24,436 --> 00:46:25,594
allright thanks guys

842
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,176
You want to walk

843
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:41,133
What were their names?

844
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,303
You hear what I just said?

845
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:42,711
What

846
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,308
I said its time to modify the site

847
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:47,408
What does that mean?

848
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:50,348
It means, its time for the web site generate revenue

849
00:46:50,468 --> 00:46:52,396
I know  the word, I am asking is how you want to do it

850
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:54,629
- Advertising

851
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:55,368
NO

852
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,600
Well we got 4000 members

853
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,821
Because Facebook is a cool

854
00:46:59,822 --> 00:47:02,150
And if we start selling pop-ups for Mountain Dew

855
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:03,622
Well I wasnt thinking mountain DEW Mountain Dew, but

856
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,663
but at some point I am talking as the business end of the company

857
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,417
We dont even know what it is yet

858
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,384
what it is

859
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:13,852
We dont know what it can be, We dont know what it will be,
We know that its cool

860
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:16,817
that is a priceless asset Im not giving up

861
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:17,860
So when will it be finished

862
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,878
It wont be finished

863
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:21,156
Thats the point, the way fashion never finishes

864
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:21,767
fashion

865
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,963
fashion is never finished

866
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:24,757
Your talking about fashion?
Really you

867
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,430
I m talking about the idea and Im saying that its never finished

868
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:30,535
OK they manage to make money selling pantsl

869
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:33,329
Mark, What is this?

870
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:34,309
A what

871
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,069
This

872
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,902
Its called a Cease and Desist letter?

873
00:47:36,903 --> 00:47:37,602
What were their names

874
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:37,920
Who

875
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,531
the Girls

876
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,552
When did you get this?

877
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,021
About ten days ago,right after we launched the site.

878
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:43,688
Hey, the girls

879
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:44,324
What were their name?

880
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:47,518
It says the Winklevoss twins are saying that you stole their ideas

881
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,670
I find that to be a little more then mildly annoying

882
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:52,088
They find it to be intellectual property theft

883
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,625
Why didnt you show this to me?

884
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:55,986
It was adressed to me

885
00:47:55,987 --> 00:47:59,486
Their saying we stole the Facebook
from David Neandra and the Winklvoss twins

886
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,084
I know what it says

887
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:00,758
Did we

888
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:02,412
Did we what

889
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,367
Dont screw around with me now

890
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:04,283
Look at me

891
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:06,434
The letter said we could face legal action

892
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:08,190
No, it says I could face legal action

893
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,608
This from a lawyer, Mark, they must feel they have some grounds

894
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:12,822
The Lawyer is their fathers house counsel

895
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:13,382
Do they have grounds?

896
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:16,585
The grounds are our thing is cool, and popular, and"Harvard Connection" is lame

897
00:48:16,586 --> 00:48:20,262
Euardo I didnt use any of their code I promiise I didnt use anything

898
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:23,597
Look a guy who builds a nice chair doesnt owe money to everyone whos ever built a a chair

899
00:48:23,598 --> 00:48:25,837
Look they came to me with an idea...I had a better one.

900
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:26,983
Why dont you show me this letter?

901
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:28,141
I didnt think it was a big deal

902
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,452
Is there something wrong

903
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,762
If theres ever anything wrong

904
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,060
You can  tell me

905
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:40,435
Im the guy that wants to help

906
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:41,630
This is our thing

907
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:45,371
Now is there anything you need to tell me?

908
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:46,173
No

909
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,676
What are we doing about this?

910
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:55,150
I went to 3L Student Legal Services, and they told me to write them back

911
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:56,105
And what did you say?

912
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,471
When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site.

913
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:03,187
were it stood with grpahics, how much programming was left that I had not anticipated.

914
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:08,822
lack of hardware , we had website use and promotion and the to go on to  successfuly launch the web site.

915
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:12,708
This is your first time to you raised any of those concerns right

916
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:14,176
I raised concerns before

917
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:15,169
BULLSHIT

918
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,416
that's all gentlemen

919
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:20,102
Im talking about the metting in January to which this letter is refering

920
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:20,650
Yeah

921
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:22,370
Let me rephrase this

922
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,148
You sent  my client sent 16 emails

923
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:27,900
The first 15, you didnt raise any concerns

924
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,046
Is that a question?

925
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:32,629
In the 16th email you raised concerns about site functionality

926
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:35,126
Were you leading them on for six weeks

927
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:35,495
No

928
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:38,463
Then why didnt you raise any of these concerns before ...

929
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:39,689
Its raining

930
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:40,517
Im sorry

931
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:41,536
It just started Raining

932
00:49:41,656 --> 00:49:44,810
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention

933
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:46,656
No

934
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,471
Do you think I deserve it?

935
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:50,580
What

936
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,987
Do you think I deserve your full attention

937
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,767
I had to swear an oath before I began this deposition and I dont want to perjure myself

938
00:49:57,768 --> 00:49:59,563
so I have a legal obligation to say no

939
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:00,710
OK no

940
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:03,626
You dont think I deserve your attention

941
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,448
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders

942
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,461
and call themselves tall, they have a right to

943
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,066
but there is no requirement that I enjoy sitting here, listening to people lie.

944
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:14,884
You have part of my attention you have the minimum amount.

945
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,196
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of FACEBOOK

946
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:21,942
Were my colleagues and I are doing thing that no one in this room including and especially your clients

947
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:24,429
are intellectually or creatively capable of doing

948
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:29,511
Does that adequately answer your condascending question?

949
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:40,093
I have 12:45, why dont we say thats lunch

950
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:42,847
Back at Two thirty

951
00:50:44,248 --> 00:50:45,828
So, What' were their names

952
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,057
Their names were Christie and Alice

953
00:50:52,304 --> 00:50:55,335
And they want to have drinks tonight

954
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:50,140
Hey man sorry, a couple of girls are freshening up in there

955
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,051
OK

956
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,040
We GOT A QUICKIE

957
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,083
I'll be right back

958
00:52:08,203 --> 00:52:09,051
Where are you going?

959
00:52:15,459 --> 00:52:16,007
Erica?

960
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:19,124
Hi

961
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:21,264
I saw you from over there, I did'nt know you came to this pub

962
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:22,627
first time

963
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:25,850
Mine too, can I talk to you alone for a secound?

964
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:28,585
I think Im good right here

965
00:52:28,903 --> 00:52:29,209
I just

966
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:31,579
I love to talk to you alone

967
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,394
If we could talk outside

968
00:52:32,514 --> 00:52:33,311
Right here is fine

969
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:36,534
I dont know if you heard about this new website I launched?

970
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,133
No

971
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:38,948
The Facebook?

972
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:41,037
You called me bitch on the Internet, Mark

973
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,820
Thats why I wanted to talk to you

974
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:43,801
On the Internet

975
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:45,381
That is why I came over

976
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:47,126
Comparing women to farm animals?

977
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,782
I did'nt end up doing that

978
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:50,565
Did'nt stop you from writing it.

979
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:53,877
Its as if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever

980
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:55,763
It would be a crime for it not to be shared

981
00:52:57,346 --> 00:52:59,244
The internets not written in pencil Mark

982
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:00,084
Its  written in ink

983
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:02,938
And you published "Erika • Albright" is a bitch

984
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:06,096
Right before you made an ignorant crack about my families name

985
00:53:06,108 --> 00:53:09,395
And Bra size,then rated women based on their flattness

986
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,497
Erica is there a problem

987
00:53:11,617 --> 00:53:12,603
No theres no problem

988
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:15,852
You right your snyde bullshit in a dark room

989
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,055
because thats what you need now a days

990
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:20,495
It was nice to see you

991
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,164
Dont torture me for it

992
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:23,170
If we could just go somewhere for a minute

993
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,043
I do not want to be rude to my friends

994
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:28,457
OK

995
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,280
Good luck with your video games

996
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:35,974
Yeah that was great, that was the right thing to do you apologised right

997
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,362
We have to expand

998
00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:41,649
Tommorow

999
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,509
Is he mad about something

1000
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:49,585
OK we are expanding to to Yale and Columbia

1001
00:53:49,586 --> 00:53:52,962
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me Chris, you are in charge of publicity and outreach

1002
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,153
and you can start by getting us a story in the BSU newspaper

1003
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:55,841
The Bridge

1004
00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:57,829
They hate doing stories about Harvard

1005
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,073
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major tell him

1006
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,984
Mark Zuckerberg will do ten hours of free programming

1007
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,844
Why do you want a story in the BU newspaper?

1008
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:04,596
Because I do

1009
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:05,386
Now heres the arrangement

1010
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:07,475
Eduardo is CFO, owns 30% of the company

1011
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:11,335
Dustin is a vice president and head of programming ,and his 5% of the company will come from my end

1012
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:15,730
Chris is director of publicity, and his compenstaion will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing

1013
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:16,729
Any Questions?

1014
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:17,354
Who are these girls?

1015
00:54:18,857 --> 00:54:20,105

Nothing

1023
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:27,359

00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:25,506
I dont hate anybody

1044
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:30,062
The Winklevai are suing me for intellectual property theft

1045
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:32,406
Their suing me because for the first time in their lives

1046

- I want to hire a lawyer to file for injuctif realeasing it, the site taken down now.

1054
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:59,201
Every minute the site is up HARVARD CONNECTION becomes less valuable

1055
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:02,150
I want an injuction I want damages I want punitive release

1056

Then why are'nt we doing anything about it

1059
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,195
Because we are a gentleman at Harvard?

1060
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:08,533
Because your not thinking about how its gonna look

1061
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:09,501
hows it gonna look

1062
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:13,651
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the karate kid around a high school gym

1063
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:14,084
Cam

1064
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,447
He has violated Maasachusets state law

1065
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:20,568
He goes to Connecticut, New York and to California he will have violated federal law

1066
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:22,951
By the way hes in violation of Harvard law

1067
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:24,862
Theres no such thing as HARVARD law

1068
00:56:25,613 --> 00:56:25,919
YEAH

1069
00:56:26,722 --> 00:56:27,779

Harvard student hand book

1071
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:35,044
Every freshman is issued one of these

1072
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:37,872
Some where in this book it says you cant steal from another student

1073
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:40,827
This is what we need

1074
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,097
You cant get a meeting with Larry Summers

1075
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:45,689
My brother and I we pay tuition at this school

1129
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:36,199
I just slept with Sean • Parker?

1130
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,313
You just slept on Sean • Parker?

1131
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:39,740
Your a billionaire

1132
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:40,787
not technically

1133
00:58:40,907 --> 00:58:41,539
What are you

1134
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:43,577
broke

1135
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:47,781
Thers not a lot of money in free music and even less if your being sued by anyone whos won a grammy

1136
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,743
This is blowing my mind

1137
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:50,892
I appreciate that

1138
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,790
I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class

1139
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,650
Even though your a french major whos name is amy

1140
00:58:58,365 --> 00:58:59,397
Im a hard worker

1141
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:04,760
Theres juice theres anything else you can find, help yourself

1142
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:06,301
Mind if I check my e-mail

1143
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:07,652
Yeah go ahead

1144
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:18,571
AMY

1145
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:23,208
AMY

1146
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:25,017
Can you come out here

1147
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:26,890
Just a secound

1148
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,083
There a snake in here, Amy

1149
00:59:32,084 --> 00:59:32,682
What?

1150
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:36,236
Where

1151
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:37,943
OK there is no snake but I need to ask you something

1152
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,411
Are you kidding me I could have been killed

1153
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:40,959
How

1154
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:41,545
By

1155
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:42,717
Running too fast

1156
00:59:42,837 --> 00:59:45,507
And getting twisted in the curtain

1157
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:46,628
What do you need to ask me?

1158
00:59:46,629 --> 00:59:49,456
I went to check my e-mail and theres a website open on your computer

1159
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:54,719
Yeah after you passed out last night I went on the Facebook for abit

1160
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,241
Whats that?

1161
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:56,247
The Facebook?

1162
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:59,356
STANFORD'S had it for like 2 weeks now

1163
00:59:59,357 --> 01:00:02,737
Its really awsome, freakishly addictive

1164
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,464
seriously Im on the thing like 5 times a day

1165
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:06,852
Mind if I send myself an e-mail

1166
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,495
Yeah is everything  okay

1167
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:09,616
Everythings great

1168
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:15,690
I just need to find you Mark Zuckerberg

1169
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:20,747
Ever been in this building before

1170
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,783
This buildings a hundred years older then the country its in.

1171
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:25,324
So do be careful

1172
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:28,246
Were sitting in chairs

1173
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:29,620
YES

1174
01:00:31,229 --> 01:00:31,839
Very good

1175
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:33,863
You can go in now

1176
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,262
Catherine, Ive got students now,

1177
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:48,159
students

1178
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,533
undergrads

1179
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,681
dont know,from the looks of it they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers suit

1180
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:56,387
Good morning

1181
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:57,074
Good morning, sir

1182
01:00:57,075 --> 01:00:58,843
I'm Cameron • Winklevoss, this is my brother Tyle

1183
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,905
Are you here because?

1184
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:05,111
I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter

1185
01:01:05,112 --> 01:01:06,027
read the letter

1186
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:06,972
well

1187
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:09,657
we came up with an idea for a website called "Harvard Connection"

1188
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:11,833
we've since changed the name to CONNECTU

1189
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:13,500
• and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and

1190
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:14,111
I understand

1191
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,528
and Im asking what you want me to do about it?

1192
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:17,610
Well sir

1193
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:21,152
In the HARVARD student handbook which is distributed to each freshman

1194
01:01:21,272 --> 01:01:23,837
Under the heading standars of conduct in the HARVARD comunity

1195
01:01:23,957 --> 01:01:26,522
it says the college expects all the students to be honest

1196
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:29,245
and forthcoming in their dealings with members in the community

1197
01:01:29,716 --> 01:01:32,834
stundents are required to respect public and private ownership

1198
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:35,072
and instances of theft, missappropriation

1199
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:35,569
- Anne?

1200
01:01:35,689 --> 01:01:36,370
Yes sir?

1201
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,267
punch me in the face, go ahead

1202
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,008
or

1203
01:01:42,128 --> 01:01:43,917
or unauthorised use will result in

1204
01:01:43,918 --> 01:01:45,408
disciplinary action

1205
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:47,470
including required withdrawl from the college

1206
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:49,608
you memorised that instead of doing what

1207
01:01:49,728 --> 01:01:51,389
what my brother came and

1208
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:53,005
I came here to ask you respectfully

1209
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:55,725
Sir its against university rules to steal from other students

1210
01:01:55,726 --> 01:01:56,552
plain and simple

1211
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:57,608
have you spoken to your housemaster

1212
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:58,321
yes sir

1213
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:01,922
and the housemaster made a recommendation to the AD BOARD but the ADBOARD wont hear us

1214
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:03,586
have you tried dealing with the other student directly

1215
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:07,849
Mr Zuckerburg hasnt been responding to any of our e-mails and phone calls for the last 2 weeks

1216
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,912
he doesnt answer when we knock on his door at KIRKLAND

1217
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:11,693
and the closest Ive come to dealing with him face to face

1218
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,137
when I saw him on the quad and chased him through HARVARD SQUARE

1219
01:02:14,138 --> 01:02:14,633
chased him

1220
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:17,063
I I I saw him and I know he saw me, I went after him

1221
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:18,247
and he disapeaared

1222
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,509
I dont see this as a universty issue

1223
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,138
Of course its a a universty issue

1224
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:24,632
theres a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both

1225
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,808
you entered into a code of ethics with the university

1226
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:28,271
im sorry president summersnot with each other

1227
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:32,536
im sorry president summers what you just said makes no sense to me at all

1228
01:02:32,656 --> 01:02:33,338
Im devestated by that

1229
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:34,623
What my brother means is

1230
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:37,322
Mark Zuckerburg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer

1231
01:02:37,442 --> 01:02:38,798
that would be a universty issue

1232
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,013
I dont know this office doent handle petty larceny

1233
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:42,177
this isnt petty larceny

1234
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,506
this idea is potentialy worth millions of dollars

1235
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:45,104
millions

1236
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:45,753
yes

1237
01:02:45,754 --> 01:02:48,107
you might just be letting your imaginations run away with you

1238
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:48,693
sir

1239
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:51,263
I honestly dont think your in any position to make that call

1240
01:02:51,264 --> 01:02:53,170
I was the US Treasury secretary

1241
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,117
Im in some position to make that call

1242
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,254
"Letting our imagnations run away with us "

1243
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:59,392
Is exactly what we were told to do in your Freshaman address?

1244
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:02,065
well then I would suggest that you let your imaginations

1245
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:03,609
run away with you on a new project

1246
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,080
you would

1247
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,472
everyone at HARVARD is inventing something

1248
01:03:06,592 --> 01:03:11,282
HARVARD undergarduates believe that inventing a job is better then finding a job is better then finding a job

1249
01:03:11,283 --> 01:03:14,847
So I suggest again that the 2 of you come up with a new new project

1250
01:03:14,848 --> 01:03:16,641
I'm sorry, sir. But thats not the poin

1251
01:03:16,642 --> 01:03:17,112
Please

1252
01:03:17,113 --> 01:03:18,208
come right at the point

1253
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:21,898
you dont have to be a intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong

1254
01:03:22,018 --> 01:03:23,247
your saying that I dont

1255
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,596
of course I am not saying that sir

1256
01:03:24,716 --> 01:03:25,207
Im saying that

1257
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:26,517
really

1258
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:27,154
sir

1259
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:28,032
Ann

1260
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:29,455
how did I get this appointment

1261
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:30,816
Colleagues of their father

1262
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:35,448
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winkle Voss ,Mr WinkleVoss

1263
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,510
since your on the subject of right and wrong

1264
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,456
This action, this meeting

1265
01:03:39,457 --> 01:03:42,192
The 2 of you being here, is wrong

1266
01:03:42,312 --> 01:03:43,630
Its not worthy of Harvard,

1267
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,755
Its not what Harvard saw in you

1268
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:48,045
You dont get special treatment

1269
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,114
We never asked ...

1270
01:03:49,343 --> 01:03:50,680
Wai ...Wai..start another project

1271
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,123
Like were amking a diorama for a science fair

1272
01:03:53,136 --> 01:03:54,039
If you have a problem with that Mr WinkleVoss

1273
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,770
We never asked for special treatment

1274
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:57,793
The courts allways at your disposal

1275
01:03:58,188 --> 01:03:59,625
Is there anything else I can do for you

1276
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:01,511
TY

1277
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:04,018
Thank you very much for your time

1278
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:10,914
OOPPPS

1279
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:13,268
I broka a 335 year old door knob

1280
01:04:15,747 --> 01:04:18,878
Eduardo, spring break you and Mr Zuckerburg took a trip to Newe York

1281
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:19,374
Yes

1282
01:04:19,494 --> 01:04:20,716
What was the purpose of the trip

1283
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:23,223
Well as CFO

1284
01:04:23,224 --> 01:04:26,036
I set up some meetings with potential advertisers

1285
01:04:26,265 --> 01:04:27,283
who paid for the trip

1286
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:30,502
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I set up a few months earlier

1287
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:34,351
at this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company

1288
01:04:34,352 --> 01:04:34,987
YES

1289
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:36,349
How did you feel the meetings went

1290
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:38,627
went terribly

1291
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:39,390
why

1292
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:40,841
Mark was asleep

1293
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,252
I was not asleep

1294
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:44,263
can I repharse my answer

1295
01:04:44,383 --> 01:04:45,993
I wish he was asleep

1296
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:52,841
so were at 29 schools now with over 75000 members

1297
01:04:53,368 --> 01:04:58,866
People who go on the Facebook tend stay on  longer  then almost any other web site now heres the most impressive statistc

1298
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:02,925
91% of the people who try it once come back, Now if you'll allow me

1299
01:05:02,926 --> 01:05:03,905
Excuse me one secound

1300
01:05:03,906 --> 01:05:06,151
What sound are you making, is that like a tick

1301
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:10,771
Was'nt a tick

1302
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,005
Was

1303
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:14,804
Like throttle sound

1304
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:17,411
Almost a gag reflex

1305
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,286
What is this ... ...

1306
01:05:20,986 --> 01:05:23,608
There was 1 more meeting scheduled for the New York

1307
01:05:23,728 --> 01:05:24,117
YES

1308
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:25,135
It was a dinner

1309
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,809
It was setup through my girlfreind at the time

1310
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:29,405
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting

1311
01:05:30,004 --> 01:05:30,703
YES

1312
01:05:31,569 --> 01:05:32,243
VERY

1313
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:34,241
Their not gonna card us here right

1314
01:05:34,242 --> 01:05:34,954
Look around

1315
01:05:35,074 --> 01:05:35,806
Dont be embarrsed

1316
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,894
Tell him their not gonna card us

1317
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:39,370
their not gonna card us

1318
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:39,752
Mark

1319
01:05:39,753 --> 01:05:41,177
Are you gonna talk about adds again

1320
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:45,135
Unless your the BALLET THEATRE of HARTFORD, the purpose of business is to make a profit

1321
01:05:45,136 --> 01:05:46,407
It is'nt a  business yet

1322
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:46,961
Thats tough.

1323
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:48,933
Its not tough for me , Its my job

1324
01:05:49,709 --> 01:05:50,333
Never mind

1325
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:54,583
25 minutes late

1326
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:56,683
He started Napster, when he was 19

1327
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:57,387
He can be late

1328
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,163
He is not a God

1329
01:05:58,164 --> 01:05:59,054
What is he?

1330
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,658
Hes 25 minutes late

1331
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:02,083
I think your just jealous

1332
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,903
I honestly was'nt jealous

1333
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:05,544
I was nervous

1334
01:06:05,664 --> 01:06:06,320
why

1335
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:07,682
I did'nt know him at all

1336
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:11,392
But I had done a search and asked around and he

1337
01:06:11,512 --> 01:06:14,077
He struck me as a kind of an....

1338
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:16,877
WILDCARD

1339
01:06:16,997 --> 01:06:17,864
WHAT

1340
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:23,082
He crashed out of 2 pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs

1341
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,520
He also founded the companies

1342
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:25,822
We dont need him

1343
01:06:27,285 --> 01:06:27,883
Hes here

1344
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:37,888
- Im Sean • Parker

1345
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:38,436
How do you do

1346
01:06:38,437 --> 01:06:39,110
You must be Eduardo

1347
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,070
and Christy, and Mark

1348
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:41,617
Nice to meet you

1349
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:44,811
You guys dont have anything in front of you

1350
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:45,282
no

1351
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:46,161
TORI

1352
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:47,663
HeY, baby boy

1353
01:06:47,664 --> 01:06:51,328
Could you bring out somethngs,
The laquered pork with that ginger confit

1354
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:54,307
Tuna tartar , and the lobster claws, that'll get us started

1355
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,032
Christie

1356
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:56,038
what do you like to drink

1357
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,646
An Appletini

1358
01:06:59,066 --> 01:06:59,779
great

1359
01:07:00,072 --> 01:07:01,344
4 of those

1360
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:04,475
From that point on it was a Shauathon

1361
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:15,723
The question was what did you talk about

1362
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:29,870
He took through his episode with NAPSTER

1363
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:32,724
I did'nt want to spend my 20's as a professinal defender

1364
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,638
Who knew that in the begining of 2003--

1365
01:07:35,758 --> 01:07:41,519
They tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties but I guess to them that was a little like

1366
01:07:42,137 --> 01:07:44,466
Selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas

1367
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:46,209
So we said screw it

1368
01:07:46,222 --> 01:07:47,278
and declared bankruptcy

1369
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,322
You made a name for yourself

1370
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:49,874
And you are dry

1371
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:51,032
TORY

1372
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:54,258
and then he went on to his secound business venture

1373
01:07:54,348 --> 01:07:58,012
which was an online rolodex that he got thrown out of by his equity

1374
01:07:58,132 --> 01:08:03,908
and I wanted to do it nicely, I put on a tie and shined my shoes, but nobody wanted to take orders from a kid

1375
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:06,822
So let me tell you what happened to a 20 year old the top of the DOT-COM

1376
01:08:07,144 --> 01:08:08,518
Im not a psychiatrist

1377
01:08:08,638 --> 01:08:10,083
We got that on the record

1378
01:08:10,203 --> 01:08:12,145
Your not a psychiatrist, but what

1379
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,288
a psychiatrist, would say that he was paranoid

1380
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,810
They hired private detective who followed me day and night

1381
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:20,087
There were targets for high priced escorts

1382
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:22,543
I cant prove it but I know they tapped my phone

1383
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,140
So I figured Im gonna trip you up whos done all this

1384
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:28,004
Private behaviour is a relic of times gone by

1385
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:30,957
and somehow,someway you've managed to live your life like the DALI LAMA but

1386
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,339
but make shit up because

1387
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,545
they dont want you they want your idea

1388
01:08:34,546 --> 01:08:37,103
and they want you to say thank you while

1389
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:37,968
excuse me

1390
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:39,660
wipe your chin and walk away

1391
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,882
what happened to you

1392
01:08:41,002 --> 01:08:42,333
and delusional

1393
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:43,707
YES

1394
01:08:44,191 --> 01:08:44,433
WHAT

1395
01:08:44,738 --> 01:08:49,625
There'll be payback in case  I bought down the record companies with NAPSTER and retribution for PLEXOR to

1396
01:08:49,745 --> 01:08:52,132
You did'nt bring down the record companies

1397
01:08:52,564 --> 01:08:53,086
Name 1

1398
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:54,053
In court

1399
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:54,524
YEAH

1400
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:57,527
You want to buy TOWER RECORD Eduardo

1401
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,643
He told story after story about

1402
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:05,347
life in SILICON VALLEY, parties at STANFORD

1403
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:08,057
down in LA freinds who become Millionaires--

1404
01:09:08,058 --> 01:09:12,939
but mostly how Mark had to he had to come to California...

1405
01:09:13,059 --> 01:09:16,146
and then he cut around to FACEBOOK

1406
01:09:16,147 --> 01:09:18,353
So tell me about your progress

1407
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,872
well were in 29 schools now

1408
01:09:20,992 --> 01:09:22,755
we got over 75000 members

1409
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:23,977
tell me about the strategy your using

1410
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:24,283
OK

1411
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:28,347
For intance we wanted BAYLOR in Texas but BAYLOR already had a social network on campus so

1412
01:09:28,348 --> 01:09:32,037
instead of going right after them we made a list of every school within a hundred miles

1413
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:33,679
Put the FACEBOOK on those capuses first

1414
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,086
Pretty soon all the BAYLOR kids were seeing their freinds on our site and we were in

1415
01:09:36,087 --> 01:09:37,549
Its called the little bighorn, its smart Mark

1416
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,555
Thanks that was mine

1417
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:40,909
Hey you know what settle an arguement for us

1418
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,163
I say its time to start making money through the FACEBOOK

1419
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:44,436
but Mark does'nt want to advertise

1420
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:45,085
whos right

1421
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:48,100
well neither of you yet

1422
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:50,824
The FACEBOOK is cool thats what its got going for it

1423
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:53,508
you dont want to ruin it with adds, because adds are'nt cool

1424
01:09:53,509 --> 01:09:54,029
Exactly

1425
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:55,773
Its like your throwing the greatest party on campus

1426
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,809
and someone saying its gotta be over by 11

1427
01:09:58,852 --> 01:10:00,837
you dont even know what the thing is yet

1428
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:02,808
How big it can get, How far it can go

1429
01:10:02,809 --> 01:10:04,768
This is no time to put your chips down

1430
01:10:04,769 --> 01:10:06,755
A million dollars isnt cool, you know whats cool

1431
01:10:06,756 --> 01:10:07,264
YOU

1432
01:10:10,534 --> 01:10:12,367
A Billion dollars

1433
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,803
It shut everybody up

1434
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:18,700
and thats were your headed

1435
01:10:18,701 --> 01:10:20,507
a billion dollar evaluation

1436
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:26,349
unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well have come up with a cahin of very succesful Yogurt shops

1437
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:28,449
when you go fishing you can catch alot of fish

1438
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,952
or you can catch a big fish

1439
01:10:29,953 --> 01:10:33,528
You ever walk into a den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout

1440
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,094
No hes holding a 3000 pound marlin

1441
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:35,335
YEP

1442
01:10:35,336 --> 01:10:36,352
Thats a good analogy

1443
01:10:36,353 --> 01:10:39,177
OK we all know that Marlins dont really wegh 300 pounds right

1444
01:10:39,178 --> 01:10:40,208
Have you seen the big ones up close

1445
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:43,033
No I have'nt
But looking at the guy holding a Marlin the size of a RangeRover

1446
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:45,781
that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy

1447
01:10:45,782 --> 01:10:47,487
I think you might be getting away from the point

1448
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,254
I dont have a dog in this fight, I just came to say HI

1449
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:54,308
He owned Mark after that dinner

1450
01:10:54,309 --> 01:10:57,186
He picked up the check and he told Mark that they would talk together soon

1451
01:10:57,187 --> 01:11:02,074
and he was gone,but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company

1452
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:07,051
Drop the "THE"just FACEBOOK

1453
01:11:23,484 --> 01:11:26,017
Thats gotta be some kind of landspeed record for talking

1454
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,620
You want to end the party at 11

1455
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,208
Im trying to pay for the party

1456
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:31,098
there wont be a party

1457
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:32,320
unless its cool

1458
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:36,863
Yeah sure lets drop the"THE"

1459
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:39,408
I meant catching the Marlin instead of 14 trout

1460
01:11:40,033 --> 01:11:40,949
does'nt that sound good

1461
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:42,413
If your a trout

1462
01:11:43,336 --> 01:11:48,630
Im going to enter this into the record, incorporation papers for FACEBOOK and their also  registered in Florida

1463
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:49,686
why Florida

1464
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:50,895
Well thats were my familiy lives

1465
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,798
and ask the respondents to stipulate that the articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows

1466
01:11:54,812 --> 01:12:00,894
65% for Mark Zuckberg,30% for Edurdo Severin and 5% for Dustin Markovitz

1467
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:01,885
I'll stipulate

1468
01:12:01,886 --> 01:12:04,099
and that was April13th 2004

1469
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:04,773
You can Mark it

1470
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:06,071
Do you have anything here

1471
01:12:06,313 --> 01:12:07,611
Yes thank-you

1472
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:13,995
Mr.Saverin have you ever done anything that might be considered as legitimate grounds for termination

1473
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:15,929
NO

1474
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:20,835
You've never did anything to embarass the company or even seriously jeapordise it

1475
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:21,917
NO

1476
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:22,515
NO

1477
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:27,552
NO

1478
01:12:27,672 --> 01:12:29,359
You were accused of Animal cruelty

1479
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:33,915
You were'nt

1480
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:35,836
This is not happenning

1481
01:12:35,837 --> 01:12:38,138
Well I have here an article from the Crimson

1482
01:12:38,139 --> 01:12:39,614
JESUS CHRIST

1483
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:41,154
I cant have this Eduardo

1484
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:44,604
Oh come on man, this is bullshit it another club playing a prank

1485
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:47,810
I'd gotten into the PHOENIX

1486
01:12:48,274 --> 01:12:54,814
as as part of my initiation I had to for 1 week carry with me at all times, and take care of a chicken

1487
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:59,073
They identified you as 1 of the founders of FACEBOOK Jr Eduardo Severin

1488
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:02,509
Im not the expert but I think torturing animals was bad for business

1489
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:06,865
I did not torture the chicken,I dont torture chickens

1490
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:07,933
are you crazy

1491
01:13:07,934 --> 01:13:09,270
no now settle down please

1492
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:11,550
I have here an article from the CRIMSON

1493
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:12,390
This is scathing

1494
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:13,166
956

1495
01:13:13,286 --> 01:13:20,582
I was having dinner at the KIRKLAND dining hall, with Mark and I had the chicken with me, cause I had to have the chicken with me at all times

1496
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:21,460
This is College

1497
01:13:21,461 --> 01:13:22,962
Somebody is going to have to answer for this

1498
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:23,776
969

1499
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:32,453
The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner, so I had to feed my chicken, so wha..I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken

1500
01:13:32,455 --> 01:13:36,336
Someone must have seen cause the next thing I knew, I was accused of forced cannabilism

1501
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:37,991
I did'nt know

1502
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:39,187
you could'nt do that

1503
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:41,910
I dealt with various animal rights groups

1504
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:44,321
I dealt with the associate dean at the college

1505
01:13:44,441 --> 01:13:46,026
this was all resolved

1506
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,121
988

1507
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:51,776
Someone from the Fly or the Porc must have reported it, for all I know it was the WinkleVoss's

1508
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:53,074
allright lets just forget about it

1509
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:54,092
This is absurd

1510
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:56,332
Im being accused of animal cruelty

1511
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,046
next i'll be accused of necrophelia

1512
01:13:58,047 --> 01:13:59,318
It is better to be accused of necrophelia

1513
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:02,729
Im gonna have to explain this to my father ,Im goonna have to explain this to everybody

1514
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,638
what is happenning on that

1515
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:07,488
I have my final coming up for "Post War and Contemporary Art" and I havent been to class

1516
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:09,366
Im supposed to write about those 4 paintings

1517
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:10,728
Thats a FACEBOOK PAGE

1518
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:10,957
YEAH

1519
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:11,988
I put it under an ALIAS

1520
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,454
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.
Every once in awhile I hop and stir the pot to get a good debate going,

1521
01:14:16,455 --> 01:14:19,212
Was Mr Zuckberg cheating on his final exam

1522
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:20,879
I.d rather not answer that question

1523
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,694
and why not

1524
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,460
cause Im not suing him for cheating on his final exam

1525
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:26,356
Thats not what freinds do

1526
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:28,277
well you just told us he was cheating

1527
01:14:29,652 --> 01:14:30,148
OOPPS

1528
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:34,529
You told your lawyer I was torturing animals

1529
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:38,821
No he did'nt tell us about it at all our litigators are capable of finding a CRIMSON article

1530
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,341
In fact when we raised the subject he defended you

1531
01:14:44,307 --> 01:14:44,714
SO

1532
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:47,972
993 we are so close

1533
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:49,893
OH yeah that remind me....

1534
01:14:50,568 --> 01:14:51,713
were gonna need more money

1535
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,317
I aggree more servers..apps

1536
01:14:53,437 --> 01:14:56,805
Im interviewing 2 interns to come to PAULO ALTO and we are going to have to pay them something

1537
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:57,543
sorry what

1538
01:14:57,556 --> 01:15:01,781
I already found a house for rent on a street 2 blocks from the STANFORD campus
its perfect and its gotta pool

1539
01:15:01,782 --> 01:15:03,763
When did you decide to go to Califrnia for the summer

1540
01:15:03,764 --> 01:15:05,341
You mean when did I actually decide

1541
01:15:05,342 --> 01:15:07,950
Somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker variety hout

1542
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:11,233
He was right California is the place we gotta be

1543
01:15:11,234 --> 01:15:12,747
What your Jed Clampett

1544
01:15:12,748 --> 01:15:14,958
What you got the Beverly Hill Billbillies in BRAZIL

1545
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:18,177
What is your problem with Sean

1546
01:15:18,297 --> 01:15:20,061
He doesnt bring anything to the table

1547
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:22,224
doesnt have money, Dustns a better programmer

1548
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:23,077
Hes got connections

1549
01:15:23,078 --> 01:15:23,902
got connections to VC

1550
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:26,808
If we need advertisers I have connections to VC

1551
01:15:26,809 --> 01:15:30,486
The real players and as someone whos just really embarrased the  company in a bad way

1552
01:15:30,487 --> 01:15:31,814
It was the WnkleVoss's Mark

1553
01:15:31,815 --> 01:15:32,348
Hang-on

1554
01:15:32,857 --> 01:15:33,608
hit refresh

1555
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:37,057
150.000

1556
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,225
150.000 members

1557
01:15:40,226 --> 01:15:40,917
Eduardo

1558
01:15:40,918 --> 01:15:42,062
Congratulations

1559
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:47,000
You dont think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives

1560
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,285
Who came up with nothing

1561
01:15:48,286 --> 01:15:50,792
enough to get him out of the company the drugs the girls

1562
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:51,980
We dont know if any of thats true

1563
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:52,616
Read about it

1564
01:15:52,617 --> 01:15:54,983
and I can read about you torturing birds, since when does reading about something...

1565
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:58,495
dont eat other fish, the Marlins and the Trout

1566
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:01,728
Whats he talking about

1567
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:06,407
Im intervieing interns at 10 tommorow night in the CS lab
Get onboard with this man you know

1568
01:16:06,764 --> 01:16:07,883
I dont really know what else to say

1569
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:44,156
Whats going on

1570
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:50,216
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a python webserver, expose its SSL encryption then intercept all traffic over its secure port

1571
01:16:50,217 --> 01:16:51,018
Their hacking

1572
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:53,169
All behind a PIX Firewall Emulator, butn heres the beauty

1573
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,046
You know I did'nt understand anything you just said right

1574
01:16:55,047 --> 01:16:55,669
I do know that

1575
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:56,293
So whats the beauty

1576
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:58,329
every 10th line of code written they have to take a shot,

1577
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:03,162
and hacking supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1578
01:17:03,163 --> 01:17:06,992
I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all 5 computers.

1579
01:17:06,993 --> 01:17:08,796
The last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot.

1580
01:17:08,797 --> 01:17:11,062
Plus every 3 minutes they all have to take a shot

1581
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:17,177
can I ask what part of the interns job will they need to be able to do drunk

1582
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:21,313
Your right a more relavant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week

1583
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:24,523
That was mean

1584
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:25,744
HERE

1585
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:26,826
WHAT IS THIS

1586
01:17:26,827 --> 01:17:29,796
I opened a new acount and put 1800 dollars in it

1587
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,749
will that get you through the summer

1588
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:42,054
Welcome to FACEBOOK

1589
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:53,770
18000 DOLLARS

1590
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:54,114
Yes

1591
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,735
In addition to the 1000 dollars you already put up

1592
01:17:56,736 --> 01:17:57,053
Yes

1593
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,626
A total of 19,000 dollars then

1594
01:17:59,746 --> 01:18:00,262
YES

1595
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,004
just checking your math on that

1596
01:18:04,373 --> 01:18:05,072
YES

1597
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:06,816
I got the same thing

1598
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,454
May I continue

1599
01:18:08,899 --> 01:18:13,149
After expressing missgivings about Mr Zuckerburg taking the company and moving it to California

1600
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:17,069
for the summer why did you put 18000 dollars in the account for his use

1601
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,577
I figured we were partners

1602
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:20,549
I wanted to be a team player

1603
01:18:20,669 --> 01:18:26,479
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York

1604
01:18:26,599 --> 01:18:27,811
But mostly I figured

1605
01:18:28,383 --> 01:18:31,106
how much could possibly go wrong in 3 months

1606
01:18:44,374 --> 01:18:45,710

He got a Internship in New York

1641
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:22,785
Eduardo did'nt come out

1642
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:50,911
I was crashing there for a little bit while I am taking care of somethings. But shes done for the summer so shes back at her parents palce and Im homeless

1643
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,372
You can crash at our place at PAULO ALTO

1644
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:53,351
Allright

1645
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:55,069
Whats your plan for the summer

1646
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,923
Im sorry I was looking at the architecture

1647
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:03,712
I asked what your plans were

1648
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:05,290
honour school till the end of the summer

1649
01:21:12,477 --> 01:21:14,717
your date looks so familiar to me

1650
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:16,002
she looks familiar to alot of people

1651
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,224
what do you mean

1652
01:21:21,538 --> 01:21:25,280
wants to buy his wife some lingerie
but hes to embarased to shop for it in a department store

1653
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:29,823
comes up with an idea for a high end place that doesnt make you feel like a pervert.

1654
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:34,329
He gets a 40.000 dolar bank loan borrows another 40.00 thosand from his inlaws

1655
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:37,307
Opens a store and calls it VICTORIA SECRET

1656
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:39,972
Makes half million dollars the first year

1657
01:21:39,973 --> 01:21:47,200
So the guy opens 3 more stores and after 5 years he sells the compant to leslie wester unlimited for 4 million dollars

1658
01:21:47,753 --> 01:21:48,937
Happy ending right

1659
01:21:49,548 --> 01:21:56,547
2 years later the company is worth 500 million dollars and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate bridge

1660
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:05,708
Was that a parable

1661
01:22:06,446 --> 01:22:09,348
I date Victoria Secret models thats why shen looks familiar to you

1662
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:13,499
Dont be impressed wth all this I read your Blog

1663
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:17,513
You know why I started NAPSTER

1664
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:23,088
The girl loved in High School was with the co-captain of the varsity lacross team

1665
01:22:23,089 --> 01:22:25,162
and I wanted to take her from him

1666
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:27,415
So I decided to come up with the next big thing

1667
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:28,344
I didnt know that

1668
01:22:28,345 --> 01:22:33,727
NAPSTER wasnt a failure I changed the music industry for better and for allways

1669
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:37,699
It may not have been good business and it pissed alot of people off

1670
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,590
and isnt that what your FACEMASH was about

1671
01:22:40,591 --> 01:22:43,707
Their sacred of me pal and their gonna be sacred of you

1672
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:47,945
and their gonna say good idea kid grown-ups are gonna take it from here

1673
01:22:47,946 --> 01:22:51,181
but not this time this is our time

1674
01:22:51,182 --> 01:22:56,691
This time you goona hand over a business card that says Im CEO Bitch

1675
01:22:57,467 --> 01:22:59,351
Thats what I want from you

1676
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:02,261

Eduardo maybe a business manager and for all I know he'll be a good one but

1684
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:22,972
He shoud'nt be in New York kissing Madison Avenues ass

1685
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:27,693

1686
01:23:27,694 --> 01:23:32,085

1866
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:22,258
Now let me ask you something

1867
01:34:22,702 --> 01:34:24,763
Whos Eduardo Severin

1868
01:34:49,831 --> 01:34:50,480
When did you get back

1869

You scared me, I need you to knock

1870
01:34:52,097 --> 01:34:54,259
When did you get back

1871
01:34:55,432 --> 01:34:56,959
I got back this afternoon

1872
01:34:57,079 --> 01:34:58,053
and when were you gonna call me

1873
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:00,471
JESUS it was kind of a bad trip

1874
01:35:00,776 --> 01:35:01,871
and I was tired

1875
01:35:01,872 --> 01:35:05,500
or answer 1 of my 47 texts, did you know I sent 47 texts

1876
01:35:05,501 --> 01:35:09,483
I did and I thought that was incredibly normal behaviour

1877
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:10,832
are you mocking me

1878
01:35:11,222 --> 01:35:12,380
I bought you a present

1879
01:35:14,302 --> 01:35:16,478
Why does your status say single on your FACEBOOK page

1880
01:35:18,225 --> 01:35:22,425
Why does your relationship status say single on your FACEBOOK page

1881
01:35:22,426 --> 01:35:24,155
I was single when I set up the page

1882
01:35:24,156 --> 01:35:25,797
and you never bothered to change it

1883
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:26,540
what

1884
01:35:27,609 --> 01:35:28,156
I dont know

1885
01:35:29,047 --> 01:35:30,536
do I look stupid to you

1886
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:32,254
no calm down

1887
01:35:32,255 --> 01:35:37,400
Your asking me to believe that the CFO of FACEBOOK does'nt know how to change his relationship status on FACEBOOK

1888
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:38,125
a little embarassing

1889
01:35:38,126 --> 01:35:40,466
You should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that

1890
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:41,064
GO TO HELL

1891
01:35:41,065 --> 01:35:41,803
TAKE IT EASY

1892
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:45,056
You did'nt change ot so you could SCREW those little SILICON VALLET SLUTS

1893
01:35:45,057 --> 01:35:52,067
thats not even remotely true and I can promise you that the SILICON VALLEY SLUTS dont care about anybodys relationship status on FACEBOOK

1894
01:35:52,068 --> 01:35:53,952
please open your present

1895
01:35:53,953 --> 01:35:55,097
YOUR PHONE DOES WORK

1896
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:57,464

1897
01:35:59,169 --> 01:36:00,569
UH open you present

1898
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:02,007
Its a scarf

1899
01:36:02,803 --> 01:36:04,801
have you ever seenme wear a  scarf

1900
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:06,086
This'll be your first

1901
01:36:07,092 --> 01:36:07,537
YEAH

1902
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:08,644
You froze our accounts

1903
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:09,204
I did

1904
01:36:09,324 --> 01:36:10,273
You froze the accounts

1905
01:36:10,393 --> 01:36:11,584
I had to get you attention Mark

1906
01:36:11,585 --> 01:36:16,133
Do you realise that you jeapordised the entire company do you realise that your actions could have permanetly destroyed everything I've been working on

1907
01:36:16,134 --> 01:36:17,100
WE'VE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

1908
01:36:17,101 --> 01:36:18,856
Without money the site cant function

1909
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,301
OK let me tell you the difference between FACEBOOK and everone else

1910
01:36:21,302 --> 01:36:22,472
We dont crash ever

1911
01:36:22,473 --> 01:36:26,188
If the servers are down for even a day our reputation is irreversibly destroyed

1912
01:36:26,189 --> 01:36:26,443
LOOK

1913
01:36:28,352 --> 01:36:33,315
Even a  few people leaving  would reverberate, through the whole user database The users are interconnected thats the whole point

1914
01:36:33,316 --> 01:36:38,045
College kids are line cause their freinds are online and if one domino goes the other domino goes dont you get that

1915
01:36:38,046 --> 01:36:40,577
I am not going back to the Carribean night of 85

1916
01:36:43,275 --> 01:36:43,797
HOLY SHIT

1917
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:47,993
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU

1918
01:36:47,994 --> 01:36:51,302
did you like being nobody, Did you like being a joke, You want to go back to that

1919
01:36:51,303 --> 01:36:51,607
Hang on

1920
01:36:51,608 --> 01:36:54,292
That was the act of a child not a businessman

1921
01:36:54,293 --> 01:36:56,014
certainly not the act of a freind

1922
01:36:56,015 --> 01:36:59,551
You know how embarssed I was to cash a check today I am not going back to that life

1923
01:36:59,552 --> 01:37:01,002
Yeah

1924
01:36:59,552 --> 01:37:01,473
Maybe you were frustrated

1925
01:37:01,474 --> 01:37:03,292
maybe you were angry

1926
01:37:03,293 --> 01:37:03,903
I was

1927
01:37:04,461 --> 01:37:10,187
I am wiiling to let bygones be bygones cause Eduardo I've got some good news

1928
01:37:11,066 --> 01:37:14,285
Im sorry I was angry and maybe it was childish

1929
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:15,822
But i had to get your attention

1930
01:37:17,489 --> 01:37:18,876
I said I've got some good news

1931
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:20,149
What is it

1932
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:22,872
Peter Thiel has made an ANGEL INVESTMENT OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

1933
01:37:24,132 --> 01:37:25,226
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

1934
01:37:25,682 --> 01:37:28,240
and hes setting us up in an office

1935
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:30,365
They want to re-incorporate the company

1936
01:37:30,485 --> 01:37:37,105
They want to meet you they need your signature on some documents, you got get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco, I need my CFO

1937
01:37:42,638 --> 01:37:43,363
Im on my way

1938
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:43,694
Eduardo

1939
01:37:44,012 --> 01:37:44,470
YEAH

1940
01:37:45,094 --> 01:37:45,590
WE DID IT

1941
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:50,792
Eduardo

1942
01:37:51,784 --> 01:37:52,968
Your going back there already

1943
01:37:56,582 --> 01:37:58,783
and also Im breaking up with you

1944
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:16,267
4 documents the first 2 are comon stoc agrrement purchases allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated FACEBOOK instead of the old shares which are now worthless

1945
01:38:16,268 --> 01:38:20,570
the third is an exchange agreement allowing you to exchange old shares for new shares

1946
01:38:20,571 --> 01:38:22,937
and finally the voter holing aggreement

1947
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:24,896
how many shares of stock will own

1948
01:38:25,016 --> 01:38:28,694
1,328,334

1949
01:38:28,814 --> 01:38:32,716
that represents 34.4% ownership share

1950
01:38:32,717 --> 01:38:35,404
why the increase from the original 30%

1951
01:38:35,405 --> 01:38:37,873
because you may dilute to award shares to new investors

1952
01:38:38,827 --> 01:38:41,742
I love working with business majors dont you

1953
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:47,157
You should know that Mark has already taken his 60 down to 51

1954
01:38:48,659 --> 01:38:51,407
Well Mark does'nt care about the money and he needs to be protected

1955
01:38:53,982 --> 01:38:59,085
Dustin Markowitz down to 6.81% Sean Parker 6.47%

1956
01:39:01,657 --> 01:39:02,459
I can live with that

1957
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,278
and Peter Thiel 7%

1958
01:39:09,228 --> 01:39:10,297
like to use my pen

1959
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,309
Eduardo

1960
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:14,422
Eduardo

1961
01:39:15,974 --> 01:39:17,298
can you please repeat the question

1962
01:39:17,299 --> 01:39:20,174
no it was an outrageously leading question the first time and now you want hear it twice

1963
01:39:20,175 --> 01:39:22,299
yes will you read it back please

1964
01:39:23,133 --> 01:39:23,611
go ahead

1965
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:28,897
COUNSEL and were you aware that when you were signing these documents that you were signing your own death certificate

1966
01:39:34,037 --> 01:39:37,969
it was insanely stupid of me not to have lawyers look at all this stuff

1967
01:39:38,089 --> 01:39:40,883
In all honesty I thought they were my Lawyers

1968
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:45,788
I was your only freind

1969
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:49,224
you had one freind

1970
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:55,177
my father wont even look at me

1971
01:39:55,178 --> 01:39:59,847
OK Eduardo did Mr Zuckerburg say anything to you after you had signed the papers

1972
01:40:00,624 --> 01:40:03,347
there was alot of hand shaking alot of congratualtions

1973
01:40:04,816 --> 01:40:08,544
He already told me that he would'nt be coming back to school for at least a semester

1974
01:40:09,384 --> 01:40:11,357
we were saying good bye for awhile

1975
01:40:13,046 --> 01:40:15,107
before I left he said you gotta come back

1976
01:40:15,782 --> 01:40:17,767
some time around the end of November, early December

1977
01:40:18,136 --> 01:40:22,424
Peter wants to throw as an amazing partywhen we hit a million members, its gonna be out of control you gotts come back for it

1978
01:40:22,544 --> 01:40:23,297

1979
01:40:25,473 --> 01:40:26,924
remember the algorythm

1980
01:40:26,925 --> 01:40:28,472
on the window at KIRKLAND

1981
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:35,675

1982
01:40:40,788 --> 01:40:41,946

1984
01:40:43,377 --> 01:40:45,993
Yur gonna walk in there say you overslept and you did'nt have time to get dressed

1985
01:40:46,007 --> 01:40:49,786

1986
01:40:49,787 --> 01:40:56,278
Your gonna nod your gonna nod
and then your gonna say which one of you is David Roth no not Roth Manningham.

1987
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:02,216
which one of is Mitchel Manningham and he'll say I am
and you say
Sean Parker says FUCK YOU

1988
01:41:17,587 --> 01:41:22,168
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out to the late million member party party

1989
01:41:22,288 --> 01:41:23,936
what else did the e-mail say

1990
01:41:23,937 --> 01:41:26,394
it said that we had to have a business meeting

1991
01:41:26,934 --> 01:41:30,586
that Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on CASE EQUITY

1992
01:41:31,146 --> 01:41:35,549
and Manningham was so impressed that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to pin down

1993
01:41:36,638 --> 01:41:39,946
so i went to California and I went straight to the new offices

1994
01:41:40,939 --> 01:41:44,591
i did'nt know weather to dress for the party or the business meeting

1995
01:41:44,711 --> 01:41:46,055
so i kinda dressed for both

1996
01:41:47,902 --> 01:41:48,843
but it did'nt matter

1997
01:41:49,098 --> 01:41:49,785
why not

1998
01:41:49,905 --> 01:41:51,936
because i was'nt called out there for either one

1999
01:41:52,056 --> 01:41:53,513
what were you called out there for

2000
01:41:57,614 --> 01:41:58,619
an ambush

2001
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,592
Mr Severin please

2002
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:15,073
at first i thought he was joking

2003
01:42:15,298 --> 01:42:17,003
giving more contrcts  to sign

2004
01:42:21,164 --> 01:42:22,844
but then I started reading

2005
01:42:28,485 --> 01:42:31,959

2006
