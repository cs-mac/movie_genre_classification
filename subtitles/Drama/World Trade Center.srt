1
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,142
Give us 22 minutes.
We'll give you the world.

2
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,768
Good morning. 64 degrees.

3
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,608
It is Tuesday
and here's what's happening.

4
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,143
It's primary day and the polls are
officially open in New York City.

5
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,186
Voters will be deciding among
250 candidates...

6
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,351
Thank you. Tickets, please. Thank you.

7
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,321
Tickets.

8
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:56,631
The Daily Number, 945.
Win 4 number, 4242.

9
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:13,216
Did you see Jeter's homer on Saturday?
Guy's got some swing, man.

10
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,306
Yeah, I was there.

11
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,283
Yeah? It was a good one
to have been at.

12
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:17,680
It was.

13
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,220
...part of the ongoing slump
in corporate earnings.

14
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:24,590
Right now, S&P futures
are up two points. Dow futures up 28.

15
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:26,663
NASDAQ futures up six and a half...

16
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,225
Sun coming up

17
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,895
Over New York City

18
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,574
Is there anybody else
that we could call?

19
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,270
Anybody?

20
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,407
- Hey, rookie. How's it going today, man?
- It's going good.

21
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:53,482
All right.

22
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,813
- Hey, Willy.
- Yeah.

23
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,987
I like those shorts.
They're real sharp, you know.

24
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,056
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,954
- 12 bucks at Target. Yeah.
- Yeah?

26
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,027
Do they make them for men, too?

27
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:10,361
I'm not the one who puts
a gallon of pomade in my hair, Pezzulo.

28
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,346
Attention.

29
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,009
Roll call working Tuesday,
September 11.

30
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,642
Color for the day is green.

31
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,119
Tour Commander
is Lieutenant Kassimatis.

32
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,086
Patrol Sergeant, you're looking at him.

33
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:35,783
- Stolzman.
- Sarge.

34
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:38,258
- Post one. Colovito.
- Sarge.

35
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,829
- Three. Nice job on Friday.
- Thanks.

36
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,322
- Pezzulo.
- Sarge.

37
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,366
- Six. Jimeno.
- Sarge.

38
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:47,229
Three-five.

39
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,633
- Rodrigues.
- Sarge.

40
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:49,932
Nine.

41
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,700
- Lieutenant, you got anything?
- No.

42
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:53,867
Inspector Fields has something to say.

43
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,877
Listen up. Be on the lookout for this girl.

44
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:59,346
Zoey Cowley.

45
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,778
Age 11, runaway out of Rhode Island.

46
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:05,513
Thought to be on a bus
coming in this morning.

47
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,713
This is important. Okay.

48
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:11,991
As always, protect yourselves.
Watch each other's backs.

49
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,660
Hear about who Giraldi
brought in yesterday?

50
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:15,731
No, who?

51
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,990
I'll give you one guess.

52
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:21,161
She's 300 pounds, her dress is
a trash bag with bugs all over it.

53
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,295
Gloria, the "Naked Lady"?

54
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,871
Yeah, and Giraldi said
she asked for you.

55
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,476
You love it, huh?

56
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:31,043
- I'll catch you at break.
- Yeah.

57
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,862
Hey, Jethro. Jethro.

58
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,325
Hey, how many times I gotta tell you?

59
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,093
You got to take your crew
and your junk out to Ninth.

60
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,258
It's a free country, man.

61
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,359
- This is my statue.
- What are you, the statue police?

62
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,631
It's the Jackie Gleason statue.
It's not a bench.

63
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:59,331
He don't care. He's dead, man.

64
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,238
Get out of here. Get out of here.

65
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:15,650
Excuse me.

66
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:19,716
I wonder if I might help you out today
with, like, a taxi or get you a hotel?

67
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:22,662
Maybe I can help you out with your bag,
you know.

68
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,066
Hello, Officer? Where find bus center?

69
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,571
Hey, Amoroso.

70
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,648
- How you doing?
- How's it going, man?

71
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,310
To be honest, I miss the bus terminal.

72
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,318
- Yeah, what do you got today?
- Loading docks.

73
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,719
Loading docks?
That shipment come in from...

74
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:53,927
What the...

75
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,033
BT, all units. 8-40. 8-40, ASAP.

76
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,305
BT, all units. 8-40, ASAP.

77
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,371
All units, BT 8-40. 8-40, ASAP.

78
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:18,783
Excuse me.

79
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,321
Hey, something's up.

80
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,291
We have unconfirmed reports
this morning

81
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:28,761
that a plane has crashed into one of
the towers of the World Trade Center.

82
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,196
- CNN Center right now...
- Holy shit.

83
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,096
...work on this story, calling our sources

84
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,897
and trying to figure out
exactly what happened, but, clearly,

85
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:39,098
something relatively devastating
happening this morning there.

86
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:42,370
We're going to join
another one of our New York affiliates

87
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:43,637
for their live coverage.

88
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:48,944
Here at the top of this tower, there's
a huge, gaping hole, flames still inside.

89
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,312
Can you believe this?

90
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:53,512
What schmuck would fly a plane
into the Trade Center?

91
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,820
Maybe they ran out of gas or something.

92
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,827
Yeah, Colovito. Right.

93
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:03,022
Maybe some jerk-off forgot
which lever to pull on his twin-engine.

94
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,065
That's not a small plane.

95
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:07,794
Hell, no.

96
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,029
All right, listen up!

97
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:12,829
Let me have your attention here!

98
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,675
They're telling us it's a commuter plane.

99
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:19,310
Tower One is being evacuated
as a precaution.

100
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,145
They've asked us to send
a team down to assist.

101
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,238
Sergeant McLoughlin.

102
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,908
I've got a list of names here.

103
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,147
Step out when you hear it.
We're going downtown.

104
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,650
- Polnicki.
- Sarge.

105
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,158
- Colovito.
- Sarge.

106
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,955
- Washington.
- Sarge.

107
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,557
- O'Reilly.
- Sarge.

108
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:38,962
- Jimeno.
- Sarge.

109
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,862
- Hogart.
- Sarge.

110
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,699
- Bavli.
- Sarge.

111
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:44,872
- Rodrigues.
- Sarge.

112
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:47,403
- Giraldi.
- Sarge.

113
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:48,737
- Pezzulo.
- Sarge.

114
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:49,935
Stolzman.

115
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,706
Hold it right there! Pull it over!

116
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,080
Command post on the air?
Command post.

117
00:10:56,184 --> 00:11:00,814
Field command post. Are there any
injuries going to any particular hospital?

118
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:05,217
Chief on the air. Go ahead.

119
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:09,430
Come on, everybody. Off the bus.
Get off the bus. Step this way.

120
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,930
I'm gonna cut across
Bleecker to Seventh. Stay close.

121
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,126
You got it.

122
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,565
Central. Mobilization point
is gonna be Pike and South.

123
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:24,806
That was to evacuate One Police Plaza

124
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:28,473
at the Gracie Mansion, the Municipal
Building, and any potential targets.

125
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,345
Who is advising this?

126
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,146
Central units, the mobilization point
is now South and Pike.

127
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:39,188
Yeah. No, no, I got it.

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,554
Hey, guys, you won't believe this!

129
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,154
My wife says the other one got hit,
the other tower.

130
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,028
How the hell did the other tower get hit?

131
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,295
She was listening to HOT 97
and they said it.

132
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:52,702
What? Who gets their news
from HOT 97?

133
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:56,835
- I told you it was no damn private plane.
- No, I got it.

134
00:11:57,811 --> 00:12:00,279
What special equipment
we got down there?

135
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:04,710
- What?
- We're prepared for everything.

136
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:09,585
Car bombs, chemical, biological,
an attack from the top.

137
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,718
But not this. Not for something this size.

138
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,453
There's no plan. We didn't make it.

139
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:20,260
Only emergency transmissions
on this frequency.

140
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:23,759
All right, all emergency personnel

141
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,270
respond to Vesey and West.

142
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,899
All emergency service units,
please go to Vesey and West.

143
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,004
There could be 50,
60,000 people in there.

144
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,157
Units on West Street to use caution.

145
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,695
Debris is falling from the building
on West Street.

146
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,627
Hey! Looks like
Tower Two did take a hit.

147
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,567
What did I tell you?

148
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:58,994
No, no, that's the smoke blowing over
from Tower One.

149
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:02,131
All right, that's enough.
Everybody sit down. Now!

150
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,909
Yo, Dom, let me see your phone
for a sec, yeah?

151
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,305
Hey, let me see your phone.
I got to call Allison.

152
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:09,712
It's not working!

153
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,883
Nothing's going through.

154
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:18,986
Emergency service vehicles
are also responding.

155
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:24,026
Hey, take it easy, will you? Jesus!

156
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,226
- This is gonna be a bitch.
- Relax.

157
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,303
Well, I'm just saying
that it looks like it's gonna...

158
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,531
You think they're bringing you
down there to scratch your ass?

159
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,231
McLoughlin will tell you what to do.

160
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,365
Why the Sarge?

161
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,341
He was Emergency Services
at the Trade Tower.

162
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:40,140
He's one of the guys who came up
with a plan after the attack in '93.

163
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,407
Anybody knows what to do down there,
it's him.

164
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:44,176
Command to Division One.

165
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:47,009
Does anyone over
in Tower One hear me?

166
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:49,949
Okay, make the turn on Broadway.

167
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:52,616
Go down West Broadway.
We'll meet you outside Five.

168
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,056
You got it.

169
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:36,164
Send everything you got
to the World Trade Center now.

170
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,400
We got to get that building evacuated!

171
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,836
Which tower?
Which tower are we responding to?

172
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,398
- I got to get a team to go up!
- I'll check in with headquarters.

173
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,604
Roll every available ambulance you got
to this position.

174
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,310
Fire out on the north side.

175
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:55,283
They're now coming out
of the west side

176
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:56,354
of the World Trade Center.

177
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,455
All right, everybody stay here. I'm gonna
find out what the hell's going on.

178
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,528
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,409
Oh, my God.

180
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,613
Nothing's gonna help them.

181
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,214
No, we'll get up there.

182
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,623
How are you gonna save people
that high up? It's impossible.

183
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,252
We got to try.

184
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:12,489
Sarge!

185
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,897
Officer? Officer?

186
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:22,635
The daycare center.
There's kids there. Over there.

187
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,470
Hey, Sarge! There's kids in the...

188
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:27,943
Yeah, at the daycare at Five.
I know, they got them out.

189
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:32,108
- Okay, listen up. Where's Kassimatis?
- He's looking for you, Sarge.

190
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,082
We got to evacuate the Tower.

191
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:38,217
Who knows how to use a Scott Pak?
And don't give me any PBA bullshit.

192
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,258
Hey, Sarge, to tell you the truth,
I haven't used one in like four years.

193
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,054
Look, what did I just say?

194
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,059
Who's coming?

195
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,664
Step forward.

196
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,163
I got it, Sarge.

197
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:55,698
I'll go.

198
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:02,045
I'm with you, Sarge.

199
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:07,911
All right.

200
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,012
All right, we got a team.

201
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:13,352
We're headed into Building Five.
The rest of you wait for Kassimatis.

202
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,255
Follow me. Stay together.

203
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:28,136
- Jimeno.
- Sarge.

204
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:31,867
Take everyone's memo books,
nightsticks, hats. They're useless here.

205
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:35,073
Put them in the Suburban.
It's over on Church and Vesey.

206
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,909
And meet us back at the police desk
in the lobby of Five. You got it?

207
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,607
Which one's Five?

208
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,416
There's two towers.

209
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,053
North tower is One. South tower is Two.

210
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:47,919
Right behind it, there's Five,
right in front of us,

211
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,322
which is where the police desk is.

212
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,394
Take the alley. Hurry up. Hey!

213
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,994
Let's go.

214
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,168
They're all dying!

215
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,507
They're all dying!

216
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:21,955
Grab those bottles.

217
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,254
Get the helmets.

218
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,263
People trapped at 87th and 89th floors.

219
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:30,492
10-4. They're getting a TVpicture
with numerous injuries.

220
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,364
Numerous injuries out there.

221
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,968
Okay, turn them on.
Double check. Test them.

222
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:40,608
Massi? Anything more here?
Helmets? Scott Paks?

223
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,908
No, Sarge. Try the E room
near the truck docks in the basement.

224
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:45,345
Jimmy Lynch is down there.

225
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,179
Thanks.

226
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:52,681
Okay, there's more stuff down on B-1,
the truck docks.

227
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:55,291
We'll drop down to the Concourse,
go around One to Two,

228
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:57,292
and there's some stairs there.

229
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,892
Keep your eyes open. Follow me.
Don't get separated, okay?

230
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,056
Well, Sarge, we got plenty here.

231
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,793
Hundred and ten floors. Fire with fuel.

232
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,495
We're gonna be using up bottles.
We need them.

233
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,704
Sarge, you won't believe this.

234
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:14,507
Your Suburban on Church? It's gone.
Roof smashed in.

235
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,713
Stay together and stay focused.

236
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,444
- Yo, Dom, where we going?
- Sarge wants more stuff.

237
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:24,714
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

238
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:26,517
He knows what he's doing.

239
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,315
What the...

240
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,824
Don't think. Keep moving.

241
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,519
Jesus, Sarge, we got to get up there.

242
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,426
You aren't rescuing anybody
if you can't breathe, Rodrigues.

243
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:35,964
Stay focused.

244
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,840
This way.

245
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:16,773
Where's the fire?

246
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,420
Now you're talking.
Got the BT dogs up in here.

247
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,362
What's up, Sarge?
Sarge, I'm telling you we got to get up.

248
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,955
There's a ton of people stuck up there.

249
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,557
- We're going up.
- Yeah? I gotta go with you.

250
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,603
- Sure, Chris. We can use you.
- Yeah?

251
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,036
We need more equipment.
Get a tank on.

252
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,299
A-Rod!

253
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:52,935
Yo, what's up, Chris?

254
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,136
Yo, what happened to your eye, man?
What happened to your eye?

255
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:57,234
I was carrying this woman out,

256
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,836
something whacked me
in the freaking head.

257
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,041
- She okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got her clear.

258
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,586
Hey, hey, Sarge, we ain't gonna find
any equipment left in One.

259
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,887
- Coming through. Coming through.
- Excuse us. Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:11,425
Lynch has got gear down
at the B-1 truck docks next to Two.

261
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:13,688
There's a staircase right over there
at Ben & Jerry's.

262
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:15,764
I heard they were
evacuating Two, Sarge.

263
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,856
Must have caught fire from One.

264
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,958
I heard Two got hit,
that there was a second plane.

265
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,470
No, Fields just said one plane,
Tower One. Now, stay together.

266
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:28,474
You see the TV?
There's a big fire up there.

267
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,102
There ain't no TVs down here.

268
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:33,579
You guys hear about the Pentagon?
It got hit. A missile or something.

269
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,651
Israel? It's gone. It's nuked.

270
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:38,447
Whole freaking world's
coming to an end today, Willy.

271
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:39,680
- Yo, Chris.
- Yeah.

272
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,189
- Nice timing on that transfer.
- Yeah, no kidding, right?

273
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,656
- Jimeno?
- Yeah.

274
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,685
You stay with the can't.

275
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,329
The rest of you, come with me.

276
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,467
Stay safe.

277
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,871
We're receiving... On the 106th floor...

278
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:05,507
People are trapped at that location.

279
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,687
About five floors from the top,

280
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:22,092
there's at least 50 people hanging on.

281
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,164
Hey.

282
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,426
Reynolds.

283
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,132
Bridge.

284
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,269
Jimeno. Bus terminal.

285
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:34,638
- You all right?
- Yeah. You helping evacuate?

286
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,839
Trying. Going up Two. You?

287
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:45,618
Up One. I'm waiting for my sarge.

288
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:50,984
Yeah. Well, it's gonna be a long day.

289
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,927
You'll be all right, kid.
A lot of good people here.

290
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,166
Units, also be advised

291
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,795
that people are trapped
on that 60th floor.

292
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,568
Sixtieth floor,
people are trapped up there.

293
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,039
Stuck in the elevator,

294
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:12,944
the elevator shaft, and we're
chopping through the wall to get out.

295
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,515
Okay, we got enough.

296
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:19,179
Tower One.

297
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,889
Let's go. Stay together.

298
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:24,984
Okay, 10th floor.

299
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,859
We've knocked out that fire. We're in
the B stairs. We'll meet you over there.

300
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,430
Let me know
what kind of conditions you got.

301
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,127
Lieutenant?

302
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,828
I was down on B-1.
The shafts there are buckling.

303
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:36,733
There's gonna be people trapped
in those elevators.

304
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:37,964
Jeez.

305
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,769
It just took us an hour to get up to 30
in Tower One.

306
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,740
Now they want us over in Two.

307
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:45,306
- What happened in Two?
- I don't know.

308
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,882
- You guys be careful, okay?
- Yeah, stay safe.

309
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,953
Hey, Will. Let me get that.

310
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:03,686
Thanks, man.

311
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,129
8-1, McLoughlin. What's your location?

312
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:09,135
This is 8-1. We're in the Concourse.
We got gear and are heading to One.

313
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,863
8-1, 800, negative that.

314
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,700
Rendezvous with me
out on Barclay Street. I got a team here.

315
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,334
We'll all go up together.

316
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,543
8-1, is something going on
with Tower Two?

317
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:51,869
Run!

318
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,913
The elevator shaft!

319
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:57,276
Anybody there?

320
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,353
Anyone there?

321
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,190
My legs!

322
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:20,064
Sound off!

323
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:23,132
Sound off!

324
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:26,202
Pezzulo!

325
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:29,805
Jimeno!

326
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:34,173
Rodrigues!

327
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:38,514
Chris!

328
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,551
Antonio.

329
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:47,356
Chris!

330
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,260
A-Rod!

331
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,394
Antonio!

332
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:57,866
They're gone.

333
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:01,832
They're in a better place, really.

334
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:07,342
All right.

335
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:11,450
What's everyone's situation?

336
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:11,745
What's everyone's situation?

337
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:13,882
I'm pinned. Bad.

338
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,847
I can't...

339
00:27:19,392 --> 00:27:20,859
I can't move my legs.

340
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:24,323
I think I'm okay.

341
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,862
How you doing, Sarge?

342
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:31,527
I don't think I'm hurt, but I can't move.

343
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,671
I got some movement here.

344
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,681
8-13!

345
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:51,420
PAPD!

346
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:54,986
Officers Jimeno, Pezzulo

347
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,693
and McLoughlin are down.

348
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:01,363
We're trapped on the Concourse level

349
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,829
between Towers One and Two.

350
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,502
We're trapped near
freight elevator Five.

351
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,942
- Oh, thank God.
- It goes down to the B-1 truck dock.

352
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:14,035
Yeah, here you go. Get some air.

353
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:16,614
Get some air. Some fresh air.

354
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:21,353
You're okay, Willy. You're okay.

355
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:22,648
Got any radio?

356
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:24,422
Here you go.

357
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,417
No, mine's smashed. It's not working.

358
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:33,291
All my stuff on the left side is buried.
The mike's gone.

359
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:37,502
You got to get this...
You got to get this off of me.

360
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:44,170
It's good to see you, Dom.

361
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,403
Good to see you, Willy.

362
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:50,945
- You okay? You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

363
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:54,448
I'm going to get you out.
Don't worry about it.

364
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:55,645
I'm gonna get you out, Willy.

365
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,222
It's working, Sarge!

366
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,353
Dom's got us covered!

367
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,018
Good. That's good.

368
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:07,432
How'd you know to run in here, Sarge?

369
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:11,965
The elevator shaft's
the strongest part of the building.

370
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:13,804
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,404
How did this happen, Willy?

372
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:24,281
I'm gonna take care of you.

373
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,549
I'm gonna get you out, buddy.

374
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,358
Looks like there's light! Maybe some air!

375
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:40,924
I'd say about 20 feet up!

376
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,767
Hey!

377
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:45,702
8-13!

378
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,763
Officers down!

379
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:50,942
Hey!

380
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:01,949
- You ready?
- Come on.

381
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:10,158
Come on, Dom!

382
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:11,826
Oh, Jesus.

383
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:19,865
I can't get this off him by myself, Sarge.

384
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,172
Maybe I should go up and get some help
and then come back for you guys.

385
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:27,870
No! No! You're gonna get him out!

386
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:31,044
You're gonna get him out!

387
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:35,119
All right.

388
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:43,892
Here we go, Willy.

389
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:45,820
Come on!

390
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,939
I can't get you out, Willy.

391
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:02,873
Come on, Dom.

392
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:06,973
Don't leave us here.

393
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:11,351
Do me a favor.

394
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,159
You can do it. I know you can do it.

395
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:26,429
All right.

396
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,404
I'm going to get you out, Willy. All right?

397
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:34,504
I'll get you out. Yeah, I'll get you out.
All right.

398
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:32,866
Dom?

399
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:36,403
Dom?

400
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,810
I'm hurt.

401
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:50,920
Dom, it's me, Willy.

402
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:53,719
Look at me.

403
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,724
Stay awake.

404
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,660
Can I get a 3-8, Sarge?

405
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:07,437
Yeah, Dom. You take a break.

406
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:13,806
I'm dying, Willy.

407
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:18,039
No. No, you're not. Dom, stop this.

408
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:23,848
Don't forget
I really tried to save you guys.

409
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:36,959
I love you, Willy.

410
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:41,033
I love you, too, Dom.

411
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,224
Dom's gone.

412
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,790
Dom's gone!

413
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,432
I know.

414
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,411
Jimeno,

415
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,385
can you still see the light?

416
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:29,817
Can you still see the light?

417
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:31,778
Yeah.

418
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,416
Yeah!

419
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:37,556
How far up?

420
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,559
I don't know. Maybe 20 feet up.
There's still stuff in the way.

421
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:46,495
What else do you see?

422
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:50,106
Beams. Plaster. Nothing.

423
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:31,209
It is with deep sadness and regret

424
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:34,282
that I have to advise you
that two hijacked planes

425
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,917
have crashed into the Twin Towers
of the World Trade Center...

426
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,544
...from what remains
of the World Trade Center for 9:00.

427
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:42,590
One airplane crashed into
World Trade Center Two.

428
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:45,592
About 15 minutes later, an airplane
crashed into the second one.

429
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:48,424
About an hour later,
both of them collapsed.

430
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:23,063
Associated Press is reporting
that a plane or helicopter

431
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:27,157
crashed at the Pentagon,
and the Pentagon is being evacuated.

432
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:32,228
Whether that fire is in the building itself
or outside, we have not yet confirmed.

433
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,802
This is a live picture of the Pentagon

434
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:39,312
and an Associated Press reporter says
he could see the tail of a large airliner

435
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,382
as it plowed into the Pentagon.

436
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:43,348
And that fire there in Washington
continues to burn.

437
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,577
Bastards!

438
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,023
...just a few minutes after that,
it wasrt very long,

439
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,191
you will see, it happened again.
The second tower came tumbling down.

440
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,633
That was the first tower collapse
that we just saw.

441
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,302
This is the collapse
of the second tower.

442
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:08,866
And so now, as we stand here,
both towers...

443
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,811
The tops of both towers are gone.

444
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:12,938
Allison, let's sit outside.

445
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:17,485
Behind somewhere that plume of smoke
that continues to rise over the...

446
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,686
He's probably still at the bus terminal.

447
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:23,986
What is left of those buildings,
we cannot tell you.

448
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:26,183
We cannot tell you.

449
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,456
- Allison.
- Jerry.

450
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:31,694
Al, I'm looking at the Tunnel.

451
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,127
There's no one there.

452
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,262
No Port Authorities there.

453
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,873
Al, I don't...

454
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,208
I guess they got called in.

455
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,341
Can you get someone to drive you?

456
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,977
- Allison?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:59,125
Okay, I'll see you at home
in half an hour.

458
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:01,755
I'll call Mom and Dad.

459
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,333
Okay.

460
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,797
We got to pick up Bianca.

461
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:14,039
Both towers came down,
trapping thousands

462
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,167
and thousands of people inside.

463
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,074
We do not know the numbers yet,

464
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,582
but we do know thousands of people
work inside those buildings.

465
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,810
That... The buildings are gone.

466
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:27,854
There are reports
that hundreds and hundreds

467
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:30,982
of fire and police and rescue crews

468
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,819
are missing or unaccounted for.

469
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:38,194
Officials seem simply stunned
by the scale of the losses...

470
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,359
They keep showing the same thing
over and over and over.

471
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,696
Jay's there.

472
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:45,772
They must have called in
every company in the city.

473
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:47,669
He would have been there early.

474
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:49,742
Yeah, John, too, probably.

475
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:52,503
He knows those buildings so well.

476
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,942
They've seen something
no one has ever seen before.

477
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,573
One man who came by said

478
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:59,515
he had seen this building come down.

479
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,088
It looked as though it was imploding.

480
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:07,354
This was complete chaos and utter hell
that has come to Lower Manattan.

481
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,860
Oh, my God.

482
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:14,965
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.

483
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:19,331
They evacuated those buildings.
All right?

484
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:22,904
I'm sure most everybody got out.
They're fine.

485
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,842
In the '93 attack,
John said everybody got out real quick.

486
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,610
God. In '93,
the buildings didn't fall down.

487
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,579
All right, well,
I'm going to call everybody and cancel.

488
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:38,648
A Den Mothers meeting right now
sounds pretty dumb, right?

489
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,668
I keep looking for John.

490
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,365
There's so many policemen
running around.

491
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,166
Maybe I'll see him.

492
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,244
- Judy.
- Yeah?

493
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:24,504
Judy...

494
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:27,306
- They're here to tell us they're dead.
- No.

495
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,002
No, they're not. They're not.

496
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:47,350
- Hey, Judy. Jay...
- No. No.

497
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:49,986
Look, we know he's alive. All right?

498
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,857
They know where he is.
They're communicating with him.

499
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,595
He's alive?

500
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:58,500
Yes. Yeah, we're gonna go
down there now and help out.

501
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:00,232
- Oh, thank God.
- Yes!

502
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,933
There you go.

503
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,806
- Thank God. Oh, my God.
- There you go.

504
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:07,435
Oh, that's good.

505
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,745
- That's good.
- Thank you, God.

506
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:16,754
PAPD.

507
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:18,820
8-13.

508
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,493
Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.

509
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:29,856
We're trapped near
the FE Five vestibule.

510
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:35,002
Will you please work?

511
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:41,106
I'm so thirsty.

512
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,716
You're not kidding.

513
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:46,343
My mouth feels like a beach.

514
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,718
- How's your pain?
- Comes in waves.

515
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:57,226
Every 20, 30 minutes.

516
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:02,264
Every wave, I feel the pain less.

517
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,604
But I'm more numb.

518
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:10,738
The number I get
the more I want to sleep.

519
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:13,505
What's wrong with sleep?

520
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:17,115
I wish I could
so this pain would go away.

521
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:21,183
You're bleeding inside, Will.

522
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,518
You sleep, you don't know
if you're coming back.

523
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,324
Awake, at least you got a shot.

524
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:32,596
Your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.

525
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:36,001
That's what I think, anyway.

526
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:40,835
You know that movie, G.I. Jane?

527
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,669
What's-her-name?

528
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:48,973
- Yeah, Demi Moore.
- Yeah.

529
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,578
You know the part where
the drill sergeant says,

530
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:58,583
"Pain is good. Pain is your friend.
If you're feeling pain you're still alive"?

531
00:43:00,492 --> 00:43:02,460
I didn't see the movie.

532
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:05,897
I keep thinking of that line.

533
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,233
Pain is your friend.

534
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:11,327
It means you're alive.

535
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:14,832
We'll make it, Will.

536
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:17,605
Just don't go to sleep.

537
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,718
Sarge, I got a fire here!

538
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,011
Sarge!

539
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,455
There's nothing I can do here!

540
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,986
Sarge!

541
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:48,202
I'm burning! I'm burning!

542
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:02,753
Please God.

543
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:05,688
Where'd that wind come from
all of a sudden, Sarge?

544
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,157
I don't know.

545
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:12,326
The fire just goes out like that, Sarge?

546
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,564
Why's that?

547
00:44:16,702 --> 00:44:17,964
I don't know.

548
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:21,330
You're not a big talker, are you?

549
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:23,634
No.

550
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:25,903
Well, see, you got to talk to me 'cause...

551
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:36,309
I can't,
'cause my knees are crushed together!

552
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:38,523
That's why I can't fucking talk!

553
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,420
Oh, God!

554
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,626
Oh, God. Oh, God.

555
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:50,995
Holy shit!

556
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:59,033
Dom's gun is cooking off!

557
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:01,403
Will!

558
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:11,988
Will! Will, that's it!
All the rounds got to be done, Will.

559
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:15,014
I can't believe this is happening!

560
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,153
- Not in my whole goddamn life!
- Breathe, Will.

561
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,592
Come on, breathe.

562
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,898
Get your mind right!

563
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,503
Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.

564
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:40,317
...Pennsylvania. This is where
the United Airlines flight,

565
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:42,716
I believe it is 176...

566
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,847
I'm sorry, I'm correcting...
United Airlines 93...

567
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,825
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can't make
that kind of assessment yet.

568
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,188
- We just...
- Is that Allison Jimeno?

569
00:45:51,294 --> 00:45:53,626
We grew up together.
Let me talk to her.

570
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:56,229
Al, it's Brian. I just got in.

571
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,233
- Hi, Brian.
- Allison,

572
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:02,002
listen, they sent Will down on a bus
with a bunch of the guys.

573
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:05,965
- So he did go down there?
- Yeah.

574
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,679
And did he go in the buildings?

575
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:14,480
We don't know.

576
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:19,080
Brian, did he go in the buildings
or did he not go in the buildings?

577
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:20,918
We're trying to find that out.

578
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:25,427
It's very basic.
Did he go in or did he not go in?

579
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:28,064
Allison, I'll call you
as soon as we know.

580
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,461
Bianca? Sweetie, I'm sorry.

581
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:34,902
Brian, I... Brian, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

582
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:36,064
- I'll take Bianca to my place.
- No.

583
00:46:36,174 --> 00:46:37,505
- I'll keep her here. I wanna...
- My parents are there.

584
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:41,066
They'll take care of her. Okay?
She'll be five houses away.

585
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,146
Want to go play?

586
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:45,282
...shards of metal coming past...

587
00:46:45,383 --> 00:46:46,441
Brian?

588
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,985
President Bush was in Florida
when the attacks began.

589
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:53,818
He spoke a short time ago
from an Air Force base in Louisiana.

590
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:55,415
Here's some of what the President said.

591
00:46:55,526 --> 00:47:00,623
The resolve of our great nation
is being tested.

592
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:06,000
But make no mistake, we will show
the world that we will pass this test.

593
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:07,496
God bless.

594
00:47:07,604 --> 00:47:10,095
We're told the President's plane
has flown on,

595
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,674
but for security reasons,

596
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:15,643
the government will not say where
Mr. Bush is going or for how long.

597
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:19,237
I don't know if you guys know it yet,
but this country's at war.

598
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:50,309
Pastor, I gotta go down there.

599
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,511
- Where?
- New York.

600
00:47:55,652 --> 00:48:00,521
You can't. Only emergency responders
are being allowed in.

601
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:07,997
I've spent my best years
with the Marines.

602
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,163
God gave me a gift
to be able to help people,

603
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,964
to defend our country.

604
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:20,305
And I feel him calling on me now
for this mission.

605
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:24,511
Then find a way to listen, Dave.

606
00:48:33,888 --> 00:48:36,550
I'll leave that to you
to determine just how widespread

607
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:40,926
the human loss will be
in New York City alone.

608
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:46,794
America has changed today.
This is a dark day in this country.

609
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,429
It's in bold print in future history books

610
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:54,134
about how America was attacked
within its continental borders

611
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:56,677
to devastating effect by terrorists

612
00:48:56,778 --> 00:49:01,147
in a coordinated assault
using hijacked civilian airliners.

613
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:04,311
- Hey, Mom?
- Yes, sweetie.

614
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:07,149
Dad knows it's
my birthday party Saturday, right?

615
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:10,322
Your birthday, are you crazy?
Of course he does.

616
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:11,517
He's just...

617
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:15,119
He's still working to help people
at the disaster at the Trade Center.

618
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,597
But they keep saying a lot
of those people aren't coming back.

619
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:24,103
I'm not supposed to tell you this, okay?

620
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:27,472
But he told me that he was gonna
take you to the playoffs next month.

621
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:30,476
- The playoffs? Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

622
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:33,172
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? I knew it.
I knew he was going to.

623
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:35,249
Mom, you better come here.

624
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:49,522
Stay here, okay?

625
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:52,027
What's wrong?

626
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,198
Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.

627
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:58,068
If anything happens to one of them,
they go and tell the other family.

628
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,505
Are you here to tell me something?

629
00:50:07,415 --> 00:50:10,407
Don't come in here, Pat. I mean it.
Don't you come into this house.

630
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:11,917
Donna, he's not.

631
00:50:12,153 --> 00:50:13,814
We don't know. We don't know.

632
00:50:13,921 --> 00:50:16,355
They've declared him as missing,
that's all. He's just missing.

633
00:50:16,457 --> 00:50:18,891
I know. I know. I'm with you. Come here.

634
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,954
I know.

635
00:50:24,665 --> 00:50:27,361
We got confirmation. John went in.

636
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,543
Oh, Dad.

637
00:50:47,988 --> 00:50:49,785
It's okay, baby.

638
00:50:50,457 --> 00:50:52,687
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

639
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:56,262
Hey. Hey.

640
00:50:58,398 --> 00:51:01,697
Will's a tough nut. He's gonna make it.

641
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:03,896
- I know it, honey.
- Dad.

642
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:05,528
- I just know it. Come on.
- Dad.

643
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:07,128
- Dad.
- Your mom's out there.

644
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,901
- I'll clean you up.
- Dad.

645
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,137
What?

646
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,977
How...

647
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:20,813
How would I tell Bianca
her father's dead?

648
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,226
Missing means missing, Ma.
It doesn't mean dead.

649
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:30,820
She's very strong.
She's gonna be all right.

650
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:32,631
- Jer.
- Yeah.

651
00:51:34,335 --> 00:51:37,031
We've got to call a doctor.
Give her something fast.

652
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:40,099
- Why?
- She could lose it.

653
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:42,207
What is happening to this world?

654
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:46,105
...of this horrible and vicious
act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.

655
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:51,206
And our focus now has to be
on saving as many lives as possible.

656
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,808
Do we know the number of casualties
at this point?

657
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,219
I don't think we really want
to speculate about that.

658
00:51:57,757 --> 00:52:03,457
The number of casualties will be more
than any of us can bear, ultimately.

659
00:52:05,698 --> 00:52:07,495
Sounded like a truck bomb.

660
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:10,097
Like in '93.

661
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:14,798
Blasted out the lobby.
Pushed everything in here.

662
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,875
Concourse must have collapsed.

663
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,150
You never answered, Sarge.

664
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:27,052
What have we got?

665
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:32,284
How long does this
internal bleeding take?

666
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,328
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

667
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,994
Twenty-four hours
is the most I've heard of. Maybe 14,

668
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:43,399
16.

669
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,268
Just don't sleep.

670
00:52:49,242 --> 00:52:52,973
So we've been in six, seven hours.
What does that mean?

671
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,308
Another seven, eight hours from now?

672
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:07,454
You remember that earthquake?
Where was it? Turkey?

673
00:53:08,193 --> 00:53:10,093
There was a little girl there.

674
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:13,754
She lived four days
buried in the rubble like this.

675
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:17,202
She was, like,
three years old or something.

676
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,636
If she could make it, we can make it.

677
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:27,446
Maybe we ain't bleeding so bad inside.

678
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,557
- Sarge?
- Yeah, Will.

679
00:53:39,994 --> 00:53:41,621
You got any kids?

680
00:53:42,897 --> 00:53:45,161
Four. I got four.

681
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:49,761
- That's a lot of kids.
- Yeah.

682
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:54,636
It's a lot of work for my wife.

683
00:53:56,243 --> 00:53:57,870
What are their names?

684
00:53:58,012 --> 00:54:00,412
Steven. He's the oldest.

685
00:54:01,148 --> 00:54:02,615
He's 15.

686
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,514
Caitlirs 12. Peanut.

687
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:14,688
JJ, he's 10.

688
00:54:18,064 --> 00:54:20,032
We got a little girl.

689
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:22,598
Erin.

690
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,697
She's four.

691
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,974
We had her late.

692
00:54:31,845 --> 00:54:35,474
It wasrt planned. It just... It happened.

693
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:40,547
I don't know.

694
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:55,629
- What's that?
- What's what?

695
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:57,729
That sound.

696
00:54:58,371 --> 00:55:00,168
I got a pipe here.

697
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:03,976
Keep doing that!

698
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:32,537
What about JJ's tuition?

699
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:37,670
- It's not easy.
- Right.

700
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,773
Did you vomit yesterday?

701
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:44,279
Yeah. Yeah, yesterday and today.

702
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,544
- And today?
- Yeah.

703
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:50,384
You know what?
I probably just have the flu, hon.

704
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:51,820
Yeah? Okay.

705
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,320
So, wait...

706
00:55:56,428 --> 00:55:59,262
Yeah, there's supposed to be a stripe.

707
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:01,765
- A stripe? It's a stripe.
- Yeah.

708
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:03,495
Yeah, it's a stripe.

709
00:56:06,706 --> 00:56:08,003
That's good.

710
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:10,632
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.

711
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,506
Yeah, it's good. Yeah.

712
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:16,006
It's good.

713
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:19,482
...seems just like a ghost town
in the financial district. Very eerie.

714
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:22,054
You saw people being wheeled
on gurneys

715
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,383
away from the site of the explosions.

716
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,754
People were coming out
with masks over their face,

717
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:28,326
anything they could put over their face

718
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,623
because the air was
still very thick with debris.

719
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,699
The ash on the ground
is at least two inches thick.

720
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,096
It's more like snow cover.

721
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,531
Mom, listen.

722
00:56:38,704 --> 00:56:40,262
Officials are saying that as many

723
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:44,274
as 400 police, fire and rescue teams
entered the towers,

724
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:48,210
and there are fears that half of them
are missing and feared lost.

725
00:56:48,313 --> 00:56:50,838
We are waiting for more
on the survivors.

726
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,513
There are no clear estimates
yet on numbers,

727
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:56,986
but it is clear that many
of New York's finest

728
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:58,954
have been lost on this day.

729
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:01,958
These are the so-called
first responders.

730
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,425
Oh, my God.

731
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:07,759
That's so many.
What are we going to do?

732
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:10,258
Mom, let's go get him.

733
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,102
Can we just go to the city and find Dad?

734
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:16,868
- We don't even know where he is.
- You're gonna go drive and get him?

735
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,239
- Can't you call someone?
- The phones don't work.

736
00:57:19,344 --> 00:57:21,005
Come on, JJ,
there's really nothing we could do.

737
00:57:21,113 --> 00:57:23,946
- You're just worried about your birthday.
- No, Caitlin, stop it.

738
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:26,313
He needs us. I know if we just go
down there, we can find him.

739
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:27,783
Dad doesn't need you to go find him.

740
00:57:27,886 --> 00:57:28,910
Come on, Mom, please.

741
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:32,081
JJ, would you just stop it?
Stop it for a minute. Okay?

742
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,782
They'll call when they know something.

743
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:36,793
Lay off your ma, please. This is tough
enough on everybody. Come on.

744
00:57:38,697 --> 00:57:40,324
You don't really care, do you?

745
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,597
I'll go talk to him.

746
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:50,736
Hey, JJ, come on.
Come back here, kid. Let's go.

747
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:53,069
He's scared. He's just a kid.

748
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,177
Yeah.

749
00:57:56,247 --> 00:57:57,874
He's right, you know?

750
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,381
I don't even remember
the last thing I said to John.

751
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,991
Excuse me.

752
00:58:20,638 --> 00:58:21,628
This is it.

753
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,370
I'm sorry. No, sir.
Nobody gets by here. Nobody gets by.

754
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:27,638
United States Marines.

755
00:58:27,746 --> 00:58:30,909
- Sure thing. Is your unit down there?
- Yes, sir.

756
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:03,672
I'm gonna take a 3-8, Sarge.

757
00:59:05,683 --> 00:59:06,809
Okay.

758
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:11,954
Just don't go to sleep.

759
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:18,055
"Let me get that."

760
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,556
What?

761
00:59:21,932 --> 00:59:23,957
That's what he said to me.

762
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:25,999
Antonio.

763
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:28,833
"Will, let me get that."

764
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,666
The can't.

765
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:36,576
If he hadrt switched places with me...

766
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,416
And Dom.

767
00:59:42,853 --> 00:59:44,320
I made him stay and help me.

768
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:47,451
I told him to stay.

769
00:59:48,692 --> 00:59:50,489
Yeah, I begged him.

770
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:55,389
"Don't leave me, Dom.
Please don't leave me." And he stayed.

771
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,298
You know, there was time.
He could have gotten out.

772
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:03,197
And Chris. After being cut so bad,
he didn't have to go in.

773
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,077
You tell them.

774
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:14,172
You tell them.

775
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:20,312
I took them in.

776
01:00:22,525 --> 01:00:23,787
For what?

777
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:28,492
What good did we do?

778
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:30,928
We wanted to go in.

779
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:32,826
Kassimatis said you were the best.

780
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:35,234
You were the guy
who knew everything down here.

781
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:40,400
Dom, Antonio and Chris, nothing was
gonna stop them from trying to help.

782
01:00:40,944 --> 01:00:44,073
We figured
we might as well follow the best guy in.

783
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:46,575
The best?

784
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,150
They did what they had to do, Sarge.

785
01:00:49,553 --> 01:00:52,818
They couldn't have lived
with themselves if they hadrt gone in.

786
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:54,590
That's who they were.

787
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:57,720
Okay.

788
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,488
Thank you, Will.

789
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:14,737
Will?

790
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:20,405
If this is it,
I am gonna see you someplace better.

791
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:24,251
Sarge, I don't know you too good...

792
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:25,582
Our Father...

793
01:01:25,688 --> 01:01:26,848
...but I love you!

794
01:01:26,956 --> 01:01:28,423
...who art in heaven...

795
01:01:28,691 --> 01:01:30,386
- Goodbye, John!
...hallowed be thy name.

796
01:01:30,693 --> 01:01:33,992
Give us this day our daily bread...

797
01:01:34,264 --> 01:01:37,392
Thank you, God, Allison and Bianca,

798
01:01:37,934 --> 01:01:39,731
who needs a daddy.

799
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,068
Oh, God! Forgive us

800
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:47,000
our trespasses as we...

801
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,737
Let her know I love her!

802
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:51,310
...forgive those
who trespass against us!

803
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:45,559
John?

804
01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:48,900
You there?

805
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:56,506
Yeah, Will.

806
01:02:59,381 --> 01:03:00,643
I'm here.

807
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:04,342
I'm still here.

808
01:03:09,192 --> 01:03:12,161
About 20 minutes ago,
we were reporting on another building

809
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:14,195
at the site of the World Trade Center

810
01:03:14,297 --> 01:03:16,925
that they referred to as Building Seven.

811
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:20,332
Officials were watching
very closely because

812
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:23,405
it was on fire
and in danger of collapsing.

813
01:03:23,773 --> 01:03:26,264
Well, moments ago, it did collapse.

814
01:03:26,676 --> 01:03:29,645
So that would be the third building
in the World Trade Center complex

815
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:31,680
that has collapsed today.

816
01:03:31,781 --> 01:03:34,409
There are no reports yet
of additional casualties...

817
01:03:39,255 --> 01:03:40,654
Rescue officials in the area

818
01:03:40,757 --> 01:03:42,622
have suspended
the search for survivors.

819
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:49,630
No word yet on when rescue teams
might get back to trying to find anyone...

820
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:51,790
That's a lot of guys not with him.

821
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,665
Port Authority Police.
Sergeant King speaking.

822
01:04:30,105 --> 01:04:34,166
I got cars cooking off.
I got rounds flying all over the place.

823
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:39,171
I've got guns all over the place.
Now back off. It's getting dark out.

824
01:04:39,281 --> 01:04:41,749
Chief, you got to let us in.
My whole battaliors in here, Chief.

825
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,318
- There's still guys in there.
- I know it, boys. Not tonight.

826
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:47,855
Tomorrow's another day.
It'll be dark in a half an hour, man!

827
01:04:47,956 --> 01:04:52,723
God bless their souls,
but I'm not letting you join them!

828
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:15,880
Everybody report to the station there.

829
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:30,398
What's the status here?

830
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:32,728
The search has been called off.

831
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:36,565
They say the Marriott's gonna go, too,
and until it's more stable, we're out.

832
01:05:39,007 --> 01:05:41,237
This whole thing is crap, man.

833
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:44,039
Our guys are in there.
They're dying in there.

834
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:49,951
It's like God made a curtain
with the smoke,

835
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:53,916
shielding us
from what we're not yet ready to see.

836
01:05:57,492 --> 01:05:59,221
All right, nut bag.

837
01:06:52,413 --> 01:06:54,381
Didrt even finish them.

838
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:14,894
...a 45-degree angle.

839
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,468
See? Okay?

840
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:21,438
You put the plywood here.
Put the saw here. Nice and easy.

841
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:24,099
Don't force anything. All right?

842
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,838
Want to try again? Okay.

843
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:34,346
Don't force it. There you go.

844
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:53,662
Sarge? You never told me
your wife's name.

845
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,541
It's Donna.

846
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:01,475
Donna? That's a good name.

847
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,611
It's real American, you know?

848
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,353
Mine's Allison.

849
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:10,548
She's Italian and some German.

850
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:13,619
Don't get her mad.

851
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:16,656
Yeah. She's a wild one.

852
01:08:17,231 --> 01:08:21,691
Donna can get mad, too.
She wants a new kitchen.

853
01:08:23,003 --> 01:08:26,632
I'm okay carpenter, so

854
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:29,537
I'm building her one.

855
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:32,907
There's no cabinets right now.

856
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,447
She's pissed.

857
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:38,509
So

858
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:41,950
I got to get out of here.

859
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:45,583
Donna, she's...

860
01:08:49,562 --> 01:08:51,996
I married the right one, you know?

861
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, I know.

862
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,163
Me, too.

863
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,039
Tell me about your wife.

864
01:09:01,874 --> 01:09:03,364
Well, she's

865
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:07,744
five months pregnant now.

866
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:11,049
It's gonna be a girl.

867
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:15,820
I already got one. Bianca.

868
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:17,754
She's four.

869
01:09:53,592 --> 01:09:55,492
You got to name Bianca.

870
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:58,860
You love that name Bianca.

871
01:09:58,964 --> 01:10:01,660
No. I love the name, but you picked it.

872
01:10:02,868 --> 01:10:03,994
So?

873
01:10:04,803 --> 01:10:07,271
So I get to choose the name this time.

874
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,837
Alyssa.

875
01:10:10,776 --> 01:10:12,243
Alyssa?

876
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:16,771
Kids are gonna love that name.
"Alyssa the pisser."

877
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:19,508
Look, I like Olivia.

878
01:10:20,153 --> 01:10:23,589
Olivia? Olivia sounds like Olive Oyl.

879
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:24,986
- Will.
- What?

880
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:27,089
Olivia.

881
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:30,356
Olivia Jimeno.

882
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:08,357
I'm naming the baby Alyssa.

883
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:11,061
It's what Will wanted.

884
01:11:15,607 --> 01:11:16,904
What?

885
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:20,437
- I'm gonna pick up that prescription.
- What prescription?

886
01:11:20,946 --> 01:11:23,847
The doc called in
a prescription for you, honey.

887
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:25,416
You know, for the baby.

888
01:11:26,384 --> 01:11:28,818
Said we got to have it on hand,
just in case.

889
01:11:29,654 --> 01:11:30,814
In case what?

890
01:11:31,723 --> 01:11:34,283
In case you need it, honey. You know?

891
01:11:37,262 --> 01:11:39,287
- I'll go with Jerry.
- No, Allison...

892
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:43,163
I'm not sitting here waiting for a call
that Will's dead.

893
01:11:43,768 --> 01:11:45,326
- Allison...
- I'm coming, too.

894
01:11:58,049 --> 01:11:59,073
What am I doing here?

895
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:01,175
- AI, you all right?
- Yeah.

896
01:12:01,486 --> 01:12:03,146
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

897
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:07,287
Will could be never coming home.

898
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:11,522
I'm walking around CVS
like there's nothing wrong.

899
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:12,062
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

900
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:13,427
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

901
01:12:13,531 --> 01:12:15,761
You have your cell phone?

902
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:19,633
I left it.

903
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:21,602
Karen, you have your cell phone?

904
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:22,797
Karen.

905
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:28,003
I forgot it.

906
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:31,311
We left the house with no phone?

907
01:12:56,908 --> 01:12:58,432
Al, what are you doing?

908
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:01,512
Got to get home.
This stupid light is taking forever!

909
01:13:01,613 --> 01:13:02,910
Come on!

910
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:07,518
- Allison!
- AI.

911
01:13:07,752 --> 01:13:11,984
Allison! Would you get back
in the goddamn car?

912
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,687
We're going home.

913
01:13:21,599 --> 01:13:23,032
Did he call?

914
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:39,841
Sarge?

915
01:13:40,818 --> 01:13:43,446
I don't think
I'm gonna make it to the morning.

916
01:13:46,557 --> 01:13:48,149
- I feel like...
- Will.

917
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:50,754
- Like...
- Will.

918
01:13:51,395 --> 01:13:54,956
You die, I'm gonna die.

919
01:13:56,267 --> 01:13:57,666
Okay?

920
01:13:58,335 --> 01:13:59,529
You die,

921
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:03,036
I'm just gonna die.

922
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:07,536
Well, you can't die, either.

923
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:10,278
Sounds good.

924
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:13,242
But in case...

925
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:16,714
You think you could do me a favor?

926
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:19,021
What's that?

927
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:21,717
Could you put it out over the radio

928
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:24,884
that I request

929
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,398
my daughter to be named Olivia?

930
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:32,831
And tell them

931
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,264
to tell Allison that I love her,

932
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,237
and that she should name
my daughter Olivia.

933
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,183
8-13.

934
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,320
This is McLoughlin

935
01:14:57,393 --> 01:14:58,485
PAPD.

936
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:04,162
Officer Jimeno requests
his daughter be named

937
01:15:05,135 --> 01:15:06,329
Olivia.

938
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:09,663
Officer Jimeno

939
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:15,169
would like his wife, Allison,

940
01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:18,641
to know he loves her.

941
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:25,451
Further to that,

942
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:30,990
please tell

943
01:15:32,096 --> 01:15:33,563
my family

944
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:37,295
I love them

945
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,069
very much.

946
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,371
Jeez Louise.

947
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:11,183
JJ!

948
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,454
...psychologically across the country.

949
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,424
It's had such an enormous...

950
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:26,031
JJ, what are you doing?

951
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,769
I told you before.

952
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:35,347
- Sweetie, get out of the car.
- No.

953
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:39,319
- JJ, get out of this car. Now!
- No.

954
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,355
- Don't say no to me.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:43,618
- Don't you want to find him?
- Yes, I want to find him.

956
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:45,956
- What if he's dying?
- There's nothing that we can do.

957
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,620
What if we never see him again?

958
01:17:58,374 --> 01:17:59,841
All right, I'll go. Get out.

959
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,805
I said I'm going. Now, come on.

960
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,273
You want some tuna without the bread?

961
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:10,310
No, Mom, I'm not hungry.

962
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,421
You have to eat something.

963
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,089
The baby's going through this,
too, honey.

964
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,289
How about a waffle?

965
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,696
Forget it, Patricia. She'd throw it up.

966
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,513
I could cook up some macaroni.

967
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:49,122
No, that's okay, Ma.
I'm going to put Bianca to bed.

968
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,995
It's also a great test for us all,

969
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:59,260
wherever we live, whatever our age,
whatever our beliefs.

970
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:04,170
Just look at that scene
and think about what happened today.

971
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:10,039
Rescue officials predict that hundreds,
if not thousands...

972
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,441
- Mommy!
- Hey, baby.

973
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,430
Is Daddy coming home?

974
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,098
Honey,

975
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:17,211
I don't know.

976
01:20:49,009 --> 01:20:52,945
United States Marines!
If anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

977
01:20:58,218 --> 01:21:01,915
United States Marines.
If anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

978
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:07,219
United States Marine?

979
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:15,961
Are you heading in, too, Devil Dog?

980
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:20,269
I've reconned the area, Sergeant.

981
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:25,205
Our best shot is going up.

982
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:28,244
All right.

983
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:35,720
Someone says stop, you don't stop.

984
01:21:35,822 --> 01:21:38,620
You don't hear them.
There's no going back.

985
01:21:40,026 --> 01:21:41,323
Let's go.

986
01:21:42,428 --> 01:21:43,725
Thomas.

987
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,794
Karnes.

988
01:21:56,943 --> 01:22:00,401
United States Marines.
If you can hear me, yell or tap.

989
01:22:42,556 --> 01:22:43,853
Sarge?

990
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:46,717
John.

991
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:50,288
Yeah.

992
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:55,000
The most amazing thing just happened.

993
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:57,993
I saw Jesus.

994
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:02,674
And you know what?

995
01:23:04,644 --> 01:23:06,635
He had a bottle of water.

996
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:11,644
And I could have drunk it, you know?

997
01:23:12,685 --> 01:23:14,482
But I didn't drink it.

998
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:19,087
He's telling us something, Sarge.

999
01:23:20,693 --> 01:23:22,820
He's telling us to come home.

1000
01:23:26,732 --> 01:23:28,597
Don't sleep on me, John.

1001
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:31,500
No.

1002
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:34,768
The pairs keeping me alive.

1003
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:38,276
Keep talking.

1004
01:23:41,948 --> 01:23:44,178
You remember Starsky and Hutch?

1005
01:23:45,918 --> 01:23:48,443
When I was a kid, it was on TV.

1006
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:52,086
I remember the theme song.

1007
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:00,197
When that would come on,

1008
01:24:00,298 --> 01:24:03,665
I'd run around the house
and arrest my sister, Karen.

1009
01:24:07,806 --> 01:24:10,036
Took me six years to be a cop.

1010
01:24:12,878 --> 01:24:15,278
The only thing
I ever wanted to be was a cop.

1011
01:24:17,215 --> 01:24:18,842
How long you been in?

1012
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:22,748
Twenty-one years.

1013
01:24:23,488 --> 01:24:25,115
Boy, that's a lifetime.

1014
01:24:27,893 --> 01:24:30,020
You're one tough guy, Sergeant.

1015
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:35,497
I don't smile a lot.

1016
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,799
That's why I'm not

1017
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:45,900
lieutenant.

1018
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:48,243
People

1019
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:51,982
don't like me 'cause

1020
01:24:53,019 --> 01:24:56,045
I don't smile a lot.

1021
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:08,292
Yeah, that's it. You got it.

1022
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,398
We got Frank Sinatra over here.

1023
01:25:26,851 --> 01:25:29,342
If you can hear me, yell or tap!

1024
01:25:58,216 --> 01:25:59,513
John.

1025
01:26:00,685 --> 01:26:02,312
John.

1026
01:26:03,521 --> 01:26:05,318
Remember what you said?

1027
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:08,882
You sleep, you ain't coming back.

1028
01:26:09,594 --> 01:26:12,461
You got to come back,
'cause we're getting out of here.

1029
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:24,170
Sarge!

1030
01:26:27,444 --> 01:26:29,071
John McLoughlin!

1031
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:33,243
If you can hear me, yell or tap!

1032
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:35,544
Can you hear me?

1033
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:39,185
Are you sleeping?

1034
01:26:42,826 --> 01:26:44,088
Sarge!

1035
01:26:47,664 --> 01:26:48,858
Will?

1036
01:26:52,503 --> 01:26:53,970
Where are we?

1037
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:56,937
In hell.

1038
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,574
We're alive in hell.

1039
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,507
How about that, John?

1040
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,281
Pipe.

1041
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,314
Keep trying.

1042
01:27:11,723 --> 01:27:13,054
Try the pipe.

1043
01:27:26,204 --> 01:27:27,228
Good.

1044
01:27:28,273 --> 01:27:29,740
Keep doing it.

1045
01:27:39,917 --> 01:27:41,544
We could circle back.

1046
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:48,718
Never mind.

1047
01:27:53,797 --> 01:27:54,923
Yeah.

1048
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:03,736
We hear you!

1049
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,502
We hear you!

1050
01:28:10,614 --> 01:28:11,911
- Go!
- Keep yelling!

1051
01:28:12,816 --> 01:28:16,013
8-13! PAPD down!

1052
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,852
- Who's down there?
- PAPD.

1053
01:28:18,956 --> 01:28:20,583
McLoughlin and Jimeno.

1054
01:28:22,192 --> 01:28:24,160
- Hello?
- Here!

1055
01:28:25,129 --> 01:28:26,426
I don't see you!

1056
01:28:26,697 --> 01:28:28,164
You got to be kidding me.

1057
01:28:29,366 --> 01:28:30,663
Here!

1058
01:28:32,536 --> 01:28:33,730
Gotcha.

1059
01:28:33,837 --> 01:28:35,134
Gotcha!

1060
01:28:39,743 --> 01:28:42,075
Just hang on! Just hang on, okay?

1061
01:28:42,713 --> 01:28:45,112
Don't leave us.
We've been here a long time.

1062
01:28:45,214 --> 01:28:49,378
We're not leaving you, buddy.
We're Marines. You are our mission.

1063
01:28:51,287 --> 01:28:54,085
That's great! Oh, that's great!

1064
01:28:58,961 --> 01:29:00,758
The Marines, John!

1065
01:29:01,964 --> 01:29:03,932
Can you believe that?

1066
01:29:09,472 --> 01:29:11,667
Sergeant, if we leave this spot,
we might never make it back.

1067
01:29:11,774 --> 01:29:13,241
That's what I'm thinking.

1068
01:29:15,444 --> 01:29:17,309
- It's overloaded?
- Yeah.

1069
01:29:20,717 --> 01:29:22,685
My sister in Pittsburgh.

1070
01:29:25,455 --> 01:29:26,854
Hello?

1071
01:29:27,157 --> 01:29:29,125
It's me. I'm at the Trade Center.

1072
01:29:29,526 --> 01:29:30,925
Yeah. Emergency Command.

1073
01:29:33,297 --> 01:29:35,424
You got an exact location on that?

1074
01:29:39,303 --> 01:29:40,463
Great. Yeah.

1075
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:44,007
Guys, I got two Port Authority cops
found in the middle of the rubble.

1076
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,665
They're still alive.

1077
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:56,915
I got it.

1078
01:30:01,123 --> 01:30:02,750
Thank God!

1079
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:05,519
They found him, Donna!
You hear that? They got him.

1080
01:30:05,628 --> 01:30:08,062
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. All right.

1081
01:30:08,631 --> 01:30:11,099
All right. All right. Thank you.
We're on our way.

1082
01:30:12,368 --> 01:30:15,132
He's okay! The son of a bitch
walked right out onto Liberty Street.

1083
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:17,502
They want us to meet him
at the bus terminal.

1084
01:30:17,607 --> 01:30:19,939
I am going to kick his ass
when I see him!

1085
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:23,579
He just walked right out.

1086
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,207
He just walked right out.

1087
01:30:36,025 --> 01:30:38,084
- Allison, he's alive.
- What?

1088
01:30:38,194 --> 01:30:40,662
He's alive. They couldn't kill him.
They couldn't kill him.

1089
01:30:40,763 --> 01:30:41,730
They found him.

1090
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:44,190
He's trapped,
but they're digging him out right now.

1091
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:47,599
He's the toughest son of a gun I know.
He's made of rocks, is he not?

1092
01:30:48,404 --> 01:30:50,201
- He's coming home.
- Come on. Let's go.

1093
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,399
Have you been working out?
I can't keep up to you here.

1094
01:31:04,453 --> 01:31:06,511
I told you. Didrt I tell you?

1095
01:31:06,621 --> 01:31:08,748
So where are we supposed
to pick him up?

1096
01:31:09,157 --> 01:31:11,125
Where are we supposed to pick him up?

1097
01:31:12,994 --> 01:31:14,291
No one asked?

1098
01:31:14,462 --> 01:31:16,589
Jerry! What're you doing?

1099
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:30,837
- You're the Marine?
- Yeah.

1100
01:31:30,945 --> 01:31:33,573
Scott Strauss, Emergency Service Unit.

1101
01:31:36,685 --> 01:31:38,915
What do we got? How many
are down there? Two down there?

1102
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,147
They're Port Authority cops.

1103
01:31:41,623 --> 01:31:44,320
The first one's down about 20 feet,
in pretty bad shape.

1104
01:31:44,427 --> 01:31:46,088
The second one's even deeper.

1105
01:31:46,362 --> 01:31:50,662
It's a tough hole to get down,
but they're in there, and they're alive.

1106
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:52,763
We got to hold them off, Paddy.

1107
01:31:53,302 --> 01:31:54,599
All right, listen up.

1108
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:57,198
No one make any sudden moves.
All right?

1109
01:31:57,306 --> 01:32:00,207
This whole thing's
like a pile of pick-up sticks.

1110
01:32:00,676 --> 01:32:03,167
- Is there any F.D. Up here?
- Any F.D. Up here?

1111
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:04,644
- Ed! Ed.
- Yeah.

1112
01:32:04,747 --> 01:32:07,307
Go back to Church.
Get the fire department up here.

1113
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,474
Got it.

1114
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:10,848
Is Captain Yee on the radio?
Captain Yee on the air?

1115
01:32:10,953 --> 01:32:12,079
On the air.

1116
01:32:12,188 --> 01:32:14,850
- Captain. Captain, it's Scott Strauss.
- Go ahead.

1117
01:32:14,957 --> 01:32:17,152
I got two cops here buried in the rubble.

1118
01:32:18,126 --> 01:32:21,584
Right in the pile near the globe.
I need equipment and manpower.

1119
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:24,558
Also get F.D. Up here forthwith.
We're gonna burn.

1120
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:25,963
Got it, Scotty. Stay safe.

1121
01:32:26,134 --> 01:32:28,602
I need a paramedic!
Who here's a medic?

1122
01:32:28,837 --> 01:32:30,134
I used to be.

1123
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:34,742
Used to be? Jesus Christ. Come on!
I need a paramedic here.

1124
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:37,078
My license lapsed.

1125
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:40,144
I had a few bad years.

1126
01:32:41,249 --> 01:32:43,649
But I know what I'm doing.

1127
01:32:44,686 --> 01:32:45,948
I'm good.

1128
01:32:46,054 --> 01:32:49,421
You know this whole thing
could collapse on our heads and kill us?

1129
01:32:50,325 --> 01:32:51,622
Yeah.

1130
01:32:53,228 --> 01:32:54,525
What's your name?

1131
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:56,519
Chuck Sereika.

1132
01:32:56,865 --> 01:32:59,095
I'm Scott. Come on. All right.

1133
01:33:00,602 --> 01:33:01,591
Hey.

1134
01:33:01,703 --> 01:33:04,638
- Seen the way to one of them.
- All right, Paddy. Call it.

1135
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:06,736
It's real tight, Scotty.

1136
01:33:07,942 --> 01:33:08,909
Hey.

1137
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,578
You're never gonna get down there
with all that gear, buddy.

1138
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,807
Try this, Marine KBAR.
Best knife ever made.

1139
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:18,215
Thanks. You got a name, Marine?

1140
01:33:18,453 --> 01:33:19,943
Staff Sergeant Karnes.

1141
01:33:20,522 --> 01:33:22,490
I mean, something a little shorter.

1142
01:33:23,825 --> 01:33:25,349
Staff Sergeant.

1143
01:33:27,562 --> 01:33:29,358
- Okay.
- You all right?

1144
01:33:29,463 --> 01:33:30,430
Yeah.

1145
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,230
Okay.

1146
01:33:41,308 --> 01:33:43,208
My wife is Pat Strauss.

1147
01:33:43,944 --> 01:33:46,879
You tell her and my kids
that I love them, okay?

1148
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:53,052
You ready?

1149
01:33:53,353 --> 01:33:55,150
- Let's go.
- All right.

1150
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:06,423
Hi. Where's John McLoughlin?

1151
01:34:06,901 --> 01:34:08,596
- Mrs. McLoughlin?
- Yes.

1152
01:34:10,038 --> 01:34:13,235
He's alive,
but I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

1153
01:34:14,576 --> 01:34:15,634
Mistake?

1154
01:34:15,743 --> 01:34:17,973
When they called me,
they really thought John walked out.

1155
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,537
He didn't. He's still trapped,
but they're working on him.

1156
01:34:23,451 --> 01:34:24,975
Is he hurt bad?

1157
01:34:25,086 --> 01:34:26,053
Oh, my God.

1158
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:32,288
Oh, this is not right.

1159
01:34:32,393 --> 01:34:34,020
This is not right!

1160
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:36,663
He gave you everything,
years of his life!

1161
01:34:36,764 --> 01:34:38,755
And you can't even get this right?

1162
01:34:45,839 --> 01:34:48,273
Where is he? I'm going down there.

1163
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:51,403
I'm sorry, Mrs. McLoughlin.
It's too dangerous.

1164
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:56,149
Where are they taking him?

1165
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,947
Bellevue.

1166
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:00,919
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1167
01:35:09,796 --> 01:35:11,855
Where do we take him
when we get him out?

1168
01:35:11,965 --> 01:35:13,398
Triage at One Liberty.

1169
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,297
And what's the status of McLoughlin?

1170
01:35:15,402 --> 01:35:17,131
He's further down.
We're still working on him.

1171
01:35:21,742 --> 01:35:23,539
Easy, easy.

1172
01:35:24,378 --> 01:35:26,573
We need more length! Kink it!

1173
01:35:31,785 --> 01:35:33,252
What the hell?

1174
01:35:34,755 --> 01:35:36,052
- 103!
- Yeah.

1175
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,959
We need a line down here fast.

1176
01:35:54,574 --> 01:35:57,668
Okay, breathe this. Breathe. Okay.

1177
01:36:02,748 --> 01:36:04,306
Chuck, how's he doing?

1178
01:36:04,951 --> 01:36:07,749
Blood pressure's holding. He's stable.

1179
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,189
But he's swelling,
and he's getting colder.

1180
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,687
Paddy!

1181
01:36:13,426 --> 01:36:15,394
Get something to cover him, will you?

1182
01:36:16,495 --> 01:36:17,860
Hey, Willy.

1183
01:36:27,674 --> 01:36:31,542
Brother, take a blow. Take the blow.
We got fresh guys up there.

1184
01:36:31,645 --> 01:36:32,703
All right.

1185
01:36:32,813 --> 01:36:35,441
I got to get down below you.
We got a guy down below you.

1186
01:36:45,392 --> 01:36:46,984
I'm sorry, Will.

1187
01:36:48,962 --> 01:36:51,396
Why can't I ever get a female cop?

1188
01:36:51,565 --> 01:36:53,192
At least somebody skinny.

1189
01:36:53,867 --> 01:36:56,267
What do you want?
My wife's a great cook.

1190
01:36:57,504 --> 01:36:59,096
She'd better be,

1191
01:36:59,673 --> 01:37:02,471
'cause I'm bringing 20 people
to that barbecue you're giving for me.

1192
01:37:02,576 --> 01:37:05,510
Scotty! They say
they can't control the fires.

1193
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,144
Building Four and Five
might come down.

1194
01:37:08,547 --> 01:37:10,515
Nothing like a little pressure, right?

1195
01:37:30,169 --> 01:37:32,660
God damn it. It's not working.

1196
01:37:32,938 --> 01:37:34,565
Try more cribbing.

1197
01:37:38,377 --> 01:37:39,844
Chuck. Paddy.

1198
01:37:40,112 --> 01:37:41,579
Just get out of here.

1199
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,782
This whole damn thing
could come down on us.

1200
01:37:44,116 --> 01:37:46,050
There's no sense in all of us
getting killed.

1201
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:48,848
You gonna pry up that slab
and get him out of here yourself?

1202
01:37:50,289 --> 01:37:52,018
I've been in and out of rehab for years.

1203
01:37:52,124 --> 01:37:55,389
Finally figured out the only thing
I've ever been good at is helping people.

1204
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:56,961
We're doing this together.

1205
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,858
I ain't leaving.

1206
01:37:58,964 --> 01:38:01,228
I don't mean to break up the moment,

1207
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,494
but we're all
getting out of here together.

1208
01:38:06,972 --> 01:38:09,941
Is someone there? You got water?

1209
01:38:10,876 --> 01:38:12,173
Who the hell's that?

1210
01:38:12,611 --> 01:38:14,942
I told you. That was my partner.

1211
01:38:15,714 --> 01:38:18,182
- Hey, John!
- I thought he was your partner.

1212
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,415
I'm almost out, okay?

1213
01:38:21,052 --> 01:38:23,043
They're coming soon. I promise.

1214
01:38:23,855 --> 01:38:25,948
- Okay, Will.
- Who's that?

1215
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:28,056
McLoughlin.

1216
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:31,487
Scott Strauss, ESU. How you doing?

1217
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:35,056
I'm okay. Need water.

1218
01:38:35,533 --> 01:38:39,264
We hear you. When we get Will out,
we're coming for you.

1219
01:38:40,038 --> 01:38:42,666
We can't get anything to you
down there right now, John.

1220
01:38:42,774 --> 01:38:44,401
There's just no room.

1221
01:38:48,546 --> 01:38:49,808
This guy.

1222
01:38:50,381 --> 01:38:53,180
He's gonna die
if you don't get him out soon.

1223
01:38:53,452 --> 01:38:57,354
And the only thing in the way is my leg.
I want you to cut it off.

1224
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,086
Just cut it off. I can live without a leg.

1225
01:39:04,463 --> 01:39:05,589
Okay.

1226
01:39:09,101 --> 01:39:11,729
I'm not cutting your leg off. I can't.

1227
01:39:12,538 --> 01:39:15,268
You're coming out in one piece,
you hear me?

1228
01:39:15,374 --> 01:39:16,841
You gotta...

1229
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:20,838
Look, it's my leg.
Just juice me up and cut it off.

1230
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,976
If he dies, I die. That's just the way it is.

1231
01:39:24,216 --> 01:39:27,616
Look, Will,
your partner must be 20 feet deeper.

1232
01:39:27,752 --> 01:39:29,982
Probably more compacted than you.

1233
01:39:30,355 --> 01:39:34,314
Even if I cut your leg off, he's not gonna
get out of there for hours.

1234
01:39:35,026 --> 01:39:37,654
I'm sorry, man. Now, let me do my work.

1235
01:39:38,029 --> 01:39:39,826
We're going again!

1236
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:45,163
Hi.

1237
01:39:47,038 --> 01:39:50,940
Ma'am, this is Allison Jimeno.
She's Will Jimeno's wife.

1238
01:39:51,042 --> 01:39:53,135
I'm his sister.
We were told he was coming here.

1239
01:39:53,244 --> 01:39:56,611
We're asking all the family members
to please wait in the cafeteria.

1240
01:39:56,714 --> 01:39:58,306
It's over there through the doors.

1241
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,285
I can't go in there.

1242
01:40:03,388 --> 01:40:06,186
Come on.
We'll find someplace else, honey.

1243
01:40:14,966 --> 01:40:16,126
Hand it over here, boss.

1244
01:40:16,401 --> 01:40:17,698
Hey, John!

1245
01:40:18,036 --> 01:40:21,164
They're coming!
You hang in there! Okay?

1246
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:25,536
I love you, John!

1247
01:40:26,211 --> 01:40:27,974
I'm waiting for you!

1248
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,313
Don't give up, okay?

1249
01:40:37,721 --> 01:40:39,018
Will.

1250
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:40,987
Tell them

1251
01:40:42,192 --> 01:40:45,650
I'm coming, too.

1252
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:49,098
You tell them.

1253
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:50,966
It's great up here!

1254
01:40:51,702 --> 01:40:53,670
It's just so great!

1255
01:41:19,931 --> 01:41:21,899
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1256
01:41:23,134 --> 01:41:24,761
Hey, where did the buildings go?

1257
01:41:25,103 --> 01:41:27,435
They're gone, kid. They're gone.

1258
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:29,336
You're going home.

1259
01:41:41,619 --> 01:41:43,280
You done it, Will.

1260
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:47,189
You done it.

1261
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:51,354
Go to your family.

1262
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,177
Who's there?

1263
01:42:14,885 --> 01:42:17,445
No, not yet.

1264
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,467
Can you hear me?

1265
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:37,968
Not yet.

1266
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:44,672
John?

1267
01:42:45,816 --> 01:42:48,284
John, can you hear me?

1268
01:42:48,385 --> 01:42:49,852
- John!
- Easy, Scott.

1269
01:42:49,953 --> 01:42:51,079
Scotty?

1270
01:42:51,188 --> 01:42:53,782
- Down here.
- Coming to you. I'm good.

1271
01:42:54,825 --> 01:42:57,953
- I'm coming.
- It's tight.

1272
01:42:58,061 --> 01:43:00,858
I think I see him, Lou. I got him.

1273
01:43:01,097 --> 01:43:03,156
- Is he awake?
- Semi.

1274
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:06,760
John? John, can you hear me?

1275
01:43:08,371 --> 01:43:11,863
John! I'm Scott, from ESU 5.
Man, I'm not gonna leave you.

1276
01:43:11,974 --> 01:43:14,807
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to get you out of here. All right?

1277
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:16,468
- It's tight, Lou.
- All right.

1278
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:17,944
- Just send it back.
- All right.

1279
01:43:18,047 --> 01:43:20,345
Find a place to put debris.

1280
01:43:20,883 --> 01:43:23,147
Louie, bring it back.
I got an elevator shaft here.

1281
01:43:23,252 --> 01:43:24,549
You're gonna be all right, John.

1282
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:26,587
- We're not leaving you.
- Bring the Sawzall down.

1283
01:43:35,664 --> 01:43:37,929
Hang in there, John. Come on.
You'll be all right.

1284
01:43:38,035 --> 01:43:41,334
Stay with us, John. Come on.
We got you.

1285
01:43:47,611 --> 01:43:51,172
We're transporting Jimeno to Bellevue.
Have a trauma team standing by.

1286
01:43:51,281 --> 01:43:56,446
Respiratiors 26, B.P. Is 90 over 58.
Got him on 15 liters O2.

1287
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:59,255
Room's prepped.
Take him all the way down to the end.

1288
01:44:01,224 --> 01:44:04,455
Hey, they brought him in the back.
Come on.

1289
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:10,526
This way.

1290
01:44:13,035 --> 01:44:14,332
Over here.

1291
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:28,042
Oh, my God.

1292
01:44:29,185 --> 01:44:31,153
He's breathing out rocks.

1293
01:44:32,388 --> 01:44:35,221
Will? Can you hear me?

1294
01:44:35,925 --> 01:44:37,222
Hey, baby.

1295
01:44:37,626 --> 01:44:40,220
Oh, baby, are you okay?

1296
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:42,526
We're taking him to the O.R. Now.

1297
01:44:42,665 --> 01:44:45,156
They said your leg was broke.

1298
01:44:47,002 --> 01:44:48,629
Will, baby?

1299
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:51,666
They told me you were all right.

1300
01:44:58,981 --> 01:45:01,211
I want you to name her Olivia.

1301
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:07,155
No, I want Alyssa.

1302
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:09,387
For you.

1303
01:45:11,794 --> 01:45:13,159
Olivia.

1304
01:45:13,496 --> 01:45:16,021
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
take him up to O.R.

1305
01:45:16,132 --> 01:45:18,396
It'll be better for him
if you come with us, ma'am.

1306
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:19,801
Will.

1307
01:45:22,204 --> 01:45:23,761
He'll be okay, right?

1308
01:45:24,372 --> 01:45:25,771
There are some complications,

1309
01:45:25,874 --> 01:45:27,899
- but we've given him good...
- Will?

1310
01:45:28,776 --> 01:45:31,973
I'm going to name her Olivia, okay?

1311
01:45:32,947 --> 01:45:34,244
Okay.

1312
01:45:39,487 --> 01:45:42,217
John? You got two big slabs
on your chest.

1313
01:45:42,323 --> 01:45:44,154
It's the only way we're gonna
get you out of here, all right?

1314
01:45:44,259 --> 01:45:46,420
I got the big one, you got the little one.

1315
01:45:50,098 --> 01:45:51,497
Pull it off.

1316
01:45:54,269 --> 01:45:55,827
All right. John. We got one more.

1317
01:45:55,937 --> 01:45:57,871
One more, brother,
and we got your chest clear.

1318
01:45:57,972 --> 01:45:59,600
We got a good start.

1319
01:46:00,809 --> 01:46:02,743
- Joe-Joe?
- Yeah?

1320
01:46:03,445 --> 01:46:05,640
Tell Lieutenant
to get a paramedic down here.

1321
01:46:05,748 --> 01:46:08,512
- We got to get an IV in him now.
- All right.

1322
01:46:09,351 --> 01:46:11,478
We're gonna need a paramedic
down here now!

1323
01:46:12,788 --> 01:46:14,278
Come on, John. We're almost there.

1324
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,652
McLoughlin.

1325
01:46:17,092 --> 01:46:19,822
You're in good hands, John.
You're getting out of here.

1326
01:46:19,929 --> 01:46:23,194
That's it, John. That's it.
Hang in there, brother.

1327
01:46:23,732 --> 01:46:26,496
That's it. Hang in there, John.
Don't give up.

1328
01:46:26,602 --> 01:46:29,537
Don't give up. We didn't give up.
Don't you give up.

1329
01:46:30,839 --> 01:46:32,602
John, can you hear me?

1330
01:46:32,975 --> 01:46:34,169
John, wake up.

1331
01:46:34,276 --> 01:46:38,575
That's it, John, wake up. Stay with us.
Don't go nowhere.

1332
01:46:43,251 --> 01:46:45,446
Come on, John. Come on, John.

1333
01:46:46,487 --> 01:46:51,220
Stay with us, John. Don't give up.
Come on, brother. Hang in there.

1334
01:46:51,392 --> 01:46:52,689
- John.
- Come on, John.

1335
01:46:53,528 --> 01:46:55,996
Hang in there, brother.
Hang in there. Come on.

1336
01:46:56,364 --> 01:47:00,164
We're almost home.
We're almost home, man.

1337
01:47:00,268 --> 01:47:01,235
Come on.

1338
01:47:03,538 --> 01:47:05,165
Stay with us, brother.

1339
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,540
I let you down.

1340
01:47:21,155 --> 01:47:24,022
All these years, I've been so careful.

1341
01:47:25,627 --> 01:47:27,151
Now I screw up.

1342
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:30,357
I'm sorry.

1343
01:47:39,974 --> 01:47:42,841
Did I ever love you enough, honey?

1344
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:45,776
I mean,

1345
01:47:47,014 --> 01:47:51,348
did I love you good
like I was supposed to?

1346
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,588
What the hell happened?

1347
01:48:01,295 --> 01:48:03,024
I think we had it, John.

1348
01:48:05,966 --> 01:48:07,831
It was in the moments.

1349
01:48:11,505 --> 01:48:13,598
Happens to most people, I guess.

1350
01:48:14,141 --> 01:48:16,939
Me with the kids,
and you with the department.

1351
01:48:19,212 --> 01:48:21,180
Somewhere along the way

1352
01:48:23,017 --> 01:48:25,986
I guess we kind of stopped looking
at each other.

1353
01:48:30,124 --> 01:48:31,921
Come home, honey.

1354
01:48:32,727 --> 01:48:34,354
The kids need you.

1355
01:48:37,165 --> 01:48:38,291
No.

1356
01:48:41,736 --> 01:48:43,101
I need you.

1357
01:48:44,038 --> 01:48:45,437
Donna.

1358
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:47,368
I can't.

1359
01:48:48,676 --> 01:48:50,439
I can't get out of here.

1360
01:48:51,145 --> 01:48:53,943
Honey, the kitchers
not even finished yet.

1361
01:48:55,316 --> 01:48:58,443
Okay. Would you get off the kitchen?

1362
01:48:59,786 --> 01:49:01,720
Is this necessary?

1363
01:49:02,389 --> 01:49:05,324
- I'm stuck.
- Then get unstuck.

1364
01:49:06,059 --> 01:49:07,959
Get off your ass, John.

1365
01:49:08,862 --> 01:49:11,592
Just get up and come home.

1366
01:49:12,366 --> 01:49:14,800
Donna, I can't. I...

1367
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,507
You can do it.

1368
01:49:24,044 --> 01:49:25,341
John?

1369
01:49:27,981 --> 01:49:30,643
What's taking so long? Hey, you guys!

1370
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,816
One thing he said,
of all the images we've seen,

1371
01:50:04,117 --> 01:50:07,086
it is a scene of New Yorkers calmly

1372
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:09,419
evacuating...

1373
01:50:09,522 --> 01:50:10,580
Great.

1374
01:50:10,756 --> 01:50:12,724
It's not working. Don't bother.

1375
01:50:17,029 --> 01:50:19,020
Waiting's shit, isn't it?

1376
01:50:20,232 --> 01:50:22,393
If it's gonna be bad,
you just want to know it. No bullshit.

1377
01:50:22,501 --> 01:50:23,832
That's right.

1378
01:50:23,936 --> 01:50:26,598
They're digging my husband out.
They found him in the rubble.

1379
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:28,939
That's good.

1380
01:50:32,044 --> 01:50:34,274
My sors down there. Lawrence.

1381
01:50:36,182 --> 01:50:39,811
He's the elevator operator
in the South Tower. A good boy.

1382
01:50:43,689 --> 01:50:47,057
When I saw that building going down
like a pancake...

1383
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,498
Damn thing is, I yelled at him.

1384
01:50:57,504 --> 01:50:59,631
Last time, I...

1385
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:04,172
I made dinner.

1386
01:51:06,646 --> 01:51:09,877
He got held up at work.
Food went to waste.

1387
01:51:12,686 --> 01:51:14,153
And I yelled.

1388
01:51:16,857 --> 01:51:18,984
Now all I want to do is hold him.

1389
01:51:20,026 --> 01:51:21,322
I know.

1390
01:51:22,862 --> 01:51:24,159
I know.

1391
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:26,327
I know.

1392
01:51:27,099 --> 01:51:28,896
Oh, come here. Come here.

1393
01:51:29,568 --> 01:51:31,536
I know. I know, sweetie.

1394
01:51:31,804 --> 01:51:34,773
It's all right. It's all right.

1395
01:51:35,207 --> 01:51:36,504
Come here.

1396
01:51:41,213 --> 01:51:43,340
It's all right. You're okay.

1397
01:51:53,025 --> 01:51:54,322
I know.

1398
01:51:56,862 --> 01:51:58,386
Thank you so...

1399
01:51:59,365 --> 01:52:01,162
Thank you so...

1400
01:53:10,703 --> 01:53:12,034
Thank you.

1401
01:53:12,871 --> 01:53:15,169
Thank you. Thank you.

1402
01:53:15,274 --> 01:53:16,832
It'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

1403
01:53:16,942 --> 01:53:18,102
Thank you.

1404
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:20,178
- We got you, buddy.
- Hang in there, man.

1405
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:22,247
- Hang in there.
- Hang in there, John.

1406
01:53:22,348 --> 01:53:25,317
- Good job.
- We got you, man. We got you.

1407
01:53:25,517 --> 01:53:27,417
You're going home, John.
You're going home.

1408
01:53:27,519 --> 01:53:29,009
- Way to go, man.
- Thank you.

1409
01:53:29,121 --> 01:53:31,282
- Welcome home.
- God bless you, John.

1410
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:32,550
Thank you.

1411
01:53:32,658 --> 01:53:34,956
Way to go. Way to go, guy.

1412
01:54:08,693 --> 01:54:09,785
John?

1413
01:54:10,561 --> 01:54:12,290
- Hi.
- Donna.

1414
01:54:12,397 --> 01:54:13,625
Hi, baby.

1415
01:54:15,366 --> 01:54:16,765
John.

1416
01:54:17,769 --> 01:54:20,738
You kept me

1417
01:54:22,006 --> 01:54:23,633
alive.

1418
01:55:44,122 --> 01:55:45,851
You guys come
all the way from Wisconsin?

1419
01:55:45,957 --> 01:55:48,323
Yeah, those bastards.
We had to do something.

1420
01:55:49,494 --> 01:55:50,722
You want a brat?

1421
01:55:50,828 --> 01:55:52,227
Finest brat you'll get in the whole world.

1422
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:54,127
That's a guarantee you can take
to the bank, mister.

1423
01:55:54,232 --> 01:55:55,529
Yeah, sure.

1424
01:55:56,434 --> 01:55:58,061
What are you doing down here?

1425
01:56:00,772 --> 01:56:03,070
- Paramedic.
- Atta way.

1426
01:56:12,282 --> 01:56:14,409
No, I'm not coming in today.

1427
01:56:17,354 --> 01:56:18,651
I don't know.

1428
01:56:20,957 --> 01:56:25,656
They're going to need some good men
out there to avenge this.

1429
01:56:28,965 --> 01:56:30,262
We'll see.

1430
01:56:36,006 --> 01:56:39,271
Jimeno just got out.
McLoughlirs still in surgery.

1431
01:56:39,709 --> 01:56:41,074
We're still missing 14.

1432
01:56:41,178 --> 01:56:43,305
Jesus. What do we do?

1433
01:56:45,015 --> 01:56:48,712
Thousands of people in there, Paddy.
Where the hell are they?

1434
01:58:25,615 --> 01:58:28,914
9/11 showed us
