1
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:48,881
<i>I came to America in 1914,</i>
<i>by way of Philadelphia.</i>

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,058
<i>That's where I got off the boat.</i>

3
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,251
<i>And then I came to Baltimore.</i>

4
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,464
<i>It was the most beautiful place</i>
<i>you've ever seen in your life.</i>

5
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:03,594
<i>There were lights everywhere.</i>
<i>What lights they had!</i>

6
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,365
<i>It was a celebration of lights.</i>

7
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:09,202
<i>I thought they were for me:</i>
<i>"Sam was in America."</i>

8
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,270
<i>Sam was in America.</i>

9
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,989
<i>I didn't know what holiday it was,</i>
<i>but there were lights.</i>

10
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,321
<i>And I walked under them.</i>

11
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,523
<i>The sky exploded! People cheered!</i>

12
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,167
<i>There were fireworks.</i>
<i>What a welcome it was!</i>

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,167
<i>What a welcome!</i>

14
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,287
<i>I didn't know where my brothers were.</i>

15
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:35,758
<i>I had an address on a letter,</i>
<i>but when I went there, they'd moved.</i>

16
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,090
<i>I found the man</i>
<i>who knew the name Krichinsky.</i>

17
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,996
<i>He was a little man with big shoes.</i>
<i>I'll never forget him.</i>

18
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,765
<i>He had such big shoes!</i>
<i>They were brand-new, beautiful shoes.</i>

19
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,704
<i>He told me this was</i>
<i>how he made his living.</i>

20
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,106
<i>He would break in shoes</i>
<i>for the wealthy.</i>

21
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,805
<i>Stuff them with newspaper</i>
<i>and walk in them.</i>

22
00:02:56,017 --> 00:03:00,647
<i>I said, "What a country is this.</i>
<i>What a country."</i>

23
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:04,916
<i>The wealthy didn't even have</i>
<i>to break in their own shoes.</i>

24
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:10,731
<i>So this man with the shoes took me</i>
<i>down one street after another.</i>

25
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,297
<i>We walked and walked...</i>

26
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,368
<i>... and the skies would light up</i>
<i>and explode in a celebration.</i>

27
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,034
<i>And then we came to Avalon.</i>

28
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,807
<i>And the man with the shoes yelled,</i>
<i>"Krichinsky! Krichinsky!"</i>

29
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,517
<i>And my four brothers looked down</i>
<i>and saw me.</i>

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,778
<i>"Sam!"</i>

31
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,746
<i>Sam.</i>

32
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,087
<i>Sam.</i>

33
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:51,763
And that's when I came to America.
It was the Fourth of July.

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,274
Boy, did they used to celebrate.
Big celebrations.

35
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:59,935
They closed the streets
and would celebrate through the night.

36
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,482
What happened to the guy
who wore the big shoes?

37
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:09,212
The funny thing is, he did it
for another two years.

38
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,482
He brought his brother
into the business.

39
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:15,492
They would walk the streets, breaking
in shoes. Then he got an idea!

40
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:17,823
Why not make shoes that fit right?

41
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,830
They became custom shoemakers:
The Solomon Brothers.

42
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:26,072
They made shoes, pants.
And then they were a department store.

43
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:29,243
But the Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

44
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:33,743
The five Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

45
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,939
<i>And we worked and worked</i>
<i>and worked.</i>

46
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,243
<i>Except Gabriel didn't work.</i>

47
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:42,912
<i>Gabriel used to point a lot.</i>
<i>"There's a crease, it's not straight."</i>

48
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,925
He was the inspector.
He was the inspector.

49
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:52,662
How did you all get
to be wallpaper hangers?

50
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,464
It was your grandfather William.

51
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,605
He came to America first
and worked in the department store...

52
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:02,606
...where they sold wallpaper
and do wallpaper hanging for people.

53
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,505
So he became a wallpaper hanger.

54
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:09,343
And as each brother came over,
we all became wallpaper hangers.

55
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,243
But on the weekend, we made music.

56
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:15,717
What music it was!

57
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:20,388
<i>We liked American music.</i>
<i>We were very popular ourselves.</i>

58
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:46,742
<i>One night...</i>

59
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,952
<i>... I looked across the floor</i>
<i>and I saw...</i>

60
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,490
<i>... this young, lovely girl.</i>

61
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:59,490
<i>I wasn't handsome,</i>
<i>and I didn't have a beautiful body.</i>

62
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,101
<i>But when I touched a woman...</i>

63
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,465
<i>... they fell in love with me.</i>

64
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,604
<i>Oh, the family! How it grew.</i>
<i>The wives, the kids.</i>

65
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:48,646
<i>Krichinskys everywhere, everywhere.</i>

66
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,511
<i>So we had the family-circle meetings.</i>

67
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:57,790
<i>We put money in the hat to bring over</i>
<i>the cousins, the aunts, the uncles.</i>

68
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:02,553
<i>And then, out of the blue,</i>
<i>William gets the flu.</i>

69
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,131
<i>It was a terrible epidemic,</i>
<i>the flu of 1919.</i>

70
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,926
<i>Thousands died.</i>

71
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,602
<i>William died.</i>

72
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:12,968
<i>He was a young man.</i>
<i>He left three kids.</i>

73
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:17,441
Sam, how many times do we
have to hear this story?

74
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,909
We know this story.
We heard it before.

75
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,242
If we don't tell them, they don't know.
Last year, Bill died.

76
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,045
Was very warm last year
when Bill died.

77
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:28,380
How many times
do we have to hear this?

78
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,386
The children know this story.

79
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,456
I'm telling them about
when I came here.

80
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,356
Yeah, we know about it.
We all heard it before.

81
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:38,589
Dad, you want to cut the turkey,
or do you want me to?

82
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,996
I wanted to tell them about
when my father came here.

83
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:45,195
You have plenty of time
to talk about your father.

84
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:47,896
Sorry we're late.

85
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:52,569
Another minute, we would've cut the
turkey without you and started to eat.

86
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,975
To cut the turkey without me present?

87
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,582
We leave the house!

88
00:07:57,785 --> 00:08:00,618
- We didn't cut the turkey.
- I heard the turkey was cut.

89
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,982
I was just talking
about when Bill died.

90
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,418
Thank God we are late.

91
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,962
I don't understand this holiday.
I'll never understand it.

92
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:12,621
- What's not to understand?
- Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving.

93
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,528
We're giving thanks to who?

94
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,669
You're giving thanks
for what you have.

95
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,135
How many times do we have
to go through this?

96
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,367
All I'm saying is, we had to get
the turkey and kill it to give thanks.

97
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:26,910
If it wasn't this holiday,
we wouldn't have turkey.

98
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:30,982
I don't eat turkey the rest
of the year. Why do I have to now?

99
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,619
Mom, don't give thanks, okay?

100
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,449
Time to tell the kids
when my father came to America.

101
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,352
Can't it wait till later?

102
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,384
They should hear this story.

103
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:42,585
Eva, this is very tender.

104
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,322
Of course it is.
It's a beautiful bird.

105
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,128
The turkey was in the basement alive.
She killed it.

106
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,771
We brought my father over in '25.

107
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:58,308
- '25?
- William died in 1919. '25.

108
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,844
'25? It was later than '25!

109
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,573
He came the same year
we brought Bill and Edith.

110
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,945
Bill and Edith came after!

111
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,677
- After?
- Yeah, after.

112
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,515
It was '26.

113
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,487
What's the difference?
He came to America, right?

114
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,787
It's a big difference
between '25 and '26.

115
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,260
One is '25 and the other is '26.

116
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:24,904
All's I'm saying is,
who cares if it was '25 or '26?

117
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,475
Jules, Jules, if you stop remembering,
you forget.

118
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:32,171
It was '26.

119
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:35,075
I remember the excitement
when you went to meet him.

120
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,740
<i>Finally, the father was coming.</i>
<i>We saved the money and sent it to him.</i>

121
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,978
<i>The whole family went to the border...</i>

122
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,782
<i>Jules, you were just a little kid.</i>

123
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:45,288
<i>It was cold!</i>

124
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,722
<i>We went to the marketplace.</i>
<i>It was cold. It was cold.</i>

125
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,956
What are you talking about,
it was cold? It was late May.

126
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,362
May? I remember cold.

127
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,402
No, you're thinking of when
Irene was getting married.

128
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:02,940
It was bitter cold then. No,
it was May 17 when your father came.

129
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,169
Anyway, we went, the whole family.

130
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,176
<i>The brothers, the wives, the kids.</i>

131
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:10,077
<i>I didn't go,</i>
<i>and all the kids didn't go.</i>

132
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:11,717
We waited in the house.

133
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,821
There was such excitement.
The father, the father was coming.

134
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,992
All I ever heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."

135
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,424
The head of the family.
I pictured this big, powerful man.

136
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,394
<i>All I'd heard was,</i>
<i>"Wait until the father comes."</i>

137
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,334
<i>The father's word when he speaks...</i>

138
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:31,096
<i>So I'm there. I see him.</i>

139
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,006
<i>He's shorter than me, and I'm only 6.</i>

140
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:37,836
<i>He was this little...</i>

141
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,742
He was a little, little man.

142
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,212
I never said he was big.

143
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,822
But I said he was the father.

144
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:52,720
From the day...

145
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:56,920
<i>From the day he came to America,</i>
<i>he never had to work.</i>

146
00:10:57,131 --> 00:11:01,090
<i>Not a day in his life.</i>
<i>Each of us would give him 10 percent.</i>

147
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,792
<i>Ten percent?</i>

148
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,105
<i>Right? Right? Yeah.</i>

149
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,405
<i>Ten percent. He was the father.</i>

150
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,642
<i>He never drank water.</i>

151
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:17,543
The entire time he was in America,
from the day he came...

152
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,276
...he drank whiskey or seltzer water.

153
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,751
He never drank water.

154
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,926
And oh, boy, could he drink!

155
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,089
What was that stuff called
he always used to drink?

156
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,631
Slivovitz. Slivovitz.

157
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:38,161
He used to call it "Block and Fall."

158
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:41,739
You have one drink of that,
you walk one block and you fall!

159
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,341
If you have one drink...

160
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:46,638
It's such a strong drink,
it burned the gums out.

161
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,577
He was funny. He was funny.
Very, very, very funny.

162
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,444
How often did he drink water?

163
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,579
Never, ever touched it.
How many times...?

164
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,450
I'm sitting across from you,
you can't hear it?

165
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,524
He never drank water!

166
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,754
That means he doesn't drink.
I got it.

167
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:06,899
You asked me, I told you.
Now I'm telling you some more.

168
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,569
Occasionally, maybe,
he had some water.

169
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,841
He never drank water.

170
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,509
So he didn't like it.

171
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,344
- He didn't like water.
- How many times?

172
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,777
Hymie, Gabriel, Jules.

173
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,407
Are aunts kids
before they become aunts?

174
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,978
Everybody's a kid
before they become an aunt.

175
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,241
They are?
I thought they just popped out.

176
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,157
I've been thinking about it.

177
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:08,157
It's a good time
we open our own business.

178
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,762
Open our own business?
What, are you kidding?

179
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,454
Think of the risk involved.

180
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,396
We got good routes.
Why should we gamble?

181
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:18,696
It's perfect.
We got built-in customers.

182
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,774
We open our own place. We keep
the routes, but switch people to us.

183
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,810
We sell the same goods,
except the money goes in our pockets.

184
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,845
You don't think
Simmons will sit still?

185
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,415
We open our own place,
he'll put someone on our routes.

186
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:34,815
We'll hold on to the customers.
They like us, trust us.

187
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,116
We won't hold on to everybody.
We'll lose customers.

188
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,260
This is less dollars,
and we got to find new customers.

189
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,895
The war is over, right?

190
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:46,863
There's lots of people with lots
of money. It's a good time to gamble.

191
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,290
Dessert!

192
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:50,661
I hear dessert?

193
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,429
I hear dessert.

194
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:54,638
Dessert.

195
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,371
Bring me dessert.

196
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:59,205
The kids aren't having dessert?

197
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:03,247
My grandmother is grandmother to me,
but she's not grandmother to Teddy.

198
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,213
- Yes, right.
- Then what is she?

199
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,080
She's Teddy's great-aunt.

200
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,879
There are aunts and great-aunts?

201
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,185
What's the difference between
a regular aunt and a great-aunt?

202
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,362
They're older. That's the difference.

203
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,257
It's not because they're older.

204
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:21,127
Because then someday,
all aunts would be great-aunts.

205
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,997
But why are great-aunts
just called great-aunts?

206
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:27,799
Why not "good aunts" or
"fantastic aunts" or "terrible aunts"?

207
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:32,104
No. It doesn't have anything to do
with what kind of person they are.

208
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:36,078
It's got to do with great.
You know, they're great, older.

209
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:39,377
What about those red ants that
crawl around and bite you?

210
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:42,282
No, no, no. That's A-N-T.

211
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,912
Ant.

212
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,759
What's a first cousin, twice removed?

213
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:51,523
I have absolutely no idea.

214
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,233
I'm going selling with my dad today.

215
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,273
You're not going to school?

216
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,377
Christmas holidays. No school.

217
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,171
Christmas holiday.

218
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,651
- Keep your nose clean.
- Yeah.

219
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,350
How come you didn't become
a wallpaper hanger like Sam?

220
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,995
Well, Sam always had this idea...

221
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,997
...that doing manual labor
had no dignity, but selling...

222
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,170
"Selling was security," he said.

223
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,964
No matter where you are
or what you're selling...

224
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,663
...you can always make a living.

225
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,940
- Can you sell anything?
- Anything. I can sell anything.

226
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,712
See, it's all a question of
being able to talk to people.

227
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,282
The product?
It doesn't make any difference.

228
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,716
You're selling yourself.

229
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,822
Can you sell model trains?

230
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:54,093
- As many as they can make.
- Can you sell toothbrushes?

231
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,127
To as many people as have teeth.

232
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,526
Quick! See that car?
What car is that?

233
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,927
Chrysler!

234
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,333
The one over there on the right?

235
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,729
- Nash!
- Pretty good.

236
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,546
Give me your money.

237
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,242
- What's that?
- Give me your money.

238
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,082
Are you kidding me?

239
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,123
No, I'm not kidding you.
Give me your money.

240
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:38,163
What, are you robbing me?
With all these houses around?

241
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,060
Yeah, I'm robbing you.

242
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,072
Get help.

243
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,261
I can't play.

244
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,055
I can't play.

245
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:16,597
<i>I never learned to play the piano.</i>

246
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:19,060
<i>I never learned.</i>

247
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:24,566
I said, I never learned.

248
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,068
Jules!

249
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,409
I can't. I can't play the piano.

250
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,320
I can't play.

251
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,295
No, I can't.
I can't play the piano.

252
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,294
See!

253
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,307
He can't play, but he can learn!

254
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,450
<i>I can't play.</i>

255
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,598
<i>That's the problem with collecting.</i>

256
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:25,328
<i>I know that's got to be</i>
<i>a problem with collecting.</i>

257
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,631
<i>It's unheard of.</i>

258
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,569
<i>When you have lots of money...</i>

259
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:32,267
It's unheard of to stab somebody
and take the money.

260
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,844
I never heard of it.

261
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,811
I don't want to know about it.
Not like in the old days.

262
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:40,180
When they know you got lots of money,
somebody wants the money.

263
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,479
We know that.

264
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:43,417
We know that. But who wants it?

265
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:48,026
It's not like it used to be!
A man can't walk in the street?

266
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,789
Never, never, never.
It's the money that's the problem.

267
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:55,058
- You're right.
- Somebody tries to kill...

268
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:58,101
Somebody tries to kill my boy
just for money.

269
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:01,069
- That's not good. That's not good!
- It's the money.

270
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,741
- It's not good.
- No good.

271
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,002
Money, money, money, that's it.

272
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:09,649
- That's the whole problem. Money.
- Money.

273
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,446
When I was a little younger
than you...

274
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,152
...I used to think
the world was made up...

275
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,885
...of big people and little people.

276
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,831
And that's the way
it would always stay.

277
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,728
And then I always wondered
why sinks were too high.

278
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:08,101
You had to climb up to wash your face.
Cupboards, too high.

279
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,402
The hole in the toilet was too big.

280
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,772
Nothing was made for us.

281
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:18,341
It's just a world of big people
and little people.

282
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,146
You never got any older...

283
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:23,720
...and nobody ever died.

284
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>Michael!</i>

285
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,854
Michael.

286
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:34,059
I talked to the doctor.
Your father's gonna be all right.

287
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,164
- There, you got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Hold it.

288
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,334
What is it? What is it?

289
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,304
What could it be? It's so big.

290
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,138
- It's a holiday gift.
- What is it?

291
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,643
What is it? What is it?

292
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,009
It's a surprise. Wait and see.

293
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:55,154
The family circle voted and decided
to get you a holiday get-well gift.

294
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,515
For me?

295
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:01,894
Oh, you didn't! You didn't!

296
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,469
So, what is this?

297
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,107
A television.

298
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,532
That's television.
You can only watch for so long.

299
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,175
To me, it doesn't have
what a radio has.

300
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,180
Yes, it does.

301
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,081
Anybody want coffee?

302
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:02,546
Yes.

303
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,490
Nice picture, huh?

304
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:13,256
Beautiful picture.

305
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:21,473
Never happened.

306
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,436
In the old country, never heard of
stabbing someone to take their money.

307
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,808
Never happened.

308
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:31,643
You're right.
But the government would kill you.

309
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:35,651
Would take your money,
your property, whatever you had.

310
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:38,483
You know what you have to do?
Be like in Westerns.

311
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:41,320
Have a stagecoach
and the shotgun when you collect.

312
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:44,497
That's what they had in the Wild West,
because of outlaws.

313
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:47,690
Yeah, that's what you need.
There's always robbers.

314
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,701
What was the movie we saw with
the stagecoach? A very good movie.

315
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:54,567
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- The movie had a stagecoach.

316
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:56,799
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- Very active movie.

317
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,138
John Wayne, he was an outlaw
but was not an outlaw.

318
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:03,009
What was the movie called
with the stagecoach?

319
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:04,148
<i>Stagecoach.</i>

320
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:07,320
That's what I'm saying,
with the stagecoach.

321
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:10,087
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
<i>- Stagecoach?</i>

322
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,151
I saw a nice little shop
off Helen's Market...

323
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,185
...on the southeast corner.

324
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:21,525
Supposing we do do this, what are
we selling? Same things we sell now?

325
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:24,260
Yeah, only for less
than running the routes.

326
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,430
Pots and pans?

327
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:29,537
Pots, pans,
vacuum cleaners, everything.

328
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:32,007
The time is right
we get out on our own.

329
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:34,703
We don't have enough money.
Now is not right.

330
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:37,178
- Ann, please.
- All right.

331
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:41,443
The problem is, Jules,
we never have privacy.

332
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:45,351
Everybody's on top of everybody.
We need our own place.

333
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:47,856
And we'll get it.
But Izzy's right.

334
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:51,428
This is the time for us to use
our savings for our own business.

335
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:54,429
We can get off the street
and try to make a go of it.

336
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:56,534
Well, I know that's the best thing.

337
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:59,227
I just can't promise
I'm gonna remain sane.

338
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,734
You put on a little sweater.

339
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:06,745
Yeah, be sure to take small steps.
There's a little wind.

340
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:09,540
Michael! Forgot your lunch money.

341
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,011
Toss it.

342
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,079
Ann! Do we leave at 10:30?

343
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,915
Yeah, that'll be fine!
I have to be back at 1:00.

344
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,151
I have to go to the doctor's
with Jules.

345
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:25,996
You're not driving, are you?

346
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:29,225
- No, I'm still taking the lessons.
- Oh, thank God.

347
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:36,075
"Can" is whether you're capable
of doing something.

348
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:38,767
"May" is asking for permission.

349
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:42,805
- Yes, Michael?
- Can I go to the bathroom?

350
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:45,507
Michael, do you want
to repeat that question?

351
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,777
Oh, no, I'm going
to be made an example of.

352
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:48,976
Michael.

353
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,655
I said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

354
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,828
You can, but you may not.

355
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:58,096
Well, can I or can't I?

356
00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:02,265
I don't think you've been paying
attention, have you, Michael Kaye?

357
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:03,663
Yes, I have.

358
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,270
So how would you
rephrase the question?

359
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:09,937
Can I please go to the bathroom?

360
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,204
Children.

361
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:17,042
Michael Kaye, why don't you just
spend some time in the hallway...

362
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,845
...until you've learned the difference
between "can" and "may."

363
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:25,688
When you've learned the difference,
then you may come back in.

364
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:29,859
I have to go to the bathroom,
but I'm afraid to ask.

365
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:35,933
Now, does anyone know the difference
between "can" and "may"?

366
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:45,144
Young man, have you learned the
difference between "may" and "can"?

367
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:46,912
Not yet.

368
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:50,048
You stay out there
until you've learned the difference.

369
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,218
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

370
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:06,594
Well? Are you ready
to rejoin the class, Michael?

371
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,092
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

372
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:11,498
And what's the difference
between "may" and "can"?

373
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,132
Give me a little more time.

374
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:22,778
Young man, what are you doing
in the hallway?

375
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,348
Learning the difference
between "may" and "can."

376
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,747
How long do you think it would take?

377
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:40,922
Hello?

378
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:42,624
Is this Mr. Kaye?

379
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,962
His father, Mr. Krichinsky.

380
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:49,364
No, he's at the doctor's,
but he's fine. Who is this?

381
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,373
This is Mr. Dunn,
the principal of Michael's school.

382
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,308
We seem to have a problem.

383
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:55,603
Is he sick?

384
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:59,440
We seem to have a problem
between "may" and "can."

385
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,217
What's the problem?

386
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,184
That's the lesson they were learning.

387
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:05,755
Michael asked
if he could go to the bathroom.

388
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,220
He said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

389
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:11,329
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

390
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:14,227
What's the problem?
He asked to go to the bathroom.

391
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:17,062
He asked, but he asked incorrectly.

392
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,898
- Did he raise his hand?
- Yes, he did.

393
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:23,803
But the point is, it was
a lesson about "may" and "can."

394
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,411
Okay, it's fine with me.
So, what's the problem?

395
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:29,741
He asked, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

396
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:33,510
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

397
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,178
That's confusing to the kid,
because you're saying, "You can"...

398
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,325
...and then you say,
"You can, but you can't."

399
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,658
You don't understand the subtleties...

400
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:45,922
...of the English language,
Mr. Krichinsky.

401
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:49,365
This English, it's very difficult.

402
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:52,766
I never realized
how difficult English is.

403
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:56,575
"May" or "can."
You can, but you may not.

404
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,437
We've come a long way.

405
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:02,877
In the old days, if you had to pee,
you peed on a tree.

406
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,813
There's no "may" or "can."
That's progress for you.

407
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,385
Oh, my God.

408
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,729
Hon?

409
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,131
I got it.

410
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,702
The store...

411
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,710
...televisions.

412
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:34,038
Wall-to-wall televisions.

413
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:37,341
We'll sell more of them.
How will we sell more of them?

414
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,017
We'll sell them cheaper.

415
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:43,086
Televisions, televisions,
from one end of the shop to the other.

416
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:45,348
Nothing but televisions.

417
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:02,170
I think something's about to happen.

418
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,775
Seems like the humming's getting less.

419
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,377
That's when something's
about to happen.

420
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,310
Seems like it's humming
the same hum to me.

421
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:16,347
You better hope they start getting
some more interesting programs.

422
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:27,766
See, I told you something
was going to happen.

423
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,628
It's <i>Howdy Doody.</i>

424
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,899
We're getting ahead of ourselves
with this television.

425
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:36,974
Why don't we add some linoleums,
toasters, pots and pans, brooms.

426
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:39,770
Get a little foot traffic
in here, you know?

427
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,537
Maybe that'll help.

428
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:44,640
Why are they not coming in here?

429
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,987
<i>Electronic equipment!</i>

430
00:30:56,195 --> 00:30:58,595
<i>Here's adventure!</i>

431
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,029
<i>And now let's return</i>
<i>to</i> Westinghouse Studio One.

432
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,568
<i>And</i> Letter from Cairo.

433
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,899
<i>- Fighting for law</i>
<i>and order, captain...</i>

434
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:10,098
<i>Here's adventure.</i>

435
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,038
<i>Here's romance.</i>

436
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,112
<i>Mr. L-magination</i>

437
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,306
<i>The Cisco Kid.</i>

438
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:23,510
<i>- Henry Aldrich!</i>
<i>- Coming, Mother.</i>

439
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:26,055
<i>The Colgate Comedy Hour.</i>

440
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,920
<i>Say the secret word for $100.</i>

441
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:31,221
<i>It's a common word for something</i>
<i>you find around the house.</i>

442
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,033
<i>Well, well, well.</i>
<i>Good evening.</i>

443
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:40,535
<i>It is Wednesday night again,</i>
<i>and I'm back on television.</i>

444
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,503
<i>- Your Hit Parade.</i>

445
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:47,535
<i>Time now to enjoy</i> What's My Line?

446
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:53,584
The George Burns
and Gracie Allen Show.

447
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:03,959
- Well, what does it mean?
- What?

448
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:07,530
- What does it mean, the suburbs?
- It's just a nicer place to live.

449
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,792
That's what it means? A nicer place?

450
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:13,460
Yes, it's nicer.
It's got lawns and big trees.

451
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,208
Uncle Izzy and Teddy and everyone,
they'll be there too?

452
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,934
In one house in the suburbs?

453
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,443
God, please be careful!
It's a very old piece.

454
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,377
- Yes, ma'am. We've got it.
- Huh? In one house?

455
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,779
No, Michael, it's gonna be the same.

456
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,181
Your grandparents will live
in our house.

457
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,186
We'll all live near each other.
Please don't distract me.

458
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:36,020
It's gonna rain, I got furniture
in the street, I'm gonna panic.

459
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:44,797
Aunt Dottie, Aunt Dottie!
Is this a good thing that's happening?

460
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:45,993
What?

461
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:49,038
Is this a good thing,
going to the suburbs?

462
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:52,803
- Am I gonna like it there?
- You kids are gonna love it.

463
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:57,646
We've been here forever.

464
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,580
We're even gonna have
to go to a new school.

465
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:03,046
You ever been in the suburbs?

466
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:06,623
I never even heard of the suburbs
until this thing happened.

467
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:09,258
Wait a minute.
Where you running with that?

468
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:11,089
- Wait a minute.
- Ma, they'll wrap it.

469
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:14,357
- No, no. We take this in the car.
- It'll be wrapped.

470
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:17,297
No, no. We take it in the car.

471
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:20,802
The truck hits a bump,
anything could happen.

472
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,617
Okay, we're all set.

473
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:36,652
I remember Michael learned
how to walk right here.

474
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:40,724
Held on to the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

475
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,758
He went right to your room.

476
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,623
Yeah, I remember.
What was he? A year old?

477
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,130
No, no, not a year.

478
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:50,324
Nine months.

479
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:54,632
Held the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

480
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,706
Nine months.

481
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:04,776
What's wrong, Pop?

482
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,912
I don't know, I don't know.

483
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:12,650
I get nervous about making a change.

484
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:15,793
What are you talking about?
You came to America.

485
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:18,190
We're just going to the suburbs.

486
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,724
I came to America in 1914...

487
00:34:22,568 --> 00:34:24,126
...but I was a young man.

488
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,431
Oh, come on, Dad.

489
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:30,802
What about the house?
You saw the house.

490
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,944
Forest Park area. It's beautiful.

491
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:36,114
We're gonna have more room
for the whole family.

492
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,081
We're getting farther
and farther away from Avalon.

493
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,084
I think I'm getting
too old for change.

494
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:02,029
<i>- Bill, are you hurt?</i>
<i>- Not a bit. Cut me loose.</i>

495
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,367
No, Sam, don't feed the dog
from the table.

496
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,046
He likes meat.

497
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:11,580
Don't give him big pieces.
He has a small throat.

498
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,656
- What's wrong with the green beans?
- I don't like green beans.

499
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:20,052
Since when you don't like green beans?

500
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:21,988
Never. I never eat green beans.

501
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:26,893
I cannot believe we argue over the dog
and the green beans every meal.

502
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,761
Green beans and the dog.
Like it's the first time.

503
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,994
Constantly you argue
about the same thing.

504
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:34,263
It's not an argument,
it's dinner talk.

505
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:36,873
Dad, this goes on all the time.

506
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:38,941
Whether it's green beans
or feeding Nimo...

507
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:41,705
...constantly you two
have a problem at dinner.

508
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,007
- Constantly?
- Yeah. How about drinks?

509
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,241
Mom says you can't mix drinks.

510
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,750
The mixes he makes
is not a good drink.

511
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:50,945
Let's not get into
the drinks thing now.

512
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:54,615
What are you talking about?
I take the juice from the pears...

513
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,954
...mix it with Coca-Cola.
It's a good drink.

514
00:35:57,163 --> 00:36:00,257
Oh, please. You're going to
make me sick with this.

515
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,968
Sam, I said don't feed the dog
from the table.

516
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, my God.

517
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,731
We're thinking of keeping the store
open a couple nights until 9.

518
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,101
Do you have to?

519
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,871
If we want to stay competitive.
The other shops stay open later.

520
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:17,015
He's gonna choke to death.

521
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,515
One night we look under the table,
the dog will be dead.

522
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,316
I spoke to Izzy about the family
meeting that's supposed to be here.

523
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:28,288
Some of the brothers feel
it's too far to go.

524
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:29,891
Too far?

525
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:34,157
How far can it be? They get on
Rogers over the Liberty Heights.

526
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,264
We know how to go.

527
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:38,665
Why Rogers? You take Greenspring.
There's no light.

528
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:40,168
It's a bottleneck.

529
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,361
- It's not.
- It is.

530
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,598
It's not!

531
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:45,504
It's a bottleneck.
I say you take Rogers.

532
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:49,340
To go to Rogers, he's got to go up
Park Circle. Why Rogers?

533
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:54,247
The question is not which way they'll
come. They think it is too far.

534
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,525
What do you want? You want me to
tell them to move out?

535
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,161
I don't want you to tell them
to move out.

536
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:41,026
I just was expressing a feeling
that maybe, you know...

537
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:44,464
...you can get them their own place
and chip in with the rent.

538
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,036
Their own place? Where would
the money come from?

539
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,469
I don't have the money yet.
They don't either.

540
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,235
I know, I just feel...

541
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,378
...there's always
somebody watching over me.

542
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,378
Every time I do something,
I feel like somebody's...

543
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,211
...thinking that they
could do it better.

544
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,148
What? I don't know.

545
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:05,687
I put something down, I like how
it looks on the coffee table...

546
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:07,882
...I come back and it's moved.

547
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:09,287
You want me to talk to her?

548
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:13,625
I'd like to put something down,
and have it there when I return.

549
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,127
Do you want me to talk to her?
I will.

550
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,633
I'll talk to her again and again,
but it doesn't do any good.

551
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,567
You know her. She's like an enigma.

552
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:22,798
I feel like I'm still with
my mom and dad.

553
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:27,001
I'd like to feel like this is my home.
Feel like the mom in my own house.

554
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:30,410
I understand. I understand that.

555
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:34,177
I go out and buy what I consider to be
an attractive outfit.

556
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:38,914
I come home, "No, it's too tight here.
The material's not becoming to you.

557
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:41,558
It looks too heavy for summer."
Or whatever it is.

558
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,785
She speaks her mind.
She's got opinions.

559
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:47,727
I'd like to feel good about what I buy
for my house or myself.

560
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,094
Don't let her make you feel bad.

561
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:51,564
How can I help it?

562
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,964
- Put her in her place.
- Right.

563
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:54,696
You gotta do that sometimes.

564
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,171
- I don't know.
- You gotta put her in her place.

565
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,140
I just would like to feel like
I live in my house.

566
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,836
You do. You live here.

567
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,277
What do you want from me?
I don't know what to do.

568
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,383
I know. I'm just...

569
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,052
...talking.

570
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,895
I got it!

571
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,163
Hi, Eva.

572
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,631
- Hi, Nimo.
- Where's your mother?

573
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,502
She's in the dining room.

574
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,472
Come on, let's play a game.
Got it.

575
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,815
You're not going to believe this.

576
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:39,678
I got a call.

577
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:44,413
American Red Cross.
My brother's alive in Europe.

578
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,922
What?

579
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,958
I can't believe it.
I have to sit down.

580
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:54,223
I need something to drink.
I ran to get here.

581
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,866
I'll get you some lemonade.

582
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,366
Oh, it's too sweet. Not too sweet.

583
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,300
My heart. My heart is running.

584
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:03,702
So, Ma, what happened?

585
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,809
Well, I don't know exactly.

586
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,306
He was in a concentration camp.

587
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,642
He lived through
the concentration camp.

588
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,013
They found him, but I don't know.

589
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,413
I don't know...

590
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,988
...how he lived through it.
I don't know.

591
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:23,787
I never saw him. I heard about him
from letters.

592
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:27,227
When I came to this country,
he wasn't born.

593
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,027
And when he was old enough to come...

594
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:34,103
...he wouldn't leave my father.
No, he was blind and dying.

595
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,171
And then the war started.

596
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,172
So where is your brother now?

597
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:41,505
I don't know. With refugees.

598
00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:43,942
But now they found me...

599
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:48,552
...they make plans for him
to come to America.

600
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:50,517
It's 4-1.

601
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,660
And after the concentration camp...

602
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:00,957
...he's put in a camp
with the displaced people.

603
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,498
Now he says he has a sister
in Baltimore...

604
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:07,263
...but he can't remember
my married name: Krichinsky.

605
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:10,738
Doesn't have his letters anymore.
They were all destroyed.

606
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:13,707
He knows the name's Russian,
not Polish.

607
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:17,848
It's a Y, not an I,
but he can't remember the name.

608
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,713
I cannot imagine having a brother
I've never seen.

609
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,679
Never seen.

610
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:25,720
Thought was dead.

611
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,355
All right, Michael.
Give me your best shot.

612
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,392
That's an out.

613
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:39,263
Oh, my God.

614
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,305
Bees!

615
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:42,804
Bees!

616
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:45,374
Bees! Bees! Bees!

617
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:50,138
Stand still!
You're supposed to stand still!

618
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,839
Run, run!

619
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,080
Bees! Bees! Bees!

620
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:00,321
Oh, my God!

621
00:42:01,927 --> 00:42:03,360
Get the hose!

622
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:07,464
Run, Michael!

623
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,795
Put your hands over your eyes.
Don't let them get in your eyes.

624
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,848
He's not allergic to the bees,
so there's no real problem.

625
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:29,020
He's just gonna be a little
uncomfortable for a while.

626
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,289
I hate the suburbs.

627
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,618
I'm surprised your mother-in-law
didn't come along with you today.

628
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,920
She refuses to get in the car with me.

629
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:40,394
She's never been in a car
when a woman drives.

630
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:45,929
One, two, three.

631
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:47,264
Jump!

632
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:51,673
The election of a new family-circle
president will take place...

633
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:53,310
...three weeks from Sunday.

634
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:56,003
So we have to make some serious
decision-making.

635
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:58,945
It's like a furnace in here.
Like a furnace.

636
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,641
That concludes old business.

637
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:05,017
I make a proposal that we take
the next meeting at Frock's Farm.

638
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:06,657
- Very good idea.
- I'm with you.

639
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:08,723
A very good idea.

640
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,952
It's cooler. We won't
suffocate to death.

641
00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:13,825
This is a family-circle meeting,
not an outing.

642
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:16,159
Why not combine the two
when it's this hot?

643
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:18,836
An outing and a family-circle meeting.

644
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:22,302
An outing is an outing, and
a family circle is a family circle.

645
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:23,668
I'm dripping.

646
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,401
Let's finish the meeting
and that'll be it.

647
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,637
And that will be it.
That will be it.

648
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:32,180
When Schulman was alive,
we sat in the meeting.

649
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:34,181
The meeting finished.
Then we left.

650
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:37,082
It was hot, it was cold,
it was snow...

651
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,655
...it was rain.
We sat and we had a meeting.

652
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:43,350
If we don't want to meet because
it's hot, let's not meet.

653
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:45,860
- Do not meet.
- No one said not to meet.

654
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,224
Nobody said not to meet.

655
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:48,399
It's a furnace.

656
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,366
We need to decide how much money
we'll give to our charity this year.

657
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:53,799
This is a heat wave.

658
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,940
It was hotter at Avalon.

659
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:59,372
We had a meeting and it was
so hot you couldn't stand up.

660
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,910
What are you talking about?
Aunt Molly fainted.

661
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:03,479
Still, we had the meeting.

662
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:08,016
Last year we gave...
Just let me have a look.

663
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,347
We gave to six charities.

664
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:13,286
An elephant just went by the window.

665
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:14,948
What?

666
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,889
It's the heat.
You're hallucinating.

667
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:22,263
Then the heat made me see another
elephant, because another is going by.

668
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,263
The circus! The circus!

669
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:27,536
The circus!

670
00:44:33,345 --> 00:44:34,744
The circus!

671
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,079
Oh, look at this!

672
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:42,652
They must be going through here
to get to the tent site.

673
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:47,314
- What tent?
- They have a tent at Edmondson Avenue.

674
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:04,673
Wow, look at the circus, Mom!

675
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:06,776
The circus is coming.

676
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:20,981
Yeah! Yeah!

677
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,295
Do you got everything?

678
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:04,529
You'll waste the battery.

679
00:46:04,736 --> 00:46:06,897
- And remember, you stay with Sam.
- Okay.

680
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:10,563
Don't wander off around
the reservoir without him, understand?

681
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:13,074
We know. We know.

682
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:15,041
Later, I'll make you breakfast.

683
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:34,324
In the old days, it used to be
hotter in the summertime.

684
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,524
Did I tell you my father
never drank water in America?

685
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:09,132
The whole time he was alive,
he never drank water in America.

686
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:11,199
What did he drink? Coca-Cola?

687
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:12,461
Whiskey.

688
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:14,730
If he didn't drink whiskey,
mineral water.

689
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,170
But he never drank...

690
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:18,875
...from the faucet.

691
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:20,044
Why?

692
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:22,907
He had the old ways. You see,
we drank from a well.

693
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:25,948
Spring water in the old country.
And he said:

694
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:29,712
"Water that comes through a pipe under
the city can't be good water.

695
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,821
Can't be good for you."

696
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,082
He was a very stubborn man.

697
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:37,261
And we never could convince him
otherwise.

698
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:39,487
Your grandmother
is a stubborn woman.

699
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:41,495
We know.

700
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,496
We know.

701
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,777
Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael.

702
00:47:58,984 --> 00:48:01,976
I came to America in 1914.

703
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:04,515
And when I came to Baltimore...

704
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,655
...it was the most beautiful place
you ever saw.

705
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:14,330
We know that story, Sam.
Can you tell us another one?

706
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,858
Yeah, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

707
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:19,468
Did I tell you I used to
own a nightclub?

708
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:22,100
You used to own a nightclub?

709
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:24,434
Yeah, yeah. Not a big nightclub.

710
00:48:24,643 --> 00:48:27,703
A small place
on lower Pennsylvania Avenue.

711
00:48:27,913 --> 00:48:31,076
It had a bar and a dance floor.

712
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,787
You went off and got married?

713
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:22,163
You see, we didn't plan
to get married.

714
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:25,803
They decided to get married. We
were taking them to get married.

715
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,371
We were getting married. Jules
has the car, so he gave us a ride.

716
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:31,769
Because you needed a ride,
my son is married?

717
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:35,174
No, well, we sort of got
caught up in the moment.

718
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,645
Yes, it was very...
Well, you know.

719
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,818
We were gonna marry
sooner or later.

720
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,611
- Sooner or later?
- We got a deal too.

721
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,483
The justice of the peace
charges $10 a couple.

722
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,681
I got him down to $15 for
the whole thing.

723
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:50,293
It's wonderful.
A bargain wedding.

724
00:49:50,495 --> 00:49:53,259
You save $5 by getting married.
I am so pleased.

725
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:55,933
Come on, Dad. Be happy for us.

726
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,798
Do you love my boy?

727
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:02,605
Yes, I do, very much.

728
00:50:02,807 --> 00:50:06,265
Good. Because that's one
young man that's crazy about you.

729
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:09,740
Kiss the bride.
Let me see you kiss the bride.

730
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:11,347
Izzy, kiss your bride.

731
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:15,711
That's it, that's it, that's it!

732
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:20,352
Dad, if it's all right, she's gonna
sleep at the house tonight.

733
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,897
Where is that marriage certificate?
Let me see it.

734
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,897
- Let me see it.
- Here.

735
00:50:31,102 --> 00:50:34,265
I don't want any hanky-panky
going on in my house.

736
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:39,977
Who's this?
Who's this Jules Kaye here?

737
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,605
That's me, Dad.

738
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:45,442
I changed my name.

739
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,811
Me too. I changed mine to Kirk.

740
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:50,920
It's easier to say than Krichinsky.
Kirk. It's better.

741
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:53,989
Who said names are supposed to
be easy to say?

742
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:56,057
What are you, a candy bar?

743
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,391
You got a name: Krichinsky.
It's a name.

744
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,726
Kaye. Kirk.

745
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,902
Two cousins, different names.

746
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:09,733
How can this be a family when the
father is called Sam Krichinsky...

747
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:14,469
...his son is called Jules Kaye
and his first cousin is Izzy Kirk.

748
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:19,583
This is a family, goddamn it!
Krichinsky is the name of the family!

749
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:24,016
It's not Kaye! It's not Kirk!
It's Krichinsky!

750
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:28,386
It's Krichinsky.

751
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,255
We argued and argued.

752
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,160
Then the way things are in life,
you stop arguing.

753
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:38,928
It's your life.
You're gonna have to live it.

754
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:44,304
What a celebration.
And we celebrated that night.

755
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:52,367
<i>It wasn't your ordinary</i>
<i>family celebration.</i>

756
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:56,680
It was the best wedding...

757
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,712
...I ever went to.

758
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:07,958
It's nice.

759
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,824
It's easy to sleep when you have
a breeze. It's easy to sleep.

760
00:53:27,946 --> 00:53:30,039
<i>I'm getting nervous.</i>
<i>Too much expansion.</i>

761
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:34,150
<i>We bought out that store and that one.</i>
<i>We got all this merchandise.</i>

762
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:38,254
Nothing's ready, we got no customers.
Money's going out, not coming in.

763
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:41,789
- I'm getting a little nervous.
- You're not the only one.

764
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:47,461
I've talked to some of the people
around here in the marketplace...

765
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:51,624
...and I'm not sure anyone knows
what this "discount" is.

766
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,661
I don't know whether it means
anything to anybody.

767
00:53:54,873 --> 00:53:56,807
It's not like we invented the word.

768
00:53:57,008 --> 00:53:59,738
I didn't say that,
but it doesn't mean anything.

769
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:01,605
What are you saying?

770
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:04,407
I'm saying we need to be more clear.

771
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,643
- We need a catchy slogan or something.
- More clear than discount?

772
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:10,821
More clear than discount.
Something that...

773
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:13,616
All right. You want a catchy slogan?
How about:

774
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:15,918
"Guaranteed lowest prices in town."

775
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:18,820
That's good.

776
00:54:40,552 --> 00:54:43,521
A little higher! Higher!

777
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:47,350
Higher! A little higher!

778
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,027
What if someone buys and it's cheaper?

779
00:54:50,228 --> 00:54:54,358
Cheaper than they guaranteed is
the lower price. What do you do then?

780
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:59,393
Jules, what happens if somebody buys
cheaper than what you sell?

781
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:03,062
Good question. What if they get it
cheaper someplace else...

782
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:05,936
...since we guarantee
the lowest prices in town?

783
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:10,805
Find somewhere else cheaper,
then we'll match it at that price.

784
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:12,914
That's good. We'll match it!

785
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:15,108
They'll match it?
What does that mean?

786
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,916
Whatever the guy buys somewhere else
he can get here for the same price.

787
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:22,422
What the hell does he need to
do that for?

788
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:26,461
He bought it, and then they guarantee
they'll give him the same price.

789
00:55:26,664 --> 00:55:29,599
That makes no sense. He's gotta
take it back to the shop...

790
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:32,861
...and then get it here?
- Why wouldn't that make sense?

791
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:34,868
- They'd guarantee it?
- Yes.

792
00:55:35,073 --> 00:55:37,439
They'd guarantee it.
Maybe make it lower.

793
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:40,110
How much lower? Because if it's
a nickel lower...

794
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,576
...I won't take it all the way back
to get it here for a nickel less.

795
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:45,305
A little higher!

796
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,575
Can we just put up the sign?

797
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:51,282
Is it me,
or does it look a little low?

798
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,354
No, it's still low. It's low.

799
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:57,289
I gotta go to the doctor's, then pick
up the kids from the movie around 4.

800
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:58,587
- The movies?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:03,165
From 10 in the morning to 4?
What do they watch, 9 movies?

802
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:04,733
You're going to the doctor's?

803
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,904
Just a checkup.
What time will you be home?

804
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,834
I'll be home probably around 7.

805
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,567
Can you see if my mother wants to go
back with you? Please?

806
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,373
What are they doing? They're arguing
again. Arguing again.

807
00:56:21,386 --> 00:56:22,910
You want to ride back with me?

808
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:24,145
With you?

809
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:25,452
Yeah.

810
00:56:25,657 --> 00:56:28,182
No, I think it's still too soon.

811
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,595
- I've been driving for six months.
- No, still too soon.

812
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:35,698
You gotta go all the way uptown.
Lot of turns to make. It's too soon.

813
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,869
You'll have to wait till 7:00.
That's when Jules is going home.

814
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,300
I'll take a streetcar.
It's on tracks.

815
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:43,770
You take the 32 and you're there.

816
00:56:43,975 --> 00:56:45,670
All right. Fine.

817
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,304
Higher!

818
00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:50,174
- I cannot believe your mother.
- She's not going with you?

819
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,941
No, I haven't been driving
long enough for her.

820
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:58,611
<i>What's that?</i>

821
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,731
I wonder how long it'll be
until we get our own rocket suits.

822
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,998
It'll be great.

823
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:20,371
We'll be able to rocket to school
and rocket back home.

824
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:21,408
It will be great.

825
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:26,382
I'd love to see my grandmother
rocketing to the store to get bread.

826
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,995
Go, Rocket Man!

827
00:57:57,215 --> 00:57:58,273
Yeah!

828
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,895
Hi, will you fill her up?
I'm going to get my kids.

829
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:15,190
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

830
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,733
Oh, I can't see.

831
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:30,971
It's because you've been sitting in
a dark movie theater all afternoon.

832
00:58:51,202 --> 00:58:53,864
<i>I can't believe this.</i>
<i>Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

833
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,768
<i>What are you saying?</i>
<i>That it's my fault?</i>

834
00:58:56,974 --> 00:58:58,805
I'm not saying it's your fault.

835
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:02,912
You say it like it's my fault
that the streetcar smashed my car.

836
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:07,278
I'm not saying it's your fault.
No, you took the car and it got hit.

837
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:10,750
- And I could have been sitting in it.
- You don't understand.

838
00:59:10,955 --> 00:59:14,652
You make it sound as if I'm
responsible, as if it's my fault.

839
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,793
I've been in this country 40 years.

840
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:20,327
I've never seen a streetcar jump
the track and hit a car.

841
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:23,056
Am I crazy, or does it sound
like it's my fault?

842
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:26,259
You're being sensitive.
She's not blaming you.

843
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:30,168
- You're not blaming her, are you?
- No, no, I'm not blaming her.

844
00:59:30,374 --> 00:59:33,468
What I'm saying is, they should
get rid of the streetcars.

845
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,374
They got buses.
Why do they need streetcars?

846
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:38,446
The tracks are too slippery.

847
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,880
I don't even like Sam
to drive in the rain.

848
00:59:42,086 --> 00:59:45,647
The tracks is dangerous. When it
gets wet, it gets too slippery.

849
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:49,884
Do you know anyone whose car got hit
by a streetcar off its tracks?

850
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:51,152
It's a first.

851
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:53,830
To think I could've been
sitting in that car.

852
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:56,556
Thank God I didn't get into
that machine.

853
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,962
I cannot believe this conversation.

854
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,297
Can we put the streetcar talk to rest?

855
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:04,566
We're lucky it was nothing serious.
That's the end of it.

856
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:08,176
You should've seen it, Dad.
It was just like the cliffhangers.

857
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,309
Michael!

858
01:00:09,514 --> 01:00:11,607
- Ellen Ferguson.
- What?

859
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:14,785
Ellen Ferguson's car got hit
by a streetcar.

860
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,547
It wasn't a streetcar.
It was a train.

861
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:21,987
Off of Saratoga. Freight train.
It wasn't a streetcar.

862
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:24,286
- It wasn't a streetcar?
- It was a train.

863
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,860
Do you know where my coat is?

864
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:28,429
In the back closet.
It was too crowded.

865
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:31,659
Never has there been a streetcar
jumped its tracks.

866
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:35,202
Now, a train has jumped its tracks,
but never a streetcar.

867
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:39,706
I circulated over 10,000 fliers for
the opening of the new store, Dad.

868
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:41,310
I never believed in fliers.

869
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:45,039
If people don't pay for something,
they won't bother reading it.

870
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:47,911
The newspaper you pay for,
then you read an ad.

871
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,816
Let's hope you're wrong, because we
can't afford newspaper ads.

872
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:56,824
You can gamble, you're young. You make
mistakes, you can always start again.

873
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,395
See what Solomon did. He could have
stayed in the shoe business...

874
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,598
...but he gambled. Today, he's got...

875
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,394
One of Baltimore's
biggest department stores.

876
01:01:05,603 --> 01:01:08,572
- That is true.
- I can't find the coat.

877
01:01:08,773 --> 01:01:11,571
Oh, God. I sent it to the cleaners.

878
01:01:11,776 --> 01:01:13,903
Dad, where's the keys to your car?

879
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:18,048
Here.

880
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,111
You ready, hon?

881
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:22,252
I'm just putting on my coat.

882
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:25,516
- Michael, be good.
- I will.

883
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,948
Don't be late.

884
01:01:30,394 --> 01:01:31,827
And it's true with Solomon.

885
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,574
I'm about this far away
from losing my mind.

886
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:52,911
Thank you.

887
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:56,645
Want pictures here? Pictures?

888
01:01:58,823 --> 01:02:01,291
Pictures? Pictures?

889
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,251
- Pictures?
- No, thank you.

890
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:05,395
Pictures here? All right.

891
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,790
Pictures here?

892
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:25,574
Can I get a picture?

893
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,013
All right. Come on.
Everybody smile.

894
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,413
Don't laugh.

895
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,178
I'm not laughing.

896
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:33,857
Yes, you are. I can see it.

897
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,422
Miss? Miss?
Let's do it again.

898
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,527
- What do you want?
- My eyes weren't open.

899
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:41,220
They were fine.
What's your problem?

900
01:02:41,432 --> 01:02:42,763
I'm getting nervous.

901
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,559
You? You getting nervous?

902
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:45,758
He makes me nervous.

903
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,938
We're back to
the business again.

904
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,128
He started it.

905
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,329
- What?
- No, no, no.

906
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,736
Maybe the customers won't show.

907
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:55,343
We're expanding. We're getting in
over... You getting this?

908
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:58,947
It was a genuine concern,
and it remains a genuine concern.

909
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,744
Genuine concern? That I like.

910
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:04,853
Genuine concern. Very nice phrase.

911
01:03:05,056 --> 01:03:08,287
I have to admit, he tends to be
on the conservative side.

912
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:10,858
If this expansion doesn't go over...

913
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:14,793
...we're out of the suburbs
and back into row houses, huh?

914
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:16,660
That's a genuine concern.

915
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:20,098
We'll toast to genuine concerns.
It's been acknowledged.

916
01:03:20,304 --> 01:03:22,864
No, let's toast to the suburbs,
shall we?

917
01:03:23,074 --> 01:03:24,371
Better.

918
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,344
Honey, don't count.
Just...

919
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:39,511
Am I doing good?

920
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:42,693
- You're doing wonderful.
- Thank you.

921
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:48,127
Who would've thought that this bargain
marriage would have lasted this long?

922
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:54,370
You know, I didn't get a chance
to tell you before, but...

923
01:03:55,106 --> 01:03:56,573
But what?

924
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,169
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

925
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,112
You're what?

926
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,074
I am pregnant. I'm pregnant.

927
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:09,718
- You're kidding?
- No, I am not kidding.

928
01:04:10,688 --> 01:04:13,589
You have great news
and you wait until now to tell me?

929
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:17,659
I would've told you sooner, but the
streetcar discussion got in the way.

930
01:04:17,862 --> 01:04:20,558
It didn't seem like the proper time
to get in the fact...

931
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:22,733
...that I'm pregnant again.

932
01:04:26,504 --> 01:04:29,701
Let's face it, the streetcar
story was all-consuming.

933
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,398
Honey, this is great news.

934
01:04:40,684 --> 01:04:42,777
Let's do that promenade thing.

935
01:05:34,004 --> 01:05:36,598
Please. It's bad enough
over there.

936
01:06:13,878 --> 01:06:15,175
What is this?

937
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,015
What is this?

938
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:21,578
There's a lot of people for something.

939
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:24,313
This is us.

940
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,887
This is for us!

941
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:31,355
- Discount is here.
- Oh, this is good.

942
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:34,030
- Look at this!
- This is good.

943
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:37,359
Don't go anywhere,
we're coming right out!

944
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:12,099
But I don't even know what
he looks like.

945
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:18,772
Where are the people who
know where the people are?

946
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:38,752
Simka.

947
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,367
Simkala!

948
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,555
Gittle, welcome, welcome.

949
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:14,255
I don't know exactly what
they were saying.

950
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:17,359
I couldn't tell if they met
in the concentration camp.

951
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:21,793
It couldn't be that, right?
Must have been the refugee camp.

952
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,733
I don't think she was
in a concentration camp.

953
01:09:27,004 --> 01:09:30,633
What I got was that
her husband died in the war.

954
01:09:31,108 --> 01:09:32,405
No, I didn't get that.

955
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:36,067
She would not have had that child
in a concentration camp.

956
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,578
I think he met her
in the refugee camp.

957
01:09:38,782 --> 01:09:42,650
To think a woman could survive
a concentration camp with a child.

958
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:45,344
Oh, my God.
It gives me the chills.

959
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,116
I don't think she was
in a concentration camp.

960
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:52,625
I got that they met in a refugee camp,
that her husband died.

961
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:57,460
But the refugee camp was recently
and the kid is like six, so...

962
01:09:58,302 --> 01:09:59,564
No.

963
01:10:00,003 --> 01:10:01,698
We'll have to ask later.

964
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:11,513
See, there's nothing else to
do with it. It's done.

965
01:10:11,715 --> 01:10:15,879
That's the problem with model planes.
There's nothing to do but look at them.

966
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,280
It doesn't fly.

967
01:10:17,488 --> 01:10:18,682
It'll never fly.

968
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:22,290
We could throw it off a building
and watch it crash.

969
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:25,087
How about a cliffhanger?

970
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:27,763
Now that's an idea.

971
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:17,577
Boom!

972
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:19,646
Another chapter!

973
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,678
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What's happening?

974
01:11:24,888 --> 01:11:27,220
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

975
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:31,591
You'll burn the house!

976
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:33,990
You've got the wing on your foot!

977
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:41,930
Fire in the house will burn
the house to the ground.

978
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:44,539
It was just a cliffhanger.

979
01:11:46,577 --> 01:11:48,909
The pilgrims started it,
whoever they were.

980
01:11:49,112 --> 01:11:53,742
We all have to give thanks. We kill
a turkey and everybody says thank you.

981
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:55,418
It's a holiday.

982
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:59,146
We never have turkey the rest of the
year, but now we have to eat it.

983
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:03,554
It's a funny holiday, if you ask me.
It makes no sense.

984
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,923
- Are we going to eat?
- Gabriel should be here any minute.

985
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,724
That man will be late
for his own funeral.

986
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:15,035
Dad? Dad, why don't we eat?

987
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:16,365
Yeah, we're hungry!

988
01:12:17,274 --> 01:12:18,639
- I'm hungry.
- We want to eat.

989
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:21,538
No, no, no.
We should wait for Gabriel.

990
01:12:21,745 --> 01:12:22,734
Wait for Gabriel.

991
01:12:22,946 --> 01:12:24,880
Every year we go through
the same thing.

992
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:28,017
We can't cut the turkey
because of Gabriel.

993
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,049
Jules...

994
01:12:30,254 --> 01:12:32,017
...cut the turkey!

995
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,992
- I made the mold this time.
- It's lovely.

996
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:46,933
- I hate when food touches.
- It all ends up in the same place.

997
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:49,332
I hate that!
I hate when it touches!

998
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:50,904
Michael.

999
01:12:54,945 --> 01:12:56,469
Sorry we're late.

1000
01:12:58,849 --> 01:12:59,679
Gabriel.

1001
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:04,478
You started without me?

1002
01:13:05,822 --> 01:13:08,689
You cut the turkey without me?

1003
01:13:12,162 --> 01:13:15,689
Come on, we leave.
They start without us, we go.

1004
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,357
Every year you're late. We were
hungry, the kids wanted to eat.

1005
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:20,536
We couldn't wait.

1006
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:23,865
Your own flesh and blood,
and you couldn't wait?

1007
01:13:24,074 --> 01:13:25,541
You cut the turkey!

1008
01:13:26,977 --> 01:13:30,435
That's it! That's the last time
we come for Thanksgiving!

1009
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:32,842
Gabriel, come here, for God's sake.

1010
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,413
Gabriel! Gabriel!

1011
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,849
- Come back!
- Such a lunatic.

1012
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:40,353
It's ridiculous.
The same thing every year.

1013
01:13:40,557 --> 01:13:43,788
We wait for him, he shows up late,
then we cut the turkey.

1014
01:13:43,994 --> 01:13:46,155
You cut the turkey!

1015
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:49,157
It took us hours to get here.

1016
01:13:49,366 --> 01:13:51,596
You live miles from nowhere.

1017
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:56,136
It's too far, for God's sake.
Too far for relatives.

1018
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,739
Your new relatives.

1019
01:13:57,941 --> 01:14:01,001
You have relatives that live near you
who you'll wait for.

1020
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:05,409
Gabriel, for God's sake, let's not
make an issue out of the turkey.

1021
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:08,175
That's what happens
when you get to be wealthy.

1022
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:12,549
Your son's wealthy so you don't wait
for your brother to cut the turkey.

1023
01:14:12,756 --> 01:14:13,882
To hell with you!

1024
01:14:14,091 --> 01:14:14,989
To hell with me?

1025
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:19,720
Jules making a good living has nothing
to do with the turkey. Nothing!

1026
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,191
When we lived in Avalon, nobody ate.

1027
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:24,492
You wait for everybody
before you eat...

1028
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,067
...much less cut the turkey
without a brother.

1029
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,501
You move to the suburbs and you think
it doesn't matter anymore.

1030
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:33,676
The young ones are hungry.
They make a commotion.

1031
01:14:33,877 --> 01:14:36,175
You want to stand on ceremony
with the family?

1032
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,908
There's always young ones that are
hungry that carry on and want to eat.

1033
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:45,714
They got to wait till every relative
is there before the turkey's cut.

1034
01:14:45,922 --> 01:14:47,913
I've said enough!

1035
01:15:11,615 --> 01:15:12,582
What's wrong?

1036
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:39,875
<i>Put all kitchen appliances here.</i>

1037
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,807
<i>Washing machines, refrigerators,</i>
<i>a whole department.</i>

1038
01:15:43,013 --> 01:15:47,279
We got one entire floor just for
bedroom sets, sleepers, sofas.

1039
01:15:47,484 --> 01:15:50,419
It's been no time since we
expanded the other place.

1040
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,589
- Where's the money coming from?
- The bank is financing us.

1041
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:54,620
The bank?

1042
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:57,089
They're giving us the money.
This is the time.

1043
01:15:57,294 --> 01:16:01,697
You know, you open a place like this,
no one can compete with us.

1044
01:16:01,898 --> 01:16:04,924
We got a chance, we might as well
run with it.

1045
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:07,365
Discount department store.

1046
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:09,664
- Right.
- This place is enormous.

1047
01:16:09,873 --> 01:16:12,535
What's the worst that can happen?
It goes under.

1048
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,137
It goes under?

1049
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:16,744
Right. How much money
you got right now?

1050
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,040
You got nothing. You got nothing.

1051
01:16:19,249 --> 01:16:24,152
I got nothing because every time
I make a dollar, you want to expand.

1052
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:29,524
God forbid the place goes under.
You can't have less than nothing.

1053
01:16:29,726 --> 01:16:32,388
It's not a lot. What are we?
We're a discount warehouse.

1054
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:37,192
There's nothing like it. No frills,
no fixtures. No one's ever done this.

1055
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,425
I'll have to invent new ways
to count money.

1056
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,968
We're gonna tear up this town.

1057
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:43,666
Yeah?

1058
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:48,135
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yes!

1059
01:16:48,345 --> 01:16:49,710
Let's do it.

1060
01:16:56,653 --> 01:17:01,590
A job at McCormick's spice company.
Good, very good. Good.

1061
01:17:03,193 --> 01:17:05,093
We'll have a family-circle meeting.

1062
01:17:05,295 --> 01:17:07,786
Get everybody to help you
get your own place.

1063
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:12,030
Own place.

1064
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:17,506
That's a good drink.

1065
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:20,870
You'll have your own place.
You'll be an American, like us.

1066
01:17:21,611 --> 01:17:22,771
Two...

1067
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:24,742
...eleven...

1068
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:27,713
...and thirteen.

1069
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:29,681
That's the only channels we've got.

1070
01:17:29,886 --> 01:17:31,854
<i>Howdy Doody</i> on 11.

1071
01:17:32,055 --> 01:17:35,752
That's the channel you want
in the afternoon. Want to try it?

1072
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:39,918
Two, 11, 13.

1073
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:42,632
<i>Howdy Doody.</i>

1074
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:46,563
Monday through Friday, <i>Captain Video.</i>
That one's great.

1075
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,330
Did you ever see <i>Captain Video</i>
where you come from?

1076
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,632
<i>Captain Video?</i>

1077
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,400
<i>Captain Video.</i>

1078
01:18:01,284 --> 01:18:02,717
Where is Michael?

1079
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:04,443
He's in the car.

1080
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:07,346
When's Jules coming
to the family circle?

1081
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:11,823
He'll be there. He said he
wanted to take some golf lessons.

1082
01:18:12,028 --> 01:18:13,962
Golf? He's gonna play golf?

1083
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:17,930
That's what I said when I heard.
A working person doesn't play golf.

1084
01:18:18,134 --> 01:18:20,159
It's for people
with feathers and a cap.

1085
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,531
<i>Where does he get such crazy ideas?</i>

1086
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:24,070
<i>Why is it so unusual?</i>

1087
01:18:24,274 --> 01:18:27,072
<i>It's not unusual.</i>
<i>I just never heard of it.</i>

1088
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:28,904
<i>Don't run with the machine.</i>

1089
01:18:29,112 --> 01:18:32,343
<i>I'm not running.</i>
<i>I'm going 25 miles an hour.</i>

1090
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:36,679
<i>You're running, you're running!</i>
<i>The trees are going past too quick.</i>

1091
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:38,979
Okay. Goodbye, buddy.

1092
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:41,657
- Ooh, touching!
- Touching!

1093
01:18:44,327 --> 01:18:46,761
I'm gonna use my Linky.
Beat that.

1094
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:54,193
I don't think we have to chip in
for Simka, that's all.

1095
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:55,928
It's part of our tradition.

1096
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:58,903
One brings another over.
We supported them.

1097
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,475
We took care of them.
You brought me.

1098
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:04,272
When did we last give
percentages of our money?

1099
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:05,948
How long has it been?

1100
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:07,776
It's got to have been 25 years.

1101
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:10,646
Belle came over in the late '20s...

1102
01:19:10,854 --> 01:19:13,482
...so it wouldn't be 25 years.
Let's see now.

1103
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,317
It couldn't be 25 years.

1104
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:17,959
It's close to 25 years.

1105
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:22,163
He came in 1930, then it's close
to 25 years and that's it!

1106
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:24,799
You want to support every Tom,
Dick and Harry?

1107
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:29,438
We're talking about my wife's brother.
Herbie, you talk like an idiot.

1108
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,869
Don't call my son an idiot.
He's not an idiot.

1109
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:33,337
Tom, Dick and Harry.

1110
01:19:33,543 --> 01:19:36,637
He has never had any sense.
Never had common sense.

1111
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:40,077
Just because Jules has money,
you call my Herbie an idiot?

1112
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:42,774
Come on! Nobody's calling
anybody an idiot.

1113
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,419
He called my son an idiot.

1114
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:49,149
His son makes money, and all of
a sudden they get this attitude.

1115
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:51,759
What attitude?
What are you talking about?

1116
01:19:51,961 --> 01:19:56,591
Living out in the sticks, you don't
wait for anybody to cut the turkey.

1117
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,826
This is about
the goddamn turkey again!

1118
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:02,766
The goddamn turkey again
and again and again.

1119
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:03,836
Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,837
The man has a mind like an elephant.

1121
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:07,839
He drove all that time...

1122
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:10,376
...and you eat the dinner
before he gets there.

1123
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,378
Who ate? We didn't eat the dinner,
we cut the turkey!

1124
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:16,143
- You ate.
- It wasn't how much you ate...

1125
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:20,790
...or you didn't eat. It was the act.
The disregard for an older brother.

1126
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,550
You might as well have stabbed me
in the heart.

1127
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,957
What's this about here, huh?

1128
01:20:26,162 --> 01:20:29,529
This meeting is about cutting
a turkey or is about Simka?

1129
01:20:29,733 --> 01:20:33,134
Let's get back to the issue about how
to support Simka and his family.

1130
01:20:33,336 --> 01:20:36,464
Another member of the wealthy
contingent is speaking.

1131
01:20:36,673 --> 01:20:40,609
Uncle Gabriel, we're out there busting
our asses to make a living.

1132
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:43,301
- Why are you so contemptuous?
- The language.

1133
01:20:43,513 --> 01:20:46,038
The language.
The children are outside.

1134
01:20:46,249 --> 01:20:48,945
We're not talking about a lot of money
for Eva's brother.

1135
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,551
Not a lot of money?

1136
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:54,417
Enough of this. I'll give Simka
the money and put an end to it.

1137
01:20:54,624 --> 01:20:55,716
I'm with you, pal.

1138
01:20:55,959 --> 01:20:58,223
Good. Let's move on
to the next business.

1139
01:20:58,428 --> 01:20:59,258
Next business?

1140
01:20:59,462 --> 01:21:01,123
Next business:

1141
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:02,996
I resign.

1142
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,625
That's the next business.
I resign.

1143
01:21:05,835 --> 01:21:07,132
Oh, he resigns!

1144
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:08,235
I resign!

1145
01:21:08,438 --> 01:21:11,271
I am finished! I am finished.

1146
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,268
Let's try to settle this.

1147
01:21:15,812 --> 01:21:19,304
I'm insulted. I am not gonna stay
where I am not wanted.

1148
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,914
He was a lousy president anyway.

1149
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:23,244
I'm not wanted.

1150
01:21:23,453 --> 01:21:25,182
Come back, Sam.

1151
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:27,616
We need you, Sam.

1152
01:21:27,824 --> 01:21:29,553
We're going. Get in the car.

1153
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,688
Teddy, Mindy, come on.

1154
01:21:32,796 --> 01:21:35,287
Teddy, Mindy, come on. Come on!

1155
01:21:35,498 --> 01:21:38,990
Sam, Sam! Come back, for God's sake!
Let's talk.

1156
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:42,194
Gabriel, let's talk.
Come out! You're brothers!

1157
01:21:42,405 --> 01:21:43,929
- Is it over already?
- Sam!

1158
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,630
We're going to get Chinese?

1159
01:21:45,842 --> 01:21:47,673
- Get in the car.
- Where's your car?

1160
01:21:47,877 --> 01:21:50,004
The golf pro dropped Izzy and me off.

1161
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:52,010
Never do I come back. Never!

1162
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:56,010
We brought you to this country.

1163
01:21:56,553 --> 01:21:59,181
We put you in
the paper-hanging business.

1164
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:03,018
And if it wasn't for my say-so,
you'd still be in the old country.

1165
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,394
You wanted to quit the paper business.
You wanted to own your own club...

1166
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:09,690
...I said, okay.

1167
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:11,867
When the nightclub was over...

1168
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:15,231
...and you wanted back in
the business, I said, okay!

1169
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:19,135
That's got nothing to do with nothing.
Nothing!

1170
01:22:20,376 --> 01:22:25,313
I came to a Thanksgiving dinner
at my brother's house.

1171
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:28,611
But you have no respect.

1172
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,347
No respect!

1173
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:44,454
I remember when I brought home
the piano for Jules.

1174
01:23:45,762 --> 01:23:49,323
It was a beautiful, sunny day.

1175
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:54,467
You should learn how to play.

1176
01:23:54,704 --> 01:23:55,966
I don't know.

1177
01:23:56,172 --> 01:23:57,298
I don't know?

1178
01:23:57,507 --> 01:23:59,907
I tried to teach your father...

1179
01:24:01,177 --> 01:24:05,238
...but he never learned. Never.

1180
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:08,143
That's a shame.

1181
01:24:36,646 --> 01:24:40,082
The baby's going in your bedroom.
Where are you going to go?

1182
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:43,616
Michael, there comes a time
when have to leave your kids.

1183
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,050
Your mom and dad
need their own place.

1184
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,651
But where are you gonna go?

1185
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:53,690
We'll get a place with Simka,
Gittle and Elka.

1186
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:56,126
You mean you won't live here?

1187
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:59,491
See the seam. You get a bubble in it.

1188
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:03,194
You use the brush like this
and you smooth it out.

1189
01:25:03,406 --> 01:25:04,395
Can I try it?

1190
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:05,869
Here.

1191
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:10,708
It's not important for you
to know how to wallpaper...

1192
01:25:10,913 --> 01:25:13,177
...because you should never do this
in your life.

1193
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:20,885
I don't want you to ever leave.

1194
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:25,355
One way or another,
we all have to leave.

1195
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:57,278
On July 4th, the largest discount
department store warehouse...

1196
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,778
...in the state of Maryland
opens its doors.

1197
01:27:59,982 --> 01:28:02,644
Hi, I'm Jules Kaye.

1198
01:28:02,852 --> 01:28:06,652
And I'm Izzy Kirk.
That's right, Jules, July 4th...

1199
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:11,555
...the day you'll get independence
from higher prices when K&K expands.

1200
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:14,753
60,000 square feet
of discounted merchandise.

1201
01:28:14,964 --> 01:28:19,628
And with that guaranteed
lowest-price-in-town sticker price...

1202
01:28:20,102 --> 01:28:20,932
That's not right.

1203
01:28:21,137 --> 01:28:22,069
Okay. Cut it.

1204
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:23,238
What? Sounded good to me.

1205
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:25,532
You said price twice.
That threw you off.

1206
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:27,641
- Price twice.
- You said it twice.

1207
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,334
Let's reset and do this again.

1208
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:32,605
Lowest-price-guaranteed sticker.

1209
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:34,612
Guaranteed-Iowest-price sticker.

1210
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:35,841
This is tough.

1211
01:28:36,052 --> 01:28:39,044
We should've got the announcer.
I'm not good at this.

1212
01:28:39,255 --> 01:28:41,155
- They're too professional.
- I'm not good.

1213
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,052
You're very good. We're salesmen.

1214
01:28:43,259 --> 01:28:45,352
Who better to sell than salesmen?

1215
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:49,053
Besides, we can't even
afford these spots.

1216
01:28:53,402 --> 01:28:54,630
You'll kill me with this.

1217
01:28:54,837 --> 01:28:57,670
Every time I turn around,
you remind me how broke we are.

1218
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:01,901
Seriously, this TV thing is
way beyond the advertising budget.

1219
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:05,706
I told you, nothing will get
the message across like that.

1220
01:29:05,915 --> 01:29:08,713
You told me, you told me.
You love television.

1221
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,582
If what you're saying is true,
what are we gonna do?

1222
01:29:12,788 --> 01:29:14,312
Don't worry, all right?

1223
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:16,684
Just shift some money around.

1224
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,088
Take from this area, take it to there.

1225
01:29:19,295 --> 01:29:20,990
Creative financing.
Boom-boom-boom.

1226
01:29:21,197 --> 01:29:23,131
Everyone does it all the time.

1227
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:25,327
Lowest-guaranteed-price sticker?

1228
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:26,967
Can I see the card again?

1229
01:29:27,503 --> 01:29:28,697
Can I see that card again?

1230
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,135
Mr. Kaye, you mother's on the phone.

1231
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:32,204
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1232
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:35,070
My mother's on the phone?
My mother's on the phone.

1233
01:29:35,278 --> 01:29:37,872
Excuse me.
My mother's on the phone.

1234
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,741
His mother's on the phone.

1235
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,775
Come on, Jules.
Time's money, huh?

1236
01:29:42,985 --> 01:29:44,179
Hold on a second, Mom.

1237
01:29:44,387 --> 01:29:48,448
You won't believe this. Simka's moving
to New Jersey to work on a farm.

1238
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:49,755
A farm?

1239
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:52,018
How did this happen?
I don't understand.

1240
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:53,327
With cows?

1241
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:56,293
One of the people he works with
at the spices?

1242
01:29:56,499 --> 01:29:58,399
All right. All right, Mom.

1243
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:01,536
We're gonna have to talk later,
all right? Bye.

1244
01:30:02,138 --> 01:30:03,162
What was that about?

1245
01:30:03,372 --> 01:30:07,206
A worker at McCormick's has a brother.
He's got a farm in New Jersey.

1246
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:10,106
He made Simka a deal.
He'll be the farm manager.

1247
01:30:10,313 --> 01:30:12,304
Or whatever the hell they call it.

1248
01:30:12,515 --> 01:30:15,484
It turns out he thinks it's too busy
in a big city.

1249
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:17,016
That's something.

1250
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:20,347
- She comes to America in 1918.
- 1916.

1251
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:23,218
She's got a brother
who was born after she left.

1252
01:30:23,426 --> 01:30:26,156
He gets caught up in the war,
concentration camp.

1253
01:30:26,362 --> 01:30:30,093
They finally meet for the first time
in 30 years...

1254
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:33,530
...and in less than one year,
he decides to move on.

1255
01:30:33,736 --> 01:30:36,068
So much for family reunions.

1256
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,343
Everybody out.

1257
01:30:42,511 --> 01:30:45,344
- You got your jacket, Jules?
- Wait up, Teddy.

1258
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:49,043
I hope they show up. Good luck.

1259
01:30:49,251 --> 01:30:51,947
They showed up for the
George Washington sale.

1260
01:30:52,154 --> 01:30:54,019
It's one thing they show for that...

1261
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:58,023
...it's another on 4th of July
with 60,000 feet of merchandise.

1262
01:30:58,227 --> 01:31:00,491
All right, boys. Time to go to work.

1263
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:02,931
I forgot something.

1264
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:04,827
I forgot my model-plane kit.

1265
01:31:05,034 --> 01:31:07,594
You think he'll be all right
down there all day?

1266
01:31:07,803 --> 01:31:10,101
He's got Teddy to play with.

1267
01:31:10,306 --> 01:31:12,706
- Don't kick the seat.
- I'll see you later.

1268
01:31:13,275 --> 01:31:16,267
Come on, Michael. Hurry.
Big day. Don't hold them up.

1269
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,909
- Bye.
- Come on, come on.

1270
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:26,988
Take a look at that.

1271
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:28,247
An SE5a.

1272
01:31:28,457 --> 01:31:31,187
This will be good to build and burn.

1273
01:31:31,894 --> 01:31:32,883
You nervous?

1274
01:31:33,662 --> 01:31:35,061
- I'm not.
- You're nervous.

1275
01:31:35,264 --> 01:31:37,198
All right, I'm nervous.

1276
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:42,036
What happens if we get there
and only eight or nine people show?

1277
01:31:43,105 --> 01:31:44,663
You see all this?

1278
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,339
Take a good look.

1279
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:48,075
You won't see it again.

1280
01:31:48,444 --> 01:31:50,742
- Back to the row houses?
- That's right.

1281
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:51,565
Finally got through to the store.
They say it's a madhouse.

1282
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:53,002
What a relief.

1283
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:57,407
Joe says the fire marshal's there
to keep some of the crowd out.

1284
01:32:57,613 --> 01:33:00,138
There's more people than they
know what to do with.

1285
01:33:00,349 --> 01:33:02,146
- That's amazing.
- They did it!

1286
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:03,511
- Mom...
- Just a second.

1287
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:05,619
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.

1288
01:33:05,821 --> 01:33:09,689
They're playing in the basement,
building a model airplane.

1289
01:33:09,892 --> 01:33:11,359
- Mom, can l...
- Just a second.

1290
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,586
They could be out here in the sun
with the other kids.

1291
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:17,664
Instead they're in a hot basement.
Beats me.

1292
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:20,333
I blame Teddy.
What do you want, sweetie?

1293
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:22,663
Is it time to go back in the water?

1294
01:33:22,872 --> 01:33:25,033
Ten minutes until you digest.

1295
01:33:47,296 --> 01:33:49,491
I think you put too many in there!

1296
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,744
Oh, my God!

1297
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:10,384
A fire is starting!

1298
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:15,683
Everything's catching fire!

1299
01:34:52,461 --> 01:34:53,359
Nothing.

1300
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:55,029
I think that's it.

1301
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:02,867
That was close.

1302
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:06,701
Just what we need. We burn the store
down the first day it opens.

1303
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,843
That's just what we need.

1304
01:35:09,545 --> 01:35:11,843
It don't get much better than this!

1305
01:35:12,047 --> 01:35:15,915
$19,628!

1306
01:35:16,118 --> 01:35:18,211
How do you like that?

1307
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,186
Way to go, brothers!

1308
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:23,517
You were right. You were right.
We're rich.

1309
01:36:01,664 --> 01:36:04,326
Dad, that sounds horrible.

1310
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,796
Mr. Kirk.

1311
01:36:09,004 --> 01:36:10,631
You have a telephone call.

1312
01:36:10,839 --> 01:36:12,830
- What is it?
- I haven't got the call yet.

1313
01:36:13,042 --> 01:36:16,842
- Where is it?
- You can get it over at the snack bar.

1314
01:36:17,046 --> 01:36:18,911
- Thank you, sir.
- Be right back.

1315
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,145
Hello?

1316
01:36:28,524 --> 01:36:29,513
Yeah.

1317
01:36:29,725 --> 01:36:30,487
What?

1318
01:36:45,074 --> 01:36:46,701
Jules. Jules!

1319
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:49,469
- What?
- The new store's on fire.

1320
01:36:49,678 --> 01:36:51,145
- What?
- It's on fire!

1321
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:52,336
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1322
01:36:52,548 --> 01:36:54,709
It's a four-alarm. Come on!

1323
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:59,177
Dottie, the store's on fire.
We got to go.

1324
01:36:59,388 --> 01:37:00,685
Oh, no.

1325
01:37:17,573 --> 01:37:20,167
Don't say anything to anybody. Ever.

1326
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:23,072
We did it. We burned
the whole store down.

1327
01:37:23,278 --> 01:37:25,212
Hey, Michael! Come on! We're going!

1328
01:37:25,414 --> 01:37:28,315
Remember. Nothing to nobody.

1329
01:38:08,123 --> 01:38:09,112
We're the owners.

1330
01:38:09,324 --> 01:38:10,450
It doesn't look good.

1331
01:38:10,659 --> 01:38:11,819
What do you mean?

1332
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:12,959
Can you save it?

1333
01:38:13,162 --> 01:38:14,720
We're trying to contain it.

1334
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,864
There's nothing you can do?

1335
01:38:17,065 --> 01:38:18,862
We're doing all we can.

1336
01:38:27,476 --> 01:38:28,738
Michael!

1337
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:37,509
Michael!

1338
01:38:38,587 --> 01:38:41,351
I don't know if he'll go to the store.
I'll go after him.

1339
01:38:41,557 --> 01:38:43,149
- Will you stay?
- Of course.

1340
01:38:43,358 --> 01:38:46,054
Are you sure you two
didn't have a fight?

1341
01:40:28,997 --> 01:40:31,056
I hate this thing.

1342
01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:34,394
The radio, you put it on the station,
it's there.

1343
01:40:34,636 --> 01:40:37,662
Here the picture goes this way
and that way.

1344
01:40:41,143 --> 01:40:43,737
That's it. You got radio.

1345
01:40:48,116 --> 01:40:50,778
- Sam!
- Michael is here?

1346
01:40:50,986 --> 01:40:52,419
Michael, what's wrong?

1347
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,486
- I did a terrible thing.
- Calm down.

1348
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:56,055
No.

1349
01:41:00,162 --> 01:41:01,527
I did a terrible thing.

1350
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,823
- Terrible. Terrible.
- What happened?

1351
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:08,469
Me and Teddy played with the model
airplane and something happened.

1352
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,434
- I told you not to play with that.
- I didn't know.

1353
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,803
- I knew it. Now it's happened.
- We put it out.

1354
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,035
- Eva, please.
- It was just a little fire.

1355
01:41:17,245 --> 01:41:19,543
What are you talking about?

1356
01:41:19,748 --> 01:41:22,979
- I burned the store down.
- Oh, my God!

1357
01:41:27,823 --> 01:41:29,688
I don't know where he is.

1358
01:41:29,891 --> 01:41:33,258
He ran out of the house.
I thought maybe he came down here.

1359
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,293
I don't know where he is.

1360
01:41:35,497 --> 01:41:39,228
- What are you yelling at me for?
- I'm not! I'm worried about him!

1361
01:41:39,434 --> 01:41:41,129
- What?
- Come on.

1362
01:41:41,336 --> 01:41:42,428
I'll be right there.

1363
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:44,503
Call my parents. Maybe he's there.

1364
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:47,174
- I'll go look for him.
- Call my parents.

1365
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:49,207
And let me know. All right?

1366
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:00,281
I told your mother...

1367
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,947
...to have your father
come and get you...

1368
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:08,095
...because you had something
very important to say.

1369
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,559
You'll have to tell him.

1370
01:42:16,438 --> 01:42:18,429
How am I going to do that?

1371
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:29,180
Michael.

1372
01:42:31,386 --> 01:42:32,819
Michael.

1373
01:42:53,175 --> 01:42:55,040
So, what's all the mystery?

1374
01:42:57,045 --> 01:42:59,639
Michael has something
he has to tell you.

1375
01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:01,711
Go, Michael.

1376
01:43:07,456 --> 01:43:08,889
Daddy...

1377
01:43:09,357 --> 01:43:11,052
...it's my fault.

1378
01:43:11,293 --> 01:43:12,453
What?

1379
01:43:12,761 --> 01:43:14,228
I burned the store down.

1380
01:43:15,297 --> 01:43:16,662
You what?

1381
01:43:17,499 --> 01:43:22,163
Me and Teddy were playing
with the model airplane...

1382
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:26,136
...and we finished it and put glue
all around the basement...

1383
01:43:26,341 --> 01:43:30,004
...and Teddy had some firecrackers...

1384
01:43:30,212 --> 01:43:31,509
...and we added those.

1385
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,874
We lit it and it caught fire...

1386
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:37,950
...and we thought we put it out,
but we didn't, I guess.

1387
01:43:42,324 --> 01:43:44,690
Sit down.

1388
01:43:45,794 --> 01:43:48,991
How many times have you been told
not to play with fire?

1389
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:50,562
- Lots.
- A lot.

1390
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:53,496
You think maybe it's time
you start to listen?

1391
01:43:53,702 --> 01:43:54,999
Yeah.

1392
01:44:14,156 --> 01:44:16,351
Well, I'm glad that you told me.

1393
01:44:18,193 --> 01:44:20,286
It's a very brave thing to do.

1394
01:44:22,197 --> 01:44:24,688
It's not your fault.
I talked to the fire marshal...

1395
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,334
...and the fire started
on the fourth floor.

1396
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:30,237
It started on the fourth floor?

1397
01:44:30,772 --> 01:44:32,535
They're not 100 percent sure.

1398
01:44:32,741 --> 01:44:35,938
It seems there was some kind
of an electrical fire.

1399
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:38,704
It started on the fourth floor?

1400
01:44:38,947 --> 01:44:40,812
Not in the basement?

1401
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:47,513
You didn't do it, Michael.

1402
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,354
Come on, let's go home.

1403
01:44:55,163 --> 01:44:56,892
- Jules.
- Yeah?

1404
01:44:57,098 --> 01:44:59,896
Jules, what about the store?

1405
01:45:00,535 --> 01:45:02,093
It's gone, Dad.

1406
01:45:03,605 --> 01:45:05,095
It's all gone.

1407
01:45:38,273 --> 01:45:40,298
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

1408
01:45:41,343 --> 01:45:44,039
It means we don't have any insurance
to cover this.

1409
01:45:48,917 --> 01:45:52,478
What are you talking about?
You took care of that stuff.

1410
01:45:53,788 --> 01:45:57,952
What are you talking about? You're
telling me we don't have any insurance?

1411
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,320
We had it. I canceled it.

1412
01:46:00,629 --> 01:46:02,426
You canceled it?!

1413
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:06,460
There's no insurance for this whole
thing? How's that possible?

1414
01:46:06,668 --> 01:46:08,158
What the hell did you do?

1415
01:46:08,637 --> 01:46:13,040
I told you when we did the commercials
that we didn't have enough money.

1416
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:16,233
You didn't care when I said
we had to shift the money around.

1417
01:46:16,444 --> 01:46:18,674
Take a little from here,
borrow from there.

1418
01:46:19,214 --> 01:46:21,910
It's always been borrowing from Peter
to pay Paul.

1419
01:46:22,117 --> 01:46:23,846
It's like a gamble.

1420
01:46:24,052 --> 01:46:27,818
I took from the insurance, figured we'd
save while we set up advertising...

1421
01:46:28,023 --> 01:46:30,218
...and get this place on its feet.

1422
01:46:32,694 --> 01:46:34,525
This is like...

1423
01:46:34,729 --> 01:46:36,026
...a fluke.

1424
01:46:36,498 --> 01:46:37,658
You know?

1425
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:41,363
Yeah.

1426
01:46:42,871 --> 01:46:44,668
It's a fluke all right.

1427
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,035
Things like this don't happen.

1428
01:46:48,043 --> 01:46:50,944
What are the odds on this?
What's it gotta be?

1429
01:46:51,813 --> 01:46:53,940
- Something like this?
- Yeah.

1430
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:57,945
- It's gotta be a million to one.
- Exactly.

1431
01:47:02,223 --> 01:47:03,986
So, what will we do?

1432
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,495
Well, file bankruptcy, regroup...

1433
01:47:08,697 --> 01:47:09,925
...start over.

1434
01:47:10,565 --> 01:47:12,396
We'll lose some distributors.

1435
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,160
They won't want to do business
with us anymore.

1436
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,235
But we'll pick up some new lines.

1437
01:47:17,505 --> 01:47:19,496
With a little luck, we'll be back.

1438
01:47:23,211 --> 01:47:25,304
No, I think that's it for me.

1439
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:31,785
It's too much of a roller coaster ride
for me.

1440
01:47:36,091 --> 01:47:38,559
Krichinsky cousins, Kirk and Kaye.

1441
01:47:39,294 --> 01:47:41,421
This is the end of the road for me.

1442
01:47:43,365 --> 01:47:44,525
What will you do?

1443
01:47:47,168 --> 01:47:49,693
A salesman can always sell.

1444
01:47:49,904 --> 01:47:52,702
It's not the product.
It's the salesman.

1445
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,205
That's what my father always said.

1446
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:15,625
<i>Sam, don't run with the machine.</i>

1447
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,195
<i>I'm not running.</i>

1448
01:48:17,399 --> 01:48:19,959
<i>Sam, why don't you speak to Gabriel?</i>

1449
01:48:20,168 --> 01:48:22,159
<i>I never speak to him.</i>

1450
01:48:22,637 --> 01:48:25,765
<i>You don't speak to Gabriel,</i>
<i>then Nathan won't speak to you...</i>

1451
01:48:25,974 --> 01:48:28,875
<i>... because he doesn't like that you</i>
<i>don't speak to Gabriel.</i>

1452
01:48:29,077 --> 01:48:31,375
We got four brothers
and two don't speak.

1453
01:48:31,579 --> 01:48:34,013
But Nathan speaks to you
when you speak to me.

1454
01:48:34,215 --> 01:48:36,376
I can talk to you.
This he can tolerate.

1455
01:48:36,584 --> 01:48:40,782
But he won't talk to you unless you
speak personally to Gabriel.

1456
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:42,883
Got an indigestion.

1457
01:48:43,091 --> 01:48:44,888
You've been having it a lot.

1458
01:48:45,093 --> 01:48:48,119
Yeah. Whatever I eat, it lays on me.

1459
01:48:48,329 --> 01:48:50,354
Bombs away!

1460
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:55,292
- Why aren't they at the country club?
- I don't know.

1461
01:48:55,637 --> 01:48:59,164
They don't like it there.
They like it better here with us.

1462
01:48:59,874 --> 01:49:03,332
They better like the club,
because they're getting rid of this.

1463
01:49:03,545 --> 01:49:06,571
- What are you talking about?
- I was talking to the old man.

1464
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:09,909
He's selling the place.
They want to build homes here.

1465
01:49:10,285 --> 01:49:11,616
Homes?

1466
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:13,879
It's too far for homes.

1467
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:17,889
You got to be a pioneer.
You can't get here with a streetcar.

1468
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:21,324
They can build homes, they can
put more streetcar tracks.

1469
01:49:31,573 --> 01:49:32,699
Again?

1470
01:49:32,907 --> 01:49:34,534
Indigestion?

1471
01:49:34,976 --> 01:49:37,035
I think I'll take a little walk.

1472
01:49:37,245 --> 01:49:38,576
Might help.

1473
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:41,715
- Do you boys want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

1474
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:44,944
Fix me another sandwich, will you?

1475
01:49:45,153 --> 01:49:46,916
You already had two.

1476
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,817
This will make three.

1477
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:53,852
- You want something, Sam?
- No, no, nothing for me, thanks.

1478
01:51:00,361 --> 01:51:02,955
- How's she doing today?
- The same.

1479
01:51:03,164 --> 01:51:07,533
Every day's the same. She gets better,
she comes out, gets worse, comes back.

1480
01:51:07,735 --> 01:51:10,704
In and out.
In and out of the hospital.

1481
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:13,669
Dad, Ann's going to make
a Thanksgiving dinner.

1482
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:16,503
I know, I know.
She's been here all day.

1483
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:19,373
- You going to come over?
- No, I better stay here.

1484
01:51:19,581 --> 01:51:22,311
I already had a bite in the room
with your mother.

1485
01:51:22,784 --> 01:51:25,981
All right.
If you change your mind.

1486
01:51:36,364 --> 01:51:37,558
Hi, Ma.

1487
01:51:40,001 --> 01:51:41,434
How you doing?

1488
01:51:41,803 --> 01:51:43,668
Oh, I'm tired.

1489
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:47,872
- How's the new job?
- It's good.

1490
01:51:48,343 --> 01:51:49,742
I like it.

1491
01:51:51,346 --> 01:51:53,610
It's interesting...

1492
01:51:53,815 --> 01:51:55,510
...and it's challenging.

1493
01:51:55,917 --> 01:51:57,009
I like it.

1494
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,854
Selling time.

1495
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:03,086
I never heard of such a thing.

1496
01:52:03,291 --> 01:52:06,852
It's not just time.
It's time for television commercials.

1497
01:52:07,061 --> 01:52:11,088
Companies buy the time for commercials
to sell their products.

1498
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:13,261
I hate commercials.

1499
01:52:15,837 --> 01:52:20,433
But I like the one where the cigarette
packs dance. I like that one.

1500
01:52:21,776 --> 01:52:23,437
Did you sell them time?

1501
01:52:24,712 --> 01:52:25,701
No, Ma.

1502
01:52:26,314 --> 01:52:29,306
That's a shame,
because I like that one.

1503
01:52:51,839 --> 01:52:55,002
<i>Henry! Henry Aldrich!</i>

1504
01:52:55,209 --> 01:52:57,006
<i>Coming, Mother.</i>

1505
01:53:53,735 --> 01:53:56,533
We have come here
to pay our final respects...

1506
01:53:57,405 --> 01:53:59,430
...to the late Eva Krichinsky...

1507
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,335
...a woman of valor.

1508
01:54:01,976 --> 01:54:03,443
She came to America...

1509
01:54:03,644 --> 01:54:05,703
...in 1916.

1510
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:08,041
She married...

1511
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,248
...and raised a beautiful family.

1512
01:54:10,518 --> 01:54:14,420
Was a devoted wife
and a caring mother.

1513
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:18,425
One who was loved and respected
by her family...

1514
01:54:18,626 --> 01:54:20,321
...and many friends.

1515
01:54:20,528 --> 01:54:23,759
She lived a full and happy life.

1516
01:54:49,857 --> 01:54:51,825
Gabriel didn't come.

1517
01:54:52,393 --> 01:54:54,224
Nathan didn't come.

1518
01:54:54,796 --> 01:54:56,661
What happened to Simka?

1519
01:54:57,632 --> 01:55:00,066
He called. He couldn't get away.

1520
01:55:00,668 --> 01:55:03,102
Couldn't get anyone
to take care of the farm.

1521
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:06,062
This is not a family.

1522
01:55:06,974 --> 01:55:08,601
Not a family.

1523
01:56:09,837 --> 01:56:12,237
Dad, come on for some dinner.

1524
01:57:05,126 --> 01:57:07,856
- What's the matter with your corn?
- I don't like it.

1525
01:57:09,597 --> 01:57:11,462
Since when you don't like it?

1526
01:57:11,766 --> 01:57:13,996
I've been making you corn since...

1527
01:57:14,535 --> 01:57:16,730
How was school today, Michael?

1528
01:57:19,473 --> 01:57:20,940
Dad, that's David.

1529
01:57:21,142 --> 01:57:23,110
Michael is in college.

1530
01:57:26,948 --> 01:57:29,007
It was yesterday...

1531
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:32,879
...I had to go up to the school.
He was in trouble.

1532
01:57:33,087 --> 01:57:34,987
Something with...

1533
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:37,717
..."may" and "can."

1534
01:57:38,192 --> 01:57:40,752
With "may" and "can."

1535
01:57:44,298 --> 01:57:47,426
<i>Scientists prove there is no life</i>
<i>on Mars as we know it.</i>

1536
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:12,854
He wets the bed.

1537
01:58:17,665 --> 01:58:19,690
My dad wets the bed.

1538
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,959
- You'd like to see Sam Krichinsky?
- Yes, I'm his grandson. Michael Kaye.

1539
01:58:57,171 --> 01:58:59,696
- Do you know the way?
- Yeah.

1540
01:58:59,907 --> 01:59:02,034
- Does my son need one?
- No, he's fine.

1541
01:59:41,048 --> 01:59:44,245
In the end, you spend everything
you ever saved...

1542
01:59:44,452 --> 01:59:47,444
...sell everything
you've ever owned...

1543
01:59:47,722 --> 01:59:51,419
...just to exist in a place like this.

1544
01:59:52,793 --> 01:59:55,261
So are you dating?

1545
01:59:56,464 --> 01:59:58,523
I told you, Sam. I'm married.

1546
01:59:59,433 --> 02:00:01,924
- You are married?
- Yes.

1547
02:00:02,436 --> 02:00:04,199
And this is my son.

1548
02:00:05,272 --> 02:00:06,398
I named him Sam.

1549
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:10,568
You're not supposed to name him
after the living.

1550
02:00:11,545 --> 02:00:12,842
I know.

1551
02:00:13,881 --> 02:00:15,212
You know?

1552
02:00:17,618 --> 02:00:20,451
Carry on the family name. Carry on.

1553
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:28,895
Couple of years ago,
I went to see the house on Avalon.

1554
02:00:29,396 --> 02:00:30,886
It was gone.

1555
02:00:31,098 --> 02:00:33,794
Not just the house,
but the whole neighborhood.

1556
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:38,001
I went to see the ballroom...

1557
02:00:38,205 --> 02:00:41,800
...where me and my brother
used to play.

1558
02:00:42,143 --> 02:00:44,668
The whole place, gone.

1559
02:00:45,646 --> 02:00:47,113
Not just that.

1560
02:00:47,314 --> 02:00:51,410
But the grocery store
where we used to shop, gone.

1561
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:53,211
All gone.

1562
02:00:57,825 --> 02:01:00,794
I went to see where Eva lived...

1563
02:01:00,995 --> 02:01:03,361
...off Poplar Street.

1564
02:01:04,031 --> 02:01:05,726
It isn't there.

1565
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:10,896
Not even the street. It isn't there.
Not even the street.

1566
02:01:13,107 --> 02:01:14,904
And then I went to see...

1567
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:18,272
...the nightclub I used to have.

1568
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:21,243
Thank God it was there...

1569
02:01:21,448 --> 02:01:25,350
...because for a minute,
I thought I never was.

1570
02:01:34,228 --> 02:01:38,324
If I knew things would no longer
be here, I would have tried...

1571
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:40,997
...to have remembered better.

1572
02:01:44,738 --> 02:01:46,501
I miss you, Sam.

1573
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:54,440
I came to America in 1914.

1574
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:01,244
I came to America...

1575
02:02:01,956 --> 02:02:03,947
...in 1914.

1576
02:02:11,465 --> 02:02:13,990
Daddy, that man talks funny.

1577
02:02:14,902 --> 02:02:16,665
He wasn't born here, Sam.

1578
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:19,738
You mean, he wasn't born in Baltimore?

1579
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:20,998
No.

1580
02:02:22,176 --> 02:02:24,940
<i>He came to America in 1914.</i>

1581
02:02:25,646 --> 02:02:29,047
<i>He said it was the most beautiful</i>
<i>place he'd ever seen.</i>
