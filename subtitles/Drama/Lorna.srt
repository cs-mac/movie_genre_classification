1
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,157
340.

2
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,819
Can I see the director?
- You can see him tomorrow.

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,216
Yes, at 12:30, if possible.
- The reason?

4
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,807
A loan,
we have already spoken.

5
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:51,991
I am about to obtain Belgian nationality,
I can now do so.

6
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,957
14,000

7
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,391
In a month, if all goes as planned.

8
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,157
When will I see you?

9
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,757
I am hanging up now.

10
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,957
I love you.

11
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,552
Me too. Bye.

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,968
A euro 50, please.

13
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,952
What do you want?

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,787
I know...
and it is the third time you called.

15
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:47,191
How much do I owe you?
- A euro 10.

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,958
I am going to sleep.

17
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,357
Do not you fancy a game of cards?
- No.

18
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,757
Close the curtains.

19
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,552
Are you coming?

20
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,576
No... I said no!

21
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,768
Have you heard? I said no.

22
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,781
Yes, I heard. Goodnight.

23
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,158
Are we going to play then?

24
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,558
Lower the music!

25
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,358
The music, a little lower!

26
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,395
What do you want?
- I have to talk to you. Open.

27
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,563
Tomorrow I have to get up at six.

28
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,439
Tonight I will not go out. It is over.

29
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,196
No, this time is serious,
but you have to help me.

30
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,616
Promise me that you will.
- Let me sleep, Claudy!

31
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,391
I must know
so i set a target.

32
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,430
I do not know when I will return.
- Tell me a time, any time.

33
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,816
Five? ...Six?
At nine?

34
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,587
What time then?
At seven? ok?

35
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,401
Whatever.
- If you are late, call me.

36
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,986
Do not forget to return the mattress.

37
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,986
What are you doing?
- Lock me inside.

38
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,986
And if you want to leave?
- I have to resist!

39
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,558
No, I will not do it.

40
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,196
You will want to go out
and I will have to come back.

41
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,568
No, I swear no! Lorna!

42
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,595
If I am late, tell her
that I will stay here tonight.

43
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,358
I will tell her.

44
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,396
He told them I would return
during my break.

45
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,001
Only at nights.
- I said so. But did not understand.

46
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,363
It is bad. He is stopping.

47
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:48,815
Terminal 4.
Can you do the pick up, Fabio?

48
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,957
I will.

49
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,995
He says he wants to quit this time.
He has asked me to help him.

50
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,367
Tomorrow he will be the same

51
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,182
If he quits though, what shall we do?

52
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,981
As we said, we overdose him.

53
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,995
And will the police believe it?
- Of course.

54
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,001
It will not be the first time that someone
lies dying from overdoses.

55
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:21,634
The cops! Six months, nothing!
But now you are becoming a Belgian!

56
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,192
Will you wait?
- No, I have to go to the airport.

57
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,168
Show them the photo of the wedding.

58
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,158
Where are the police?

59
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,616
I do not feel well, I wanted to see you.
- Get out of my bed.

60
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,577
I thought I could.
- Get out! Go!

61
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,182
Look what you have done! Shit!
- Sorry.

62
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,357
Bring a towel.

63
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,558
It was not the police

64
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,957
He wanted me to come back.

65
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,791
Do not do that again.
- I was not feeling well.

66
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,758
I do not care!

67
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,977
I arrived late,
it gives me no time to eat.

68
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,158
Do you want me to prepare a sandwich?
- No.

69
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,372
Who is it?
- You need something?

70
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,953
Go away!

71
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,357
This is the second time this morning.

72
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,176
Will you go to buy Buscopan?
I have cramps.

73
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,420
Here, it costs 18 or 19 euros.
- Why do I need to do something for you?

74
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,630
If I see the others, I will be in trouble!
- And? It is not my business.

75
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,035
You got married for money,
you will get twice to divorce!

76
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,595
I do not mind the money! Help me!
Buy the Buscopan!

77
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,357
You go!

78
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
Help me, Lorna!
- Get up!

79
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,748
Get up!

80
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,577
Write the name of medicine
on a piece of paper.

81
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,748
Give it.

82
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,172
What is the name?
- Buscopan.

83
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,357
Lock me inside.

84
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,158
My key!

85
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,357
It fell into the truck!

86
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,957
Go to the cabin 3, please.

87
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,957
It is me.

88
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,158
I wanted to talk to you.

89
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,592
Bye...
I will call you on Sunday...

90
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,200
Good evening... A Buscopan, please.

91
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,957
Do you have a prescription?

92
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,176
Is it really bad?
- It is not for me...

93
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,977
For my husband...
He has cramps...

94
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,595
Ok I will give you,
but usually you need a prescription.

95
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,558
What?

96
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:31,957
What do you want? Water?

97
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,367
Let me.
- Help me get up.

98
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,158
Let me, Claudy!

99
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,601
Help me, I have cramps, I am hurting!
- Take the Buscopan!

100
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,377
I have taken it, but I am still hurting.

101
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,553
Wait...

102
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,396
Call my doctor.
- Why do not you call him?

103
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,971
Lorna, help me! Help me!

104
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,377
In D, Dr. Mayr.

105
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,595
Tell him I want to go to hospital.

106
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:58,415
Good evening...
I am the wife of Claudy Moreau

107
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,571
He quit drugs...

108
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,558
He is in pain for two days now...

109
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,995
He wants to go to the hospital...
Yes, I am giving him to you...

110
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,382
Already registered.
- Does it cost anything?

111
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,786
No, but tomorrow will bring
health care card.

112
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,153
Your money.

113
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,600
Claudy, your money!
- I do not need them here.

114
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,568
Let me just 20 euros to snuff.

115
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,629
Tomorrow I have to bring your health card,
where is it?

116
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,772
Put it into my pocket.

117
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,029
Is there someone to look after me?
- The admissions officer said that they will

118
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,786
Tomorrow, will you bring the CD player and CDs?

119
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,991
Do not leave me alone.
- A nurse is coming now.

120
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,005
Stay until he comes.
Please.

121
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,953
Yes, I am coming down.

122
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,363
I will be in the taxi parking.

123
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,635
Claudy Moreau?
- Room 110.

124
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,840
I brought his health card.
- Go to admissions, ground floor.

125
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,605
Can you give him these things?
Are you his wife?

126
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,411
Yes!
- Go, but do not stay too much.

127
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,592
The last door on the left.
Room 110.

128
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,605
What shall we do?
- Ask for divorce, as he believes.

129
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,147
Why not?

130
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,424
We have chosen a junkie to prevent divorce.
And it would take too long.

131
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,177
What if the Russian is in agreement?

132
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,391
I have set for June.
I gave my word.

133
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,376
Put on the window wipers.

134
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,757
The button on the left.

135
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,206
I will find a faster way to obtain a divorce.

136
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,371
And who pays 5,000 euros to a junkie?

137
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,792
Take 5,000 from the 10,000 euros of the Russian.

138
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,395
Are you engaged with him or what?
- Fuck it. I am with Sokol.

139
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,796
And why are you backing off?
- I am not backing off.

140
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,195
To die from overdose will look strange.

141
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,592
Almost everyone leaves
and then come back again.

142
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,395
Divorce has many risks,
it is best to become a widow.

143
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,744
Sokol!

144
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,358
I was afraid you were gone.

145
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,981
The minibus to Germany has not arrived yet.

146
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:57,776
I like you more without the beard.

147
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,358
You are now Belgian.

148
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,177
Near Colonia. At the reactor core.

149
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,595
One minute into the reactor, 1,000 euros.
- It is not dangerous?

150
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,400
Only if you do it every month.
- You will go back?

151
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,177
No, we will return directly to Italy.

152
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,177
Take... 1,200 euros.

153
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,595
How much we have in mind?
- Nearly 20,000 euros.

154
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,762
Let me see your card again.

155
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,171
What a joy to live with you.

156
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,162
We must still have to wait for the Russian.

157
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,587
Did you find any space for the bar?
- Next week.

158
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,195
The bank will give me some addresses.

159
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,358
Tell me you love me!

160
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,781
I love you. What's wrong?
- Nothing

161
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,762
The minibus. I got to go.

162
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,435
Claudy is trying to quit.
He believes it this time.

163
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,201
I would prefer a divorce...
- Have you spoken to Fabio?

164
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,953
He is afraid of the Russian.

165
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,191
But the divorce will be quicker if
I say that my husband beats me.

166
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,796
Wont they investigate?
- I think it always works.

167
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,171
If it fails, all will be shit!

168
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,600
Let Fabio decide.
- I do not want him to die.

169
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,800
It is too late.
We have an agreement, is only a drug addict.

170
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,415
Lorna, you can not leave now.
We are near the end...

171
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,376
If something does not work, call me.

172
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,153
Come.

173
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,757
That's it. The other arm.

174
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,757
You can now dress.

175
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,177
17 Ferreire Street
Marital Home

176
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,592
Circumstances: abstinence of heroin.

177
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,195
Wednesday November 14200721:00.

178
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,376
He is now in the hospital?

179
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,972
Yes, since that Wednesday night.

180
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,962
You should have come that very evening.

181
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,635
Present the complaint before the judge,
but I do not think that is sufficient

182
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,748
Why not?

183
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,395
Given the position of the hematoma,
they could argue that you did it.

184
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,563
It was him, he wanted drugs.

185
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,595
If at least you had one witness...
but you do not.

186
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,363
Sign here, please.

187
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,557
I need money,

188
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,805
The sooner I get to remarry,
the sooner I will get them.

189
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,210
A real marriage?
- No. Like ours.

190
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,792
A foreigner who pays to be Belgian

191
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,195
I have helped you quit.
And that was not the deal.

192
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,363
Now you can help me, right?

193
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,552
Do you agree?

194
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,967
I do not want me characterised as abusive.

195
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,195
You are already booked for drugs and theft.
- It is not the same.

196
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,167
I have never struck a woman.

197
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,816
And 5000 euros for the divorce,
you do not you care?

198
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,158
I can wait.

199
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,796
I am collecting allowance and I could find a job.

200
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,186
If you accept, I will help you to stay clean.

201
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,158
Even after the divorce.

202
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,957
Someone is coming.

203
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,772
Come on, Hit me. Hit me! Claudy!

204
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,752
Come on!

205
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,391
You should have played your
king before your dame.

206
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,158
It is 10 to 3.

207
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,182
One last game? -
We said until 3.

208
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,552
It is there.

209
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,953
Come on.

210
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,948
Get up.

211
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,986
You said you would hit me if I stayed!

212
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,547
Come on!

213
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,158
With the fist!

214
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,953
I can not.

215
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,552
Are you okay?

216
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,996
I was struck and I hit
my head against the wall.

217
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,563
You should complain to the police.

218
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,957
I will.

219
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,395
Do you agree to testify
if the police asks?

220
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,195
He did not seem a violent person.
Do not always trust appearances.

221
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,800
What is your name, madam?
- Monique Sobel.

222
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,605
Can you write your name on a piece
of paper and your phone number?

223
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,782
Fabio wants to see you.
He is at the parking.

224
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,382
All fine with the girl from the laundry.

225
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,216
I am afraid, Lorna.
- Why? I have not done anything.

226
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,792
Do not do it.
Do not go to the police.

227
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,376
And if it works?
- Do not do it!

228
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,595
You are his wife, take care of him.
The rest leave them to me.

229
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,957
Do not trust me?

230
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,557
Mandatory. I need you.

231
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,157
Okay, go now.

232
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,976
Lorna! Do not forget, you need me too.

233
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,420
Do not want the job to get ruined.
It is my first one with the Russians.

234
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,782
Nor do I. I want my money.

235
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,758
Now you admit it.

236
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,563
Who was that guy the other
night at the station?

237
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:07,581
Sokol.
- But Sokol has a beard.

238
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,358
Yes, but he shaved it.

239
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,591
Lorna, someone asked about you.

240
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,957
Excuse me, back in two minutes.

241
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,186
I left, I wanted to surprise you.

242
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,957
You mean you are cured?
- Yes

243
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:10,415
If I am bad, I can call the hospital.

244
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,957
You must resist.

245
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:18,581
Can you give me the house keys?
- Let me get them.

246
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,557
And my money.

247
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,972
I just want 10 euros for cigarettes.

248
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,410
Shall we eat together to celebrate?
- I can not, I have a lot of work.

249
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,396
Shall I prepare dinner for tonight.
It will do me good.

250
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,591
I need some more money for shopping.

251
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:09,391
When will you be back?
- I do not know, about seven.

252
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,348
Okay, bye.

253
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,352
Yes. Who is it?

254
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:07,352
Almost ready.

255
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,157
I made the pasta carbonara.

256
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,792
A letter came for you.
I have left it on the bed.

257
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,386
It is a letter from the judge,
he has granted the divorce.

258
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,406
Back in an hour.
- I have cooked, and it is almost ready.

259
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,376
You can wait an hour, right?

260
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:56,015
I thought we were going to celebrate!
- In an hour, okay?

261
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,367
Roberto, have you seen Fabio?

262
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,782
Fabio waits in the taxi at the plaza.

263
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,782
I have not done anything more, I swear.

264
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,963
It is a consequence of the complaint.

265
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,963
Too late for the Russian, he can not wait.

266
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,587
Ask! It is only one month more!

267
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,396
And you get to marry for one week
and after divorce... it sucks!

268
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:01,219
Why? I have a husband who attacked me.

269
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,957
I will make the race.

270
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,587
And you will give him 5000 euros
the day of the divorce?

271
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,358
Yes, from the lame 10,000 of the Russian.

272
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,587
Okay, I'll call him,
just to see if he accept the month.

273
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,762
Will you call me when you have talked?
- Yes

274
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,171
I spoke with the Russian, he agrees.

275
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,557
Get out of here with all your shit!

276
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,972
Go!
- Shut up, my money!

277
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,601
I want to talk first!

278
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,957
Wait here.

279
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,776
10 minutes, no more.
- Alright.

280
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:22,376
Give me my money!
- You started again?

281
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:25,591
Call the hospital.
- My money!

282
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,963
Wait, calm down!

283
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,000
I do not want you to start again.
- You got your divorce, what do you care?

284
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,162
Give me my money!
- I will!

285
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:43,400
I have left them at the laundry.
- Liar! Give them to me!

286
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,957
Give me the envelope!

287
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,957
Give me the key!
- No!

288
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,367
Is this bike alright?
- Which?

289
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,153
The blue one.

290
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,758
Yes, 50 euros.

291
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,957
I will take it.

292
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:03,195
60 euros to open the door and 10 by two keys.

293
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:04,943
50-50?

294
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,396
No, it is my fault, the door.
- It is also my fault.

295
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,358
35 per head?
- Alright.

296
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:28,810
I will ride all day.
It is something to do.

297
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,816
Can I come at noon?
- I will be alone in the shop.

298
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,625
Not to have lunch. I need a target
in the middle of the day.

299
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,957
I will come by and then leave.

300
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:46,762
I have the need to see you.

301
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:49,352
I am off now.

302
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:55,400
Here, it is better than what you have them.
See you later...

303
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,615
The family was here.
They will pay the funeral.

304
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:14,605
I said I will pay.
- I told them but they said no.

305
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,415
Can I see him for the last time?
- You already recognised him.

306
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:39,605
The officer is gone.
- I am his wife.

307
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,563
Are you sure you do not want to stay here?

308
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:44,991
The police will think that you are fleeing.

309
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:56,595
Have you heard what i said?
They might suspect something.

310
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,963
The police has my phone number.

311
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,752
Give it back.

312
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,786
The CD player.
- He does not need it anymore.

313
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,153
Give it to her.

314
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,406
You can stay one more week.
It will seem normal.

315
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,348
Where are you going to go?

316
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,201
Where I was before.
- But the rent.

317
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,358
I have already made an agreement
with the girl.

318
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,563
Won't you take his razor blade and things?
- No.

319
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:53,210
Spirou, come and collect things
of the junkie from the bathroom.

320
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,963
Are you going to continue
with the long face?

321
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,410
Would you tell him if you knew
the Russian would not wait?

322
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,816
I have helped you.
Say thanks instead of the long face.

323
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,782
For the unexpected work another 1,000.

324
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:23,795
That you took care of him when
he wanted to quit. It was a job.

325
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,996
If you deny it then it means you are not with us.

326
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,557
Still with us, right?

327
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,567
You were always alright!

328
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,601
You did not talk,
so we were able to overdose him.

329
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:53,581
I have the 1,000 euros,
I will give them to you whenever you want.

330
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,157
Take the photo.

331
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,376
Spirou. Take the bag.

332
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,177
Ms. Moreau is at home?

333
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:17,619
We had still some questions pending.
It is for the autopsy report.

334
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,557
I will take your bag.

335
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,168
We will wait in the car.

336
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,348
Come in.

337
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,205
The autopsy confirms that he dies
of a drug overdose.

338
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,186
Do you know of any enemy
that wanted him dead?

339
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,216
Would anybody earn anything
by killing him with an overdose?

340
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,591
He just quit them.
- He was depressed?

341
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,358
Have he ever talked of suicide?
- No.

342
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,577
You asked for divorce
because he beat you...

343
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,358
Did he know you will get it?

344
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,948
Since when?

345
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,625
Since you received the letter from
the judge, four days ago.

346
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:21,015
When did the dealer tell us?
- Friday, 4 days ago.

347
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,800
You husband called him to buy heroin.

348
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,181
Perhaps the news of the divorce?

349
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:33,195
According to the dealer,
you prevented him to buy it.

350
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,396
Alone and depressed
he could have taken the dose...

351
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,792
...which killed him on purpose or by mistake?

352
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,553
Possibly.

353
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,758
Well. We are going now.

354
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,577
Good evening, Mrs. Moreau.
- Good evening.

355
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,367
Excuse me, are you the
mother of Claudy?

356
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,358
No, it is the lady who is
in the car behind you.

357
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:57,376
I am Lorna, the wife of Claudy...

358
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,768
I wanted to give you this.

359
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,157
It is the money he left me.

360
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,957
Has he talked about me?

361
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,972
It is my son, his brother.

362
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:15,557
This is the wife of Claudy.

363
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:21,015
What is that?
- The money that was left by Claudy.

364
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,563
You are his wife, they are yours.

365
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:28,000
For the girl...
- We do not want your money specially of Claudy.

366
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,948
Take them.

367
00:58:27,919 --> 00:58:30,376
Good... I feel better...

368
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,396
Call me and I come...
1000 kilometers...

369
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,758
I am leaving again tonight.

370
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,557
What do we do?

371
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:21,543
Are you asleep?
- No.

372
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:42,762
You should not worry.

373
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,396
A junkie prefers drugs instead of life.

374
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,015
Sooner or later he would start again...
and who knows... he would die.

375
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,406
Shall we see sites you have
found for the bar?

376
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:13,747
Agreed.

377
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,981
Here, the number 36...

378
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,157
It is too small.

379
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,577
There is no room for tables...

380
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,358
Come and see.

381
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:16,147
You see?

382
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,358
Only three rooms...

383
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,776
And a garden?
- Is it big?

384
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:25,386
Yes, in summer we could
put tables outside.

385
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,153
I like it.

386
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:48,595
You really have to go tonight?
- Yes.

387
01:01:48,919 --> 01:01:50,557
Well, the minibus will leave at six.

388
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,547
Shall we dance?

389
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,963
Lorna, this is Andrei Aslikov.

390
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:43,157
Kosti, the interpreter.

391
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,547
Sit down.

392
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,771
Want something to drink?
- A beer.

393
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,758
Something for you?

394
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,358
No, he does not take anything, me neither.

395
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,758
Roberto, a beer!

396
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,181
Do you like your Belgian identity card.

397
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,352
Do you have the document?
- Yes.

398
01:04:50,919 --> 01:04:54,195
The official document that says
that she is a widow and can marry again.

399
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:14,957
They paid in advance.

400
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,177
Take your share.
Three bundles.

401
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,553
In twenties.

402
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,786
This is the price of a pack of
cigarettes in Moscow.

403
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,168
Want the 1,000 euros you rejected?

404
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,577
Like I said, I would save them for you.

405
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:37,752
See you soon.

406
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,601
What? Yes, I signed this morning.

407
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,201
I am so happy, Sokol! Our bar!

408
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,372
Let me count...

409
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:37,362
One, two, three, four...
Roughly four meters.

410
01:07:37,919 --> 01:07:39,762
The counter can be put
in this location.

411
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,406
Width is the same...
Length... wait...

412
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,415
One, two, three, four, five...
Fits five or six tables.

413
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,216
The third...
Tables also fit here.

414
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,358
There is a door...

415
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,963
We can make a small kitchen there!.

416
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,358
The door to the garden.

417
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,225
How nice...
It has even trees.

418
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,187
Perfect for summer.
Yes, yes.

419
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:36,757
Now I am on the first floor...

420
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,829
Up the stairs there is a bathroom...
with a tub...

421
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,153
Very big...

422
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,820
Beside there is a room...
We could put the living room.

423
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,792
In this one we can do the kitchen.

424
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:58,810
The second floor.
For sure that it is for the bedroom.

425
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,548
Wait...

426
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:29,557
Yes, I'm fine...

427
01:09:30,919 --> 01:09:32,967
I was so excited...

428
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,363
I had nothing to eat...

429
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,215
I loaded my mobile and I came straight here...

430
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:08,557
Yes, I am better...

431
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:14,762
I must have low blood pressure...

432
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,358
I will call you later.

433
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,796
Come with me...

434
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,796
Take off your clothes, put this robe on
and wait until I call you.

435
01:10:52,919 --> 01:10:54,762
Any operations?

436
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,958
Any chronic disease?

437
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,158
Do you take any medication?
- No.

438
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,996
Your last period?
- Seven weeks ago.

439
01:11:07,919 --> 01:11:10,376
Are you here for a reason?

440
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:13,552
I want an abortion.

441
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:17,395
Voluntary interruption of pregnancy.
Alright...

442
01:11:17,919 --> 01:11:22,834
We will do an ultrasound to establish
the exact date of pregnancy and set the date.

443
01:11:22,919 --> 01:11:27,015
y law, we must give you 8 days to think.

444
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,958
Come and lie down.

445
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,948
Lie down.

446
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:50,762
What, madam? Anything wrong?

447
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:00,557
You do not want the ultrasound?

448
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,358
I do not want the abortion!

449
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:53,195
In your name?
- In the name of the child I will give birth.

450
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,796
We can not open an account in that name,
a person that does not exist.

451
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,215
It will be born in eight months.
- It is not born yet though.

452
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,587
I can only Book an account number.

453
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,967
Yes, but I want to pay the money quickly.

454
01:13:07,919 --> 01:13:11,400
Into your account, and transfer
to the new one when it is born.

455
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,548
Alright.

456
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,977
First I will come to the reservation
account number of the child.

457
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,977
Still has no name. Surname?
- Moreau. M-O-R-E-A-U.

458
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:55,395
Have you forgotten the appointment
with the Russian?

459
01:13:55,919 --> 01:14:00,015
You did not hear the bell?
Luckily someone came out.

460
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,416
Fabio here... Tell Andrei we are comming...

461
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,620
Yes, I know, I had a problem
with the taxi. I am sorry.

462
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,958
Quickly, the Russians
have already arrived!

463
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,358
Are you coming like that?

464
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,958
I am pregnant.

465
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,792
What? Are you sure?

466
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,958
Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.

467
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:04,757
What about the Russian?

468
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:08,400
Why you were not careful?
You and the idiot Sokol?

469
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,211
Next week we will go for abortion.
Be quick now...

470
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,772
What if I want to have it?
- Forget it.

471
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:23,219
The Russian does not want you like that.
- I would ask him to recognize it.

472
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,977
Never mind, it was not planed like that!

473
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:37,376
Micky will be one of the wedding witnesses.

474
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,757
Have something from me.

475
01:15:45,919 --> 01:15:48,786
He circulates papers.
We have worked for him.

476
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,757
Totally trustworthy.

477
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,982
Sometimes the police
interrogate witnesses.

478
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,977
They have to see you dancing together.

479
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,177
Andrei, you should dance with her.

480
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,001
If they say they met here,
they need witnesses.

481
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,796
All right for you if I have a child?
Me, a child?

482
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,820
A child, not with you.
- Marriage yes, child no!

483
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,777
You the wedding, me the child!

484
01:16:54,919 --> 01:16:58,195
No, no. We talk later.
- Never mind.

485
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,592
No trouble. It is nothing.

486
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:08,167
No child, only wedding.

487
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,387
I just asked, If i was pregnant

488
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,182
Would he marry me?
That was the question.

489
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:27,034
He would not pay for the child.
We did not agree that.

490
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,568
Anything wrong?
- All fine.

491
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:33,195
She asked if he would take her
if she was pregnant.

492
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:38,419
Why did you ask him?
- I have my own life, it could happen.

493
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,358
If it happens, you will have an abortion.

494
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,177
No problem.
There is no child.

495
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:48,781
If he wants, a doctor can exam her.

496
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:57,576
He agrees. He has a doctor as a friend.

497
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:03,962
We will let you dance now.

498
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:55,762
I told you not to mention it.

499
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,363
I just wanted to know what he is thinking.

500
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,235
Do not do that again.
Never! Do you understand?

501
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,368
We will go for that abortion tomorrow.

502
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,748
What is wrong?

503
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,977
The doctor who examined her is coming.

504
01:20:02,919 --> 01:20:04,557
You asked for abortion?

505
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,958
You asked for abortion?

506
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,777
No!
- Why not?

507
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,358
You have the number of Sokol?

508
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:23,576
In my mobile, in my bag.

509
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:40,991
Sokol is not the father, Claudy is.

510
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:43,147
The junkie?

511
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:46,986
You fucked with the junkie?
- His name is Claudy.

512
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,001
Are you her partner?
- Friend. I brought her here.

513
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,158
Does the sedative begin
to take effect?

514
01:20:59,919 --> 01:21:02,786
As I have shown on ultrasound,
you are not pregnant.

515
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,187
You are too disturbed to accept it.

516
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,796
It is better to stay in 2 days for observation.

517
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:12,552
Do you agree?
- Yes

518
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,568
They will prepare your room.

519
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:21,191
Individual, if possible.
- I think so.

520
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,792
Why did you tell me you were pregnant?
- I am.

521
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:31,195
The doctor said you are not.

522
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:43,191
Mrs Sobel?
- Ah, good evening, ma'am.

523
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,820
Do you remember me? And Claudy?
- Your husband? Of course.

524
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,187
I have to go.
- Will you come and see me?

525
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,772
One moment, I will look at the
room you were given.

526
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:08,010
Can I stay in your room?
- Yes, there is a sofa bed.

527
01:22:17,919 --> 01:22:20,991
I do not want to return to Albania.
- This is the best solution.

528
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,781
Tell him to let me stay.
- He will say no.

529
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:29,576
He does not trust you. You talk too much.

530
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,600
You would tell it to the nurse...
- She knew Claudy...

531
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:49,376
If you love me, understand
why I wanted the child.

532
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,177
There are no child, do not get crazy.

533
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,187
I did not want to betray you.
- Shut up!

534
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,825
You must complete this and this, but unsigned.
You must sign in the bank.

535
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,001
Cancel the loan. The bank only keeps
part of the money.

536
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,777
That amount?
- The bastards!

537
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:20,762
Call me when the doctor arrives.

538
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,163
7,000 are gone!

539
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,616
You are like him.
You just want your money back.

540
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,996
He lost his money with the Russians.
It is natural to want them back.

541
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,358
I am talking about you.

542
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,600
You will take as much as you gave
and then I will not see you again.

543
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,958
I will come at Gramsh.

544
01:23:45,919 --> 01:23:47,352
You will not.

545
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,796
Your certificate for the
annulment of the loan...

546
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,768
and the receipt to sign.

547
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,158
Here is your money.

548
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,387
I take back and the 1,000 I gave you.

549
01:24:53,919 --> 01:24:55,762
5600 is what they had spent?

550
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,163
5600 I paid in?

551
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:03,757
You know better.

552
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,358
The first track.

553
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,572
I will be in a month in Milan.

554
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,177
Then I'm going to see you at Gramsh.

555
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,753
What do you want?

556
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,352
See you.

557
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,158
Give me the phone.

558
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,568
Why?
- For your card.

559
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:09,191
What if I call you?
- Aske Spirou.

560
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,215
Why do not you get the highway?
I have to make refuel.

561
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:30,805
There is a gas station,
I will go while refueling.

562
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,576
Not here, there is another cheaper.

563
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,163
I have to pee. Stop.

564
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,358
Can't you wait?
- No

565
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,792
You do not need the bag to urinate.

566
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,757
They want to kill us.

567
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,163
Do not be afraid, I will protect you.

568
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,010
We will continue running...
It is safer...

569
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:40,962
We will start a fire...

570
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:14,762
I am going to get some firewood.

571
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,552
Do you hear?

572
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,163
I will not let you die.

573
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:17,352
Never.

574
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,187
I left your father to die.

575
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:25,757
You will live.

576
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,358
Sleep now.

577
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,163
We will leave tomorrow morning.

578
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,006
We will find something to eat and drink...

579
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,358
We will ask from a house.

580
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,953
Do not worry.

581
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:46,781
Somebody will help us.

582
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,953
Goodnight.
