1
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,140
Uncle Jonathan...

2
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,783
Come and join me.

3
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,586
Let's have some fun for a change.

4
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,706
Bible?

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,247
Bible?

6
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,080
Thank you, very much.

7
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,579
Bible?

8
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,850
No sir, it's no monster.

9
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,061
It's a hybrid.

10
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:48,130
The head came from
the Russian front - 1915.

11
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,560
The arms are Viennese - 1917.

12
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,071
The hips are French.

13
00:02:54,841 --> 00:03:00,541
This leg is Romanian
and that one Serbian - 1916.

14
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,079
- Times are hard.
- True.

15
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,283
Yet surely the one thing there's
no shortage of at the moment is corpses?

16
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,479
For sure, sir.

17
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,181
- Herr Schiele?
- Yes?

18
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,153
If you'd care to follow me.

19
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:49,287
One, Two,
One, Two...

20
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,862
Herr Schiele. This way.

21
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,668
There's no one here?

22
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,177
They've all gone.

23
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,506
Really?

24
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,314
- Even Midi?
- Even Fraulein Flüge.

25
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,280
Gustav?

26
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,726
Gustav, it's me.

27
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,958
Flowers.

28
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,586
How terrible...

29
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:54,615
Because of the weather they've decided to
cancel the Primavesis masquerade ball.

30
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,918
Okay.

31
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,493
That's enough for today.

32
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,119
But come on down. There's some food
and drink in the kitchen, thank you.

33
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,461
Thanks. Thank you, Herr Klimt.

34
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:15,468
I would work longer but I have
an appointment - thanks for today.

35
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,411
What about you?

36
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,648
What about me?

37
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,558
- Keisermelange.
- Franziskaner.

38
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,096
Bring me the usual.

39
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,756
- A tafelspitz.
- As usual.

40
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,366
- Gugelhupf.
- As usual.

41
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,460
- Maria Theresa Cafe
- As usual.

42
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,472
- Melange... Kaisermelange.
- As usual.

43
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,568
- What a rumpus.
- What's going on?

44
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,743
A reconciliation dinner

45
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,804
between Herr Jodl's supporters
and Herr Wickhoff's supporters.

46
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,113
And of course the members of the Academy.
Those you know well Herr Klimt.

47
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,313
Yes, but to me they all sound alike.

48
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,185
As though they were farting
through trumpets.

49
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,783
- How do you tell them apart?
- Easy...

50
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,862
In spite of his name Herr Jodl

51
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,898
believes that there exists a single
and unique form of aesthetic beauty.

52
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,366
Does he now?

53
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,428
In his view form is of no significance
as long as there is beauty.

54
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,566
Herr Vickhoff on the other hand argues
that every era has its own concept of beauty.

55
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,873
A concept that changes
as the era changes.

56
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,840
For him nothing is ugly.
It just depends on the era.

57
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,852
And the Academicians?

58
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,579
They believe that when Herr Raphael died,
beauty died along with him.

59
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:43,661
But is was all good clean fun,
that is until Herr Loos turned up.

60
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,728
Here is Klimt
a modern ornamentalist.

61
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,028
A real pathological case.

62
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,537
He never stops switching styles.

63
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,233
- What do you propose instead?
- Read my articles.

64
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,670
Forget it.

65
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,338
Look at this mirror.
I mean look at it, not into it.

66
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,005
What purpose does it serve?

67
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,846
To adjust one's hat,
one's cravatte, one's lipstick...

68
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,512
Which let me remind
you are all ornaments.

69
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,681
Now look at the gold frame.
What purpose does it serve?

70
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,724
I'll tell you. It serves to give work?

71
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,862
- pointless, unproductive work
- to craftsmen.

72
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,853
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

73
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,162
The frame is useless,
therefore inexpressive.

74
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,716
The mirror is useful
therefore functional.

75
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,132
Therefore expressive
and therefore beautiful.

76
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,848
What you were just saying is
merely ornamental.

77
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,323
Therefore it's useless and
therefore it's ugly.

78
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,686
However this cake has allowed
me to shut your mouth.

79
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:57,498
Therefore it's useful it's expressive,
and above all it's beautiful.

80
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,367
You, Herr Klimt, I forgive.

81
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,937
And you know why I forgive you?

82
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,373
Because at least your paintings
are sexual, as all art should be.

83
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,305
The crucifixion for example.

84
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,578
Now what could be more
sexual than the crucifixion?

85
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,153
Excuse me.

86
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,865
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,214
Sorry I'm so late.
I've just come from the ministry.

88
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,554
Hartel?

89
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,029
Yes.

90
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,362
So what does the minister
have to say for himself.

91
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,993
He must still be in a state
of shock I suppose.

92
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,663
He's not the worst you know?

93
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,969
So will there be a scandal or not?

94
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,709
Maybe not.

95
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,506
Really?

96
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,946
The minister said that for the
moment he supports Klimt.

97
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,848
After Paris, who knows?

98
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,353
If all goes well there'll be no scandal.

99
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,856
So it all depends on the
judgement of Paris...

100
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,188
God, that's pathetic.

101
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,955
Speaking of Paris, have you packed?

102
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,997
My mother will take care of that for me.

103
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,534
Naturally.

104
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,596
Everyone's here.
Even Jodl.

105
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,402
That fellow deserves
to have his face smashed in.

106
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,510
But he's with Wickhoff.
I thought they couldn't stand each other.

107
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,812
Do you know what Jodl said?

108
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:56,455
We are not against the nude art.
We are not against free art.

109
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,480
But we are against hideous art.

110
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,883
And he is sitting right over here
under out noses.

111
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,129
I feel like smashing his face in.

112
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,824
No, no, no.
You'll do nothing of the sort.

113
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,699
And our good friend, Klimt...

114
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,101
- What is he thinking of doing?
- Nothing.

115
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,841
- Klimt is drinking his coffee.
- Oh, leave them alone.

116
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,034
Where are you going?

117
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,674
To vomit.

118
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,573
I'm going to vomit.

119
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,244
Herr Klimt.

120
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,254
Herr Klimt.

121
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,122
If all goes well in Paris.

122
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,532
Herr Klimt.

123
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,028
- Flowers.
- What?

124
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,228
Flowers.

125
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,767
A broken mirror.

126
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,677
Well, I must say the twentieth
century's off to a good start.

127
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,011
A whole century of bad luck.

128
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,516
What's going on?

129
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,077
You're famous. Didn't you know?

130
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,580
It can happen to anyone after all.

131
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,690
No, I'm joking.

132
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,619
No, I was talking about the mirror

133
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,631
I was standing in front of and then someone
asked me how I was enjoying Paris.

134
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,735
And I said something or the other.

135
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,699
And the mirror shattered.

136
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,534
What really happened?

137
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,944
I spoke to Klimt and asked him
whether he missed Vienna.

138
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,572
He said not Vienna, but the flowers.

139
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,514
When he said flowers
the mirror shattered.

140
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,175
Le tout Paris.

141
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,010
There's Rodin. So he came after all.

142
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,124
And Mucha and Herr Stuck

143
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,893
I need a glass of water.

144
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,542
You again.

145
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,120
Oh, you know me.
I am flattered.

146
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,690
Usually no-one knows civil servants.
At least not the minor ones.

147
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,663
Allow me to introduce myself.

148
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,361
Secretary to the consular service
of the Austrian embassy.

149
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,203
Third secretary.

150
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,603
In perpetuity.

151
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,769
At my age one learns
to forget all about promotion.

152
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,815
Honoured never the less
to make your acquaintance.

153
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,508
I'm a great admirer of yours.

154
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:42,745
Burgtheater.
What an astounding achievement.

155
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,323
It's a fucking wedding cake
made of shit!

156
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:53,162
Yes, I had heard that your language was
a little... shall we say, on the salty side

157
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,731
It's the only language I know.

158
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,597
Not true, I'm sure.

159
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,104
But I wouldn't dream of
contradicting an artist.

160
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:06,468
Or perhaps you're just one of those
people who actually likes wedding cakes.

161
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,109
Well you say that with contempt,

162
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:14,118
But after all it's wedding cakes that follow
monuments, not the other way round.

163
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,244
I need a glass of water.

164
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,192
Where did you get to?

165
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
Everyone's looking for you.
The minister's there.

166
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,025
They're all there but you.

167
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:33,200
I have the distinct impression Herr Klimt is
unaware of what awaits him.

168
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,036
Austria my dear Herr Klimt.

169
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,042
Austria has been honoured.
You've won the gold medal.

170
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,740
I knew it.

171
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,507
Oh, shit!

172
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:48,208
Really Herr Klimt,
you exaggerate.

173
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,464
Herr Klimt.

174
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,306
You don't know me...
or rather you don't regognise me

175
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:17,108
I am... I was the daughter
of your housekeeper

176
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,915
I was in love with you as a child.

177
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,015
It was I who opened the door to you the time
you forgot the keys to your apartment.

178
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,388
It was I who ran after you
when you went for a walk to the prater.

179
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:33,865
It is I... it was I that was the mother
of your son Andreas.

180
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,761
Ladies and Gentlemen!

181
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,871
Attention please.

182
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:46,372
I would like to announce a great surprise
from the management of the Exposition.

183
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,640
Gustav Klimt meets
Lea De Castro

184
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:26,310
Mesdames, Messieurs, would you please
now welcome the great magician

185
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:30,711
Monsieur Melies
and his two very talented actors.

186
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,654
You're not offended I hope?

187
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,753
Offended?
No. On the contrary.

188
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,228
Did you enjoy the film?

189
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,394
I thought it was remarkable,
my congratulations.

190
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,902
It's Monsieur Melies
you should congratulate.

191
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,067
Monsieur Melies a great honour.

192
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,439
A mere trifle.
We cobbled it together last week.

193
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,568
How did you like Lea?

194
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,606
She could charm the birds
out of the trees.

195
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,109
I hope you'll agree to paint my portrait.

196
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,716
Yes, I would love to.

197
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,718
Tell me, what do you think of Lea?

198
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,053
She could charm
the trees themselves.

199
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,683
If you like this one
you'll like the real Lea even better.

200
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,954
Pardon?

201
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,097
Don't worry Monsieur Klimt. The real one is
not nearly as real as the false one.

202
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,936
You like her don't you?

203
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,709
Yes, you do like her.

204
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,522
You always said you cannot work
without a model within arm's reach,

205
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,149
if I can put it like that.

206
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,221
Yet all of a sudden
you can draw her by heart.

207
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,326
By heart.

208
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,362
Well, well.

209
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,566
Little Gustl speaks French.

210
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,501
What a surprise!

211
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,622
No, Midi.

212
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,082
No, not you.

213
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,490
You're beautiful but...

214
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,099
But what?

215
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,097
Message for Mister Klimt.

216
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,065
Sign here, please.

217
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,919
- Is it from her?
- It's from someone.

218
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,326
A rendez-vous. Tonight?

219
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,492
I'm to meet someone downstairs.

220
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,399
In Vienna they're expecting you.

221
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,867
I know that too.

222
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,835
You're going to stay
on in Paris, aren't you?

223
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,070
I don't know.

224
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,938
Gustl, I leave tomorrow.

225
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,376
Without me.

226
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,543
I've got to go the boutique.

227
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,379
Speaking of which, have I
shown you my latest models?

228
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,214
No, I'd like to see them.

229
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,483
Gustl... you will
tell me everything?

230
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:28,786
Promise.

231
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,823
Every detail?

232
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,724
Every.

233
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,592
- What? You!
- At your service.

234
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,734
You'll have to excuse me, I'm on
my way to a romantic assignation.

235
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,035
The carriage is outside.

236
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,077
- Just who are you?
- Your humble servant.

237
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,074
I don't need a servant.

238
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,274
Do you know what they call Paris?

239
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,582
The new Babylon.

240
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,117
It's a beguiling city
but a dangerous one.

241
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,088
I see. So you're going to
chaperone me, I suppose.

242
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,920
What if it's the other way round?

243
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,089
I have my resources.

244
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,723
- Was it the embassy that sent you?
- No.

245
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,767
The person who's message
you've just received.

246
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,903
- The false Lea.
- False, true, does it really matter?

247
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,014
Okay Gaston.
We're ready.

248
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,615
Right away, Monsieur.

249
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,667
Actually,
I wear several different hats.

250
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,638
At the Cultural section of the embassy
we're modestly re-numerated.

251
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,833
But I get by.

252
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,277
Lea, the false Lea
is she wealthy?

253
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,280
The false one, no.
The real one, yes.

254
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,311
She has a wealthy sugar-daddy.

255
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,219
A sugar-daddy!
Naturally!

256
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,954
Here we are.

257
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,603
I see I'm leaving you in good hands.

258
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,933
- Have fun.
- You're abandoning me?

259
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,530
Mission accomplished.

260
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,441
Monsieur,
if you would kindly follow me.

261
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,196
Sir, may I ask what all this is about?

262
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,935
Sir!

263
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,845
Sir, may I ask what all this is about?

264
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,020
Sir?

265
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:00,160
Sir, I asked you a question.

266
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,671
I am not permitted to say anything, sir.

267
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,472
I'm sorry.

268
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,850
- You.
- Yes, it's me.

269
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,982
They told me you're one of those men
who like their women naked.

270
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,492
It isn't always the case you know?

271
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,391
Here in France,
nudite is no longer 'comme il faut'.

272
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,227
Whiskey?

273
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,365
At the moment whiskey
is all the rage in Paris.

274
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,465
But then as you know 'the rage'
changes so quickly in this city.

275
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,771
Six months ago it was port
with a splash of bitters.

276
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:46,074
And last year,
it was strawberries and champagne.

277
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,177
But that's enough gossip.

278
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,616
Shall we get down to business?

279
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,316
You said publicly, that you'd be
delighted to paint my portrait.

280
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,519
I can scarcely believe it.

281
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,292
Believe it mademoiselle.
Believe it.

282
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,930
What do you think?

283
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,694
The Duke Wolff Helenia adores it.

284
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,429
Who?

285
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,764
A friend.

286
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,875
A very dear friend.

287
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,806
Let's say an intimate friend.

288
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:16,711
And he's in Paris just at the moment.

289
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,041
Who knows?

290
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,984
The Duke is a globe - trotter.

291
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,978
Don't you 'trot the globe' with him?

292
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,891
Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't.

293
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,190
By nature, he's an artist.

294
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,361
An artist who just happens
not to possess any talent.

295
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,833
So instead of painting me himself

296
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,803
he commissions
other talented artists to do it for him.

297
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,300
I see.

298
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,138
You haven't told me yet what you
think of this Whistler.

299
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,170
If it weren't amusing it
would be laughable.

300
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,614
You have a cruel streak.

301
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,146
I like the cruelty of artists.

302
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,716
It tends to leave
a bitter sweet after-taste.

303
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,689
And it mixes well with your sweat.

304
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:16,230
Funny there's the smell
of horses about you.

305
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,234
But I also detect a hint of apples, non?

306
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,842
How impatient you are!

307
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,977
Don't tell me
you've got another appointment.

308
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,575
No. No.

309
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,720
I love you.

310
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,983
What?
Love at first sight?

311
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,752
Yes. Yes.

312
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,327
Be careful. Love at first sight
doesn't always survive the second.

313
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,466
Heavens we're carrying on
like a pair of bumpkins.

314
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,902
But I personally prefer to make love
as it were through the proper channels.

315
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,168
You can't deny he's got allure.

316
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,511
I'd call it a nerve.

317
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,645
She's not bad.

318
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,087
She's not bad at all.

319
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,451
You think so?

320
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,115
I find her a bit stiff.

321
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,957
Well, don't forget, it's not so easy.

322
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,092
He's certainly a fast worker.

323
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,800
Is he of peasant stock?

324
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,633
I've no idea.

325
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,978
My dear I fear
it's your turn now. Go.

326
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,084
Go, go, go.

327
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,400
I do hope I didn't keep you waiting.

328
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,770
No, on the contrary.

329
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,938
But I do wonder how you changed
your hair style so quickly.

330
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,306
Unless of course...

331
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,377
You're not the real one.

332
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,854
Men!
Why do you always need proof?

333
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,654
Always need evidence.

334
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,120
It isn't you, is it?

335
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,122
What isn't me?

336
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,859
Lea.

337
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,832
Lea.

338
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,494
Lea De Castro.

339
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,475
Don't tell me you've been talking to
that poor little girl who pretends to be me.

340
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,237
I've been told you watched
the film she's in.

341
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,205
Is she any good?

342
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,884
Do you believe me now.

343
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,282
I believe.

344
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,761
I gather you made a promise
to paint my portrait.

345
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,835
Then I'll expect you to keep it.

346
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,073
Actually I shall want two portraits.

347
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,704
One in which I'm clothed.

348
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,243
And the other in which I'm stark naked.

349
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,952
Or stark nude.

350
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,142
It seemed to me
that only someone like you

351
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,194
would be capable
of painting me clothed

352
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,026
in such a way that people
would think I was naked.

353
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,233
And painting me naked
in such a way

354
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,567
that people wouldn't see
my nakedness at all but...

355
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,469
...well, something else.

356
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,539
What else?

357
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,205
So how long will it take you...?

358
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,279
A week?

359
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,285
Two weeks?

360
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:58,393
At the moment
I really can't give you too much time.

361
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,829
Two weeks isn't nearly long enough.

362
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,729
We could start tomorrow.

363
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,314
What you did is very beautiful.

364
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,249
Very beautiful.

365
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,292
And very strange.

366
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,980
The man does have courage,
I'll give him that.

367
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,448
Easy if you're well paid.

368
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,678
Oh no,
you can see he really worked.

369
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,721
And that's all he's got to show for it?

370
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:01,518
Well, you can't make an omelette
without breaking eggs.

371
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:05,489
What he does is break eggs
without making an omelette.

372
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,563
...Herr Klimt

373
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,168
Herr Minister. What do you think?

374
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,668
Oh, I...

375
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,130
I find it all very aback-taking.

376
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,866
Yes. Indeed this is the word;
aback-taking.

377
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,741
But we'll talk about it later.

378
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,543
We'll have a long chat about
it just the two of us.

379
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:28,386
What's the difference between
a caricature and an allegory?

380
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:31,219
According to Herr Klimt
there isn't any difference.

381
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,654
What do you say, Professor?

382
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:41,256
I would argue rather that if there is abuse
it is not of antichrony but of antipopeics.

383
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,924
Honourable Secretary.

384
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,525
Second secretary...
Since last week.

385
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:47,331
As the French say, 'Ca s'arrose'.

386
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,201
Ca s'arrose.
Your good health.

387
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,534
And yours.

388
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,040
Not everyone's happy.

389
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,770
Most of them are furious.

390
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,075
Not me. But then I live in Paris.

391
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:01,678
There your work would be regarded as poetic.
Charmingly poetic. Here it's decadent.

392
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,619
I wish I were in Paris.

393
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,279
Don't delude yourself.

394
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,589
Here decadent is synonymous
with diabolical.

395
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,356
In Paris it just means naughty.

396
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,797
You know Herr Klimt...
I've been around.

397
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,663
And I can assure you it's a triumph.

398
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:26,036
It's a triumph that may feel at the
moment very much like a defeat.

399
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,372
But it's a triumph never-the-less.

400
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,413
Have you seen Lea?

401
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,546
She's worried about the painting.

402
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,377
- Is it progressing?
- I haven't had time.

403
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,414
I see. Well...

404
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,562
She's waiting for you
to get in touch with her.

405
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,830
And she's quite willing to come to you.

406
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,968
Just as soon as the portrait is finished.

407
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,832
It's not a portrait. It's an allegory.

408
00:32:55,573 --> 00:33:01,011
I fear that's going to be an unpleasant
surprise for Mademoiselle de Castro.

409
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,376
What do you think of my allegories?

410
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,975
Yet another abrupt change of subject?

411
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,722
I think they're poetic. Charmingly poetic.

412
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,151
Thank you.

413
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,098
Klimt, I've been looking for you.

414
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,301
What do you think?

415
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,962
What do I think?

416
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,798
I think it's beautiful.
Sublime, revolutionary.

417
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,878
But that's not what I've come
to talk to you about.

418
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,317
I've been hearing from my informants
that you have problems

419
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,682
big problems.

420
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,946
Your paintings are likely to be rejected.

421
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,988
There is even talk of a scandal.

422
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,614
Two scandals - because
I'm going to take them back.

423
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,159
Steal the paintings?

424
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,662
That doesn't make sense.
They are no longer yours.

425
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,195
They were once and they will be again.

426
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,662
You're really going
to get into trouble, you know.

427
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,833
In any event. Whatever happens,
you have my support.

428
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,466
Berta, Berta Zuckerkandl.

429
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,067
I was looking for you.

430
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,673
Excuse me, please.

431
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,248
Many apologies, but I have got to go.

432
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,712
So, you need to hear
what I've just heard.

433
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,354
Two hundred signatures.

434
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,652
Each ornament is in itself
a form of expression.

435
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,592
And the expression itself...

436
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,558
Frau Zuckerkandl's a
very powerful woman.

437
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,261
Congratulations. This means
the press is going to get behind you.

438
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,667
You're saved.

439
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,566
You think so?

440
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,141
Our dear Academicians
have a very short memory.

441
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,574
Alas for them, but good for you.

442
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,675
For they're going
to attack you on every front.

443
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,145
Which I have to tell you
is also a good sign.

444
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,646
The Academy loathes you

445
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:51,484
but Herr Kraus for his part abominates
both you and the Academy.

446
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,421
The philistines will be up in arms,

447
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,187
then Herr Loos will counter attack by
saying that they're the real scandal.

448
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:02,460
And with any luck you'll find yourself
in the middle of the most God-awful stink...

449
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,728
I repeat, congratulations.

450
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,271
Tell Lea I am coming to see her soon.

451
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,500
Change of subject.

452
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,609
Actually I don't believe
she's in Paris at the moment.

453
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,645
Gustav? Gustl, are you
talking to yourself?

454
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,883
No... No, I was talking to someone.

455
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,516
Well the minister's furious.

456
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,092
So am I.

457
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:33,221
He has changed sides
for the moment he is...

458
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,323
he is against us.

459
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,596
So what?

460
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,236
Gustl, you are not making things easy.

461
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,505
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,996
The exhibition was it a success?

463
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,034
Well, if you measure
the success of such an event

464
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,161
by the number of visitors
who remember to take their hats off...

465
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,066
I'd say it was a disaster.

466
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,530
No, no, no. No, no, stop it.

467
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,663
No, Let me.. let me go.

468
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:50,832
Stop.

469
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,421
We'll redeem Austria.

470
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,484
Klimt. Klimt.

471
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,885
Hartel.

472
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,827
You are the only one.

473
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,764
The only one who has
any reason to complain.

474
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,004
All those Jodl's, those Loos's are...

475
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,338
- One moment! We are the police...
- what... a bunch of...

476
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,003
Herr Minister...
why don't we accompany you home?

477
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,927
- Out of the question.
- Come on.

478
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,742
I'll stay with my friend Klimt.

479
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,453
Why didn't I put up a fight for you?

480
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,822
Come on my old friend,
let's have one for the road.

481
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,489
I know a place not...
not far from here.

482
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,847
Oh, Your Excellency,
what an honour.

483
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:14,016
We saw that the light was on and so we
decided to come up and say good evening.

484
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,093
A wonderful idea.

485
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,190
Ah Herr Klimt, we haven't
seen you for quite some time.

486
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,556
Have you reserved?

487
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:27,161
No, we haven't. I'm afraid
we are unforgivably spur of the moment.

488
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,737
I'm sure we will find something for you.

489
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,674
Although we are rather crowded tonight.

490
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,107
Herr Adler and his friends are
in your habitual salon, Herr Klimt.

491
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,946
And the Russian and the
Thai salons are also occupied.

492
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:47,388
- How about the Persian salon?
- Oh, I'm afraid the Italians have that.

493
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,291
- But how about the Western Salon?
- No out of the question.

494
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,325
That only leaves the African salon?

495
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,798
That's excellent!

496
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,665
You do know the rules for that salon?

497
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,036
Of course, of course. I love them!

498
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:07,404
Allegories, Schmallegories,
call them what you please.

499
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,743
But all that nudity...
what were you thinking of?

500
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,649
The history of art is
also the history of nudity.

501
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,913
Alright.
Okay, but there are rules.

502
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,853
Rules of representation...
And you know the rules...

503
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,257
You know what you can show
and what you can't show.

504
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,962
Did you really have to break
every single one?

505
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:31,534
Did you see the shape?...
The serpent Legeia...

506
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,797
The founder of medicine.

507
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,101
The cycle of life and death.

508
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,574
Yes, but you didn't say anything...

509
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,874
I am a painter.
I am not a fucking critic!

510
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,479
Herr Klimt.

511
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,377
Aren't you going to say good
evening to your daughter?

512
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,049
Good evening, Herr Klimt.

513
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,853
I admire your work.

514
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,328
How do you do?

515
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,391
How is school?

516
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,896
There is no school.

517
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,132
How very you.

518
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,106
- Children all over the place.
- There is Klimt with the minister.

519
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,306
Death to Decadents.

520
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,436
Death to morons!

521
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,642
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Balkans!

522
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,648
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Balkans!

523
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,786
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Balkans!

524
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,753
Long live whores!

525
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,957
Quick...
choose the one you want.

526
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,823
I'm going to stay
with your daughter.

527
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,296
Is she really your daughter?

528
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,259
I suppose she is, I don't know.

529
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,395
I'll have this one
and this one and this one.

530
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,737
I see you four are going to cook up
a nice little allegory together.

531
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:53,377
Chocolate soldiers are we...

532
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,886
manufactured to celebrate here

533
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:03,183
your birthday, excellency...

534
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,764
and then prepared to be eaten.

535
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,332
How many have you got?
Five? Six?

536
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,200
More than that, Mama.

537
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,800
If you ask me
he's holding something back.

538
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,977
And all of them with different mothers?

539
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,243
Sometimes I wonder...

540
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,082
Mama, would you pass me a Semmel?

541
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:35,658
I can see he would rather not answer.

542
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,197
- Mama, these children of mine...
- Yes?

543
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,929
The models are free.

544
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,199
Oh yes,
they're free alright

545
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,003
And I suppose it's just a coincidence
they are all Jewesses?

546
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,841
Yes, Hermine.

547
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,975
That's what I read in the paper,
I didn't make it up.

548
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,812
You don't have to make it up because
the paper already did that for you.

549
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,251
Free, you say?

550
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,849
Mama...

551
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,917
Six... Eight... Ten... What?

552
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,392
There's no point in counting them mama...
Am I right, Gustl?

553
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,560
What are you going to do?

554
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,564
I am going to go
to the studio and paint,

555
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,469
Mama. I am going to paint.

556
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,399
My God, my God.

557
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,780
Thank you both
for a very nice lunch.

558
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,476
Far, far too many children.

559
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:37,747
Mama...

560
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,916
A child is a gift from God.

561
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,560
Whose God? The Jewish one?

562
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,724
I'll see you both this evening...

563
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,793
Thank you.

564
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,997
What do you want for dinner?

565
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,399
Guess.

566
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,910
We are waiting for an answer.

567
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,945
Stew.

568
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,641
Don't you ever get sick of stew?

569
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:16,823
Mama... Mama... Mama...

570
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,689
Come...

571
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,459
I have to show you something.

572
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,368
It's me?

573
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:36,943
So to speak.

574
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:39,809
And...

575
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,050
Your condition has stabilised.

576
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,480
We should never-the-less
continue with the mercury.

577
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,624
Oh God, must we?
It takes so much out of me.

578
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,594
But my dear fellow, you're an athlete.

579
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,162
Rolf as you know, I have children...
In fact quiet a few...

580
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,100
Is there any risk that they might be...?

581
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,831
That they have been contaminated?

582
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,600
No... Not really

583
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,977
There's always a risk obviously
but it's a fairly small one.

584
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,205
You know half the male population
of this city is syphilitic...

585
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,917
If it weren't you it would be someone else.

586
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,513
I see.

587
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,017
So your work going well?

588
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,923
How is your mother?

589
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,420
Bad.

590
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,198
- Your sister?
- Worse.

591
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,330
You could have them comitted you know?

592
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,060
I'd take care of it all.

593
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:36,930
No. I should prefer to take care of
them myself, thanks.

594
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,705
Well, well, well Herr Klimt,
here you are again.

595
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,708
Alas my friend, it can't have
escaped your notice

596
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,511
that Vienna isn't
any longer what it was.

597
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,676
In fact it hasn't really been
Vienna for a very long time.

598
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,212
Isn't it odd though,

599
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:57,185
that when the Minister takes it upon himself to
reduce state subsidies for the arts...

600
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,955
And sometimes eliminates
them all together,

601
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:02,554
you continue to receive support
from the most unlikely sources.

602
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,701
You were chosen by the chosen

603
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,004
if you'll forgive the pun.

604
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,400
You were elected by the elite...

605
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:12,868
Sorry, another pun.

606
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,971
You transferred your allegiance
to private enterprise just in time.

607
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,847
The rich bourgeoisie adores you.

608
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,407
And you clearly feel
the same way about them.

609
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:26,046
I'm beginning to sense our friend doesn't
look at all favourably upon the idea.

610
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,417
You won't sell it?

611
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,622
It isn't finished.

612
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,018
But Klimt,

613
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:34,029
if we are to believe you not one of
your paintings is finished.

614
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,431
They aren't!

615
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,433
Well, what can I say?

616
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:43,165
It's your painting and you must decide
what you want to do with it.

617
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,506
We'll talk it over again
some other time, I trust.

618
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:53,276
But now, what say we take a
little guided tour of the Klimt museum?

619
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,312
It's just simply marvellous.

620
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,016
- Quite, quite remarkable.
- The whole world.

621
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,850
What kind of world would you say?

622
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,259
- Where's Klimt?
- He left as always.

623
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,031
In my opinion Klimt should paint
nothing but landscapes.

624
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,034
I also dreamed of you.

625
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,168
In this dream I was married to
a very, very old musician.

626
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,068
Old and rich, huh?

627
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,612
No. Not rich.

628
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,377
He was a retired coffee house waiter.

629
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,784
Everybody called him the Professor.

630
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,218
Just imagine he locked me
into a huge room...

631
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,822
And every night...

632
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,430
He brought me another man.

633
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,965
And so each night I made love to
an unknown person.

634
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:55,433
Serena.

635
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,142
Have you been here the whole time?

636
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:06,917
I think I am going to say,
'I only just arrived'.

637
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:10,485
- Better that way, no?
- Perhaps...

638
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,555
Listen, if you've come
about your portrait...

639
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:16,285
I'm afraid I have to confess I haven't done
much work on it since our last sitting.

640
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:18,588
No. I haven't come about the portrait.

641
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:22,991
It's something I saw in here
the other day... Quite by chance.

642
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:26,463
- Do you mind?
- No.

643
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,679
Voila... here it is.

644
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:38,438
Who is this?

645
00:47:40,618 --> 00:47:41,710
Who is this?

646
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,320
It seems you know very well
who that is.

647
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:46,389
Oh, Yes?
How do I know?

648
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:48,953
Intuition.

649
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:53,792
Yes... Yes, as a matter of fact
I do know.

650
00:47:54,198 --> 00:47:56,666
Lea de Castro...
I see...

651
00:47:57,535 --> 00:47:58,763
Well, I've got to go.

652
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:00,928
- So soon?
- Yes, so soon.

653
00:48:01,705 --> 00:48:03,866
I'll leave you to your models.

654
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:06,432
They seem quite terrifyingly naked.

655
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:09,011
...at times they are.

656
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,410
Amuse yourself.

657
00:48:13,317 --> 00:48:14,682
Work well!

658
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,484
Let's work.

659
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:22,015
So are you mad at me?

660
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,954
No, you aren't.

661
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:28,287
Thank you... steady now...

662
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:30,060
You haven't made
a rendezvous with her?

663
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,634
Turn your face a little...

664
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:33,897
But no, but no, but no.

665
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:35,335
Is she still in Paris?

666
00:48:35,439 --> 00:48:36,599
Very still...

667
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:41,467
Sometimes I wonder
if the real Lea even exists.

668
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:42,637
Good.

669
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:45,576
I want to get married.

670
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,748
Are you serious?

671
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,051
No. Well, actually yes and no...

672
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:55,119
A free marriage.

673
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,054
I've got another piece of news for you.

674
00:48:58,996 --> 00:49:00,793
You've just had a child.

675
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,798
- A daughter.
- What? No!

676
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:08,698
With who?

677
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,032
Mizzi.

678
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:12,473
I have a daughter?

679
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,699
Yes.

680
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,335
I have a little daughter.

681
00:49:16,213 --> 00:49:18,306
- Yes!
- That is wonderful news!

682
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:21,745
Gustl!

683
00:49:32,897 --> 00:49:35,661
Little red riding hood's great grandmother

684
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,393
had a love affair with a wolf...

685
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:42,672
So her daughter was born...
half wolf and half human.

686
00:49:43,474 --> 00:49:45,908
She became a wolf
when she grew up.

687
00:49:46,744 --> 00:49:52,808
So it was she who swallowed
little Red Riding Hood.

688
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:56,715
As she did so she sang a song...

689
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:05,252
From the lambs I prefer the head.

690
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,898
From the humans I prefer their bottom.

691
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:14,001
The throat is
what I like best of the chickens.

692
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:18,569
Their calmness is
what I like best with the rabbits.

693
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,176
Mizzi, it's me...

694
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,655
- You want to see her?
- Of course.

695
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:41,629
She's in there.

696
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:46,099
No... I won't.

697
00:50:46,637 --> 00:50:47,695
Why not?

698
00:50:47,771 --> 00:50:51,207
I should prefer not
to just at the moment.

699
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:55,545
- She doesn't bite.
- I'll see her when she's older.

700
00:50:56,213 --> 00:50:58,511
As you wish... Herr Klimt.

701
00:50:59,216 --> 00:51:01,184
What have you got there?

702
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,816
It's just a gift from someone...
in a very poor taste.

703
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:11,317
A gift from someone
in a very poor taste.

704
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:15,759
Gustav, I have to talk to your father.

705
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,667
Go and play in the yard!

706
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:20,932
Come on, Come on.

707
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:31,441
Herr Klimt.

708
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,382
My father came to see me.

709
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,720
He wanted to talk to me about...

710
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:42,682
Well... you see he...

711
00:51:43,827 --> 00:51:45,317
He wanted to...

712
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,296
He needs money?

713
00:51:48,432 --> 00:51:50,229
Oh, no... no.

714
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:52,460
No, it's not about money he...

715
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:57,534
He would like the children
to be brought up in the Jewish faith.

716
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:00,872
Fine, so long
as he takes care of it.

717
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,304
- You're not shocked?
- No, why?

718
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:06,944
- I thought you were a Catholic?
- I'm nothing at all.

719
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:08,884
But if your father
wants to amuse himself

720
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:11,183
by putting the fear of God
into his grand children

721
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:13,848
and you're not against it,
it's fine by me.

722
00:52:18,362 --> 00:52:20,626
- What a relief.
- A relief?

723
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:25,391
Well I... I wasn't sure
how you would react.

724
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:29,735
Thank you Herr Klimt...
a thousand, thousand thanks.

725
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:36,510
Gustl!

726
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,478
Gustav!

727
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:48,252
Gustl!

728
00:52:51,495 --> 00:52:53,929
I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times.

729
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:56,498
Next time you will get more than a slap.

730
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,299
What's he done?

731
00:52:58,402 --> 00:52:59,835
There is something wrong
with that boy.

732
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:02,030
He prefers to play with a little chink.

733
00:53:02,773 --> 00:53:06,334
- He knows he's forbidden to.
- Why is it forbidden?

734
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:08,605
Herr Klimt.

735
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,244
I ask you a question.

736
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:15,183
Well, you know...

737
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:18,851
We don't know where they come from.

738
00:53:21,692 --> 00:53:22,989
China?

739
00:53:24,027 --> 00:53:25,722
You can be terribly cruel.

740
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:33,732
Sorry, but I'm going
to have to disturb you.

741
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:35,634
Not now Midi, please.

742
00:53:35,739 --> 00:53:38,230
You're angry, irritated, sad.

743
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:42,877
- I'm also late.
- I have to talk to you.

744
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:45,675
- No, tomorrow.
- You've seen the photographs?

745
00:53:46,884 --> 00:53:48,719
You were followed by a photographer.

746
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,219
You can be seen quite clearly,

747
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:53,746
There's no doubt it's you sashaying through
Vienna with a painting under your arm.

748
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:56,826
Dear old Gustl,
stealing his own painting.

749
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:58,321
What?

750
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,724
Shit!

751
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:12,266
- I'll pay them back.
- And what will you use for money?

752
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,108
- I've no idea.
- Gustl, Gustl...

753
00:54:17,614 --> 00:54:20,139
I don't give a shit
about those critics...

754
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:21,777
And the Academics.

755
00:54:21,919 --> 00:54:25,878
They can take their shitty little opinions
and their shitty little theories...

756
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:29,550
.. and shove them up their shitty,
little assholes...

757
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:32,826
Oh, my I've never seen
little Gustl so angry.

758
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:35,191
I care about the people
who buy my work.

759
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:36,425
And believe me,
I promise you,

760
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:39,001
those people I'm going to reimburse.

761
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,703
Yes, I'm laughing.

762
00:54:42,706 --> 00:54:43,764
Sorry Gustl.

763
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:46,934
I'm laughing because I know you
really mean it. That's a joke.

764
00:54:47,377 --> 00:54:48,867
You think it's a joke?

765
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:53,147
Little Gustl is used to getting his own way.
That's what's so funny.

766
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:56,550
To tell you the truth Midi.

767
00:54:58,121 --> 00:55:01,682
To tell you the truth
I... I don't know what to do.

768
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:05,425
Your friends will clean up
after your mess. They usually do.

769
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:09,496
Thank you, Midi.

770
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:19,335
...Gustl!

771
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:23,072
Kissing anywhere but on the lips is
like smoking without inhaling.

772
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,875
I'll keep that in mind.

773
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:27,276
I have to work.

774
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:29,882
Don't worry, I'm going.

775
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:36,318
Ah, non!

776
00:55:36,393 --> 00:55:37,451
Yes!

777
00:55:49,673 --> 00:55:51,004
Where are you?

778
00:55:57,748 --> 00:56:00,046
Or for that matter,
who are you?

779
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:02,144
I was waiting outside.

780
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,145
Then I met pussy.

781
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:08,918
So I followed her in here
by the back door.

782
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:11,918
Why aren't you in Paris?

783
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,058
Paris?

784
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,135
Paris is a long way away.

785
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,964
I note that you haven't asked for
news of Mademoiselle Lea.

786
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,971
Oh, you mean the false Lea?

787
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:27,102
She's the one you're in love with.

788
00:56:28,045 --> 00:56:29,273
Or am I wrong?

789
00:56:29,613 --> 00:56:30,875
I wouldn't know.

790
00:56:31,214 --> 00:56:32,511
Perhaps they're both false.

791
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:34,841
Both?

792
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,644
All three of them.
Who can tell?

793
00:56:38,755 --> 00:56:40,416
Duke Wollf Helenia, you know...

794
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:43,460
He's a Viennese to the tips of
his manicured finger-nails.

795
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:45,894
He just adores imbroglios.

796
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,657
He adores to set the cat
among the pigeons.

797
00:56:52,536 --> 00:56:53,594
So...

798
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:55,460
So?

799
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,070
Why don't you go to her
since she's waiting for you.

800
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:01,277
You said 'she', not 'they'.

801
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:02,912
I know, tricky isn't it?

802
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:06,947
Now you must excuse me.

803
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:21,963
Well, well, well
look who's here.

804
00:57:22,132 --> 00:57:23,599
I was expecting you.

805
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:26,831
Actually, it wasn't you
I was expecting.

806
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:28,271
It was him.

807
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:30,970
Oh hello, hello.

808
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:34,409
Oh my poor friend.

809
00:57:34,444 --> 00:57:36,844
I can see you're
completely discombobulated.

810
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:38,446
You have my sympathy.

811
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:40,973
But come in. Come in.

812
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,989
Please, come in.

813
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:49,919
Bonsoir, Monsieur.

814
00:57:50,026 --> 00:57:51,015
Bonsoir.

815
00:57:58,068 --> 00:57:59,467
Where is Lea?

816
00:58:00,137 --> 00:58:01,103
There is no one here...

817
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:04,630
I mean no one but me
and you and your double.

818
00:58:04,975 --> 00:58:06,943
Is there anything I can offer you?

819
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:08,670
Do make yourselves at home.

820
00:58:08,812 --> 00:58:12,304
This is my home, you know?
It's my studio.

821
00:58:12,616 --> 00:58:17,053
I rent it out from time to time to the Duke
or else to one of his acquaintances.

822
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,686
Or maybe I should say accomplices?

823
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:22,949
Where is Lea?

824
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,452
Sit down my friend, sit down.
There are chairs for everyone.

825
00:58:35,005 --> 00:58:36,973
Forgive me,
I've a memory like a sieve.

826
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,266
Cheers, good health...

827
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,911
And I can't seem to remember
anything at all about poor Lea.

828
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,804
Wait though.

829
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:48,449
I have what you might call
mnemotechnical hands.

830
00:58:48,552 --> 00:58:50,076
Why don't we interrogate them?

831
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:57,490
Now where have
my scissors got to?

832
00:58:57,627 --> 00:58:59,754
You're holding them,
dear Melies.

833
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:03,421
Ah, yes so I am.
Alright, let's see.

834
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:12,233
Light.

835
00:59:45,342 --> 00:59:46,604
Lea.

836
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:04,453
Lea.

837
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,262
It's Idiotic!

838
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:17,704
It's simply idiotic.

839
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:21,073
It could be that I am an imbecile...

840
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:25,278
Idiot means that you are self enclosed,
a prisoner of yourself, of your 'sense data'.

841
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:28,044
And an imbecile is someone
who has no sense...

842
01:00:28,151 --> 01:00:29,413
What about him?

843
01:00:35,191 --> 01:00:38,126
which can be expressed
in less than three words...

844
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,029
- How can you say that?
- I say it because it's true.

845
01:01:15,665 --> 01:01:16,654
May I join you?

846
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:19,894
Ah, Schiele. It's you.
Yes please.

847
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:26,335
They say you've found
a new Chinese style.

848
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,507
Do you have a pencil?

849
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:34,373
I'll draw the first line
and you draw the next and so on.

850
01:01:47,597 --> 01:01:49,064
Who's winning?

851
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:53,163
No one.

852
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:07,777
Who's drawing is this,
yours or mine?

853
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,585
Do you know
what those young people say?

854
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:16,416
They say that you have
to stand outside of history.

855
01:02:16,593 --> 01:02:18,686
This history is a nightmare.

856
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:24,165
And that there's absolutely
nothing else to be said about it.

857
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:25,892
And who are they?

858
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:29,802
I don't know.
They sound like philosophers.

859
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:33,374
Except they say philosophy is rubbish.

860
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:35,444
Yes, of course.

861
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,953
News ladies and gentleman

862
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:49,222
News about the war.

863
01:02:49,726 --> 01:02:53,025
News from the Front.

864
01:02:57,267 --> 01:03:00,430
Schiele!

865
01:03:04,374 --> 01:03:10,677
Schiele!

866
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:23,287
You're in here -
outside is the reality!

867
01:03:23,393 --> 01:03:28,797
Here it's coffee house philosophy!

868
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:33,765
Nothing but frothy coffee!

869
01:03:33,903 --> 01:03:35,097
Calm down.

870
01:03:38,975 --> 01:03:40,374
What are you reading?

871
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,635
Dante.

872
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:44,377
And you find Dante helpful do you?

873
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,549
And what does that have to do with you?

874
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:48,480
Nothing. Nothing...

875
01:03:48,752 --> 01:03:51,220
so very sorry to have...

876
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:53,687
As a matter of fact I do find it helpful.

877
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,485
I see, I see.

878
01:03:55,592 --> 01:03:57,219
Here you are professor.

879
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:00,662
May I offer you something?

880
01:04:01,698 --> 01:04:05,657
No, thank you, professor.
I've had enough to drink this evening.

881
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:08,094
I'm not a professor, Herr Klimt.

882
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:09,466
I am nothing.

883
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:11,070
Virtually nothing.

884
01:04:12,142 --> 01:04:16,101
Once upon a time I was actually
doing what Klaus does now.

885
01:04:19,883 --> 01:04:21,942
I knew I'd seen you before.

886
01:04:22,185 --> 01:04:23,618
My name is Hugo...

887
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:25,115
Hugo Moritz.

888
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:27,049
To your very good health.

889
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:32,720
I have spent thirty years at this table
listening to the drivel of these gentlemen.

890
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:37,323
What is beauty? What is ugliness?
What is function?

891
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:41,533
Everything is beautiful
everything is ugly

892
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:43,366
nothing is functional.

893
01:04:43,973 --> 01:04:46,635
To your very good health, sir.

894
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:50,809
Police have only just left
and they're at it again.

895
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:54,978
Really these gentlemen are
seriously beginning to get on my nerves.

896
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:58,952
In my day I'd have had them slung out
on their backsides by now.

897
01:04:59,422 --> 01:05:01,322
Come, let's be off.

898
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:04,821
I think I'll go home.

899
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:08,728
Nonsense! Far too late to stay,
far too early to go.

900
01:05:09,165 --> 01:05:11,429
Come, I live just across the way.

901
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:13,232
Bring your glass.

902
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:16,400
As I say, it's a mere matter
of crossing the street.

903
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:18,700
And please don't concern
yourself about the bill,

904
01:05:18,808 --> 01:05:20,503
it's all taken care of.

905
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:22,804
I have got a permanent tab here.

906
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:44,358
I trust the incense
doesn't bother you.

907
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:47,893
My son simply can't live without it.

908
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:53,569
Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment,
I have to get dressed.

909
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:56,975
Actually I think I should be
on my way, but I can find...

910
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,275
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I won't hear of it.

911
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:02,116
Too late Herr Klimt,
too late.

912
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,090
Here is the little genius
of the family.

913
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:20,602
Thomas is a great admirer
of yours, Herr Klimt.

914
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:23,734
He's not wholly unlike you either.

915
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,172
For he too represents a certain
evolution in the artistic process.

916
01:06:28,678 --> 01:06:30,511
In just fifteen years

917
01:06:30,546 --> 01:06:34,949
he has gone from writing music
which was almost archaic...

918
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:37,450
To music of the utmost modernity.

919
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,112
Play us something, Thomas.

920
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,289
You see, what nowadays
we'd call early music...

921
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,829
And now... Thomas!

922
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,192
That'll do.

923
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,634
Now it's starts
to get really up to date.

924
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:06,237
And now total modernity.

925
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:15,357
In his most recent compositions,
he has actually gone beyond modernity.

926
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:16,949
Beyond everything.

927
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:19,856
Thereby coming full circle.

928
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:24,733
That'll be all for this evening.

929
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:37,611
I love you.

930
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:40,010
I love you to death.

931
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:50,755
Come... come...
come with me...

932
01:07:51,828 --> 01:07:54,126
Come... I love you...

933
01:08:02,939 --> 01:08:04,236
Over there.

934
01:08:09,445 --> 01:08:10,605
Yes.

935
01:09:39,902 --> 01:09:41,699
My name is Anna.

936
01:09:44,874 --> 01:09:46,136
Alright.

937
01:09:48,678 --> 01:09:50,805
Moritz, is he your husband?

938
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,446
Let's say he's my supplier.

939
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:54,840
I see.

940
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:57,351
Don't be too hard on him,
the poor thing.

941
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,911
And do you do this every night?

942
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:02,249
Yes, every night.

943
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:05,523
We were meant
to recreate your painting,

944
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:08,096
we weren't successful
so he's not happy.

945
01:10:08,464 --> 01:10:09,488
No.

946
01:10:23,546 --> 01:10:26,674
Where did you disappear to?
You scared me.

947
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:29,280
I'd forgotten I had
a rendezvous with a lady.

948
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,953
Ah, there she is.

949
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:37,149
She wanted to come.
Actually, so did I.

950
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,359
I wanted you to know.

951
01:10:39,996 --> 01:10:41,623
Mizzi, how are you?

952
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:45,163
- You know we're a couple.
- Congratulations.

953
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:47,265
See, I told you.

954
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:49,899
You are not angry?

955
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,230
No, why should I be angry?

956
01:10:59,115 --> 01:11:00,707
What's the matter with her?

957
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:03,477
Nothing.
She's always been like that.

958
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:19,397
There she is the mysterious lady.

959
01:11:21,037 --> 01:11:24,336
- The professor's wife.
- The professor's wife?

960
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:27,233
Thomas is the professor's wife!

961
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:31,103
Tubby little Mozart!

962
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:35,746
Then who is she?

963
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:37,107
A client.

964
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,810
There's a different one
every evening.

965
01:11:39,789 --> 01:11:40,983
You understand?

966
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,582
Yes.

967
01:11:55,605 --> 01:11:57,937
- It's wonderful.
- Isn't it.

968
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:02,343
We haven't yet got it right
but we're almost there.

969
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:04,647
The main problem is
finding the exact colouration

970
01:12:04,682 --> 01:12:07,377
that will help us
to detect the bacilli.

971
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:09,480
We'll get it eventually.

972
01:12:10,286 --> 01:12:13,187
It really is very beautiful.

973
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:15,780
Oh, it's better than that.
It's useful.

974
01:12:16,692 --> 01:12:18,091
Thank you, Rolf.

975
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:21,353
Come back in whenever you want,
I'm here every day.

976
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:23,798
Now...

977
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:28,293
There is something else...

978
01:12:29,038 --> 01:12:30,471
...I'd like to show you.

979
01:12:30,573 --> 01:12:31,972
Yes, please.

980
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:42,414
Herr Klimt.

981
01:12:44,687 --> 01:12:45,949
Herr Klimt.

982
01:12:48,724 --> 01:12:50,589
Herr Klimt.

983
01:12:57,133 --> 01:12:58,600
Times are hard.

984
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:27,424
Oh yes...

985
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,088
...It really is me.

986
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:34,433
I was just thinking how long it's been
since the last time we ran into each other.

987
01:13:36,272 --> 01:13:38,674
Well we're all extremely busy
at the moment.

988
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:40,767
Busy at the Ministry of Culture?

989
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:43,105
You do fuck all.

990
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:44,503
Well, there you're mistaken.

991
01:13:44,613 --> 01:13:47,309
At the moment our task is prevent
people from creating anything.

992
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:48,372
Which, believe me,

993
01:13:48,517 --> 01:13:51,247
takes a great deal more energy than
helping them create something.

994
01:13:51,387 --> 01:13:53,150
But why am I telling you all this?

995
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:56,713
I no longer work for the Ministry of Culture.
I work for the Ministry of Finance.

996
01:13:56,826 --> 01:13:57,793
Taxes you see.

997
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,420
And I should warn you they're beginning
to take an interest in you

998
01:14:00,529 --> 01:14:02,429
Tell me just out of curiosity.

999
01:14:02,498 --> 01:14:05,661
A painting, a portrait say,
how long does it take you?

1000
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:11,239
Are you checking on my finances?

1001
01:14:11,307 --> 01:14:13,241
Yes, I'm afraid I am - apologies.

1002
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:17,342
- Right here. Right now?
- Yes, again. Apologies, again.

1003
01:14:17,446 --> 01:14:20,483
Do you find it at all odd that we've
known each other all these years

1004
01:14:20,518 --> 01:14:22,348
and I still don't know your name?

1005
01:14:22,418 --> 01:14:24,579
Let's keep it that way
shall we for the moment?

1006
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:26,678
Still working for the Duke?

1007
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:27,911
The Duke?

1008
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:29,423
Mademoiselle De Castro's benefactor.

1009
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:31,858
Strange,
saw him just the other day.

1010
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:35,163
He asked me to pay him a visit.

1011
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:39,257
Since his accident he doesn't get
about as much as he used to.

1012
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:42,799
To tell you the truth he doesn't really
invite you, he summons you.

1013
01:14:42,905 --> 01:14:45,533
And what I discovered was
that it's you he's after.

1014
01:14:45,674 --> 01:14:47,574
He asked me to have a word
with you and...

1015
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:51,703
I was going to say 'invite',
summon you, to see him.

1016
01:14:51,814 --> 01:14:53,805
You won't even have
to make an appointment.

1017
01:14:53,916 --> 01:14:57,579
He never gets anywhere these days.
Here's his address.

1018
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:01,923
Now you must excuse me.

1019
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:11,357
Yes, yes, yes.

1020
01:15:18,674 --> 01:15:20,938
I've been watching you.

1021
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:22,775
Is everything alright?

1022
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:24,605
Yes, everything's fine.

1023
01:15:25,047 --> 01:15:26,708
You were talking to yourself.

1024
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:28,748
No, no, no I was...

1025
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:54,539
Oh, remember me? Paris!
Melies? I was you.

1026
01:16:02,418 --> 01:16:04,784
Herr Klimt,
they are waiting for you.

1027
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:42,984
Lea.

1028
01:16:46,896 --> 01:16:47,885
Lea.

1029
01:16:50,866 --> 01:16:52,458
Lea, where are you?

1030
01:16:55,437 --> 01:16:56,961
Lea, where are you?

1031
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:41,947
Who are you?

1032
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:47,318
You know it never
ceases to amuse me...

1033
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:52,349
...to see how easily people will
fall into my little traps.

1034
01:17:52,795 --> 01:17:57,027
Traps that are after all scarcely
what you would call Machiavellian.

1035
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,392
Or should the word be Mephistophelean?

1036
01:18:00,102 --> 01:18:01,694
Or even Angelic.

1037
01:18:03,038 --> 01:18:05,836
Which I have to say
would be my own word for it.

1038
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:11,074
Whichever, here you are.

1039
01:18:11,513 --> 01:18:14,277
You have fallen headlong
into my trap.

1040
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:17,981
It's a really rather simple, little trap.

1041
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,245
Especially for a man like you.

1042
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:24,791
A 'ladies man', so they say...

1043
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:30,422
If you knew how often I have been
asked that embarrassing question..

1044
01:18:30,566 --> 01:18:33,126
And I'm even tempted to
call it a stupid question.

1045
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:36,964
Except that that would be extremely
disobliging to you, would it not?

1046
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:41,641
But from what I hear, you're a rather
frank and forthright sort of fellow.

1047
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:44,940
Doesn't suffer fools gladly,
that sort of thing.

1048
01:18:45,014 --> 01:18:47,812
Which I have to say, is not at
all my first impression of you.

1049
01:18:51,053 --> 01:18:56,423
And when might all of
this have happened?

1050
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:00,556
How old is Lea?

1051
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:03,826
She's not old my friend, she's dead.

1052
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:05,861
Murdered.

1053
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:09,236
Murdered in her bed,
where else?

1054
01:19:09,405 --> 01:19:11,270
I need a glass of water.

1055
01:19:11,674 --> 01:19:14,074
There were even those
who said that I did it.

1056
01:19:14,777 --> 01:19:16,745
No one could prove a thing,
of course.

1057
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:19,643
I tell you, I wouldn't have minded
ending my days in a prison cell.

1058
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:22,548
It was you I was with a little
while ago wasn't it?

1059
01:19:28,624 --> 01:19:30,182
I don't know.

1060
01:19:32,061 --> 01:19:34,291
I really do believe
it was you I was with.

1061
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:44,062
Why does it surprise you,
my dear Herr Klimt...

1062
01:19:44,139 --> 01:19:46,630
that there should be
so many different Leas?

1063
01:19:48,544 --> 01:19:51,479
Why do you keep wondering
which is the real one?

1064
01:19:51,947 --> 01:19:54,541
You have doubles too, after all.

1065
01:19:56,952 --> 01:19:58,749
Are you the real Klimt?

1066
01:19:59,722 --> 01:20:01,883
Perhaps you're only the latest one.

1067
01:20:22,511 --> 01:20:23,671
That's it!

1068
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:37,150
Bad news from the front!

1069
01:20:38,794 --> 01:20:44,027
Bad news from the front!

1070
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:50,504
Good gracious! Can it really be?
Gustav Klimt?

1071
01:20:50,606 --> 01:20:51,834
Thank you.

1072
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,299
No. no.
There's no need to thank me.

1073
01:20:56,078 --> 01:20:57,545
I am honoured, Herr Klimt.

1074
01:20:57,846 --> 01:21:01,407
Really most honoured
to be of assistance to you.

1075
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:05,085
But I bet you don't remember me?

1076
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:06,476
No

1077
01:21:07,055 --> 01:21:09,683
Herr No. That's me!

1078
01:21:10,025 --> 01:21:14,121
Of course!
Herr Otto Messerschmitt von Ommit.

1079
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:17,996
Exactly so, dear sir.
Exactly so.

1080
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:21,197
Herr No.

1081
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:25,202
- Is there something I can do for you?
- No.

1082
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:29,566
Well, at least let's walk
a little way together.

1083
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:33,275
- Nothing broken, I trust?
- No.

1084
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:36,947
- Well, I'll see you home.
- No.

1085
01:21:39,254 --> 01:21:41,620
- I bet you despise me.
- No.

1086
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:45,548
No, no, no, no, no.
The correct answer is, yes.

1087
01:21:45,828 --> 01:21:48,695
They all despise me.
And they always have.

1088
01:21:48,831 --> 01:21:52,232
But there's absolutely nothing
I can do about it.

1089
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:55,801
I simply can't resist saying no.

1090
01:21:56,905 --> 01:22:00,898
As a matter of fact my entire
career has been built on this...

1091
01:22:01,043 --> 01:22:04,479
...natural tendency of mine to say, no.

1092
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:07,309
To every question I am ever asked.

1093
01:22:07,516 --> 01:22:11,282
And it's true you voted against me
for the School of Fine Arts?

1094
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,680
That's right.

1095
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:17,520
It was thanks to me
you were never appointed professor.

1096
01:22:17,759 --> 01:22:22,128
And you voted 'no' on every jury of
every competition I've ever entered?

1097
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:26,267
Exactly so.
Me and my notorious 'no'.

1098
01:22:27,202 --> 01:22:32,572
Nevertheless, you have to admit
that without me and my "no's"...

1099
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:38,412
Vienna would be now
be a graveyard of ugly monuments.

1100
01:22:38,714 --> 01:22:40,682
Ugly because they are beautiful.

1101
01:22:40,849 --> 01:22:46,344
For too much beauty in my view
is far worse than too little.

1102
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:51,223
No, we simply don't have
the space for so much beauty.

1103
01:22:52,194 --> 01:22:56,893
The old would have
to be endlessly demolished...

1104
01:22:57,165 --> 01:22:59,599
to make room for the new.

1105
01:23:06,308 --> 01:23:09,869
I proudly present Marco Polo.

1106
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:17,184
My next song is
dedicated to someone

1107
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:22,316
who happens to be listening
to us at this very moment!

1108
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:25,960
To a great artist!

1109
01:23:26,695 --> 01:23:32,156
Goodbye my little guardsman...

1110
01:23:32,234 --> 01:23:38,605
Goodbye, may good fortune
be with you...

1111
01:23:57,859 --> 01:23:59,258
It's all over.

1112
01:24:01,563 --> 01:24:02,860
All over?

1113
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:05,727
Ave Maria...

1114
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,695
Pray for us

1115
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,960
Grieving Mother

1116
01:24:10,072 --> 01:24:12,267
- Flowers.
- Pray for us

1117
01:24:13,008 --> 01:24:17,138
Pray for us from heaven...

1118
01:24:30,826 --> 01:24:33,989
Death is all around us.

1119
01:26:02,551 --> 01:26:04,143
How terrible.

1120
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:07,315
Isn't it a shame
about the weather, Gustav?

1121
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:09,455
Yes, it is.

1122
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:15,152
And I was planning a costume
fitting for the fancy dress ball.

1123
01:26:15,263 --> 01:26:18,630
Look, I have found this.

1124
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:20,864
Isn't it beautiful?

1125
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:22,402
But because of the weather

1126
01:26:22,437 --> 01:26:27,397
they have decided
to cancel the Primavesi masquerade ball.

1127
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:31,737
Midi?

1128
01:26:33,348 --> 01:26:34,872
What time is it?

1129
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:36,841
Late, I'm sure.

1130
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:47,217
Poor Gustav, he doesn't know
where he is. He's lost.

1131
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,330
Yes, she's here. It's my surprise.

1132
01:26:53,768 --> 01:26:55,258
Lea is here...

1133
01:26:56,972 --> 01:26:59,770
- The real Lea.
- I don't think we ever met...

1134
01:27:01,243 --> 01:27:02,335
Did we?

1135
01:27:04,212 --> 01:27:05,611
I don't know.

1136
01:27:07,382 --> 01:27:09,111
Poor Klimt,

1137
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:12,510
he doesn't know where he is.

1138
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,455
He's lost.

1139
01:27:19,427 --> 01:27:21,554
You are not going to kiss her?

1140
01:27:22,464 --> 01:27:25,763
She's come from far away
to bid you 'adieu'.

1141
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:39,580
There you are, at last.

1142
01:27:39,648 --> 01:27:42,082
- I'm so pleased to see you again.
- And you.

1143
01:27:42,184 --> 01:27:44,209
It's so much nicer here,
don't you agree?

1144
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:46,512
I'm trying to find the way out.

1145
01:27:46,922 --> 01:27:47,889
It's that way.

1146
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:51,720
Just turn left, then left again,
keep turning left...

1147
01:27:51,826 --> 01:27:55,819
Left, left, left... and then
hey presto, you're there.

1148
01:28:05,106 --> 01:28:06,506
Who are you?

1149
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:10,910
My name is Sylvia.
I am lost, just like you.

1150
01:28:11,513 --> 01:28:13,310
Do you like to get lost?

1151
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:19,013
Just like you.
Everyone's looking for me, just like you.

1152
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,317
Come on, it's this way.

1153
01:28:21,656 --> 01:28:23,521
We've got to hide.

1154
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,198
Were you talking to yourself?

1155
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:37,261
No. I was talking to him.

1156
01:28:38,807 --> 01:28:40,069
To a corpse?

1157
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:42,942
And what were
you two talking about?

1158
01:28:44,846 --> 01:28:46,074
Flowers.

1159
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:50,716
<i>'Who art thou?'
asked the guardian of the Night...</i>

1160
01:28:51,686 --> 01:28:54,678
<i>'From crystal purity I come'
was my reply...</i>

1161
01:28:54,889 --> 01:28:57,449
<i>'And great my thirst Persephone...</i>

1162
01:28:58,026 --> 01:29:02,019
<i>Yet heeding thy decree
I take to flight and turn...</i>

1163
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,428
<i>and turn again forever right.</i>

1164
01:29:05,867 --> 01:29:07,892
<i>I spurn the pallid cypress tree.</i>

1165
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:11,097
<i>Seek no refreshment
at it's Sylvan spring...</i>

1166
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,776
<i>But hasten on towards
the rustling River of Mnemosyne.</i>

1167
01:29:16,678 --> 01:29:19,647
<i>Wherin I drink to sweet Satiety.</i>

1168
01:29:20,615 --> 01:29:25,848
<i>And there, dipping my palms between
the knots and loopings of its mazy stream</i>

1169
01:29:26,588 --> 01:29:30,285
<i>I see again as in a drowning
swimmers dream...</i>

1170
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,526
<i>All the strange sights I ever saw...</i>

1171
01:29:33,895 --> 01:29:37,592
<i>And even stranger sights
no man has ever seen.</i>
