1
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,450
What?!

2
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,387
Hi... I called about
the apartment.

3
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,323
Shit.

4
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,391
I forgot.

5
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,693
Shit, hang on.

6
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,845
Come on in!

7
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,888
You know I'm just showing
the apartment, right?

8
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,756
Yeah, I just got here.

9
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,292
Great.

10
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,462
Bathroom; kitchen;

11
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,196
living room;

12
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,164
my room;

13
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,465
empty room.

14
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,803
Sorry about that.

15
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,339
I'm Lana!

16
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,641
Kate.

17
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:56,909
It's nice.

18
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,577
Yeah, um...

19
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,846
so, I don't need any references

20
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,414
and I won't run a credit check.

21
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,376
That's what you
said on the phone.

22
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,852
So here's the room.

23
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,424
I used to use it
as an office but...

24
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,332
so you said you
just moved to the city?

25
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,366
Yeah.

26
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,267
From where?

27
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,669
Utah.

28
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,438
So do you have a job or what?

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,740
No, but I'll find one.

30
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,275
And I can pay
the security deposit

31
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,377
and the first month's
rent in cash.

32
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,880
Are you a serial killer?

33
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,615
No.

34
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,538
That's been happening a lot.

35
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,823
I have NO idea what
they're doing up there.

36
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,232
Okay.

37
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,235
Okay what?

38
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,805
Do you want the room?

39
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,008
Are you a serial killer?

40
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,877
Look, my ex-boyfriend
just moved out

41
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,412
and Friday's the first
of the month

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,780
and the woman who came
to look at the room

43
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,315
yesterday had a ferret
who took a shit

44
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,818
on my couch so...

45
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,720
if you want the room,
it's yours.

46
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:22,961
Whatever.

47
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,496
Uh, yeah.

48
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,564
Great.

49
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,672
Okay.

50
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,008
You probably shouldn't
be carrying around

51
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,477
this much cash in New York.

52
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,912
I'm really excited
to live in Brooklyn.

53
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,764
You know this
is south Brooklyn,

54
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,615
it's not like Williamsburg
or, whatever.

55
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,519
I've wanted to
live here my whole life.

56
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,055
So, are you an actress?

57
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,025
No.

58
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,495
Yeah... uh...

59
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,613
make yourself at home.

60
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:58,730
I'll be in my room
if you need anything.

61
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,065
Okay.

62
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,539
Good morning.

63
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,815
Do you not work?

64
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,684
No.

65
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,121
Oh.

66
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,807
You didn't say
you were a smoker.

67
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,010
I'm not.

68
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,702
Excuse me?

69
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,272
Uh... I wanted to interview
for the waitressing job?

70
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,878
Thanks.

71
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,852
Are you the owner?

72
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,954
No.

73
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,691
Hey gorgeous,
sorry to keep you waiting,

74
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,126
it'll just be two more seconds.

75
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,195
Oh, no, Tommy, take your time.

76
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,630
Seriously.

77
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,632
Okay.

78
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,699
Hey.

79
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,072
Do you think it's going
to be a really big problem

80
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,241
that I don't have any
waitressing experience?

81
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,080
Nice dress.

82
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,216
Thank you.

83
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,923
Where are you from?

84
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,858
Uh, Utah.

85
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,660
Utah?

86
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,628
Wow.

87
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,603
Your shoes are amazing.

88
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,905
Aww! Thank you!

89
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:46,985
Good luck with the job.

90
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,792
Hey Utah?

91
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,596
How long have
you been in the city?

92
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,765
Five days.

93
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,700
Wow.

94
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:10,075
Well, a bunch of us
are going to be

95
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,744
hanging out on the
lower east side tonight.

96
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,354
Maybe I can introduce
you to some people.

97
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,723
Great!

98
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,957
Natasha.

99
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,726
Come into my office,
young lady.

100
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,893
Ten o'clock.

101
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,028
Text me.

102
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,754
Oh, uh, Kate?

103
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,155
No, I'm Lana.

104
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,223
I just moved in.

105
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,826
Oh, I am Joe, the super.

106
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,228
Hi.

107
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,798
I'm so, so, so sorry.

108
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,366
Could you turn down the music?

109
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,167
Oh, yeah.

110
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,269
It's uh... yes.

111
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,303
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,672
Somebody call.

113
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,939
Yes, I'm sorry.

114
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,742
No problem, just somebody call.

115
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,312
Okay... thanks. >> Geoff here?

116
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,682
No?

117
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,283
He moved out.

118
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,118
They get married?

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,186
No?

120
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,088
I don't think so.

121
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,258
Oh, she have baby?

122
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,825
No?

123
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,293
No.

124
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,430
Oh... okay.

125
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,230
Turn it down.

126
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,899
Okay, thanks.

127
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,743
Kate?

128
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,483
Kate?

129
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,058
Can you turn down the music?

130
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,194
The super came;
somebody complained.

131
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,090
Hi Natasha?

132
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,992
It's Lana.

133
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,529
We met at the
restaurant earlier?

134
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,066
I'm at the address you gave me.

135
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,869
Uh... so call me!

136
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,537
Okay, bye.

137
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,340
Hey?

138
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,108
Club's there.

139
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,778
Oh, okay.

140
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,251
Oh, Natasha!

141
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:08,853
Hey!

142
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,121
It's Lana!

143
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,557
Lana, hi!

144
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,425
Hi! It's good to see you!

145
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,960
Are you okay?

146
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,062
Yeah, no, I'm fine,
it's just fucking Tommy

147
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,931
bailed on me, asshole.

148
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,334
Oh... um, this
place looks cool.

149
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,236
Yeah, it's amazing, right?

150
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,471
I thought you
said ten o'clock...

151
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,856
So how are you?

152
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,240
Did you meet anyone
in New York yet?

153
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,059
Oh, no.

154
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,877
Um... I thought you
were going to introduce me.

155
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,999
He looks like he
wants to get to know you.

156
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,348
Oh, yeah.

157
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,550
We're on the list.

158
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,359
Hey.

159
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,228
NATASHA: Hey.

160
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,462
How's it going?

161
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,497
We're going in here.

162
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,364
DJ's lame.

163
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,866
We're headed out.

164
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh yeah?

165
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,403
Where you headed?

166
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,197
Hey guys,

167
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:10,014
I'll catch ya later.

168
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,282
Yeah, have fun.

169
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,251
Why don't you get us a cab?

170
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,988
Wait a minute,
I thought that we were...

171
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,091
You look so hot.

172
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,626
I'll call you!

173
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,007
That's a beautiful dress.

174
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,117
We could go back to my place.

175
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,487
Yeah... uh...

176
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,137
Hot.

177
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,416
What's the matter
with your mouth?

178
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,967
I just get jaw tension.

179
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,037
You should relax.

180
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,976
Rough night?

181
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,249
Are you alright?

182
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,518
What?

183
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,354
It's 7am.

184
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,526
I have job interviews
all day but I'm going

185
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,128
to be home tonight.

186
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,333
Just so you know.

187
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,564
Hi Natasha, it's Lana.

188
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,801
I just wanted to make sure we
got home alright last night.

189
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,570
I would love if we
could hang out sometime.

190
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,272
Okay. Uh, call me.

191
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,473
Bye.

192
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,149
Kate?

193
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,351
<i>Yeah?</i>

194
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,788
Would you move your
stuff out of the kitchen?

195
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,093
I need to make dinner.

196
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,296
<i>Just give me like...</i>
<i>twenty minutes.</i>

197
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,198
Could you do it now?

198
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm really hungry.

199
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,405
>><i> Hello, Mom?</i>

200
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,341
<i>Hello?</i>

201
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,675
<i>Oh my God.</i>

202
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,743
<i>Mom!</i>

203
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,178
<i>Momma!</i>

204
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,613
<i>No!</i>

205
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,348
<i>Momma!</i>

206
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,616
<i>Oh my God!</i>

207
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,184
<i>What did you do?!</i>

208
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,453
<i>Mom!</i>

209
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,913
Hello?

210
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,414
<i>Lana?</i>

211
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,448
Natasha?

212
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,202
Are you okay?

213
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,886
<i>No, they took my purse,</i>
<i>and I can't find my keys!</i>

214
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,955
<i>I don't know where I am!</i>

215
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,456
Why don't you come over?

216
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,458
<i>I don't know where you live!</i>

217
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,493
Yeah, no, no,

218
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,828
I'll text you the address.

219
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,210
NATASHA:  Hey...

220
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,879
LANA: Hi.

221
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,781
I thought they took
my purse but...

222
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,317
then I found it again!

223
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,751
Come on in.

224
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,789
Sorry.

225
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,324
It's okay.

226
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,532
I'm so sorry for
coming over like this.

227
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,167
Oh!

228
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,801
It's just, I don't think
that I have my keys.

229
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,504
Hey, what are friends for!

230
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,576
Oh God. God!

231
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,411
What is that awful music?

232
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,880
Oh, um...

233
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,528
I'm sorry, I...

234
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,464
I took some Molly.

235
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,804
I feel like shit.

236
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,789
It's okay.

237
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,925
I'll take care of you.

238
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,697
Let me get you some water.

239
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,460
Can I use your bathroom?

240
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,996
LANA: Oh yeah,
it's the door on the left.

241
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,133
Oh, no, no, no,

242
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,134
it's not that one!

243
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,744
Holy shit, man,
are you burning yourself?

244
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,741
Who the hell are you?

245
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:37,755
Who the hell are you?!

246
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:38,956
She's my friend.

247
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,025
Nice!

248
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,093
You need to get her
the hell out

249
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:42,960
of my apartment!

250
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,429
It's my apartment too.

251
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:46,897
Hey, what's your name?

252
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,599
Natasha.

253
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,369
Hey, Natasha,
get out of my apartment!

254
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,673
What kind of psycho
tries to burn them self?

255
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,742
Get out!

256
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,076
NATASHA: Shit.

257
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,411
She's clearly really fucked up.

258
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,046
You can't say that!

259
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,882
Chill out!

260
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm so, so, sorry about this.

261
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,002
I got her in a cab.

262
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,139
Thanks.

263
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:31,542
You have awesome
taste in friends.

264
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,780
Just throw them out,
they're really shitty anyway.

265
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,016
I saw the razor.

266
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,022
Look, you don't
want to get into this.

267
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,459
I lost my mom.

268
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,961
Right before I moved
to New York.

269
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,531
She killed herself.

270
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:49,553
I have another job interview
today but I'll see you tonight?

271
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,991
Okay.

272
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,138
I got a job.

273
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,975
At a chocolate restaurant.

274
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,215
Yay!

275
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,654
Let's get you into bed.

276
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:20,404
You scared me!

277
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,006
You cook.

278
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,941
Yeah.

279
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,042
Do you?

280
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,076
No...

281
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,313
Geoff, my ex, did.

282
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,416
He was a really good cook.

283
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:41,925
Did you, uh... put me in bed?

284
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,198
That's embarrassing.

285
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,901
It's fine.

286
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,336
I saw your photos.

287
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,705
You're very talented.

288
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,940
Please stay out of my room.

289
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,878
I was putting in bed.

290
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,451
Do you still take pictures?

291
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,119
No.

292
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,288
Why not?

293
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,690
I don't think my
camera still works...

294
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,925
I don't even know where it is.

295
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,996
You mostly paint now?

296
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,265
Oh... no.

297
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,066
I'm not a painter.

298
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,701
That was me just...

299
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,369
wigging out.

300
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,771
Those deserved to be
thrown up on.

301
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,208
I really can't even say
how sorry I am about that.

302
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,013
They were terrible.

303
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,849
You're a better photographer.

304
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,488
You should have some of this!

305
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,940
No.

306
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,391
Mop up that alcohol?

307
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,035
What do you do now?

308
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,240
Um... I'm a financial
consultant.

309
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,843
Or... was.

310
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,277
It's complicated.

311
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,414
I've always wanted
to have my picture taken.

312
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,983
What do you...

313
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,517
No, I mean, for real.

314
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,821
Okay...

315
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,024
I think that when
you see a photo of someone,

316
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,945
you can kind of tell
who they are.

317
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:27,231
So, why do you need
a photo of yourself?

318
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,410
Oh my God.

319
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,252
I've been living off ramen and
takeout since Geoff left.

320
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,058
Mmm...

321
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,029
Mmm... thank you.

322
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,662
MAN: You can't just stay home
for the rest of your life!

323
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,571
Kate?

324
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,075
Your mom won't stop
calling me because

325
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,343
you won't even
return her phone calls.

326
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,378
Why is she calling you?

327
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,580
That's not the point!

328
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,485
I think maybe
it will be a good idea

329
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,987
for you to talk to someone.

330
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,655
Oh, who... someone?

331
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,023
You... someone?

332
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,124
No, like...

333
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,326
Just because I don't

334
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,593
want to be with you
doesn't mean

335
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,095
I need to see a shrink.

336
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,663
I love you.

337
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,098
We can still be a family.

338
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,533
Okay!

339
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,568
I just want you to be okay.

340
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,205
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

341
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,073
You must be?

342
00:32:56,075 --> 00:33:01,044
Lana, we met before.

343
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,312
Can we just talk about this?

344
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,394
I don't know what else
there is to say.

345
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,066
Fine.

346
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,628
Look, just call me
if you need anything.

347
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,353
Enjoy the croissant.

348
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,654
It was nice to meet you.

349
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,295
He seems nice.

350
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:19,763
You want a croissant?

351
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,779
What are you doing up there?!

352
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,352
Maybe I do need therapy.

353
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,653
Therapy's where people
send you when they

354
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,189
can't be bothered
to help you themselves.

355
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,794
Who said that?

356
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,230
No one.

357
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,036
You know he's
actually really great.

358
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,507
He's really fucking nice to me.

359
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,210
I'm supposed to be
going to work but...

360
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,378
I can call out.

361
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,047
No... don't do that.

362
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,009
It's not your job
to take care of me.

363
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,492
I'm really sorry
about your mom.

364
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:32,836
That must have
been really shitty.

365
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,540
Hang on.

366
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,290
There wasn't really
anything wrong with it

367
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,524
but they did clean
up the lens a little bit.

368
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,326
What?!

369
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,952
What is all this?

370
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:08,073
It's just a couple
of things I picked up.

371
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,140
They're for you.

372
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,581
Lana, this is way too much.

373
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,449
I have a job now.

374
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,451
Yeah, as a hostess.

375
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,587
I make good tips.

376
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,661
You don't have to use them.

377
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:36,266
No, no, thank you... very much.

378
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:43,340
I was... that was really
sweet of you.

379
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,512
You're my first friend
in New York.

380
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,414
Are we friends?

381
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,817
Sorry!

382
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:57,621
I'm sorry.

383
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,394
Let's go on an adventure.

384
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,563
Where?

385
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,198
Bring your camera.

386
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,513
You always wear that scarf.

387
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,519
My mom used to
have one just like it.

388
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,625
Do you mind
if I ask what happened?

389
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,299
You don't have to...

390
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,701
It's fine.

391
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,207
Um...

392
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:58,215
I came home one day
and the house was quiet.

393
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,716
It was weirdly quiet.

394
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,219
And...

395
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:06,723
when I got to
the living room...

396
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,825
she was there.

397
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,728
You found her?

398
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,435
How did she...?

399
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,340
She slit her wrists.

400
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,516
Do you miss her?

401
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,454
All the time.

402
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,826
Who keeps calling you?

403
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,398
Someone I don't
want to talk to.

404
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,634
From home?

405
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,276
My mom.

406
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,946
You don't like your mom?

407
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,982
Uh, she made me
grow up in New Jersey.

408
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,524
Let's go get drunk.

409
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,927
No.

410
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:21,765
Don't you want
to experience reality?

411
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,367
Not really.

412
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,060
This is my favourite place
in the whole world.

413
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,637
You're a really nice person.

414
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,808
You don't meet too many
of those in New York.

415
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,713
I think you're nice too.

416
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,681
Yeah...

417
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,731
You must be the new guy.

418
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,667
The one we always hear
banging around up there?

419
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,434
What?

420
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,002
We're 2B?

421
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,604
Oh!

422
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:35,538
Sorry.

423
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,740
I'm Massi.

424
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,074
Kate.

425
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,543
This is my room-mate, Lana.

426
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:43,480
Do they only let beautiful
people live in 2B?

427
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,750
Yeah, there's a
clause in the lease.

428
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,153
Well, if you ever
need a cup of sugar,

429
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,988
you know where to find me.

430
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:04,968
Do you want some tea?

431
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,703
Thank you.

432
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:21,518
You photograph very well.

433
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,852
You're very pretty.

434
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,156
Thanks.

435
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,695
They're very beautiful.

436
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,932
That should be your job.

437
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,450
How far along were you?

438
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,889
You were gonna
have a baby, right?

439
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,158
How did you...?

440
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,461
The super said something.

441
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,032
Um...

442
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,504
Five months.

443
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,610
What happened?

444
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:26,015
Um... I...

445
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,953
I started bleeding, um,
a little bit.

446
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:37,955
And then I started
bleeding a lot and...

447
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,698
then, by the time

448
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,099
we got to the doctor's
the next morning,

449
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:48,271
there was no heartbeat and...

450
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:56,273
and... then they had
to take it out.

451
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,117
I'm so sorry.

452
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,652
Shit happens.

453
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:09,259
Were you trying?

454
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:13,029
No... no.

455
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:19,536
You guys were gonna
get married?

456
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,274
Yeah.

457
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,813
Why didn't you?

458
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,650
What is this, 20 questions?

459
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,621
I don't know.

460
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,157
He got sad.

461
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,726
I got mean.

462
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:45,929
I wouldn't have sex
with him anymore

463
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:49,632
and it just kind of...

464
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,768
exploded.

465
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,841
Fuck him, you know.

466
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,915
It's okay, it's okay...

467
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,250
it's okay, it's okay.

468
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,153
I'm sorry. >> It's okay.

469
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:11,821
It's okay.

470
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:33,876
It's okay... it's fine.

471
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:38,147
Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

472
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,884
It's okay. It's okay.

473
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,437
I couldn't remember if
you liked your eggs

474
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,806
totally cooked,
or a little runny.

475
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,114
You're all dressed up?

476
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,316
Where are you going?

477
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,054
Back to work!

478
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:52,455
Oh!

479
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:56,325
Yeah, I emailed my
boss two days ago

480
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:58,361
and he's letting me come back.

481
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,031
Oh, thank you!

482
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,583
I thought you
were going to think

483
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:04,700
about going back
to photography?

484
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,136
Oh my God.

485
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,898
That doesn't pay the rent.

486
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,142
But you hated that job.

487
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,814
Um, are you working
at the restaurant tonight?

488
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,282
No.

489
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:23,786
Shall I come meet
you after work?

490
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,456
I might be late.

491
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,962
Why don't I bring home
dinner to celebrate?

492
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,363
Great.

493
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,200
No, no, I'll do it.

494
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,069
Thank you.

495
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,442
Okay!

496
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:47,744
Bye.

497
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,212
Bye!

498
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,550
Get your shoes!

499
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,578
MASSI: Hello.

500
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:39,488
How'd it go?

501
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,225
It was boring.

502
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,594
I brought home dinner.

503
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:50,466
I liked him first.

504
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,152
I'm so sorry.

505
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,190
I was joking!

506
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:16,259
God, why would I do that?

507
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:17,627
Have you seen him?

508
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,994
I think a lot of people would.

509
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:22,164
You liked him
and I slept with him.

510
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,667
I met him once in the hallway.

511
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:29,438
I can move out if you want.

512
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,373
Why would I want
you to move out

513
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,109
because of some guy?

514
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,479
You're not moving out!

515
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,150
Are you sure?

516
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,152
Yes!

517
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,188
I don't have to see him again.

518
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,690
See him again!

519
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,375
I mean, I'm not going
to be responsible

520
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,059
for fucking up your
relationship too.

521
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,200
He's nice.

522
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:02,638
He has his own wine company.

523
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,942
A hot foreign guy
with his own wine company.

524
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:08,144
I mean, he sounds made up.

525
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:13,349
Now this sauce is
almost perfect.

526
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:16,419
We have the garlic,
the tomatoes,

527
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,120
the onions.

528
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,422
I forgot the cheese!

529
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:22,291
Okay, add a little cheese.

530
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,592
Sprinkle.

531
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,197
Hey!

532
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,198
Hi!

533
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,566
Smells great.

534
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,174
Mmm...

535
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,376
Mmm... mmm...

536
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:49,218
LANA: Come eat!

537
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,620
KATE: I'm fine.

538
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,391
Have a good night.

539
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,129
Hey!

540
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,071
I didn't mean to make you sad.

541
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:13,709
I know, it's just,
Geoff and...

542
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,045
I can stop if it's too much.

543
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:20,216
No, no, no,
it's just me being dumb.

544
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,053
Can we hangout tomorrow?

545
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:24,653
Yeah.

546
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,288
Good.

547
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,037
Oh!

548
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,139
You crazy girl!

549
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:51,580
That's a good thing,
like nobody else.

550
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,793
Why is everyone I work
with such a douchebag?

551
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,795
It just makes me want
to punch everyone

552
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,230
in the face all the time.

553
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,498
I wish you'd stop smoking.

554
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,382
I'm not smoking,

555
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,265
I'm quitting.

556
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,503
Don't be mad.

557
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:48,871
I called him.

558
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,039
What?!

559
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,206
I got his number
off your phone,

560
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:52,108
I'm sorry,

561
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,576
I called him.

562
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,578
Why would...

563
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,846
Come on.

564
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:08,524
Come on in!

565
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:19,135
I can't be everything
for you, Katie.

566
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,669
Lana...

567
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,639
I don't want you to be sad
about me and Massi.

568
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,874
You love him!

569
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,811
Do you still love her?

570
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,913
Yeah.

571
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:35,251
Well then you have to try!

572
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:37,553
Can you believe her?

573
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:43,259
Just talk about it.

574
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:50,199
We're having a picnic
on Saturday...

575
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,734
you should come.

576
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,221
Why did you leave Argentina?

577
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,230
Things were messy there.

578
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:29,471
What are you thinking
so hard about?

579
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,944
Do you miss your family?

580
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,615
Sometimes.

581
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,753
I've got you now.

582
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,495
Move in with me.

583
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,832
With you?

584
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,501
And Kate?

585
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:02,438
And leave that whole two-bedroom
that I have all to myself?

586
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,376
Let's not mess this up.

587
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,313
I like being around you.

588
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:35,704
Bye.

589
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:46,915
Where's Geoff?

590
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,751
He left.

591
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,324
You shouldn't have called him.

592
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,727
Why not?

593
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,697
It's none of your business.

594
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:05,801
It's some of my business,
you're my friend.

595
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:09,038
You deal with your shit;
I'll deal with mine.

596
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,708
Yeah, that was going
so well for you before.

597
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,615
I'm just trying to help.

598
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,389
He's coming on Saturday.

599
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:47,009
GEOFF: So, do you bottle
the wine yourself, or?

600
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,545
No, we just import it.

601
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:51,947
Wow, that's really cool.

602
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:54,049
It's something to do.

603
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:57,820
Can I have a grape?

604
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,421
KATE: Geoff is a great
graphic designer.

605
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:00,889
Oh yeah?

606
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:02,524
Not really...

607
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,127
I work at a coffee bar
in Williamsburg.

608
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,696
He's good... that's how we met.

609
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,866
Freshman year art class.

610
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:14,503
Yeah, okay, don't
get all sentimental on me.

611
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,606
Katie's an amazing
photographer.

612
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,575
She is!

613
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,817
I guess we're the only
ones without any talent.

614
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:31,553
This may be the best
day of my whole life.

615
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,689
KATE: Of your whole life?

616
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:35,391
Uh-huh.

617
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:35,684
Sorry.

618
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,500
Will you just come here?

619
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,874
I'm not having sex with you.

620
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,710
I know, will you come here?

621
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,966
Could you at least try?

622
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:32,908
There. Happy?

623
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,810
No.

624
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:38,914
What do you want from me?

625
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,684
Just talk to me about it.

626
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,986
Why?

627
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,721
Maybe it will help!

628
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:46,889
Is it going to change
what happened?

629
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:49,658
No!

630
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:53,195
I'm sad too.

631
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:58,700
You keep saying that
like I don't know that.

632
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,602
I know you're sad.

633
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,204
It was awful.

634
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,206
But you gotta get over it.

635
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,874
You get over it!

636
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,876
I'm trying!

637
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:09,378
We could have another one!

638
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,679
I don't want another one!

639
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:13,315
Geoff, do you want to know
what I felt like when I lost it?

640
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:14,816
Our daughter?

641
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,920
I felt relieved, Geoff!

642
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:20,989
I felt relieved that it
wasn't going to be born

643
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:23,625
and mess up my life!

644
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,763
I have to go.

645
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,065
See you later.

646
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,859
What is wrong with me?!

647
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,829
It is going to get better.

648
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,365
I mean, I thought
I was getting better!

649
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,644
I can't have sex with
my own boyfriend.

650
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,763
He understands.

651
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:20,164
Yeah, well, he's only going
to understand for so long.

652
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:25,921
I thought...

653
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,825
I thought maybe it
could work again,

654
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,960
but I don't know.

655
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,165
I'll see you later.

656
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,650
Let me come with you.

657
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:40,812
No, I just need to be
by myself right now.

658
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,896
Where's Kate?

659
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,065
She went for a walk.

660
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:15,904
Rough day, huh?

661
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,974
Yeah, we've been
having a lot of those.

662
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,711
Do you want some wine?

663
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,179
What ya got?

664
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,715
Mmmm, well, I have Massi's.

665
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,350
I cannot pronounce it

666
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,085
but I'm sure it's amazing.

667
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,094
She hates me.

668
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,232
I don't think she
meant what she said.

669
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:47,469
I think she probably did.

670
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:51,273
We would have been
shitty parents.

671
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,875
You would have loved her.

672
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,579
You probably think
I'm a total loser,

673
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,747
hanging around with this girl
who doesn't want me anymore.

674
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,050
She still wants you.

675
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:03,318
No wonder she was relieved,

676
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,254
she got out of marrying me!

677
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,189
Look at me, I've never really
tried to do anything

678
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:12,127
and I'm pretty sure
I'm going bald.

679
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:14,763
>> I think you're pretty great.

680
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,728
You're just saying that
because you know I'm right.

681
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,173
She says she's going to her
parents' in New Jersey

682
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,842
for the night.

683
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:27,626
Awesome!

684
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:28,409
She'd rather spend
the night in Jersey

685
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,292
than with me.

686
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,483
I guess I'll go.

687
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,529
I rented Sharktopus.

688
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:48,363
Kate and I were going

689
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,132
to watch it but...

690
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:52,467
if you're interested?

691
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:58,840
Bad movies pair very well
with expensive wine.

692
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:08,350
That was awful.

693
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,485
I don't even know
what just happened.

694
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:14,856
God I get so hot
in this apartment.

695
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:17,159
Yeah I know,
I used to live here.

696
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,795
Oh. Duh.

697
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:30,872
So how's this city
working out for you?

698
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:32,941
I love it.

699
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,911
Good.

700
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:47,055
She still doesn't
want to have sex.

701
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:50,025
I know.

702
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,593
Sorry. Shit.

703
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:54,062
You don't want to
hear about this.

704
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:56,431
It's fine.

705
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,166
It's not even about the sex...

706
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,235
it's just...

707
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:02,688
I just want...

708
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:05,140
I just want her to
like me again.

709
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:13,849
Did Kate tell you what
happened to my mom?

710
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:14,850
Yeah.

711
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,219
I'm really sorry about that.

712
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,959
Do you think
I'm beautiful, Geoff?

713
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,434
Yeah.

714
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:36,571
You don't have to lie about it.

715
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:39,507
No, I do.

716
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,109
I do.

717
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,082
You could have me
while you wait for her.

718
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:51,653
What?

719
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,121
While you're waiting
for her to get better,

720
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,923
you could have me.

721
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,495
Lana...

722
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:03,598
No, look...

723
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:09,371
she loves you!

724
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:12,173
I don't want her to lose you!

725
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:16,544
So just take me
while you wait for her.

726
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:17,679
Lana, what...

727
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,947
You don't want me?

728
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,516
No, no... it's...

729
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:22,317
I'm not sure.

730
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,519
Imagine I'm her.

731
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,102
How long has it been?

732
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,508
What about Massi?

733
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,610
We're a family.

734
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,111
Families do whatever
they have to

735
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,580
to take care of each other.

736
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,392
Just imagine I'm her.

737
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:09,431
Call me Katie.

738
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:13,501
Katie...

739
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,191
Good morning.

740
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:46,267
You waited.

741
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,536
That's really nice.

742
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:56,644
I'm sorry.

743
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,048
Me too.

744
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,220
Do you hate me?

745
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:07,622
No.

746
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,258
We'll figure it out.

747
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,795
I'm sorry I've been
such an asshole.

748
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,096
It's okay.

749
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,098
You were always
pretty much an asshole.

750
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:25,273
I love you.

751
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,677
I love you too.

752
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,691
I gotta get to work.

753
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,327
I just wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

754
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,751
Katie?

755
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,753
It's all gonna be okay.

756
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:45,253
Hello?

757
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:50,492
Hey, can I come up?

758
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:53,328
Kate won't be home until seven.

759
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,130
Yeah, I know.

760
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:12,847
Hi, can I come in?

761
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:34,936
I just want you to know
I've never cheated

762
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:36,905
on anyone before.

763
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,841
I'm not the kind of guy
who does that.

764
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,442
I know.

765
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,787
Is this okay?

766
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,061
We're going to have to
tell Katie, you know.

767
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,972
It'll be okay.

768
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,353
Buh buh buh buh buh bah!

769
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,922
Happy birthday!

770
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:31,960
Oh my God.

771
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:33,461
No one has made me
a birthday cake

772
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:35,697
since I was like 15.

773
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,004
Yay!

774
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:44,606
Nice job!

775
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:47,809
Okay, I have an
announcement to make!

776
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,313
Let's have a toast.

777
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,820
So... when I moved to New York,

778
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:03,758
I had just lost my mom
and I was really sad and lonely

779
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,695
and then I met Katie
and she was evil.

780
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,300
And she was nice.

781
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:15,536
And now I'm not sad
and I'm not lonely.

782
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,273
LANA: It's true.

783
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,375
But, I know that
there's been one thing

784
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,278
that's been really hard for you.

785
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,115
And I know it's been
hurting you a lot

786
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,951
so... Geoff and I have
started sleeping together.

787
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:39,294
I don't mind, and this way,

788
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:41,929
you can take as much
time as you need.

789
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,639
What are you talking about?

790
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,641
Katie...

791
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,883
I mean, I know it's a bit
of a surprise but...

792
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,930
Are you serious?

793
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:00,848
You're sleeping with him?

794
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,818
Only until Katie gets better.

795
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,826
For how long?

796
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,895
About a week.

797
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:17,365
MASSI: A week.

798
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,504
Massi!

799
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:24,939
GEOFF: I thought you knew!

800
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,574
You thought I knew?

801
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,110
You were sleeping
with my girlfriend!

802
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:30,945
And I just didn't care?!

803
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,784
How many times?

804
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,655
Answer me... how many times?!

805
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,790
LARA: Stop it!

806
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,924
That is no way to behave!

807
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,362
I think you should go!

808
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,536
You're just going to sit there?

809
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:13,821
It doesn't mean anything.

810
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:15,857
He's your boyfriend.

811
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,059
GEOFF: Katie...

812
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,093
Could you just go stand
in the fucking hallway

813
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,628
or something?

814
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,097
GEOFF: Yeah. Sure.

815
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,787
How many times?

816
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:49,023
Twice.

817
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:50,892
Where?

818
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:53,895
In my bedroom.

819
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,767
Is it good for you?

820
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:03,704
I'm not going to answer that.

821
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,476
Does he make you cum?

822
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:13,581
Stop. This way, you don't
have to worry about it.

823
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,685
He's not going to go
looking for it somewhere else

824
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,988
and you don't have
to do it until you're ready.

825
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:41,242
KATE: Come here.

826
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:59,026
Kiss her.

827
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,929
What?

828
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,498
Kiss her.

829
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:33,995
Let's go get a drink.

830
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,200
Okay.

831
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:48,543
Do you want to come?

832
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:49,844
No.

833
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:30,985
Did you have a nice time?

834
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,788
We did.

835
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:40,995
We had a nice time.

836
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,839
I just want you to be happy.

837
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,645
Okay.

838
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,253
Okay.

839
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,992
Hi.

840
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:21,929
Hi.

841
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,934
I'm fine.

842
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,908
No.

843
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,082
I've been going to
our park a lot;

844
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,118
I've been thinking about you.

845
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,931
I'm sorry you're dead.

846
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:05,039
I miss you.

847
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:56,957
Okay.

848
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,231
I'm gonna go for a walk.

849
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:05,299
Do you want me to come?

850
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:07,134
No.

851
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:33,362

01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:29,710
Lana?

853
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,080
Sorry... I'm sorry.

854
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,014
I thought you were someone else.

855
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:36,483
Wait, did you call me Lana?

856
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:37,952
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I thought you were my friend.

857
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,019
I have a daughter.

858
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:39,954
Lana.

859
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,422
She's run away.

860
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,729
I'm sorry... I...

861
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,664
Do you know where she is?

862
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:52,967
Who are you?

863
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:54,201
I'm her mother.

864
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,003
Her mother's dead.

865
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:58,605
I'm not dead.

866
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:06,347
I'm sorry... did you just
come here from Utah?

867
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:09,016
I live on the upper east side.

868
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,738
Oh, hey.

869
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,373
I've been calling you.

870
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,579
What is she doing here?

871
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:40,347
You told me your
mother was dead.

872
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,382
She is!

873
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:42,583
Lana, don't say that.

874
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:44,118
My mother is dead!

875
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,319
I watched her die.

876
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:47,287
Lana!

877
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:48,722
Lana!

878
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:55,195
Hello Lana.

879
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,431
It's nice to see you.

880
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,100
Lana, please, open the door!

881
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:02,369
It's your mother.

882
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,571
What's going on?

883
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,306
What's he doing here?

884
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:07,141
Your mother would
like you to come

885
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:08,876
see me again.

886
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,610
I just want to talk to you,
honey, just for a few minutes.

887
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:12,780
Please, just open the door.

888
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:15,082
Sweetheart,
sweetheart, it's me!

889
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:16,150
Stop it!

890
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,217
I do not know who you are!

891
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,786
I'm Dorothy Bower.

892
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:20,454
I'm your mother!

893
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:22,489
You're Lana Bower!

894
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,258
We'd like you to agree to an

895
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,727
inpatient program.

896
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:32,299
Is that true?

897
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,574
Dr. Whitaker, I have
been so much better.

898
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,209
Stop it!

899
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:43,210
You're lying now!

900
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:44,245
This is what you do!

901
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,886
You... >> Dorothy...

902
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,215
Does she know?

903
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:51,318
Did you know that
this is what she always does?

904
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,586
I don't know what
you're talking about.

905
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,721
Yes, you prey on people

906
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:57,124
until you become
everything they need!

907
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:58,125
No!

908
01:24:58,127 --> 01:25:00,811
Isn't that right?

909
01:25:00,812 --> 01:25:03,496
You will do or say anything,
just as long as people

910
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:06,533
love you and think
you're perfect!

911
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:07,734
Help me!

912
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,236
You have to help me!

913
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,737
Oh yes, my perfect little Lana!

914
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:11,638
That's not true!

915
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,640
Then what is true?

916
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,810
Lana!

917
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:27,221
I tried to have her committed.

918
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,655
Stop!

919
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:31,558
Stop!

920
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:36,630
I don't know what else to do.

921
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:41,735
Lana.

922
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,670
How about it?

923
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:52,713
She's right.

924
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:59,553
Dr. Whitaker.
I think it probably

925
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,588
is best if I go with you.

926
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:21,842
That's what you want,
isn't it Momma?

927
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:55,375
Do you think I'm beautiful?

928
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,899
Can I at least
spend one last night

929
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,767
in my own room?

930
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:26,573
That'll be fine.

931
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:32,613
I'll expect you both
at 8am tomorrow.

932
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:32,939
What?!

933
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:35,609
Hi.

934
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:37,644
I called about the apartment.
