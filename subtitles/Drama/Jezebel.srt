1
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:50,066
Boy, stop here.
Might as well get us a ball.

2
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,233
Julie will have plenty
to drink at the party.

3
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,865
Party liquor. Messed up
with cherries and such. Come on.

4
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:57,954
- Wait right here.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Cantrell, sir.

5
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:05,463
Man, you talk crazy.

6
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:08,881
I say that horse is
out of the Truxton strain.

7
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:10,510
- Gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

8
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:13,465
- How are you, General Bogardus, sir?
- How are you, Buck? Ted?

9
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,299
- Going to the party?
- Yes, indeed.

10
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:16,802
- See you later then, sir.
- Yes.

11
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,549
The Truxton strain's
the best horse blood in this state.

12
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:21,970
Here's somebody
that really knows bloodlines.

13
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:25,018
Hi, Buck Cantrell.
Come here and help us decide a bet.

14
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,315
Got no time, Huger.
Ted and I were just shifting.

15
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:28,980
Won't take any time at all, Buck.

16
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,692
You heard him, Huger.
Buck got no time.

17
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,535
Gentlemen, Buck Cantrell got no time.

18
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,659
Five-to-four, he doesn't know the day.

19
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:40,162
I'll do better. Even money,
he doesn't know what month.

20
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:45,836
Know what time of day it is, anyhow.
Must be getting on towards 3:00.

21
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,839
If it was any later,
De Lautruc would be a lot drunker.

22
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:53,009
Is it not admirable Monsieur Cantrell
can joke so cleverly...

23
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:56,179
when he has just lost
the lady of his heart?

24
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,343
- Better not, Rene.
- Yes, gentlemen.

25
00:02:58,517 --> 00:03:01,186
Monsieur Cantrell
has just lost his lady.

26
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,096
I wouldn't go on, De Lautruc.

27
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:06,356
See, gentlemen,
Monsieur Cantrell is in bad humor...

28
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:10,225
because Julie Marsden is marrying...
- De Lautruc.

29
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,610
I thought I heard you mention
a lady's name.

30
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,257
Must have misunderstood you, sir.

31
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,150
And if I did mention
the name of a lady?

32
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,530
Why, just that a gentleman doesn't
mention a lady's name in a barroom.

33
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,077
Are you trying
to teach me manners, my friend?

34
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,158
Wouldn't think of trying, De Lautruc.

35
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:27,538
But I somehow don't like your hat
or your ears or anything between them.

36
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:31,380
- Plain enough?
- Amply, sir. Pierre?

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,377
I've the honor to ask you
to name a friend.

38
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,797
- I'm acting as...
- Shoot, Ted.

39
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,761
You're too young
for this sort of thing.

40
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,211
Gentlemen, a moment.

41
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,963
Buck, I ought to get De Lautruc myself.

42
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,886
It's my brother that's gonna marry her.

43
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,387
That makes it much more
my quarrel than yours.

44
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:49,727
- Let me act for you, Buck.
- Well, if you feel that bad about it.

45
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,895
I've the honor
to be acting for Mr. Cantrell.

46
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,360
- Sunrise at the Oaks satisfactory?
- Perfectly, sir.

47
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,525
Why do you wanna make it
so confounded early?

48
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,907
Make it 10:00. De Lautruc ain't wild.

49
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,700
We don't have to sneak up
on him in the dark.

50
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,244
Your servant, gentlemen.

51
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,038
Come on, youngster.
We gotta get on to the party.

52
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,087
Gentlemen, let's have another drink.

53
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:15,374
Buck, listen...

54
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:17,675
Here's something
I've been aiming to get all day.

55
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,420
- Must have trimmings for the party.
- Cantrell, one minute.

56
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,639
- You riding along with us?
- I have my carriage.

57
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,645
Cantrell, I don't like this.
Miss Julie's name was mentioned.

58
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:28,386
As her guardian,
I don't like her mixed up in this.

59
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,851
Miss Julie's name was mentioned?
Why, sir, if it was, I never heard it.

60
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,435
It's just that I don't
like De Lautruc, is all. May I?

61
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:37,947
Cantrell, you're a fool. De Lautruc's
an old hand. Been out a dozen times.

62
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:40,275
Thirteen's liable to be
unlucky for De Lautruc.

63
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:43,536
You know these French. They shoot
for the head and like as not, miss.

64
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,994
I'm gonna shoot for the body
and bust his tripes.

65
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,455
General Bogardus, sir, your servant.

66
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,483
Mrs. Kendrick. Miss Kendrick, ma'am.

67
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,148
- Keep in the shade, Albert.
- Yes, Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.

68
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,734
I won't have the horses
standing in the sun, you hear?

69
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,490
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:28,792
- Stay in your seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

71
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,828
- Keep your hat and gloves on.
- Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,672
- And your coat buttoned.
- Yes, ma'am.

73
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:36,505
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,218
- Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.
- Good evening, Cato.

75
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,419
Miss Kendrick.

76
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,515
- Honoria, how good of you to come.
- Sweet of you to ask us, Belle.

77
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:47,558
And, Stephanie,
how pretty you look, child.

78
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,187
Oh, thank you, Miss Massie.

79
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,264
Stephanie, your manners.

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,809
- I do hope we aren't late, Belle.
- Late? Julie isn't here herself yet.

81
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,191
- What?
- At her own party in her own house.

82
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,438
Really, I don't know
what to do with that girl.

83
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,607
Well, I always say,
"Better late than never."

84
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,112
Excuse me, please, Honoria.

85
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,872
Mother, please don't fault me
like that before people.

86
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,453
Girls don't curtsey anymore.

87
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,868
<i>- I read it in Godey's.
- They do in New Orleans.</i>

88
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,085
You've no call to take up
with Yankee manners.

89
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,926
- How do you find yourself, Mrs. Petion?
- Honoria, Stephanie.

90
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:23,221
Belle just told me Julie is late
for her own party in her own house.

91
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:26,140
But I always say,
"Punctuality is the politeness of kings."

92
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,550
Politeness was never
one of Julie's virtues.

93
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:29,925
Ted, isn't it exciting?

94
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,559
I think your brother Pres
is the luckiest man.

95
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,890
Providing he keeps
a short reign on her.

96
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,021
Oh, you're just trying to talk
like Buck Cantrell.

97
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,401
I wish Julie would come.

98
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,779
So does Aunt Belle.
She's having a fit.

99
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,820
Tell me, wasn't Mr. Cantrell
just crushed?

100
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,079
Crushed? Buck Cantrell?

101
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:52,202
Hounds all over him. Tom with
his knife, high-tailing with a bear.

102
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,081
The only way you could tell
which was which, he had a hat on.

103
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,914
Laugh, I thought I...

104
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,841
- Yes, Miss Belle?
- Theophilus, that child isn't here yet.

105
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:02,215
You're her guardian.
You'll have to speak to her.

106
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:04,260
You're her aunt, Miss Belle.
Why don't you?

107
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,265
- Girl never was on time in her life.
- It's outrageous of her.

108
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:09,342
Oh, time ain't so important, Miss Belle.

109
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,768
Seems like the longer I live,
the more there is of it.

110
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:16,058
And I don't know
what to say to people.

111
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,362
Evening, Miss Julie.

112
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:32,658
Thank you, Gros Bat.
Take him around, Ti Bat.

113
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:43,416
Now, Ti Bat, don't stand there
with your eyes bulging out like that.

114
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:46,963
- He knows you're scared.
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie, but he bite.

115
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,808
Well, then you just plain
bite him back.

116
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,184
- Good evening, Uncle Cato.
- Praise be, Miss Julie.

117
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,890
- Miss Belle's been nigh on to a fit.
- I know, I'm late.

118
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,641
Miss Julie, I done laid out
your party dress.

119
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,694
Thanks. No time.
Got to go in to my guests.

120
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:06,699
- Miss Julie, in them horse clothes?
- They won't mind.

121
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:11,156
Good evening, everybody.

122
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:15,162
Terribly sorry to be late.
I had trouble with the colt.

123
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,540
- Hello, dumpling.
- Julie, your riding habit.

124
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,000
No time to change, darling. Stephanie.

125
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,129
- I think it looks lovely.
- Thank you, honey.

126
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,007
- How are you, Ted?
- Fine as frog's hair.

127
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,168
Good evening. Good evening.
How do you do?

128
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,337
So sorry, but when a colt
gets high-headed...

129
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,138
teach him his manners
or ruin him.

130
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:33,890
- Yes, that's so important, isn't it?
- Hello, Molly. Excuse me, will you?

131
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:37,015
I declare. I hope I'm broad-minded,
but I must say...

132
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:40,356
I know what Stephanie would get
if she did such a thing, big as she is.

133
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:44,025
I always say, "Spare the rod
and you spoil the child."

134
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:47,066
It sounds so thrilling, darling,
living way up North in New York.

135
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,317
Julie, I wish you and Pres
all the happiness...

136
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,900
the best of health...
- And the most of prosperity.

137
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,193
Sherry, ma'am?

138
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:56,373
You said the very same thing
the last time Pres and I were engaged.

139
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,211
We'll keep right on saying it
until you finally get married.

140
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:02,083
My dear, the toddies
are for the gentlemen.

141
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,880
- Whiskey, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, ma'am.

142
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,792
- The very best of Bourbon.
- That's fine.

143
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,423
To the very good health
of the future Mrs. Dillard.

144
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,924
Buck.

145
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,347
Aren't you gonna wish me
happiness too?

146
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:15,932
What's the use? You won't get it
marrying a trader and going up North.

147
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:19,638
Pres is a banker, not a trader.
I'll thank you to remember that.

148
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,558
I keep forgetting there's a difference.

149
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:24,485
But you won't like it in the North,
Miss Julie, tell you what.

150
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,068
- I'll be happy anywhere Pres is.
- You won't like it at the North.

151
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:33,193
You know those little old white beans?
Horse-feed beans?

152
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,244
You know what they
do with them in Boston?

153
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:39,577
They eat them. Ladies and gentlemen
eat them, what I hear.

154
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,079
- Buck, you're...
- My dear.

155
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,247
Isn't Preston Dillard
ever going to arrive?

156
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,830
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kendrick,
I tried to persuade him...

157
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,045
but he found it important
to meet with the directors of his bank.

158
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,467
Of course.
"Business before pleasure," I always say.

159
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,097
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a toast.

160
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,389
To the firm of Dillard and Sons,
a venerable institution...

161
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:04,265
a financial colossus
with branches in New York...

162
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:08,571
Boston, London and Paris.

163
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:17,739
I guess the one railroad we got
is not enough, huh?

164
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,453
Let's see what it does
before we finance another.

165
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,702
It's losing money by the fistful,
that's what.

166
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:25,832
Steam cars. Ten million dollars
to mess with another railroad.

167
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,251
Who's gonna ride on them?

168
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:29,880
All joggled up with any kind
of rag-tagging bobtail?

169
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,926
What's a gentleman
keep a carriage for?

170
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:33,887
What if a gentleman
ain't got a carriage?

171
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,048
He can borrow one.
What's he got friends for?

172
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,505
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

173
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,843
We are here to listen
to Mr. Dillard's plans...

174
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,645
to finance the Nashville Pacific.

175
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,936
Pacific, and build it east.

176
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,729
When they gonna ask you
to build a railroad to California?

177
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,310
Gentlemen, I'm a banker,
not a conjure man.

178
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,733
But I can tell you this:

179
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:53,860
New York and Boston are steadily
laying in rails to the Northwest.

180
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,861
They're tapping
the trade of that country.

181
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:59,239
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati,
the whole Great Lakes country...

182
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:01,241
beginning to ship east by rail.

183
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,620
- And New Orleans is missing the parade.
- The river's still there.

184
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,333
I reckon even those
Yankee sharpers aren't smart enough...

185
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:08,965
to turn the Mississippi around.

186
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,837
Yankees sharpers are smart enough
to turn the traffic around.

187
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,339
The railroads are getting it.

188
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:16,513
Cussed, snorting, tin teakettles.
Scaring my horses.

189
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:20,845
Every time we get a colt, I look for him
to be foaled with a whale-oil headlight.

190
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,139
I do not think they're so healthy too.
All that smoke and...

191
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,399
Since when have you become so suddenly
concerned about what's healthy?

192
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:28,599
He's off again.

193
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:31,529
You're old enough to remember
the epidemic of '30.

194
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,698
- Or are you so old you've forgotten it?
- I knew it.

195
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,409
Quick as anybody said "health"...

196
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:40,111
Doc Livingstone come surging out of
the cane-break, hollering, "Yellow jack."

197
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,530
And I'll keep on hollering
till you do something...

198
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,662
about cleaning up this town,
getting the filth off the streets.

199
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,753
I've been trying to pound sense
into your knotheads for years.

200
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:52,172
Just the same as Pres is trying to do
right now, and with no better luck.

201
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,880
But I'm warning you,
and you, Jean La Cour...

202
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,805
member of the City Counsel,
and all of you...

203
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,223
if we get us another dose of
yellow fever like we had back in '30...

204
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:03,884
when there wasn't enough men alive
to bury the dead...

205
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:06,898
there just isn't going to be any town
to run a railroad into.

206
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,476
I'm telling you what's a fact.

207
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,726
Dr. Livingstone,
let us not confuse the issue.

208
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:14,069
We are here to discuss a railroad.
Mr. Dillard.

209
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:17,359
Gentlemen, I have here the figures
on the declining river freight.

210
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:21,235
These figures don't lie.
Last year, our riverboat...

211
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,619
- Yes?
- It's Miss Julie's boy, sir.

212
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,328
- He insists to see you, sir.
- What does he want?

213
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:30,084
He insists that Miss Julie told him
to see you personally, sir.

214
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,835
One moment, please, gentlemen.

215
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,092
The lady's waiting, sir.

216
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,554
- Is the party over?
- Yes, Mr. Pres.

217
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,434
Miss Julie tell me to ask you...

218
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:47,355
would you most politely drop
what you're doing and come?

219
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:49,930
You tell her I'm in the middle
of something important.

220
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:52,778
Directors' meeting. I can't leave now.
She'll understand.

221
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:55,946
Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.
She'll understand, all right.

222
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:58,985
But liking it is gonna be different.

223
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:03,200
And expecting a man
to go to a dressmaker's with you.

224
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:04,996
I declare, I hope Pres doesn't come.

225
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,453
- He will.
- But, Julie...

226
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,330
Now, don't fret about Pres.
I've been training him for years.

227
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,377
Not with that man-killing
horse you bought.

228
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,942
Pres was outrageous.

229
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,962
He'd no right to tell me
what I could ride and couldn't.

230
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:16,676
Horse showed you
what you couldn't.

231
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,920
You broke your collarbone
and your engagement.

232
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:22,132
And they both mended,
so I was right after all.

233
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,798
- Miss Julie, ma'am.
- Ti Bat, did you tell him to hurry?

234
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,646
Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie. I tell him.
But he ain't come.

235
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,936
That is, not just exactly.

236
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:33,227
That is, he say,
will you please go along?

237
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:36,853
In the middle of some directions.
Causes some problems.

238
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,655
He can't see you later.

239
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,693
Did Mr. Pres say that?

240
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:44,568
Yes, ma'am, those his very words.
He says you'll understand.

241
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:49,492
- Yes. Yes, I understand perfectly.
- Julie.

242
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,912
Julie, in a bank.

243
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,651
I'll get him, Miss Julie. I'll get him.

244
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,029
- Thank you.
- Just a moment.

245
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,691
I'm not putting the bank
in a $ 10 million proposition...

246
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,696
without knowing
what I'm talking about.

247
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,706
I haven't spent six months getting
these figures for my album.

248
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,701
- Give me a little...
- Mr. Dillard, sir.

249
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:35,668
- Yes, what is it?
- It's Miss Julie, sir. She's waiting.

250
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,916
- I'm sorry.
- Certainly, my boy.

251
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,049
Everything waits
where beauty's concerned.

252
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,342
- You shouldn't...
- Are you coming or aren't you?

253
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,051
- Try to understand.
- I only understand that you promised.

254
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,845
- But this is important.
- I don't suppose it's important...

255
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,474
that I spent a whole month
having my ball dress made.

256
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,389
You promised to come and see it fitted.

257
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:55,731
I don't suppose it's important to you
what I wear to the Olympus ball.

258
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,692
It's only you that's so important.

259
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:01,147
I suppose Mr. La Cour and the others
couldn't possibly get on without you.

260
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:02,568
They'd love to, permanently.

261
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,864
- Now, Julie, you've got good sense.
- Thank you.

262
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,787
I'm having the fight of my life in there.
I've gotta get back.

263
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,532
Just run along, I'll see you later.

264
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,598
Don't trouble.

265
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,158
I'm sure you'll be too exhausted
from your terrific struggle.

266
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:15,908
- Julie, you must realize...
- I realize only too well.

267
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,788
Good day, Mr. Dillard.
I'm so sorry to have troubled you.

268
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:36,229
To Madame Poulard's.

269
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:49,987
- Julie, it's perfectly lovely.
- I don't like the color.

270
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,824
And does it have to be so tight here?

271
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:57,583
- It binds. And the skirt...
- But it's adorable, Julie. It really is.

272
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,839
- Pres has always loved you in white.
- Yes.

273
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,299
If he isn't bowled over,
I won't know what to think.

274
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,805
Wait a minute.
Bring that over here.

275
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,054
- Saucy, isn't it?
- And vulgar.

276
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,057
Yes, isn't it?

277
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,937
- Come on. Get me out of this.
- Julie, what are you doing?

278
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:24,437
If it fits me, I'm gonna wear it
to the Olympus ball.

279
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:27,818
A red dress to the Olympus ball?
Why, you're out of your senses.

280
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,748
That creature, Julie.
You heard what Madame Poulard said.

281
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:38,368
- That infamous Vickers woman.
- Marie Vickers couldn't do it justice.

282
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,921
Child, you're out of your mind.

283
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:42,211
You know you can't wear red
to the Olympus ball.

284
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,042
Can't I? I'm going to.

285
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:49,758
This is 1852, dumpling.
1852, not the Dark Ages.

286
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:53,098
Girls don't have to simper around
in white because they're not married.

287
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:54,679
In New Orleans, they do.

288
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:57,012
Julie, you'd insult every woman
on the floor.

289
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,356
Mademoiselle, your aunt, she's right.
Look how beautiful this dress is.

290
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,150
Will you kindly get me out of this?

291
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:05,190
Julie, you can't be serious.

292
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,107
Never more serious in my life.

293
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,304
But, Julie, think of Pres.

294
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:14,203
That's just exactly
what I am thinking of.

295
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,042
Preston, I'm not convinced,
but I consider, I think.

296
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:22,964
<i>- Gentlemen, bon soir.
- Evening, La Cour.</i>

297
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:26,085
Well, cheer up, son.
You've got La Cour to thinking anyhow.

298
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,466
That, my boy, is as good
as starting a balky mule.

299
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,795
- It took your support, doctor.
- Nonsense.

300
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,298
I'd always be with Tom Dillard's son,
right or wrong.

301
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:36,097
Best man I ever knew.
Don't breed men like that nowadays.

302
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,262
You measured right up to him
this afternoon.

303
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,230
I'm afraid not, doctor.

304
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:43,483
You been having you
some little fuss with Miss Julie?

305
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,818
- If you don't mind, sir.
- Certainly, my boy.

306
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:47,815
None of my business anyhow.

307
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,608
But speaking abstractly,
and nothing personal intended...

308
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:54,074
your generation
don't understand the darlings.

309
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:57,413
- Why, maybe not.
- Absolutely not, my boy.

310
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,911
Woman, sir, is a chalice...

311
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:02,583
a frail, delicate chalice,
to be cherished and protected.

312
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:07,333
But nowadays, no proper respect
for our Southern womanhood.

313
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,258
Think your father would
have allowed his lady...

314
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,421
to come surging
into his place of business?

315
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,140
What would he have done, sir?

316
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,763
He'd have cut him a hickory, sir.
A hickory.

317
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,224
He'd have flailed
the living daylights out of her...

318
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,895
and then helped put lard on her welts
and bought her a diamond brooch.

319
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,518
That's what he'd have done, sir,
and she'd have loved it.

320
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,237
Good evening, my boy.

321
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:33,238
Thank you, doctor. Good evening, sir.

322
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,446
- Evening, Mr. Preston.
- Hello, Cato. Is Miss Julie about?

323
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,950
She's up to her room, sir.
I'll tell her you're here.

324
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,814
Just rest yourself in there
with the folks.

325
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:45,710
Thanks, Uncle Cato.

326
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:49,959
- Evening.
- Pres, I'm so glad you've come.

327
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:51,795
I thought you...

328
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,630
Julie said you'd quarreled again.

329
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:56,343
It's time we all stopped
hanging on every word she says.

330
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,474
Most times,
she only half means them.

331
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,969
I was telling your aunt
the same thing. That girl...

332
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:04,017
She just had a little fuss with Pres.
That's all, isn't it, Pres?

333
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,899
If you can call it a fuss, Miss Belle.

334
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,191
- You see, Theophilus?
- I'm going to speak out.

335
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:10,022
That girl is high-headed and willful.

336
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:13,482
Son, if you just come to realize it,
what she needs is a firm hand.

337
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,328
I appreciate your interest,
but I believe I can handle this.

338
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:21,489
Mr. Preston, Miss Julie say,
will you most politely excuse her?

339
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,825
- Is she ill?
- Why, no, Pres.

340
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,494
She's sound as a nut.

341
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:32,419
- Excuse me a moment.
- Take your own good time, my boy.

342
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,840
Now, Belle.

343
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,200
Julie?

344
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,571
Julie, it's Pres.

345
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:06,200
Open the door. I want to talk to you.

346
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,543
Julie, why don't you answer?

347
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,880
Look here, Julie, you and I
have got to straighten things out.

348
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:17,964
There's no sense to all this.

349
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,473
I'm here because I love you
and because I know you love me...

350
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:24,217
but there are some things
we've got to see straight.

351
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:27,647
Julie, I couldn't leave the bank today,
you know that.

352
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:30,568
I was just as disappointed
as you were.

353
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:34,021
Now, please, Julie.
We've always had these silly quarrels.

354
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,071
Can't we stop?

355
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,573
Julie? Why don't you answer?

356
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,790
Darling, if you'll just open the door,
I'm sure I could...

357
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:51,880
Julie!

358
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,919
Open this door.

359
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:03,184
Julie!

360
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,640
Julie!

361
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,436
Who is it?

362
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,111
Open this door.

363
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,293
Why, Pres. Banging on a lady's door.

364
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,168
I'm scandalized at you.

365
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,973
Well, did you come up here
just to stand there?

366
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:46,161
Julie, how long must
we go on like this?

367
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:47,144
Like what, Pres?

368
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,475
Fighting, fussing all the time
like a couple of children.

369
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:51,019
Why do you treat me like a child?

370
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,017
Because you act like one.
A spoiled one.

371
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,816
You used to say
you liked me like that, once.

372
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:58,027
You never wanted me to change.

373
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:01,069
Remember?

374
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,329
Julie.

375
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,076
Why, Pres. In a lady's bedroom.

376
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:14,669
- Now you'll have to marry me.
- What do you figure I aim to do?

377
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,298
Then kiss me again.

378
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:34,017
- Would you like to see my new dress?
- That's what I wanted to do all day.

379
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:36,399
Well... Well, let me go, then.

380
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,112
There it is.

381
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,528
- For the Olympus ball?
- Isn't it lovely?

382
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,453
- Julie, it's red.
- It's gorgeously red.

383
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,290
- You can't wear red to the Olympus ball.
- Why not?

384
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:51,374
You never saw an unmarried girl
in anything but white.

385
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,251
And you're gonna see one
tomorrow night.

386
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,788
Julie, you can't be serious.

387
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,882
You afraid somebody will take me
for a girl from Gallatin Street?

388
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:00,711
- Julie!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

389
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:02,297
I forgot, I'm a child.

390
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:05,044
I'm not supposed to know about
things like Gallatin Street.

391
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,050
I'm supposed
to flutter around in white.

392
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:10,891
You're supposed to know better
than to scandalize the whole town.

393
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:13,805
It might be bad for the bank.

394
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:15,560
Of course.

395
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,518
Will you please hold another meeting
and ask them to decide what I can wear?

396
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,523
For heaven's sake,
will you be reasonable?

397
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:25,032
- Were you reasonable this afternoon?
- So that's it.

398
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:27,871
You're just nursing a spite.
Well, I'm not gonna let you.

399
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,611
You've made your point.
For once, you're gonna do as I say.

400
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,748
I'm calling for you
tomorrow night at 10...

401
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:35,326
and you're gonna be dressed
properly in white.

402
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:36,998
Am I?

403
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:39,129
Oh, but, of course, Preston,
if you say so.

404
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,422
Don't be absurd.
Your own good sense will say so.

405
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:42,838
And if it doesn't?

406
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:47,554
Then, my sweet, you and I will sit
at home quietly with our embroidery.

407
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,258
Good night.

408
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:53,394
Tomorrow night at 10.

409
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:56,764
Oh, Preston, you forgot your stick.

410
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,188
So I did. I forgot to use it too.

411
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,107
So you did.

412
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:26,720
- Did you call me, Miss Julie?
- Yes, Zette. I've got an errand for you.

413
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:29,296
- I'd rather not trust the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:34,385
Miss Julie, this sure
is the most elegant dress.

415
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:36,721
You can have it after tomorrow.

416
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:40,149
- Me, Miss Julie?
- If you can keep a secret.

417
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,442
It's just like
you ain't never said nothing.

418
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:46,860
Zette, I want this delivered right away
to Mr. Buck Cantrell on Chartres Street.

419
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,785
And, Zette, remember,
not a word to anyone, understand?

420
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,661
I sure do understand, Miss Julie.

421
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,997
It's just like I was struck stone dumb
in both my ears.

422
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,661
Well, go on.

423
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:38,323
Zette. Zette, when Mr. Pres comes,
give him this.

424
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,122
Give him this, Miss Julie?

425
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:42,621
Just give it to him. He'll understand.

426
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,882
Yes, Miss Julie, ma'am.

427
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,387
- Good evening.
- Evening, Miss Julie.

428
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:50,439
You're late.

429
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,259
Sorry, I had a little business
to attend to.

430
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,509
Is it true about Mr. De Lautruc?

431
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,973
Don't you suppose
I know about the meeting?

432
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:59,897
- I don't know what you mean.
- Is it true you killed him?

433
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,559
Sure. I never did him that bad.

434
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:04,022
Dr. Livingstone,
he had him an elegant name for it:

435
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,736
A fractured...

436
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:08,905
Well, anyway, it just looked
like a busted hip to me.

437
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:11,826
My zing, Miss Julie,
you all dressed up for a hog killing?

438
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,244
I hoped you'd like it.

439
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:16,371
Well, makes me feel kind of all-overish.

440
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,912
Well, your note said 10:00,
side entrance, Miss Julie.

441
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,329
What you up to?

442
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:22,827
Buck, you're taking me
to the Olympus ball.

443
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,002
- You do me a great honor.
- Then we'd better hurry.

444
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,001
Just a minute.
You had a set-to with Pres?

445
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:31,343
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- We'd better. Pres isn't gonna like it.

446
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,921
What's the matter, Buck?
Afraid Pres will call you out?

447
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,092
He'd do that.
Can't say I'd blame him much.

448
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,011
Where do I stand, carrying his lady?

449
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:41,104
- If I ask you to, isn't that enough?
- Not this time, Miss Julie.

450
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,846
I think too much of you
to help do something you'll regret.

451
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:47,110
- I know exactly what I'm doing.
- Most likely you do, but you're wrong.

452
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,022
That dress can cause
no end of trouble.

453
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,274
Folks will resent you
coming to the ball in it.

454
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,822
Well, let them. They're just petty
and narrow-minded.

455
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:57,577
No, ma'am, it's just that they got rules
and they go by them. Same as you and I.

456
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:01,959
- And do you prefer to go by your rules?
- I always have, Miss Julie.

457
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:04,624
Then I'm sorry I troubled you.

458
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:11,174
- Good night, Mr. Cantrell.
- Good night, Miss Julie.

459
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:21,053
- Good evening, Uncle Cato.
- Evening, Mr. Pres.

460
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:23,472
- Evening, Pres.
- Evening. Julie dressed?

461
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:26,484
Zette, tell Miss Julie Mr. Pres is here.
We're ready to go.

462
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:32,863
Well, don't stand there like a bump
on a log. Go along and tell her.

463
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,158
Yes, Miss Belle, ma'am.

464
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,576
Zette.

465
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,840
Good evening.

466
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:55,011
Well, shall we go, Pres?

467
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,554
Not till you're properly dressed.

468
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:03,604
You're sure it's the dress?
It couldn't be that you're afraid?

469
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:09,186
Afraid somebody will insult me and
you'll find it necessary to defend me?

470
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:21,871
May I?

471
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:29,128
- Ready, Aunt Belle?
- Pres, please...

472
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,708
We're ready, my boy.

473
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,399
That dress.

474
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:45,839
Hello, Molly.
Mrs. Kendrick. Hello, Dick.

475
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,761
- Miss Julie.
- Evening, Julie.

476
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:53,899
Stephanie, we must pay our respects
to Mrs. Zemal. You'll excuse us, please.

477
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:37,063
Gentlemen, you all have the privilege
of Miss Marsden's acquaintance, I think.

478
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,394
- Gentlemen.
- Good evening, Miss Marsden.

479
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,072
- Respects, ma'am.
- Good evening, Buck.

480
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,194
We were just fixing
to pour us a little libation.

481
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:49,747
That's right.

482
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:53,082
- Shall we see you later?
- Excuse me.

483
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:56,670
Oh, there's my partner now.

484
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:59,414
Excuse me, please.

485
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:02,798
You haven't a partner
you have to meet, Cantrell.

486
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,801
Why, no. Came alone.

487
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,265
A pleasant evening, isn't it?

488
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,644
Mighty pleasant.

489
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:16,141
Nice and cool.

490
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,807
Do you find it cool in here?

491
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,947
I don't find it particularly cool.

492
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:25,862
- Do you, Julie?
- Why... Why, no.

493
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,407
I don't find it particularly cool.

494
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,702
Miss Julie doesn't find it so.

495
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,703
Why, no.

496
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:40,959
Now you speak of it,
it's just about right.

497
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,881
It seems so to me.

498
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,634
Your servant.

499
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,007
Yours, Miss Julie.

500
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,430
Pres, I wanna leave.

501
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,273
Why? We haven't danced yet.

502
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:00,849
- Shall we?
- No.

503
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,884
Pres, let me go.

504
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,804
Take me out of here.

505
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,874
Go on and play.

506
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:44,829
Go on and play.

507
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:51,091
Pres, let me go.
Please take me out of here.

508
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,371
Good night, Aunt Belle.

509
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,451
Goodbye, Julie.

510
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:28,665
Is that all you've got to say to me?

511
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,882
There's nothing more to say.

512
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:38,682
Evidently you've made up your mind.

513
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,510
No, Julie. You've made up my mind.

514
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,648
Goodbye, Pres.

515
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:07,545
Goodbye, Julie.

516
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:18,845
Julie, don't let him go. Call him back.

517
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,776
Julie, you're a fool.

518
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,236
Not such a fool.

519
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:42,450
- He'll come back.
- He won't.

520
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,459
Not this time, he won't. Believe me.

521
00:36:57,055 --> 00:37:00,471
Julie, honey, let me send for him.

522
00:37:00,726 --> 00:37:03,929
No, he'll come back. Wait and see.

523
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,390
Yet tonight, I think.

524
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:11,058
If he does, say I've retired.

525
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:14,823
And that I'm sleeping late
in the morning.

526
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:19,367
Not to come around
till afternoon tomorrow.

527
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,990
Tell him to...

528
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:49,608
Huger's got himself a brand-new reason
for getting liquored.

529
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,814
Straight bourbon and lots of it.
That's a fact.

530
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:54,441
Ever hear of a man
and his liquor getting yellow fever?

531
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:58,860
I aim to carry all I can hold, and I
advise you gentlemen to do likewise.

532
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:02,569
Huger aims not to be carried off
by anything but drink.

533
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,293
It's no joking matter.
Looks mighty serious.

534
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:13,875
More cases than you hear about.

535
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:17,133
Doctors call it by another name,
any name but yellow fever.

536
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:20,885
Every time I see old dead wagon,
I pour me four fingers of bourbon.

537
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:22,883
Yesterday, I drunk
nigh on to two quarts.

538
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:25,347
Ain't any more yellow fever
than this time last year.

539
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,512
You never hear of fever talk
in racing season.

540
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,479
Folks got something better
to talk about.

541
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:30,727
- Hello.
- Hello, Dillard.

542
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:31,931
How you, Ted?

543
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,647
- Something working on your mind.
- Pres is coming back.

544
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,148
Why, now, folks generally do.

545
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:38,812
- When did you hear this?
- Just now, from Dr. Livingstone.

546
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:41,695
He's bringing something rare
and precious from the North.

547
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:45,320
- What could it be, I wonder?
- A stem-winding watch, maybe.

548
00:38:47,332 --> 00:38:50,286
And give yourselves a breathing spell
up there on the plantation.

549
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,497
Only a matter of a few weeks, I say,
until the scare blows over.

550
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:56,839
You'll be back in time
for the Mardi Gras and Olympus ball.

551
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:05,639
Is there really cause for alarm?

552
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:09,344
Well, I wouldn't go so far as that, but
the city's not going to be so pleasant.

553
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:13,519
No parties. Theater's liable to be closed
as a precautionary measure.

554
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:15,270
The theater.

555
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,318
I haven't been since...

556
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,405
<i>- When was the last time, Aunt Belle?
- Camille.</i>

557
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,610
I hated it. I wouldn't mind
if I never saw another play.

558
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,903
I strongly urge you go.

559
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,915
Who knows? Maybe we are in
for another time like '30.

560
00:39:29,082 --> 00:39:30,327
Heaven forbid.

561
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,834
Dr. Livingstone's only looking after
our best interests, I'm sure, my dear.

562
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,379
I am indeed.

563
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:38,881
May I send instructions
to have the house made ready?

564
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,726
I'll try to persuade her,
Dr. Livingstone.

565
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,936
Julie don't look
as well as I've seen her.

566
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,431
It's all I can do to get her
to step from this house.

567
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,479
Won't go outside except to ride
that crazy thoroughbred of hers.

568
00:39:57,653 --> 00:39:59,811
I'm in fear and trembling
she'll break her neck.

569
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:02,906
Won't go anyplace where there's
company. Won't have company in.

570
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:06,360
Young Mr. Cantrell and the others,
she hasn't received them in months.

571
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,241
They've stopped calling.
Only leave cards.

572
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:11,074
What does she do all day long?

573
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,085
Tends the house as no house
has ever been tended.

574
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:17,419
She's so particular, if an article
is half an inch out of place...

575
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:20,424
or if there's a speck of dust
on anything, she notices it.

576
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,751
Makes me uneasy.

577
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:25,597
You might be interested
in a bit of news I got today.

578
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:28,720
Preston Dillard's coming back.

579
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,303
Arrives Friday on the packet.

580
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,100
- What brings him?
- This yellow-fever business.

581
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,764
We two stand together
on what ought to be done about it.

582
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:38,982
Now it's busted loose,
he's coming back.

583
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:41,943
It's high time.

584
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,191
I suspect I know Julie
like nobody ever will...

585
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:47,910
every crook and cranny of her.

586
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,996
You ought to, Miss Belle.
She's more like you than you ever were.

587
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:54,536
Maybe I love her most
when she's her meanest...

588
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,126
because I know
that's when she's loving most.

589
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:06,301
I'll let you know about the plantation
just as soon as I can.

590
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:08,760
Do that, Miss Belle,
if you please, ma'am.

591
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,925
Don't bother, Miss Belle.

592
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:19,314
- Goodbye, Cato.
- Evening, Dr. Livingstone, sir.

593
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:24,151
I do believe Dr. Livingstone
takes pleasure in frightening people.

594
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:27,277
- Particularly women.
- You don't remember the last outbreak.

595
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,360
It was dreadful.

596
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,445
I guess it's pretty serious.

597
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,825
Pres Dillard's coming home
on account of it.

598
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:42,831
Pres is coming home.

599
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:52,259
Of course.

600
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:54,475
Did you know it?

601
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,847
Certainly, I knew it.

602
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,024
I knew all along.

603
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:03,854
He had to come back to me.

604
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:06,235
He couldn't help himself.

605
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,867
He wouldn't know
how to fight as hard as I have...

606
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,617
to keep from going to him.

607
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,081
We'll be married.

608
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:28,125
I'm gonna beg his forgiveness.

609
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:31,888
I was vicious, mean and selfish.

610
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:36,555
And I'm gonna tell him I hated myself
for being like I was, even then.

611
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,437
<i>I'll humble myself before him.</i>

612
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:46,401
And everything that ever stood
between us will be gone...

613
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:49,403
when he takes me in his arms.

614
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:52,611
Darling.

615
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:00,419
Perhaps we'd better go
to the plantation.

616
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:02,958
Of course, that's the place
for our meeting.

617
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,328
We'd better start packing.

618
00:43:05,924 --> 00:43:09,091
Uncle Cato. Zette.

619
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,258
We'll give a party, dumpling.
We'll invite everybody.

620
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:14,423
A party to celebrate.

621
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,269
Uncle Cato, get the trunks
out of the attic.

622
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:19,475
And, Zette, lay out my dresses.

623
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,769
And have Gros Bat
polish up the big carriage.

624
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,351
Have Mammy Teel pack a basket.

625
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:26,099
And get the furniture covers out,
we're closing the house.

626
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:30,607
What are you standing there for?
Get a move on. We're going to Halcyon.

627
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:49,085
- You guess that's plenty, Uncle Cato?
- I guess so, Miss Julie.

628
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,509
If all that mint sticks in the juleps,
it's bound to be a powerful night.

629
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,135
Now, don't you forget a hard frost
on the glasses.

630
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:58,972
Miss Julie, when I ever serve
a gentleman a julep without the frost?

631
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,145
Mr. Pres sure gonna know
he's back home, all right.

632
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,395
You finish it, will you?

633
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,361
Zette, run a damp cloth over my mirror
and lay out my dress.

634
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:11,732
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.

635
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:15,112
- Zette.
- Yes?

636
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,907
- Is Gros Bat on the lookout?
- Yes, Miss Julie.

637
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:47,523
You're gonna wear those flowers out
with fixing and fussing.

638
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:50,362
Everything's got to be right, dumpling.
Just right.

639
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:52,023
Well, I guess everything is.

640
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:55,032
And you most of anything, honey.

641
00:44:56,702 --> 00:44:59,987
- Excited?
- Feel my heart jumping?

642
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,786
Well, I guess I better go and dress.

643
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,524
Zette. Zette, help me out of this.

644
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,777
Did you hear a carriage?

645
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,407
Go on, Zette, see. Hurry.

646
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,252
Do you see any carriages just yet?

647
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:00,680
- No carriage coming yet.
- Nope, no carriages coming yet.

648
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:09,310
- Yes?
- No carriages yet.

649
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:11,352
Well, then hook me up, Zette.

650
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:13,934
Why you ain't never wear
this dress before, Miss Julie?

651
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:15,904
It's the most prettiest dress you own.

652
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,279
- I've been saving it for today.
- Yeah.

653
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,653
I don't never have no hopes
of falling heir to this dress, I don't.

654
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:23,620
No, not this one, Zette.

655
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:24,820
Carriages coming!

656
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:27,324
- Where?
- Carriages coming, down yonder.

657
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:29,624
- Carriages coming!
- Carriages coming!

658
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:32,120
- Carriages coming!
- Zette.

659
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:34,669
- Man on horseback too.
- Zette, yes.

660
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:38,925
- Carriages coming.
- Carriages coming.

661
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,135
- Carriages coming.
- Carriages coming.

662
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:47,807
Carriages coming.

663
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,972
Carriages coming.

664
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:11,701
- Glad to see you.
- I'm so glad to see you.

665
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:17,583
Mr. Buck and Mr. Dick
are on horseback.

666
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,167
- Keep an eye out for Mr. Pres.
- Yes, ma'am.

667
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,888
- Buck, I'm glad to see you.
- Hello.

668
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:24,677
Will you all go in
and just sort of carry on, right?

669
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,677
Go on and make yourselves at home.

670
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:28,180
Dick, I'm so glad.

671
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,936
Before it was a pleasure to be here,
but this time it's a blessing.

672
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,854
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure glad
to see you all back again.

673
00:47:35,027 --> 00:47:37,019
I guess there's no use
my telling you folks...

674
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:38,773
how glad we are to have you here.

675
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:42,363
Miss Belle, I reckon none of us ever
could forget the hospitality of Halcyon.

676
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:43,993
Now, you stay out of my kitchen.

677
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,699
I haven't forgotten the time
you ate my party pompano.

678
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:49,030
Sure. Miss Julie and me,
we'd been bird hunting.

679
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,663
We were hungry,
and there was an elegant pompano.

680
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,958
Well, you were both of you
mighty reprehensible.

681
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:56,964
- Have you heard from Preston?
- No, but I had a note from Ted.

682
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:59,374
He said Pres would arrive
on the packet about noon.

683
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,378
He'd be responsible
for bringing him over.

684
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:02,882
They ought to be here by now.

685
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:06,009
Have to wait for the sheriff
to pass them through the parish line.

686
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,214
Pass them through?

687
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:10,062
Armed guards are patrolling the road
as far up as Riverview.

688
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:11,972
Stopping everybody
coming from the city.

689
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:14,223
It's mighty bad in the city,
mighty bad.

690
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:17,733
- We're all very fortunate to be up here.
- Are any gentlefolk taken down?

691
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:19,777
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.

692
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:22,402
Ned Warrington's got it.
No telling how many others.

693
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:24,816
Where there's sickness
they're keeping it a secret.

694
00:48:24,993 --> 00:48:26,867
There's talk of shipping
those who have it...

695
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:28,742
to Lazarette Island
where the lepers are.

696
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:30,497
"Lazarette Island
where the lepers are"?

697
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:32,081
Like in '30.

698
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:37,837
Why, it ain't civilized to condemn
Christian people to Lazarette Island.

699
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:39,750
Well, they won't have a chance at all.

700
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:43,709
No chance at all, Miss Belle.
But maybe the rest of us will.

701
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,595
Theophilus, we are safe up here?

702
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:48,255
This parish always has been
above the fever line.

703
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:50,640
They aim to keep it that way.

704
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:55,181
Excuse me for keeping you all standing.

705
00:48:55,524 --> 00:48:56,935
Come on in and freshen up a bit.

706
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:00,608
- Carriage coming!
- That must be Pres and Ted now.

707
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,606
Carriage coming!

708
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:15,499
- Pres, my dear boy.
- Aunt Belle.

709
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,627
And Ted.

710
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:25,215
Aunt Belle, everybody,
this is Amy, my wife.

711
00:49:26,388 --> 00:49:28,048
Pres, your wife?

712
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:30,299
You could have knocked me
over with a feather.

713
00:49:30,476 --> 00:49:33,013
Hey, Buck, there's your stem-winder.

714
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,312
Oh, my dear...

715
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:38,815
Pres' wife would
naturally be welcome here...

716
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:42,020
but you are for your own sake.
- Thank you.

717
00:49:42,863 --> 00:49:45,318
Pres' brother has been so gracious
in his welcome.

718
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:47,732
I hoped that the others he loves
would be the same.

719
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,531
Of course we will, my dear.

720
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:52,371
May I present our friends.

721
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:54,823
- May I present General Bogardus?
- How do you do?

722
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,280
- Mr. Cantrell.
- How do you do?

723
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,287
- Mr. Allen.
- How do you do?

724
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,787
My dear, will you come with me?

725
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,502
Howdy, ma'am.

726
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,673
Mighty nice to have you back
with us again, Pres.

727
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,896
See that the gentlemen get their juleps.

728
00:50:10,897 --> 00:50:11,765
Yes, Miss Belle.

729
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:14,685
- Cato. I'm glad to see you again.
- Praise be, Master Pres.

730
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:16,264
Sure glad to see you back home.

731
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:17,849
- How are you?
- Fine and dandy.

732
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:19,683
My dear. Excuse us, please.

733
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:21,436
- You got some mint juleps?
- Yes, sir.

734
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,437
You just follow me now,
and I'll show you.

735
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:26,399
It's kind of you to have us. Tell you
the truth, I'd have come anyhow.

736
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:28,862
- I hope so.
- I've got to go back tomorrow.

737
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:30,362
Back to the city? But, Pres...

738
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:33,655
Things are at sixes and sevens.
The fever's left us short-handed.

739
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,867
But I want to ask if Amy may stay.
I want her out of the city.

740
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:40,541
- But perhaps it isn't convenient.
- My dear, Halcyon belongs to its guests.

741
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:43,038
And Pres' wife is, of course,
an honored one.

742
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:45,042
Come, my dear.

743
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:49,882
Is this your first visit south?

744
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:52,587
Yes, it's beautiful.
Strange and beautiful.

745
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:54,260
- A little frightening.
- Frightening?

746
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,760
Because of its strangeness
and beauty, I suppose.

747
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:59,060
This way, my dear.

748
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,136
- You haven't forgotten how.
- Me, sir?

749
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,799
The head might forget,
but the hand remembers.

750
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:39,931
Anyhow, Miss Julie, she's right in
behind me all day to fix them...

751
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:41,813
just the way you used to like them.

752
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,767
Uncle Cato, how is Miss Julie?

753
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:47,987
- Miss Julie? Why, she's just Miss Julie.
- Just the same?

754
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:52,733
I reckon princesses, they just naturally
grows up to be queens, that's all.

755
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:55,740
Uncle Cato, we've known
each other a long time.

756
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,748
I'm back now. Home.

757
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:02,492
It's a special occasion.
Will you join me in one?

758
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:08,126
Why... Why, Mr. Pres,
it ain't hardly proper.

759
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,256
But I'll kindly take
one out in the pantry...

760
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:13,878
and bless you and Miss Julie.

761
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:21,811
Pres.

762
00:52:29,488 --> 00:52:32,821
Are you remembering the time
you wanted me to wear white?

763
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:35,158
Are you?

764
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:39,075
Well, until now, I never have.

765
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:45,163
Cat got your tongue, Pres?

766
00:52:45,546 --> 00:52:47,289
Julie...

767
00:52:48,006 --> 00:52:50,332
You said that plain enough.

768
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,295
Pres, what fools we were.

769
00:52:57,015 --> 00:53:00,016
Julie, you're lovely.
Lovelier than ever.

770
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:04,271
Pres, I can't believe it's you here.

771
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:09,644
I dreamed about it so long. A lifetime.

772
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:13,608
No.

773
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:15,905
Longer than that.

774
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:23,206
I put on this white dress for you...

775
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:28,706
to help me tell you how humbly
I ask you to forgive me.

776
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:36,544
Pres, I'm kneeling to you.

777
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:38,551
Julie, don't.

778
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:45,229
To ask you to forgive me
and love me...

779
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:47,896
as I love you.
- Julie, please.

780
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:57,235
Julie...

781
00:53:58,076 --> 00:54:00,069
this is Amy, my wife.

782
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:07,829
Your wife?

783
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:10,292
And you're... May I say "Julie"?

784
00:54:16,762 --> 00:54:18,589
Pres' wife?

785
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:21,839
- You're funning.
- Hardly.

786
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:32,270
Married.

787
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:38,027
My felicitations, Pres.

788
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:42,861
Julie? Julie?

789
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,539
Yes, Aunt Belle, in here.

790
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,833
I was just congratulating Pres
on his marriage.

791
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,668
- You from the North, Mrs. Dillard?
- New York.

792
00:54:53,882 --> 00:54:57,049
She was a Miss Bradford.
Isn't that what you told me, my dear?

793
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:58,464
Yes.

794
00:54:58,637 --> 00:55:00,297
Bradford.

795
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:02,763
Amy Bradford...

796
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,843
from New York.

797
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:08,472
I'm very happy to welcome you
to Halcyon.

798
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:11,934
Thank you.

799
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:14,394
You have such charming customs here.

800
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,239
You may find our customs,
as you call them...

801
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:19,149
different from those
of your country.

802
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:22,493
I did want to meet you.
Pres had told me so much about you.

803
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:24,654
Everything, I suppose.

804
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:27,658
Are you very surprised
about our getting...?

805
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,872
We Louisianans are very impulsive.

806
00:55:30,043 --> 00:55:32,036
I wouldn't be surprised
at whatever Pres did.

807
00:55:32,212 --> 00:55:35,415
- Julie, the others will be coming down.
- Oh, yes, Aunt Belle, of course.

808
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:37,417
Would you excuse us a moment?

809
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:45,932
Julie...

810
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:56,693
Julie, child, I'm so sorry.

811
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:59,614
For heaven's sakes,
don't be gentle with me now.

812
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:02,189
Do you think I wanna be wept over?

813
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,285
I've gotta think, to plan, to fight.

814
00:56:05,454 --> 00:56:08,027
- But you can't fight marriage.
- Marriage, is it?

815
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,282
To that washed-out little Yankee?

816
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,292
Pres is mine. He's always been mine.
And if I can't have him...

817
00:56:16,465 --> 00:56:18,956
- Why, Buck.
- Miss Julie.

818
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:21,257
You don't know
how glad I am to see you.

819
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:24,512
And I am most pointedly delighted
to see you, Miss Julie.

820
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,469
Most pointedly delighted.

821
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,187
William Lloyd Garrison is a fanatic.
Wendell Phillips is another.

822
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:35,065
They've made a mighty
touchy situation.

823
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,522
But I can't believe
the intelligent men up North...

824
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,446
plot to destroy our sovereign rights.
- You sound calm now.

825
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:44,279
You were raring to go when you joined up
with Andrew Jackson to fight the British.

826
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:46,658
I was a lot younger then,
and a lot foolisher.

827
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:49,236
What Buck's been saying
doesn't sound so foolish to me.

828
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:52,415
Most of it makes sense.
And I'll take the rest on faith.

829
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:55,419
Why, that's the first time
you ever said I talked sense.

830
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:57,380
Well, you don't much.

831
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:00,299
But it's refreshing to see a man
who knows his own mind.

832
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:01,712
Don't you think so, Pres?

833
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,008
It's hard to know your mind sometimes.

834
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:06,884
If only we could put away
this stale old quarrel.

835
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:10,758
Exactly. I always say,
"Let sleeping dogs lie."

836
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:13,641
Trouble is, those abolitionists
don't act like sleeping dogs.

837
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,605
They're scratching their fleas all over.

838
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:18,561
Looks to me like we'll have
to hang a few to get us any peace.

839
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,191
This William Lloyd Garrison
would look elegant that way.

840
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:24,399
I'm afraid your problems wouldn't
be solved by hanging Mr. Garrison.

841
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:25,773
Why, there's plenty more.

842
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:28,524
I named Garrison because
he's a traitor by his own say-so.

843
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:32,203
And there's such meanness in a traitor.
Don't you think so, Pres?

844
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,409
Julie spoke to you, Pres.

845
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,993
- Excuse me.
- Oh, just small talk. Don't trouble.

846
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:40,627
I'm sorry. It's... Tonight I'm haunted.

847
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:44,632
- Haunted?
- Only by memories, Uncle Cato.

848
00:57:44,887 --> 00:57:47,259
It's just coming back here.
All my childhood summers.

849
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,711
There's so much to remember.

850
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,678
Remembering?
A forward-looking young banker?

851
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:53,394
Even a banker has memories.

852
00:57:53,562 --> 00:57:56,314
Well, he ought to kill them, then,
or laugh at them.

853
00:57:56,482 --> 00:57:59,399
I interrupted you. You were
about to hang somebody for a traitor.

854
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:01,311
Why, for an abolitionist, Miss Julie.

855
00:58:01,653 --> 00:58:04,857
I think it was Voltaire who said,
"I disagree with everything you say...

856
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:07,529
and I will defend to the death
your right to say it."

857
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,041
Pres, that don't make sense.

858
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:13,238
Maybe Pres got a little beyond us, Buck.

859
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:17,075
We ignorant Southerners simply expect
a gentleman to go by his raising.

860
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:18,830
I think we're all agreed on that.

861
00:58:19,004 --> 00:58:20,961
Here's how I see it. Cotton is king.

862
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,005
Folks are bound to ship cotton
down river.

863
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:25,975
So how can New Orleans keep from
being the greatest city in America,...

864
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:27,042
fever or no fever?

865
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,546
I'm afraid there's more than
fever the matter.

866
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,882
Being up North changed
your point of view.

867
00:58:32,226 --> 00:58:35,926
I hate to say this, but in a war
of commerce, the North must win.

868
00:58:36,104 --> 00:58:38,346
That's a curious thing
for a Southerner to say.

869
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:40,018
It strikes me that way.

870
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:42,861
But maybe Pres
has learned why. Up North.

871
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:48,023
If you must have it, it will be a victory
of machines over unskilled slave labor.

872
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,367
- Preston!
- I don't know that I like that, Dillard.

873
00:58:51,537 --> 00:58:53,306
You're not expected to like it.

874
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:55,285
You'll like it a lot less
when it happens.

875
00:58:55,457 --> 00:58:57,782
And you talk mighty
like a black abolitionist.

876
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:02,035
I think you know I'm no abolitionist.
I believe the tide has turned against us.

877
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:05,583
But I'll swim against that tide
just as far as you will, Cantrell.

878
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,716
Sure, we're all of one mind here.

879
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:10,045
We hate an abolitionist
as we hate the devil.

880
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,057
Naturally, we claim the right
to the customs we were born to.

881
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:15,977
Even some of us who question
the value of those customs.

882
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:19,560
I like my convictions undiluted,
same as I do my bourbon.

883
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:21,771
Frankly, I'm not impressed
by Pres' nightmares.

884
00:59:21,942 --> 00:59:24,231
I've had dreams myself,
but they never come to much.

885
00:59:24,403 --> 00:59:27,736
They slip away from you, and you
wonder how you could've been so silly.

886
00:59:27,906 --> 00:59:29,282
Sure is a fact, Miss Julie.

887
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:34,035
- There was one very curious one I had.
- I'd certainly admire to hear it.

888
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:37,075
Oh, heavens, I wouldn't think
of boring our guests.

889
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:39,076
Shall we go into
the drawing room, ladies?

890
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:42,335
- It wouldn't bore me, Miss Julie.
- Perhaps to you later.

891
00:59:42,504 --> 00:59:44,331
To you alone.

892
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,838
We'll be in the drawing room.
You can find us.

893
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:48,752
You can lay 10-1 on me,
Miss Julie.

894
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:50,505
Gentlemen.

895
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:01,431
Stephanie,
what you giggling about now?

896
01:00:01,607 --> 01:00:03,065
Oh, nothing, Mother.

897
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:05,102
- Your health, sir?
- Thank you.

898
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:06,819
Mighty good to have you back, Pres.

899
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:09,395
Times are so unsettled
we need our good men about us.

900
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:11,696
Looks like it.
If the Yankees don't let us be...

901
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:13,445
we'll have to teach them manners.

902
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,192
I'm afraid facts are against
you doing it as easy as that.

903
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,862
Your facts are to scare women
and sell Northern bonds.

904
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,701
- Cantrell.
- I don't like to hear that.

905
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:24,375
One fact you can't deny: That we're
the guests of a charming hostess.

906
01:00:25,214 --> 01:00:27,586
Sorry, general.
Most likely I misunderstood you, sir.

907
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:30,463
I don't think you misunderstood, sir.
I expressed an opinion.

908
01:00:30,636 --> 01:00:33,127
There was nothing personal about it.
Take it as you like.

909
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:35,180
Why, if it wasn't personal,
I'm satisfied.

910
01:00:35,181 --> 01:00:36,639
Just understand, Cantrell...

911
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:40,343
the question of being satisfied about
my opinions is of no importance to me.

912
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:41,766
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

913
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,512
Don't look like we're in the mood
for political discussion.

914
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:47,645
- Come. Shall we go in to the ladies?
- I'm with you there, general.

915
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,311
Shucks, Buck, we're all friends here.
Old friends.

916
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:52,980
Naturally, we are. Come along.

917
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,491
Buck seems dead set
to pick a quarrel with you.

918
01:01:03,669 --> 01:01:05,329
That's nothing new for Buck.

919
01:01:05,504 --> 01:01:08,789
And Julie, she's set herself up
to fascinate Buck...

920
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,757
like a Gallatin Street girl.

921
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:15,303
Great ladies and Gallatin Street girls,
my dear brother, have a lot in common.

922
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:18,349
Look here, has Julie been...?

923
01:01:19,017 --> 01:01:22,184
The less you crack your teeth,
the longer you'll have them, youngster.

924
01:01:22,354 --> 01:01:24,845
Ted, Pres, Julie wants you both
right away.

925
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:28,475
- Miss Massie is gonna play for us.
- Thanks, Stephanie.

926
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:32,187
- Coming, Pres?
- Yes, of course.

927
01:01:34,283 --> 01:01:35,907
- Uncle Cato.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Pres?

928
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:39,196
How's Miss Julie been?
Has she seen lots of people? I mean...

929
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:41,447
No, sir, she ain't.
She ain't seen nobody much.

930
01:01:41,707 --> 01:01:44,245
Just stay in the house
or ride the horse.

931
01:01:45,085 --> 01:01:47,872
Mr. Pres, your lady take tea
or coffee in the morning?

932
01:01:48,046 --> 01:01:50,419
I hear folks
eats mighty curious up North.

933
01:01:53,302 --> 01:01:54,630
Coffee.

934
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:58,219
Uncle Cato, has Mr. Cantrell
been up here? I mean, before today?

935
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:01,059
No, sir, he ain't. No company at all.

936
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:11,236
- Thanks, Uncle Cato.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.

937
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:39,490
Pres, why did you do it?

938
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:43,487
Why, Pres?

939
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:45,995
Because I love her.

940
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:51,408
- But you had my love.
- And lost it.

941
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:55,793
Wasn't that memory more real
than anything she had to give to you?

942
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,920
Oh, don't be cross with me, Pres.
Just tell me.

943
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,007
- You must.
- Please don't, Julie.

944
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:05,138
Shall I cry for you?

945
01:04:05,392 --> 01:04:08,013
Nobody ever made me cry but you...

946
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,809
and that was only twice.

947
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:14,849
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

948
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:17,357
How much do you remember?

949
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,366
Everything you ever said or did.

950
01:04:22,534 --> 01:04:25,903
But that's passed now, Julie.
Done, finished.

951
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:29,995
I ought to have come to you.
I wanted to so terribly.

952
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:33,121
It was because I wanted to so much
that I couldn't.

953
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:35,913
You do understand that,
don't you, Pres?

954
01:04:36,882 --> 01:04:39,752
I didn't understand.
I just knew what you did.

955
01:04:39,927 --> 01:04:42,003
But you had to come home,
didn't you?

956
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,931
You had to come back to the country
and the things you know...

957
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,509
because you belong here.

958
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,759
Nothing can change that.

959
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,228
Pres, listen.

960
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,057
Can you hear them?

961
01:04:53,232 --> 01:04:55,271
The night noises?

962
01:04:55,484 --> 01:04:58,057
The mockingbird in the magnolia?

963
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,238
See the moss hanging
from the moonlight?

964
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:04,694
You can fairly taste
the night, can't you?

965
01:05:06,912 --> 01:05:08,988
You're part of it, Pres.

966
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,412
And it's part of you...

967
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:14,875
like I am.

968
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:19,005
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

969
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:22,875
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

970
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:26,173
Your country, Pres.
Amy wouldn't understand.

971
01:05:26,348 --> 01:05:28,921
- She'd think there'd be snakes.
- Julie, please.

972
01:05:29,476 --> 01:05:31,433
Oh, it isn't tame
and easy like the North.

973
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:33,975
It's quick and dangerous,
but you trust it.

974
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:37,599
Remember how the fever mist
smells in the bottoms, rank and rotten?

975
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:40,777
But you trust that too
because it's part of you...

976
01:05:40,946 --> 01:05:45,240
just as I'm part of you,
and we'll never let you go.

977
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,203
Pres, you're afraid.

978
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,015
Miss Julie, I thought we'd lost you.

979
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,811
That's a right nice little Yankee.
Pretty as a red wagon.

980
01:06:18,984 --> 01:06:20,312
But trying to talk to her...

981
01:06:20,486 --> 01:06:22,893
- That must've been something.
- I tried her on horses.

982
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:26,322
She told me about a policeman's horse
she'd feed sugar to back North.

983
01:06:26,492 --> 01:06:29,658
I tried her on hound dogs. She thinks
a Walker Hound is one that walks.

984
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:33,114
My zing, don't they educate women
up North? She's just plain ignorant.

985
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,283
Northern girls are just
educated differently.

986
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,582
- She probably knows calculus.
- Sure, Miss Julie.

987
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:39,461
Any flower wench knows calculus.

988
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:43,462
By Calculation, out of Siderial Maid.
Won the Ranger Stakes in '47.

989
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:46,041
What's the matter?
Do you ache anywhere?

990
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,627
- Oh, it's nothing.
- It is.

991
01:06:48,806 --> 01:06:52,506
Look here, Miss Julie, you were out here
a mighty long time with Pres Dillard.

992
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:54,143
Oh, please, Buck.

993
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,434
Pres had just been
punishing the brandy and...

994
01:06:56,605 --> 01:06:57,933
My back teeth.

995
01:06:58,106 --> 01:07:00,942
Did he lose his capacity to drink
like a gentleman in the North?

996
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:04,276
What does he think a lady's house is?
A riverboat bar? What did he do?

997
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:08,574
Buck, I wouldn't have some silly thing
I said be the cause of anything.

998
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:14,120
Miss Julie, you won't be
the cause of anything.

999
01:07:14,289 --> 01:07:16,531
Depend on me.

1000
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,083
Thank you, Buck.

1001
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:25,589
Oh, that's the cannon
from New Orleans.

1002
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:28,795
- You can hear it when the wind's right.
- There it goes again.

1003
01:07:29,096 --> 01:07:32,216
- Wind has shifted to the south.
- I can't bear loud and sudden noises.

1004
01:07:32,391 --> 01:07:35,060
Even firecrackers give me palpitations.

1005
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:38,014
- What is it?
- It's the fever cannon down in the city.

1006
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:39,219
- Fever cannon?
- Yes.

1007
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:41,889
At night they set tar barrels
blazing on every corner.

1008
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:45,151
And the Washington artillery
fire a cannon to fight the plague.

1009
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,565
What good does that do?

1010
01:07:46,738 --> 01:07:50,688
Everybody knows it starts
air currents to carry the fever away.

1011
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:54,902
They might better drain the swamps
and clean up the city.

1012
01:07:55,247 --> 01:07:57,572
- Is that what they do in Yankee land?
- They do.

1013
01:07:57,749 --> 01:08:00,122
And other customs up North
that will bear copying.

1014
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:02,500
Eating horse-feed beans, maybe?

1015
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:04,296
Everyone to his own taste.

1016
01:08:04,756 --> 01:08:06,168
I'll have to remind you, sir,...

1017
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,624
that my wife is a
Northerner and a stranger here.

1018
01:08:08,802 --> 01:08:11,922
- You talk like you're the same.
- See here, Buck!

1019
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:14,922
I'm sorry, but this subject
is an unwelcome one.

1020
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:19,264
Excuse me, but as mistress of the house,
you'll agree with me, I'm sure.

1021
01:08:19,438 --> 01:08:23,103
Why, Aunt Belle, I wouldn't think
of forbidding any subject to my guests.

1022
01:08:25,944 --> 01:08:29,527
Mr. Pres, sir? Here come
a white gentleman looking for you.

1023
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:32,106
- Hello, Jenkins. What is it?
- Dr. Livingstone sent me.

1024
01:08:32,284 --> 01:08:36,412
Mr. La Cour's down bad with the fever.
Doctor says you better come right down.

1025
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,489
Of course. Send a boy for my carriage.

1026
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:41,702
You told him he could go visiting
with his folks down the Riverview.

1027
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:43,704
- Well, Bat will drive you.
- Yes, hurry up.

1028
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:45,124
Sir, Mr. La Cour is bad.

1029
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:48,049
He wants to talk
some bank business to you before...

1030
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:49,675
Well, before it gets too late.

1031
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:53,177
- Was I you, I'd ride. Be quicker.
- All right.

1032
01:08:53,388 --> 01:08:57,054
You'll stop at Halcyon tonight, Jenkins.
Make the journey back at your pleasure.

1033
01:08:57,226 --> 01:09:00,476
Gracious of you, Mistress Massie,
but I must return at once.

1034
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:02,021
Then you'll need a fresh mount.

1035
01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:04,228
There's Bayou Belle and Donna Cona
in the stables.

1036
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,392
Bat will go with you
to bring the horses back.

1037
01:09:06,568 --> 01:09:08,146
- Go along and saddle them.
- Yes.

1038
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,565
Thank you, Aunt Belle.

1039
01:09:09,738 --> 01:09:11,814
- I ought to go with you.
- No, won't take long.

1040
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,319
You come down in the carriage.

1041
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:14,903
- Ted, get me a coat.
- Right away.

1042
01:09:15,077 --> 01:09:16,322
I'm gonna put on some boots.

1043
01:09:16,495 --> 01:09:19,068
You take care of her.
I'll be right back.

1044
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:22,201
Would you care to freshen up,
Mr. Jenkins?

1045
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:23,960
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Would you mind?

1046
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:25,538
Gladly.

1047
01:09:25,712 --> 01:09:27,420
Why, Erroneous.

1048
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:29,209
What are you two doing here?

1049
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:31,671
Zette done say for us
to make inquirements...

1050
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:34,679
when we all is to sing
with you and Master Pres.

1051
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:38,340
Just another old custom, Mrs. Dillard.
Tell Zette they can come up any time.

1052
01:09:38,517 --> 01:09:40,675
- Yes, ma'am.
- What time, Miss Julie?

1053
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:44,186
Ain't you hear?
She done say, "Any time."

1054
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:46,562
- That don't mean nothing.
- It sure do.

1055
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:48,892
Of course it does, Errata.
Just you tell her.

1056
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:50,860
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.
- It do.

1057
01:09:51,071 --> 01:09:52,696
It don't.

1058
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:56,952
Hope you'll all forgive me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Kendrick. Goodbye.

1059
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,242
We understand perfectly, Pres.

1060
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:02,740
- Now, darling, don't fret about me.
- I'll try not to.

1061
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:08,703
- You'll look after Amy, won't you, Ted?
- You needn't have asked.

1062
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:15,260
- Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye, Preston.

1063
01:10:15,888 --> 01:10:19,257
- Goodbye, Pres.
- Goodbye, Julie.

1064
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:36,486
- I do hope everything will be all right.
- It always is.

1065
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:38,698
Of course, it's a pity Pres
had to leave now.

1066
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:41,194
But I suppose his bank comes first.

1067
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:43,245
You don't find that admirable?

1068
01:10:43,415 --> 01:10:44,909
Oh, admirable, I suppose.

1069
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,871
It just seems to me
there are other things more interesting.

1070
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:49,420
I imagine Buck finds it so.

1071
01:10:49,588 --> 01:10:51,746
Why, I never go into
a bank if I can help it.

1072
01:10:51,924 --> 01:10:54,925
Seems like they're studying how
to get something away from somebody.

1073
01:10:55,093 --> 01:10:56,469
I wouldn't say that, Buck.

1074
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:59,341
What Mr. Cantrell means
is that most folks down here...

1075
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:01,306
prefer other pursuits, like planting.

1076
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:03,681
You needn't apologize for Mr. Cantrell.

1077
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:06,343
I'm sure he's capable of defending
his own insinuations.

1078
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:10,140
Why, Mistress Dillard, ma'am,
I surely didn't mean to offend.

1079
01:11:10,484 --> 01:11:12,939
Of course, Amy.
Buck didn't realize what he was saying.

1080
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:15,271
He doesn't even realize
how Julie's using him.

1081
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:16,858
- Ted.
- How you mean that, son?

1082
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:19,982
I don't get the sense of it,
but it don't sound polite.

1083
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,275
You know what I mean.

1084
01:11:21,453 --> 01:11:24,288
Julie's been egging you on,
first against Pres and now his wife.

1085
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:26,034
- Ted, be quiet!
- I meant what I said.

1086
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,667
Let's figure I didn't hear, then.

1087
01:11:28,252 --> 01:11:30,873
And I'd keep Miss Julie's name
out of your conversation.

1088
01:11:31,046 --> 01:11:33,715
You're fool enough to defend
what you don't even understand?

1089
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:36,207
Buck, don't you pay
any attention to him.

1090
01:11:36,802 --> 01:11:38,960
I don't see anybody
that needs any defense.

1091
01:11:39,138 --> 01:11:41,807
If I did, I'd make out
to defend them, yes.

1092
01:11:42,307 --> 01:11:45,392
- Let's put it this way, Mr. Cantrell.
- Now, Ted.

1093
01:11:45,644 --> 01:11:49,143
All evening long, I thought you coarse
and loud and not a gentleman.

1094
01:11:49,314 --> 01:11:52,102
That's better. No need for that.

1095
01:11:52,276 --> 01:11:54,019
Very well, Mr. Dillard, sir.

1096
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:56,103
I'd be glad of your kindness, Dick.

1097
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,774
Happy to do you the honor.

1098
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,739
You young jackass.

1099
01:11:59,908 --> 01:12:03,158
- Buck, you surely don't mean to...
- Miss Belle, don't mean nothing at all.

1100
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:04,823
Just talking.

1101
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:14,996
What does he mean to do, Aunt Belle?

1102
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:17,800
Buck.

1103
01:12:20,512 --> 01:12:24,177
- Of course you're joking?
- Joking, ma'am?

1104
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,765
Buck, I forbid you.
As a guest in my house.

1105
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:30,183
Forbid me what, ma'am?

1106
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:34,768
- To do what you're planning.
- I don't know what you mean, Miss Julie.

1107
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:36,402
Oh, stop play-acting.

1108
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,609
Your stupid code. It's for fools.

1109
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:41,532
You, too, beginning to think
our customs are old-fashioned?

1110
01:12:42,034 --> 01:12:44,525
Oh, Buck, I beg you.
This mustn't happen.

1111
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,410
I don't understand.

1112
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,584
I guess there's a lot
I don't understand.

1113
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:46,051
Naturally, you'll apologize to Buck.

1114
01:13:46,223 --> 01:13:48,679
General Bogardus,
may I put myself in your hands?

1115
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:51,139
You'll be good enough
to make the arrangements.

1116
01:13:51,311 --> 01:13:53,849
Ted, listen to me.
You can't do this. You must've...

1117
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:05,238
Uncle Thee, you won't let this go
any further, will you?

1118
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:07,448
Mighty little I can do about it now.

1119
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:11,617
- Naturally, I'll do everything I can.
- Whatever it is, you must do it.

1120
01:14:11,957 --> 01:14:13,950
Isn't this what you wanted, Julie?

1121
01:14:14,126 --> 01:14:16,451
Or did your plans go astray?

1122
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:34,221
We women can start the men quarreling
often enough.

1123
01:14:34,438 --> 01:14:36,561
We can't ever stop them.

1124
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:50,823
Come on.
"Let's Raise a Ruckus Tonight."

1125
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:27,520
- Julie.
- Come on, sing, Aunt Belle.

1126
01:15:27,699 --> 01:15:29,110
Have the little Yankee join in.

1127
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,570
We have such charming customs
down here.

1128
01:15:40,295 --> 01:15:42,252
That's why I wore
my white dress tonight.

1129
01:15:42,422 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm being baptized.

1130
01:16:10,325 --> 01:16:13,741
You'd no business to take him up, a
youngster that's never been out before.

1131
01:16:13,912 --> 01:16:16,582
Why, if he's gonna talk man-size,
he's gotta act man-size.

1132
01:16:16,748 --> 01:16:18,658
- But, Buck...
- Why, Dick, he's lucky.

1133
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:22,748
All I aim to do is clip a wing.
Fix him so he won't fly too high.

1134
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:31,964
Mighty nervous feeling
the first time you face shot.

1135
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:35,757
Wish I could tell him,
but that would be highly irregular.

1136
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:38,018
Anyhow, it might hurt his feelings.

1137
01:16:39,771 --> 01:16:42,689
Don't be a fool, Ted. Buck has offered
twice to accept an apology.

1138
01:16:42,858 --> 01:16:44,934
He doesn't want to fight you.

1139
01:16:46,487 --> 01:16:48,230
You realize what you're up against?

1140
01:16:48,405 --> 01:16:51,904
I've had the benefit of Buck Cantrell's
skill and experience.

1141
01:16:52,117 --> 01:16:54,608
I'll make the best use of it I can.

1142
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:57,114
Gentlemen, take your places.

1143
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:02,459
Remember, gentlemen,
you turn and fire at the count of 10.

1144
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:05,119
- Very good, sir.
- Places.

1145
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:08,421
- Are you ready?
- At your service, sir.

1146
01:17:08,592 --> 01:17:10,335
Ready, sir.

1147
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:15,551
Gentlemen. One, two, three, four...

1148
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:21,431
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

1149
01:17:35,536 --> 01:17:38,287
Are you savages, you Southerners?

1150
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:50,589
I'll fix him so he don't garter
around me no more.

1151
01:17:50,759 --> 01:17:52,384
Good morning.

1152
01:17:52,845 --> 01:17:54,425
What brought you all out so early?

1153
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:57,257
It's a grand morning,
I couldn't resist it.

1154
01:17:57,516 --> 01:17:59,343
Where are the gentlemen?

1155
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,344
- You know very well where they are.
- Oh, yes, at a meeting.

1156
01:18:03,522 --> 01:18:07,021
A silly custom, but a part of what
we Southerners call our chivalry.

1157
01:18:07,192 --> 01:18:09,066
You know, sometimes I envy them.

1158
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:10,586
To face the one you hate,...

1159
01:18:11,181 --> 01:18:13,814
to kill or be killed,
to settle something.

1160
01:18:14,032 --> 01:18:17,532
We can't do that. We're women.
Oh, Zette, aren't they beautiful?

1161
01:18:17,703 --> 01:18:20,823
Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.
Right nice and pretty.

1162
01:18:21,206 --> 01:18:23,163
Right nice and pretty.

1163
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:25,575
Pretty enough for Ted's grave.

1164
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:32,966
Ted.

1165
01:18:47,733 --> 01:18:48,764
Buck's dead.

1166
01:18:50,903 --> 01:18:53,476
I never saw a man die before.

1167
01:18:55,741 --> 01:18:58,030
He knew what you had done.

1168
01:18:59,036 --> 01:19:01,242
Before he died, he told me so.

1169
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:18,887
- Miss Amy, we're leaving, get ready.
- Thank you, general.

1170
01:19:19,056 --> 01:19:22,140
Miss Molly, you'll ride back with us.
Dick will follow.

1171
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:28,932
I quite understand, Uncle Thee.

1172
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:32,185
My respects, ma'am.

1173
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:34,941
I'll arrange to turn my guardianship
over to the bank.

1174
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:44,696
- Julie, I...
- Stephanie.

1175
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:09,437
All right, Zette.

1176
01:20:34,423 --> 01:20:37,756
Well, say it.
What are you thinking?

1177
01:20:38,427 --> 01:20:41,796
I'm thinking of a woman
called Jezebel...

1178
01:20:42,014 --> 01:20:44,505
who did evil in the sight of God.

1179
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:20,961
He's to bury.

1180
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:25,304
- More killing.
- Sorry, gentlemen, a case of "had to."

1181
01:21:25,474 --> 01:21:26,505
- A fugitive?
- No.

1182
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:30,052
Just a poor fool who was crazy enough
to think he could run the fever line.

1183
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:31,604
- Has it spread this far?
- Sure.

1184
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:34,477
Spreading like wildfire
all along the river, yellow jack is.

1185
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:37,686
We got orders to shoot whoever tries
to pass the parish boundaries...

1186
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:38,892
coming or going.

1187
01:21:39,071 --> 01:21:41,277
You mean no one can get
downriver to New Orleans?

1188
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:43,192
That's the law, gentlemen.

1189
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:46,778
Mind if we leave the body here
till we can get a wagon?

1190
01:21:57,381 --> 01:21:59,788
I'm sorry, ladies.
You heard what the sheriff said.

1191
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:04,679
Uncle Cato,
bring the baggage back in.

1192
01:22:05,764 --> 01:22:08,433
Ladies and gentlemen,
my home is yours, as always.

1193
01:24:14,476 --> 01:24:16,801
That's today's crop for Lazarette Island.

1194
01:24:44,298 --> 01:24:45,543
Excuse me.

1195
01:24:45,716 --> 01:24:47,958
- Good evening, doctor.
- Good evening.

1196
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,415
- Bourbon.
- Certainly, doctor.

1197
01:24:49,595 --> 01:24:51,421
Make mine double.

1198
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:55,429
Well, they might as well now.
Good a time as any.

1199
01:24:58,937 --> 01:25:00,957
Ain't that kind of unusual for you,
son?

1200
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,769
Are you telling me what I can drink?

1201
01:25:02,983 --> 01:25:04,608
Why, Pres...

1202
01:25:05,444 --> 01:25:06,903
Lord.

1203
01:25:07,112 --> 01:25:09,568
Dr. Livingstone,
I don't know why I said that.

1204
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,491
- Don't you feel right, son?
- Kind of edgy, maybe.

1205
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,782
It's been a tough day.
I caught chill walking up.

1206
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:16,863
Chill? You better be easing down.

1207
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:19,956
With La Cour gone, we want you
to clear up that mess in the bank.

1208
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:22,533
It couldn't be.
I saw him myself day before yesterday.

1209
01:25:22,711 --> 01:25:24,787
Well, I saw him an hour ago.

1210
01:25:24,963 --> 01:25:27,252
You think I don't know
a dead man when I see one...

1211
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,835
and him laying in his coffin?

1212
01:25:29,009 --> 01:25:31,334
- His folks brought the body down.
- What happened now?

1213
01:25:31,512 --> 01:25:33,800
Huger here claims
Buck Cantrell is dead.

1214
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:35,301
- What? Buck, dead?
- Fever?

1215
01:25:35,474 --> 01:25:36,719
Sure, Huger, you're crazy.

1216
01:25:36,892 --> 01:25:38,968
I'll give 20-1
Buck Cantrell is to bury.

1217
01:25:39,186 --> 01:25:41,724
I'll give 10-to-1
Ted Dillard shot him in a duel.

1218
01:25:41,897 --> 01:25:43,557
Ten-to-one?

1219
01:25:43,732 --> 01:25:45,938
Ted Dillard follows him
around like a hound dog.

1220
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:48,897
Ted Dillard? And Buck? The best
pistol shot in Louisiana?

1221
01:25:49,071 --> 01:25:50,351
Come on.

1222
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:53,982
- Twenty-to-one. Any takers?
- Yes.

1223
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,152
I believe I heard you make
a private matter...

1224
01:25:56,328 --> 01:25:59,495
that concerns my family
the subject of a bet.

1225
01:26:00,457 --> 01:26:04,585
- Why, Dillard. I'm mighty sorry.
- It's not a thing to bet on.

1226
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:07,664
No, I reckon you're right.

1227
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,509
Only there's been so many
dead folks lately, that...

1228
01:26:14,471 --> 01:26:17,472
- Dillard.
- Why?

1229
01:26:21,186 --> 01:26:23,013
- Yellow jack!
- We must get out of here!

1230
01:26:23,188 --> 01:26:24,932
- Yellow jack!
- Yellow jack!

1231
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:29,150
Get out of here!

1232
01:26:33,365 --> 01:26:35,192
One of you lend a hand here.

1233
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:41,452
Ain't the one of you got enough whiskey
in him to give you a little courage?

1234
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:48,994
You're gonna let him lie here,
you drunken blackguards?

1235
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,210
If one of you don't help me, everyone
of you whose face I remember...

1236
01:26:53,385 --> 01:26:56,754
I'll call out, if you live through
this epidemic, to be challenged.

1237
01:26:57,347 --> 01:26:59,055
You, Laurette.

1238
01:26:59,933 --> 01:27:03,717
Taylor, Van Noy, come on! Come on!

1239
01:27:38,472 --> 01:27:41,259
- Some rice, Dick?
- No, thank you.

1240
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:45,888
- More gumbo, Uncle Thee?
- Thank you.

1241
01:28:19,138 --> 01:28:21,344
Serve the wine, Uncle Cato.

1242
01:28:23,308 --> 01:28:25,799
Miss Julie, please, ma'am.
Bat, he just come.

1243
01:28:25,978 --> 01:28:30,141
Say Dr. Livingstone sent him back.
Mr. Pres, he got the fever bad.

1244
01:28:31,316 --> 01:28:34,353
- The fever?
- Pres? It can't be.

1245
01:28:35,154 --> 01:28:39,234
Yes, ma'am. He take him to your house
because hotel folks won't take him in.

1246
01:28:39,408 --> 01:28:43,406
He say y'all get there quick, before
they hustle him off to that leper place.

1247
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:46,330
Leper place? What does he mean?

1248
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:50,166
Lazarette Island,
where they ship the fever victims.

1249
01:28:51,503 --> 01:28:53,875
- Get our carriage.
- But, Ted, you can't get through.

1250
01:28:54,047 --> 01:28:57,416
Cato, have a couple of horses saddled.
Ted, come with me. You all stay here.

1251
01:28:57,593 --> 01:29:00,344
Miss Amy, I'll get a pass
from the governor, short of killing.

1252
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:03,762
You and Miss Amy be dressed and ready.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

1253
01:29:06,185 --> 01:29:08,011
- Bat?
- Yes, Miss Julie.

1254
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:09,597
Go on and eat. Go on.

1255
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:12,559
How come they let you through
the fever line? Sit down and eat.

1256
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:14,586
They never. I just
kind of oozed through.

1257
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:15,318
How?

1258
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:17,110
Well, when the white gentlemen
stop me...

1259
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,565
I leave the horse and go walking
across the back of the parish...

1260
01:29:20,741 --> 01:29:22,733
because I'm bound
to get back to Halcyon.

1261
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:25,198
I just kind of squinched
through the cane by the bayou.

1262
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,743
- You swam the bayou?
- No, ma'am, Miss Julie.

1263
01:29:27,915 --> 01:29:29,492
I scared of them gators.

1264
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,493
I just kind of found me
a double-end boat.

1265
01:29:31,668 --> 01:29:34,456
It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
I fixing to take it back.

1266
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:37,381
You are. You're going back right now.
And I'm going with you.

1267
01:29:37,549 --> 01:29:39,672
Get me a cloak.
I'll meet you at the smokehouse.

1268
01:29:39,843 --> 01:29:41,219
- Miss Julie...
- Go on. Hurry!

1269
01:29:41,386 --> 01:29:43,213
Miss Julie, ma'am!

1270
01:29:44,139 --> 01:29:46,048
It's too risky
for a white lady, Miss Julie.

1271
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:49,344
I kind of mix in with the night.
But them sheriff folks ain't fooling.

1272
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,103
They're shooting first
and asking after.

1273
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,271
Bat, we're going!

1274
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:54,064
But, Miss Julie...

1275
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:57,227
Get me a coat.

1276
01:31:07,764 --> 01:31:10,635
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1277
01:31:14,646 --> 01:31:16,722
- Miss Julie!
- Doctor, is Pres still here?

1278
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:18,938
- Why, yes, ma'am.
- Thank heaven.

1279
01:31:19,276 --> 01:31:22,360
Gros Bat, all right, go around
to the quarters, and thank you.

1280
01:31:22,529 --> 01:31:24,356
- How is he?
- As well as can be expected.

1281
01:31:24,531 --> 01:31:26,571
He's up in your room.
I had to bring him here.

1282
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:29,315
- No hotel would take him.
- Naturally. His place is here.

1283
01:31:29,495 --> 01:31:31,155
Miss Julie!

1284
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:33,988
I don't think
you ought to go up there.

1285
01:31:47,596 --> 01:31:51,510
Yes... Blood... Blood...

1286
01:31:59,691 --> 01:32:02,313
That's what is...

1287
01:32:02,903 --> 01:32:04,860
You oughtn't
to be in here, Miss Julie.

1288
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:07,486
Yellow jack's mighty catching.

1289
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,759
Pres.

1290
01:32:31,348 --> 01:32:33,720
It's my head.

1291
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:36,759
Just keep on applying
the cold compresses.

1292
01:32:36,937 --> 01:32:39,060
That's all we can do.

1293
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:48,740
- Get some ice.
- Yes, ma'am.

1294
01:32:48,907 --> 01:32:50,615
Be quick.

1295
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,654
It's a part of a...

1296
01:33:03,255 --> 01:33:06,754
Remember... White...

1297
01:34:23,585 --> 01:34:24,617
Why, Miss Belle.

1298
01:34:24,795 --> 01:34:26,455
- How'd you get through?
- We got a pass.

1299
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,661
- Pres is here?
- Yes.

1300
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,871
How is he?

1301
01:34:29,049 --> 01:34:30,330
- Are you Mrs. Dillard?
- Yes.

1302
01:34:30,509 --> 01:34:32,418
Well, he's no better
and he's no worse.

1303
01:34:32,594 --> 01:34:35,928
- Please take me to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

1304
01:35:27,566 --> 01:35:29,060
Pres, dear.

1305
01:35:38,285 --> 01:35:40,741
Please, doctor, you must tell me.

1306
01:35:43,332 --> 01:35:46,249
Then it's true.
They're gonna take him away?

1307
01:35:47,252 --> 01:35:50,253
It was the only thing
I could decently do.

1308
01:35:52,716 --> 01:35:55,919
- I'll be to kill first.
- There's been enough of killing, son.

1309
01:35:56,094 --> 01:35:59,214
Pres is a fever patient.
I had to report him so.

1310
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:01,927
You reported him?

1311
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,638
Have you any idea what would happen
in New Orleans now...

1312
01:36:04,812 --> 01:36:06,833
if folks got to thinking
there's one law for the rich...

1313
01:36:06,834 --> 01:36:08,856
and another for the poor?

1314
01:36:09,024 --> 01:36:11,230
Mistress Dillard,
I put Pres on his first horse.

1315
01:36:11,443 --> 01:36:13,732
I caught his daddy
out of the saddle when he died...

1316
01:36:13,904 --> 01:36:15,943
at Buena Vista ahead of his men.

1317
01:36:16,114 --> 01:36:18,950
Pres is beyond talking,
but I know him and I know his breeding.

1318
01:36:19,117 --> 01:36:20,660
I know what he'd say.

1319
01:36:20,828 --> 01:36:22,867
He's a man of honor.

1320
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:28,283
And I've got to get on down
to the wharf.

1321
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:47,135
Miss Julie,
you're looking mighty worn-out.

1322
01:36:47,312 --> 01:36:49,803
You'd better get yourself some sleep.

1323
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:52,985
Otherwise, we'll be sending you
off to the island too.

1324
01:37:02,494 --> 01:37:04,286
Doctor?

1325
01:37:06,081 --> 01:37:07,706
Doctor?

1326
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,491
When they come for Pres,
I'm going with him.

1327
01:37:10,919 --> 01:37:11,951
Mistress Dillard...

1328
01:37:12,129 --> 01:37:14,667
You must arrange it
so that I can go with my husband.

1329
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,797
- But it's unthinkable.
- Will you arrange it?

1330
01:37:16,967 --> 01:37:18,924
You must, doctor.

1331
01:37:20,512 --> 01:37:22,339
You're asking a mighty terrible thing.

1332
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:24,922
Oh, doctor, will you?
I know what I'm asking.

1333
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,725
Will you?

1334
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,180
Yes, if you want it.

1335
01:37:30,355 --> 01:37:32,063
Thank you.

1336
01:37:41,033 --> 01:37:42,491
Amy.

1337
01:37:45,871 --> 01:37:48,492
Of course, it's your right to go.
You're his wife.

1338
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,369
But are you fit to go?

1339
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:51,953
Loving him isn't enough.

1340
01:37:52,127 --> 01:37:54,749
If you gave him all your strength,
would it be enough?

1341
01:37:54,922 --> 01:37:57,210
- I'll make him live, or die with him.
- Amy.

1342
01:37:58,217 --> 01:38:00,542
Amy, do you know the Creole word
for fever powder?

1343
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:01,964
For food and water?

1344
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:04,260
How to talk to a sullen,
overworked black boy...

1345
01:38:04,431 --> 01:38:06,340
and make him fear you
and help you?

1346
01:38:06,517 --> 01:38:08,871
Pres' life and yours will hang
on things just like that,...

1347
01:38:09,081 --> 01:38:11,225
and you'll both surely die.

1348
01:38:15,734 --> 01:38:17,063
Then it'll have to be that way.

1349
01:38:17,236 --> 01:38:20,342
It's not a question of proving
your love by laying down your life.

1350
01:38:20,343 --> 01:38:21,364
Nothing so easy.

1351
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:23,358
Have you the knowledge
and the strength...

1352
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:26,700
to fight for his life and for your own
as one will have to fight?

1353
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:29,570
Amy, it's no longer you or me.

1354
01:38:30,707 --> 01:38:33,744
- What do you mean?
- I'll make him live. I will.

1355
01:38:33,919 --> 01:38:35,746
Whatever you might do,
I can do more...

1356
01:38:35,921 --> 01:38:38,590
because I know how to fight
better than you.

1357
01:38:40,717 --> 01:38:43,255
Amy, if you knew
the horror of that place.

1358
01:38:43,428 --> 01:38:46,762
It isn't a hospital.
It's a desolate island haunted by death.

1359
01:38:46,932 --> 01:38:49,340
They'll put Pres in an open shed
with a hundred others.

1360
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:52,768
You must be there with him day and
night, watching every breath he draws.

1361
01:38:52,938 --> 01:38:54,598
You must bathe him, keep him clean...

1362
01:38:54,773 --> 01:38:56,932
give him drugs,
fight for his food and water.

1363
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:59,232
You must keep the living from him,
and the dead.

1364
01:38:59,403 --> 01:39:02,108
Be there by him,
with your body between him and death.

1365
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:03,858
Amy, I...

1366
01:39:16,461 --> 01:39:17,956
Where is he?

1367
01:39:18,422 --> 01:39:21,257
Upstairs. End of the hall.

1368
01:39:42,696 --> 01:39:46,147
- I'm not afraid.
- No, you're not afraid.

1369
01:39:46,325 --> 01:39:48,317
You're the bravest woman I ever saw.

1370
01:39:48,494 --> 01:39:51,245
I even believe
you have the courage to save him...

1371
01:39:51,413 --> 01:39:54,449
by giving me the right
to go in your place.

1372
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:57,078
You're not afraid to die.

1373
01:39:57,252 --> 01:40:01,914
I boldly ask a greater sacrifice
in Pres' name, his life.

1374
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:04,084
And for yourself?

1375
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:08,342
I'm asking for the chance to prove I
can be brave and strong and unselfish.

1376
01:40:08,514 --> 01:40:10,008
Help me, Amy.

1377
01:40:10,182 --> 01:40:13,432
Help me make myself clean again,
as you are clean.

1378
01:40:17,272 --> 01:40:20,476
Let me prove myself worthy
of the love I bear him.

1379
01:40:22,277 --> 01:40:26,357
Julie, tell me, something
that only you can tell me...

1380
01:40:26,865 --> 01:40:29,024
does Pres still love you?

1381
01:40:29,409 --> 01:40:31,283
He himself might not know,
but you would.

1382
01:40:33,038 --> 01:40:35,196
- Amy, you must let me go with him.
- Tell me.

1383
01:40:35,374 --> 01:40:38,079
What does it matter who he loves?
It's his life that matters.

1384
01:40:38,252 --> 01:40:39,912
Tell me.

1385
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:44,040
We both know.

1386
01:40:44,258 --> 01:40:46,167
Pres loves his wife.

1387
01:40:49,138 --> 01:40:50,797
Who else would he love?

1388
01:40:51,014 --> 01:40:52,888
Not me, surely.

1389
01:40:53,892 --> 01:40:56,134
I've done too much against him.

1390
01:40:57,146 --> 01:41:00,312
You see, I never knew
how to be gentle and brave as you are.

1391
01:41:00,774 --> 01:41:02,850
Had there been any love
in his heart for me...

1392
01:41:03,026 --> 01:41:04,984
I'd have taken him from you.

1393
01:41:05,487 --> 01:41:07,563
I tried and failed...

1394
01:41:09,032 --> 01:41:11,072
because he loves only you.

1395
01:41:14,788 --> 01:41:18,572
I'm grateful to you for telling me,
but I had to know.

1396
01:41:55,746 --> 01:41:56,777
Amy.

1397
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:01,992
God protect you and Pres.

1398
