1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,781
I know where the Cup is.

2
00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:02,039
[Simon] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

3
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:04,260
[Clary] <i>The tarot cards. My mom
must have painted them years ago.</i>

4
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,973
<i>The Mortal Cup has to be
hidden inside.</i> [gasps]

5
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,193
The Clave thinks our family
honor's beyond repair.

6
00:00:08,228 --> 00:00:10,248
It's gonna require a tremendous sacrifice.

7
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,423
Our parents are making
plans for both of us.

8
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,923
[cell phone rings and beeps]

9
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,332
- [Clary] <i>Leave one at the beep.</i>
- I need to talk to you

10
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,398
more than I've ever needed
to talk to you in my life.

11
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,627
I think I'm becoming a vampire.

12
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,582
I was wondering when you'd come back.

13
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,480
[Simon screams]

14
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:25,431
- I got the Cup.
- I don't care about the Cup.

15
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:32,937
It just looks like a wine glass.

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,192
That wine glass saved your life.

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,463
What if... what if I hadn't
gotten the Cup out in time?

18
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:40,649
- That demon...
- But you did.

19
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,601
First rule of Shadowhunting...

20
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:45,219
when something explodes, just keep walking.

21
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,168
Never think twice. Never look away.

22
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:51,278
And what's the second rule?

23
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:57,039
There's nothing a
Shadowhunter can't do in heels.

24
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,348
[Jace] Alec, what are you doing?

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,598
You can stare at this monitor all you want,

26
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,354
they need angel blood
to get past the wards.

27
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,729
You know that.

28
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,823
No Downworlder can come into the Institute.

29
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,243
Not without an invite by a Shadowhunter.

30
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,993
Last I checked, Valentine
is a Shadowhunter.

31
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:18,419
The Cup is not safe here. We
have to give it back to the Clave.

32
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,132
Give it back to the Clave? No.

33
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,593
Not after everything we
went through to get it.

34
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:23,028
My brother is right.

35
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:24,923
- The Cup is extremely important.
- [Clary sighs]

36
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,684
Are you agreeing with me?

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,051
I'm full of surprises.

38
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:31,101
This Cup is the one chance I
have at getting my mom back.

39
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,754
I agree with Clary.

40
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,236
We can't give the Cup
to the Clave, not now.

41
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,559
We need it.

42
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:38,489
It's our only bargaining chip.

43
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:41,264
Look, I know how powerful this Cup is.

44
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,987
It has the power to
create new Shadowhunters,

45
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:46,615
control demons and even kill a
mundane if they drank from it.

46
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,069
But I promise you,

47
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:51,115
I will not let that
monster get his hands on it.

48
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,523
There you go. You have her word.

49
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:56,261
[sighs]

50
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,394
Follow me.

51
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,688
Alec, I realize I couldn't have

52
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,789
done any of this without your help.

53
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,014
I wanna thank you.

54
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:24,758
Don't misread this as friendship.

55
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:28,242
Since you've arrived, our whole
world's been turned upside down.

56
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,308
[breathes heavily]

57
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:41,664
[line ringing]

58
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,925
[Simon] <i>It's Simon. Leave a message.</i>

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,834
Simon, sorry I didn't
get back to you sooner.

60
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,527
Been crazy busy.

61
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:51,226
We found the Cup. I
have so much to tell you.

62
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:52,884
Call me back.

63
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,510
[beeping]

64
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:58,548
- What the... Huh?
- [loud beeping]

65
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,968
[Jace] There's something
outside the perimeter.

66
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,281
- I told you...
- Don't say it.

67
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,248
- What's happening?
- [Isabelle sighs]

68
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,056
Looks like someone's trying to break in.

69
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,244
Could be the Circle.

70
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:10,754
- Told you so.
- [sighs] Too soon.

71
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,554
[Jace] Don't move.

72
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,823
Drop what you're holding.
Put your hands up.

73
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,710
[Clary breathing heavily]

74
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,871
Oh, my God, Simon!

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

76
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:57,896
People will be wondering what
we found outside the perimeter.

77
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:01,532
[Alec] I'll go. I'll tell
'em we didn't find anything.

78
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,316
Nobody will come down here.

79
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:07,258
[Raphael] I might be a vampire...

80
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,690
but I was raised a good Catholic.

81
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,159
[Isabelle] The vampires
breached the Accords.

82
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:19,773
Killing Simon is grounds for war.

83
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:22,459
The vampires were not behind this.

84
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:25,429
Just Camille. She
attacked Simon on her own.

85
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:26,943
And how do we know
you're telling the truth?

86
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,310
I could have gotten rid of him,

87
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:30,305
but instead I brought him here.

88
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,565
I don't want trouble
with the Shadowhunters.

89
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,875
Smart decision.

90
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,610
I warned the mundane to stay away...

91
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:38,236
but Camille gave him a
taste of her own blood,

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,075
and like an addict...

93
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,161
he came back wanting more.

94
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,092
The only reason Simon ever tasted

95
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,416
Camille's blood is because of you.

96
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:49,693
You kidnapped him! You drug
him to Hotel DuMort. You...

97
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,221
You delivered him to Camille!

98
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:54,381
I never meant for this to happen.

99
00:04:56,743 --> 00:05:00,459
[sobbing] Simon. Simon,
please come back, please!

100
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,905
There is a way.

101
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,184
"A way" what?

102
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,103
A way to bring Simon back.

103
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,901
[Clary] You can do that?

104
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,973
How? How?

105
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,545
He's a fledgling.

106
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,928
It's a state of transition.

107
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,529
Your friend can be resurrected.

108
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,096
- No.
- Clary, no.

109
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:25,643
[stammers] So I could have Simon back?

110
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,174
Alive and breathing?

111
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,761
That's just it.

112
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,978
He won't return alive or breathing.

113
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,072
He'll be a vampire.

114
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,015
[Jace] And not the sexed up, romantic kind.

115
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,536
The ugly, bloodsucking,
coffin-dwelling kind.

116
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,464
That's offensive.

117
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,941
Really?

118
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,381
Coffin implies wooden box.

119
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:47,645
We have caskets now. They're
made of 14-karat gold.

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,290
[clicks tongue] My bad.

121
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:52,179
It's almost sunrise.

122
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,969
Simon must be turned into a vampire
tonight or staked through the heart.

123
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,724
And if I do neither?

124
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,214
His soul will be trapped for eternity.

125
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:04,135
You have till sunset to decide.

126
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:06,761
The clock is ticking.

127
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:08,410
[sighs]

128
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:17,340
Remember what you said to me
the morning of our wedding?

129
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,864
We weren't supposed to see each
other until the ceremony, but you...

130
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:24,475
you wouldn't listen to rules.

131
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,231
You never did.

132
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,472
[sighs] And that's why I love you.

133
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,528
You told me our hearts...

134
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:38,738
beat as one and that we
would be together forever.

135
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,126
[energy pulsating]

136
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:43,809
I hope you've returned with good news.

137
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,906
The girl has the Cup.

138
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,365
Do you hear that, Jocelyn?

139
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,488
Clarissa did it.

140
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,468
It's evident she has your
determination and my curiosity.

141
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,751
Did you really think I
wouldn't figure it out, hmm?

142
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,435
You left 18 years ago
with my unborn daughter.

143
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:10,548
I guess we'll just have to
make up for lost time, hmm?

144
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,026
If she found the Cup...

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,884
where is it?

146
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,143
[Blackwell] She got back
to the Institute, sir.

147
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,059
Lucian Graymark got in the way.

148
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,310
Got in the way how?

149
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,577
He's the leader of the New York pack now.

150
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,302
She's under their protection.

151
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:26,969
[sighs]

152
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,604
Oh, Lucian.

153
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,767
Always so chivalrous.

154
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,338
[Robert] <i>Valentine's
getting stronger</i>

155
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,325
and we're just sitting here
on the sidelines waiting...

156
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,550
doing nothing.

157
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:40,468
The Clave is handling things.

158
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,611
Oh, that's a joke, Maryse.

159
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,742
You and I both know how
the Clave handles things.

160
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,422
- [Alec] What's going on?
- Sit.

161
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,868
It's no surprise Jace isn't here.

162
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,064
[Isabelle] He got held up.

163
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,189
Said to start without him.

164
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,693
I'm sure he has a good reason.

165
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,702
[Robert] Your mother and I...

166
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:02,443
Okay, I requested a meeting at the Clave

167
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,213
to inform them that the Seelies
are siding with Valentine.

168
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,803
[sighs] And the Clave denied it.

169
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:09,220
What do you mean? They don't
want you coming to Idris?

170
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,642
There are rumors that local Shadowhunters

171
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,949
have been interfering in Downworld affairs.

172
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,992
But you two wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

173
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,132
- <i>Nada.</i>
- Nope.

174
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,520
[Maryse] Since all this
happened here in New York,

175
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,305
under our command,

176
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,120
they are concerned with our
devotion to our job and the cause.

177
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:23,635
But we're the Lightwoods.

178
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,156
Remember, the honor isn't in the name...

179
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,003
it's in the deed.

180
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,961
The Clave is sending an envoy.

181
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,013
[Maryse] Who will be coming to observe us.

182
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,415
And to gather information
about Valentine to report back.

183
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,966
But really to scrutinize our
leadership, so I beg of the two of you,

184
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,738
don't do anything that
would cause the Clave

185
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,336
to lose even more trust in us.

186
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:47,422
[Simon over voicemail] <i>Clary,
I really need to talk.</i>

187
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,930
<i>I think I'm turning into
a vampire. I'm scared.</i>

188
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,739
I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

189
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,819
[sobs] This is all my fault.

190
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,302
- Clary, this isn't your...
- No, it is!

191
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:07,482
If it weren't for me,

192
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,782
Simon would have never even
known about the Shadow World.

193
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,983
He would never have been
kidnapped by vampires.

194
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:15,389
He wouldn't have met Camille. He would...

195
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,297
He wouldn't be dead.

196
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:21,734
A fledgling. He's in transition.

197
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:24,656
And now I am left with two...

198
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,492
[shudders] two reprehensible choices...

199
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:30,707
[stutters] And I can't
figure out which one is worse.

200
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:36,096
[sighs]

201
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,249
If I, uh...

202
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:42,906
[stutters] if I bury Simon...

203
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,141
- what are the risks?
- Clary, no. Absolutely not.

204
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,853
Jace, I need to know!

205
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:48,342
[sighs]

206
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:51,201
[Raphael] If Simon is buried
and he doesn't emerge...

207
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:55,783
he would be trapped under the
earth... starving for eternity.

208
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,210
Oh, my God.

209
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,599
[sobs]

210
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,279
And, uh...

211
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:08,721
[stutters] if I... if I stake him?

212
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,768
He'll die a human death.

213
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:13,332
It's painless, as far as I know.

214
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,284
[crying] Simon, I'm so sorry.

215
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:26,494
Alec, you think you
could get my stele back?

216
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,751
They took it away because you nearly

217
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,135
burnt down the Mumbai Institute.

218
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:32,036
How many times do I have
to say it was an accident?

219
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,565
Look, Max.

220
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,220
[sighs] Somebody very important
is coming to visit. All right?

221
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,067
You think you can stay out of
trouble for just a couple days?

222
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,866
If you do, I promise
I'll get your stele back.

223
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,272
[door opens]

224
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:13,163
That reaction time was abysmal. [sighs]

225
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,323
Except for you.

226
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,379
I'm Lydia Branwell, envoy from the Clave.

227
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:26,934
Maryse.

228
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,395
The Clave has ordered me to take
temporary control of this Institute.

229
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,333
Wait a minute. Nobody informed us.

230
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:34,197
The Clave doesn't need to.

231
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:38,565
And, to repeat myself, it's temporary.

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,698
Nothing's been decided yet.

233
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:43,868
But I do need full
clearance in order to assess

234
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:46,111
how this Institute is running.

235
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,029
Where is Clary Fairchild?

236
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,544
I would hope someone here knows.

237
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,604
She's in the field, training.

238
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,307
You're telling me she's just...

239
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,848
out and about in the streets of New York?

240
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,224
Valentine's daughter?

241
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,707
Isn't she also your cousin?

242
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,521
Distant cousin.

243
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:09,942
She's with Jace.

244
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,096
The same Jace Wayland who decided to lead

245
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,543
an unsanctioned raid against the vampires?

246
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,255
I've read reports.

247
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,817
Jace might be unconventional,
but he's our best soldier.

248
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,715
If he's with Clary,
then she's in good hands.

249
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,431
I hope so.

250
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,837
And for your sake, all of New York.

251
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:29,759
All of your jurisdiction
better be well protected.

252
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:34,114
[snarling]

253
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,852
[indistinct conversations]

254
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,302
- [banging]
- [Luke shushes]

255
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,942
[glass shattering]

256
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,943
[growls]

257
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:21,475
[growling]

258
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,533
This is a bad idea.

259
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:29,928
- Promise me you won't tell a mundane...
- [sighs]

260
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,642
...that Simon was bitten by a vampire.

261
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,987
I promise.

262
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,686
Good.

263
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,283
'Cause part of our job as Shadowhunters

264
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,538
is making sure mundanes don't...

265
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:38,332
Know the truth?

266
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,878
Don't know anything about the Shadow World.

267
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:42,781
Don't worry, I'm just gonna...

268
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,284
tell her there's an accident. [sighs]

269
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,697
That, um...

270
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,055
[sighs] that Simon's not coming back.

271
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:56,278
I owe his mother that much. She loves him.

272
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:57,852
[footsteps approaching]

273
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,839
I haven't heard anything from
Simon since yesterday, Clary.

274
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,996
And he flipped out on Rebecca and I.

275
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,077
And then just disappeared.

276
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,655
Have you heard from him?
Or have you seen him?

277
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:11,766
Should I be calling the police?

278
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:12,734
No.

279
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,761
No, don't do that. Um...

280
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:18,296
If we needed to, I would have called Luke.

281
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,774
I just want to know if he's all right.

282
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,522
I saw him. [sighs]

283
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:27,689
Oh, my God. You did? Where?

284
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:31,501
[stammering] Where is he? Is he okay?

285
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:37,397
No. [sighs] Not exactly.

286
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,822
[Elaine] Is it drugs? I mean,
he said that it wasn't, but...

287
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:42,491
[Clary] Uh, no, it's not drugs. Um...

288
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,053
- Clary...
- [sighs]

289
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:48,154
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

290
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:55,997
[sighs] Okay, look, the truth is...

291
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,644
[clatters]

292
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,134
What...

293
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:10,588
[Jace whispering] What are you doing?

294
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:13,363
[whispering] I don't know.
Okay, this is really hard.

295
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,346
Be careful.

296
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,924
I will.

297
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,875
Simon got this for me for Mother's Day.

298
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,829
You know, 'cause he's my little... monkey.

299
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,988
Clary, I don't know what I'd
do if anything happened to him.

300
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,548
Rebecca and Simon, they're all I have.

301
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,797
After I lost their
father... [inhales sharply]

302
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:44,475
[sniffles]

303
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,034
[sighs] But you were saying?

304
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,767
To tell me the truth...

305
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,412
Um... [swallows]

306
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,057
[Isabelle] I'm not a fan.

307
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,893
- Jealous?
- No.

308
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,138
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Maybe.

309
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,658
How the hell did she catch that arrow?

310
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,786
[Alec] I have something you need to see.

311
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,721
Something attacked the Jade Wolf.

312
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,128
The werewolves'
headquarters? Where did you...

313
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,977
Where did you get these?

314
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,921
Leader of the New York wolf pack.

315
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:24,150
You're friends with Lucian
Graymark? An ex-Circle member?

316
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:27,392
How about we send Isabelle
and Alec to investigate?

317
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,768
- I'm sure this is linked to...
- [Lydia] Valentine.

318
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,812
I need to see it for myself.

319
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,253
Are you coming or what?

320
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:46,600
Clary...

321
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,937
what happened to the plan?

322
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,511
Tell her that Simon's not coming home.

323
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:52,286
I tried, okay?

324
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,861
I just... I can't.

325
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,619
I'm not ready to just give up on Simon.

326
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,553
[sighs]

327
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,696
Would you stop for a second,
think about what you're doing?

328
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:00,747
I am, Jace, okay?

329
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,051
[stutters] It's like my brain
is telling me to do one thing

330
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,399
and my heart another and...

331
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,430
[sighs]

332
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,197
Okay. Look...

333
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,953
there was a boy...

334
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:17,653
and his father bought him a
falcon for his sixth birthday.

335
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,989
Are you seriously telling
me a story right now?

336
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,612
Please, just listen.

337
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,962
His father told him to tame the bird.

338
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:26,924
Make it obedient.

339
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,296
That's crazy.

340
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,932
And the boy would spend
every day with that falcon.

341
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,691
It would scratch at him.

342
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,192
Make him bleed.

343
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,163
But eventually...

344
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:38,806
he earned its trust.

345
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,976
He brought the bird to his father,

346
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,819
to show him that the bird
would come back to him.

347
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,879
He thought his father would be proud.

348
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,678
And he was, right?

349
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,243
No, Clary.

350
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,882
His father took the falcon
and snapped its neck.

351
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:57,520
Okay, that is the worst
story I have ever heard.

352
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,641
- You're missing the point.
- [sighs]

353
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:03,195
Yes... the boy was devastated.

354
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,098
But he realized his father was right.

355
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,907
He was told to tame the bird...

356
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,051
not to love it.

357
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,879
That's why you have to listen to your head.

358
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,336
If I listened to my heart...

359
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,781
I'd never be able to do my job.

360
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,528
Third rule of Shadowhunting...

361
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,748
emotions cloud judgment.

362
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,252
Jace, if...

363
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:35,520
if being a Shadowhunter means
that I have to be dead inside...

364
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:39,131
I'm not sure I want to be one.

365
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,797
I can see why all the girls in
Idris are clamoring to meet you.

366
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:53,889
What do you mean?

367
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,314
Rumor has it you're
looking to settle down...

368
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,592
- get married.
- Damn it.

369
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,137
Let me guess. Not your idea?

370
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,354
Not even close.

371
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,416
My parents tried to set me up, too.

372
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,180
And how'd that work out?

373
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:06,393
Not well for them.

374
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,344
I made my own path.

375
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,790
Married the love of my life...

376
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,069
John Monteverde.

377
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,060
Together we were going to
run the Lisbon Institute.

378
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:20,043
And then John was killed.

379
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,948
Everything was ripped away.

380
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,947
My love, my dream job...

381
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,916
Piece of advice... [sighs]

382
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,494
In this line of work,

383
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,690
the only thing worth falling
in love with is the work itself.

384
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,656
Lydia, I'm...

385
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:38,458
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,396
[Lydia] It's got some
characteristics of a Forsaken.

387
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:50,148
It was human.

388
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,385
It was runed.

389
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,106
[Luke] I don't know.

390
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,269
It was more focused, more determined.

391
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:58,445
It attacked like it had a plan.

392
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:03,540
Plus, a normal Forsaken wouldn't
have been so hard to kill.

393
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,762
It took five wolves to
take that thing down.

394
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,471
Never seen anything like it.

395
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:10,964
We'll take the body back to the
Institute, do a full autopsy.

396
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,459
Oh, hold up. I get that I called you...

397
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,851
Actually, I called Alec.

398
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,116
But what I didn't want is someone
to come down here and just take over.

399
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,032
Yeah, that's kind of her thing.

400
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:27,077
Look, I know I can come across... abrasive.

401
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:29,124
But we're all on the same side here.

402
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,315
Can we agree on that?

403
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,709
The Institute has the resources

404
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,898
to find out what this thing is.

405
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,018
We have an expert forensic pathologist.

406
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,906
Highly trained in all the
creatures of the Shadow World.

407
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:42,207
[Lydia] Do you have one here?

408
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,025
In this, uh, Chinese restaurant?

409
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:48,367
Fine. You win.

410
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,631
Just let me know what you find.

411
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,441
You think Valentine was behind this?

412
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:56,805
[scoffs] No question.
It's definitely his work.

413
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,178
What do you think he's after?

414
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,922
[Luke] Honestly?

415
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,233
Me.

416
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:03,894
So you think Valentine's
going after ex-Circle members?

417
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,727
[Luke] I don't know. It
might be kind of personal.

418
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,212
We have a complicated past.

419
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:11,619
But of course, he could be
going after the old crew.

420
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:12,870
I'm sure Valentine has a grudge

421
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,930
against anybody who turned against him.

422
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:17,072
We'll put extra wards on the Institute.

423
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,723
Right, for Hodge.

424
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:20,486
And your parents.

425
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:25,633
Did they conceal that from you?

426
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,659
We need to make sure no magic

427
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,853
was used to make this.

428
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:39,622
I'm calling the nearest High
Warlock to come in to consult.

429
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,402
Magnus Bane?

430
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:44,463
To come here to the Institute?

431
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,331
Yes, is there a problem?

432
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,278
No. Not at all.

433
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,366
Magnus is, um...

434
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:54,667
quite magical.

435
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,437
He's, uh, very... very good at magic.

436
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,489
Do you know him well?

437
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,124
Uh, just a little.

438
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,448
I actually can't wait
to meet him. [chuckles]

439
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:10,277
Did you know that my great
ancestor, Henry Branwell,

440
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,635
who was the last of the
Branwells to run an Institute,

441
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:16,009
and Magnus Bane invented
the Portal? [chuckles]

442
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:17,526
No.

443
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:20,401
Just add that to the list
of things I didn't know.

444
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:26,588
Alec. [sighs] I'm sorry.

445
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,741
You shouldn't have had to find out
your parents were ex-Circle members.

446
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,371
Not like that.

447
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,511
You mean from you?

448
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,136
You shouldn't have been
the one I found out from.

449
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:38,617
You know there's been a ban about talking

450
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,517
about the Circle till now.

451
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:42,751
Yeah, how convenient for my parents.

452
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,814
This doesn't change how I
feel about the Lightwoods.

453
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,488
Your family has always had
a strong alliance with mine.

454
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:49,355
They've been a powerful
force in the Shadow World

455
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,613
and praised for their devotion.

456
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:51,805
"Devotion"?

457
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,802
My parents were in league with Valentine.

458
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:57,280
People make mistakes.

459
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:59,327
Yeah, but this one...

460
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,743
it's unforgivable.

461
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,645
[bell chimes]

462
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:15,399
Luke, are you okay?

463
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,581
[Jace] What happened?

464
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,729
Uh... you should see the other guy.

465
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:21,269
We were attacked by a Forsaken,

466
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:22,882
if you can even call it that.

467
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:24,936
Anyway, it's dead.

468
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,056
It looks worse than it was.

469
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,722
- [sighs] Luke, you're hurt.
- Uh, no.

470
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:31,210
Already healed. Perks of being a werewolf.

471
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,492
Anyway, I called Alec.

472
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,052
He took the Forsaken back to
the Institute for an autopsy.

473
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,185
We've got the best forensic
pathologist in New York.

474
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,737
Yeah, so I've heard.

475
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,410
Clary, what are you doing here?

476
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:42,056
Now that you have the Cup,

477
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,815
you know you should be back
at the Institute, protected.

478
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,726
I haven't taken my eyes off her.

479
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,612
I needed to see you.

480
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,043
Luke, it's Simon.

481
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,780
He's, um... [swallows]

482
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,888
Luke, he's dead.

483
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,807
- [shuddering]
- Clary, I'm sorry.

484
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,076
[Clary crying]

485
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,070
[Isabelle] You almost done?

486
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,382
Patience is a virtue, my dear.

487
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,029
[Isabelle] Come on. I want
to get my hands on that thing.

488
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:21,297
Speaking of which, how is Alexander?

489
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:22,882
I was hoping I might hear from him.

490
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:27,318
[sighs] Putrefaction. It's decomposing.

491
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,901
It's just so hard to tell if
Alexander is even interested.

492
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,707
I mean, I can't fathom why he wouldn't be.

493
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:33,735
I'm not sure if you noticed,

494
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,685
but my brother is not
exactly warm and fuzzy.

495
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,640
Hmm, I suppose. With Clary's arrival...

496
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,775
And Valentine's return...

497
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,855
Mmm-hmm. Running the Institute...

498
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,311
The envoy from the Clave...

499
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:46,214
Oh, who I hear is very impressive.

500
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,673
[sighs] What else?

501
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,895
Oh. [scoffs] Babysitting Jace.

502
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,839
[chuckling] And dealing with our parents

503
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,429
who are trying to find him a wife.

504
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,399
Sorry.

505
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,116
It's quite all right.

506
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:04,566
I suppose Alec is just following his duty.

507
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:08,486
Not everyone gets the luxury
of following their heart.

508
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:09,985
[sighs]

509
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,994
I'm gonna go deliver
the preliminary findings.

510
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:16,056
It seems like you have
everything under control here.

511
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,131
Luke, what do I do?

512
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,519
If I bring Simon back then...

513
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:34,033
He'll be a vampire. A Downworlder.

514
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,931
[echoing]

515
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,182
[Luke grunting]

516
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:40,746
It all happened so fast.

517
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,759
[clears throat] One minute,
Valentine was behind me.

518
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,057
[grunts] The next, he was
gone and the door was locked.

519
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,390
But... Valentine loves you.

520
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:51,775
You're his <i>parabatai,</i> his brother.

521
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,774
I know.

522
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,813
If he could do this to you...

523
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,575
we have to stop him.

524
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:57,745
Once you get better.

525
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,941
[breathing heavily]

526
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,030
I won't. [grunts]

527
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:05,315
Luke, if you kill yourself, he wins.

528
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:09,032
And if I don't... [breathing
heavily] I'll turn into a... [groans]

529
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,354
What if I attack you after I turn?

530
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,520
If I hurt you... I
couldn't live with myself.

531
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:20,096
You don't wanna hurt me. Don't do this.

532
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:22,268
Your death... I couldn't survive that.

533
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,084
[grunting] Jocelyn, you have to go.

534
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,939
- I won't.
- [grunts]

535
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,175
- You have to. It's starting.
- No.

536
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,491
Look, please. [breathing heavily]

537
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,615
[yells]

538
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,307
[Jocelyn] I can't tell you what to do.

539
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,862
But if you choose to live, I
hope you learn to love yourself

540
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:44,126
the way I'll always love you.

541
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:52,045
[Luke yells]

542
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,859
[Luke sighs] It wasn't easy going

543
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:57,848
from a revered Shadowhunter to a...

544
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,491
werewolf.

545
00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:01,661
Suddenly, I was foraging for food,

546
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:04,073
unable to control my own body.

547
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:06,258
I lost my family...

548
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,185
my friends.

549
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,131
But not my mom.

550
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,872
No.

551
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,277
Jocelyn never abandoned me.

552
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:19,470
Having you and Jocelyn in my
life kept me from using this.

553
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,823
Knowing that you both needed me.

554
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:25,827
I will never stop needing you.

555
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:30,517
[inhales] Clary... you know
I love Simon like a son.

556
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,489
If you decide to bring him back,

557
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:36,343
just know that his journey won't be easy.

558
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:41,629
So make sure you do it for him...

559
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,721
and not yourself.

560
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:46,308
[sighs]

561
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:49,794
The sun is setting.

562
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,603
Have you decided?

563
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,650
- [thudding]
- [chain rattling]

564
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,019
[breathing heavily]

565
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:24,738
Magnus.

566
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,892
[Alec panting]

567
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:29,233
Okay, I'm back.

568
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,449
Oh, you don't have to
get dressed up for me.

569
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,377
Fine.

570
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,509
But I liked what I saw.

571
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,528
I have the preliminary autopsy findings.

572
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,423
Why are you giving this to me?

573
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,859
This should go to the
head of the Institute.

574
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:47,771
And it is.

575
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,918
I'm not. And I never will be.

576
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,520
Magnus, it's like...

577
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,405
it's like my whole life... has been a lie.

578
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,471
Now, everything I've ever known is...

579
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:01,691
- It's not what you thought.
- [sighs]

580
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:05,061
I've done everything for my parents...

581
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,262
for the Clave and...

582
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:08,980
[breathing heavily]

583
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,543
[stutters] I've done
everything that they've asked.

584
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,416
Maybe you should start living for yourself.

585
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,205
Do what's in your heart.

586
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,478
I can't believe I'm saying this.

587
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:24,497
[breathes deeply] I think you're right.

588
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,413
[rustling]

589
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,239
What do you want?

590
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,321
I want my property back.

591
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:07,524
Simon is not your property.

592
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,049
If you'll just hand him
over, I'll be on my way.

593
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,596
You heard Clary. You're
not laying a hand on him.

594
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:16,332
Fine. I tried to do this the nice way.

595
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:22,393
Jace.

596
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:25,692
I'm glad you brought everyone
here to witness your demise.

597
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:28,528
Camille killed this mundane.

598
00:30:28,682 --> 00:30:30,490
Now, I have all the proof.

599
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:33,287
She's been breaking the
Accords for too long now.

600
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:34,818
He's the evidence we need to show the Clave

601
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,297
what Camille has been doing.

602
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:38,340
[chuckles]

603
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:41,087
Are you trying to overthrow me?

604
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,623
No.

605
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,473
I already have.

606
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,541
Don't listen to him.

607
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,322
Raphael doesn't know the
first thing about leading.

608
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:53,415
You need me. I've given you
everything you could want.

609
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,233
All the riches. All the
pleasures you could desire.

610
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,107
[Raphael] By breaking the law.

611
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,876
Which will only destroy us.

612
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,655
We can fix this.

613
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,035
If we just get rid of the body,
this mundane means nothing.

614
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:12,521
"Means nothing"? Over my dead body.

615
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:14,236
[grunts]

616
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:18,970
[vampires hissing]

617
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,105
[Lydia] The Clave has spoken.

618
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,266
They will be taking full
control of the Institute.

619
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,809
[Maryse] I'm begging you.

620
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,457
You can punish us, but our
children did nothing wrong.

621
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,472
They've worked so hard...

622
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:32,725
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

623
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,694
With everything that's
happened here in New York,

624
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:36,531
plus your history with the Circle,

625
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,452
and now Valentine's return,

626
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,567
the Clave believes the Institute's at risk.

627
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:43,888
We've been trying to stop
Valentine. What has the Clave done?

628
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:45,522
The answer is nothing.

629
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:46,619
He's growing in strength.

630
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,054
They're more concerned about
removing us from the Institute.

631
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:50,650
- Robert.
- [Lydia] The law's hard...

632
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:52,578
but it is the law.

633
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,736
We will await the Clave's instructions.

634
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,979
I have the preliminary results from Magnus.

635
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:02,136
No magic was used in creating the Forsaken.

636
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,805
I'll take them.

637
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:21,309
[Raphael] Clary...

638
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,139
it's time.

639
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:26,802
Which will it be?

640
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:46,901
[exhales]

641
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,022
[Clary sobs]

642
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:05,972
When your grandfather gave you this

643
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:08,606
at your bar mitzvah, you, um...

644
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,334
you told me how much it meant to you.

645
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:15,309
It was a symbol of the
day you became a man.

646
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:19,006
[crying] Simon...

647
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:23,208
Simon, no matter what happens...

648
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:25,140

Lydia, do you have a minute?

661
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:30,431
Alec, I'm sorry about your
parents, but my hands were tied.

662
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,529
Look, I... I know.

663
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,025
The law is hard, but it's
the law, and I respect that.

664
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:39,149
But I've realized that...

665
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,479
I have to listen to my heart.

666
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,764
[chuckles] Let's not
forget where that got me.

667
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:48,260
I know. [stutters] And
I can't bring John back.

668
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:52,770
But, like you said, our
families have been strong allies.

669
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:56,063
And we can use that to our advantage.

670
00:34:56,417 --> 00:35:01,120
Together, we can restore my family
name and we can keep the Institute.

671
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:04,602
And we'd get to run it.

672
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,470
Lydia Branwell...

673
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:16,222
will you marry me, Alec Lightwood?

674
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,173
That mundane's a fighter.

675
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:26,792
He survived the vampires
at the Hotel DuMort.

676
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:29,483
He survived the werewolves at Jade Wolf.

He survived accounting...

for whatever that's worth.

00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:35,694
He is a fighter, isn't he?

00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:39,929
Look, I know you think
emotions cloud judgment...

681
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:41,641
and that whole falcon story,

682
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,996
I... I don't think I'll ever be able

683
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:45,569
to wrap my head around that, but...

684
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,497
all of that contradicts the
first rule of being mundane.

What's the first rule of being mundane?

686
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:58,180
[sighs] It's that love makes you stronger.

687
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,641
It was my mother's love
for me that made her

688
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:04,417
betray Valentine and steal the Cup.

689
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:09,828
It's love that makes you
fight harder for what you want.

[stutters] what's happening?

- [Simon sputters]
- God.

It'll take time to regain the ability.

You're the same Simon

Simon! You are my best friend!
