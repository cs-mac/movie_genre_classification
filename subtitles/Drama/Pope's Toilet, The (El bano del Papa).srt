1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,650
Spain, 1944

2
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,630
The civil war has ended.

3
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,110
Hidden in the mountains,

4
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,590
armed groups continue fighting

5
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,070
the new fascist regime,

6
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,550
which struggles to put them down.

7
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,775
<i>They say that a long, long time ago,</i>

8
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,100
<i>in the Underground Realm –</i>

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,050
<i>where neither deceit nor sorrow exists –</i>

10
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,950
<i>lived a Princess who
dreamt of the human world.</i>

11
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,150
<i>She dreamt of the blue sky,
soft breeze, and shining sun.</i>

12
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,575
<i>One day...</i>

13
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:56,775
<i>eluding all oversight,
the Princess ran away.</i>

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,900
<i>Once on the surface,
the light of the sun blinded her</i>

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,600
<i>and erased from her memory
any trace of the past.</i>

16
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:15,025
<i>The Princess forgot who she was...
where she came from...</i>

17
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,650
<i>her body suffered cold,
sickness, and pain,</i>

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,750
<i>and with the passing
of the years... she died.</i>

19
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,400
<i>Nevertheless, her father, the King,</i>

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,700
<i>knew that the soul
of the Princess would return...</i>

21
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,900
<i>perhaps in another body,</i>

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,900
<i>at another time and in another place.</i>

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,650
<i>And he would wait for her
until his dying breath...</i>

24
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:41,175
<i>until the world ceased to turn.</i>

25
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,725
I don’t understand why you’ve
brought so many books, Ofelia,

26
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:55,175
if we’re going to the
countryside, outdoors.

27
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,325
Fairy tales.

28
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:07,025
You’re too old to be filling
your head with such trifles.

29
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,925
Tell him to stop the car, please.

30
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:28,825
Ofelia... Ofelia, give me a moment.

31
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,975
Your brother’s not feeling very well.

32
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,050
Madam, are you alright?

33
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:38,925
Madam, do you need anything?

34
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,500
It’s nothing. Just give me some water.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Water! Water for the Captain’s wife!

36
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,700
Let’s go, let’s go!

37
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,825
Ofelia.

38
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,325
Ofelia?

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Come.

40
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:55,775
– I’ve seen a fairy.
– But look what you’ve done to your shoes!

41
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Let’s go.

42
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,950
When we arrive at the mill,
I want you to greet the Captain,

43
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,000
and I want you to call him “father”.

44
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
You don’t know how good
he’s been to us, my daughter.

45
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,900
It’s a word, Ofelia.

46
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
It’s nothing more than a word.

47
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,150
Captain, they’re coming!

48
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,850
Fifteen minutes late.

49
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,950
Carmen.

50
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Welcome.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,900
I have no need of that.
I’m perfectly able to walk.

52
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,800
Doctor Ferreiro would rather
you not exert yourself.

53
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
No.

54
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,950
Come, now.

55
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,800
Do it for me.

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,900
Thank you.

57
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,050
Ofelia, come out.

58
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,150
Greet the Captain.

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Ofelia.

60
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,450
It’s the other hand, Ofelia.

61
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
Mercedes!

62
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,800
Let them bring the luggage.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,600
It’s a labyrinth.

65
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,900
Nothing. A heap of really old rocks
that have always been there.

66
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,100
Even before the mill.

67
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,525
Best that you don’t come near it.
You can get lost.

68
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:24,900
Thank you.

69
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,000
Have you read them all?

70
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,300
Mercedes!

71
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,625
The Captain is calling you.

72
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Your father needs me.

73
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,300
He’s not my father.

74
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,450
The Captain is not my father!

75
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,200
My father was a tailor.

76
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,900
We lost him at the start of the war.

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,700
The Captain is not my father.

78
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:49,200
I’m clear on that.

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,750
Shall we go?

80
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Have you seen my mother?

81
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,100
– Isn’t she lovely?
– Yes.

82
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,100
She’s pregnant – have you noticed?

83
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,200
The <i>guerrillas</i> have taken to the hills,

84
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,175
and it’s much harder to track them there.

85
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,700
Those fuckers know the
terrain better than anyone.

86
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,900
We’re going to block
access to the mountain.

87
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,350
Food and medicine –

88
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,200
everything will be rationed
from our storehouse.

89
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,400
We need to force them down from there,
make them come to us.

90
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,025
I want three new checkpoints:

91
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:37,800
here, here, and here.

92
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
Mercedes.

93
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,150
Tell Doctor Ferreiro
to come down and see me.

94
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,800
Yes, sir.

95
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:50,175
With this, you’ll sleep
through the night.

96
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,750
No more than two drops
before you go to bed.

97
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,100
Two drops.

98
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Very good.

99
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,500
All of it, all of it.

100
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:05,775
Very good.

101
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,300
Don’t hesitate to call
if you need me. Day or night.

102
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,050
You, or your nurse.

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,150
Good night.

104
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,550
Go close the door and
turn down the light, dear.

105
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,500
You have to go up and see him.

106
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,200
His wound is not mending.

107
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
His leg is getting much worse.

108
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,050
I’ve been unable
to obtain more than this.

109
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,450
I’m sorry.

110
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,750
Vidal is waiting for you in his office.

111
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,075
Yes.

112
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,950
Ofelia, come here.

113
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Blessed Virgin, your feet
are frozen, my love.

114
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,675
Are you scared?

115
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,375
A little.

116
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,575
What’s that noise?

117
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:57,025
It’s nothing, my daughter.
It’s the wind.

118
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:01,525
Nights here are very different
from those in the city.

119
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,500
There, you can hear
motorcars, trolleys.

120
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,900
Here, the houses are old.

121
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,100
They grumble.

122
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,250
What does it seem
that they’re saying?

123
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:21,500
Tomorrow I’m going to give you
a surprise. You’ll see.

124
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,600
A surprise?

125
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,500
– A book?
– No, something much better.

126
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,800
Why did you have to get married?

127
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,100
We were alone for too long.

128
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,800
I’m with you.

129
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,800
You weren’t alone.

130
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,225
You’ve never been alone.

131
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,900
Someday you’ll understand that
it hasn’t been easy for me, either.

132
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,100
Your brother’s a little restless.

133
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,100
Come, tell him one of your stories.

134
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,600
I’m sure it’ll calm him
to hear your voice.

135
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,400
My brother.

136
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
My brother.

137
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,475
Many, many years ago,

138
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:23,950
<i>in a distant and dismal land,</i>

139
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,625
<i>stood a vast mountain
of black, rough stone.</i>

140
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,025
<i>At the fall of evening,</i>

141
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,850
<i>on the crest of that mountain,</i>

142
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,700
<i>a rose that granted immortality
bloomed each night.</i>

143
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,700
<i>However, no one dared approach it</i>

144
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,150
<i>since its numerous thorns were poisoned.</i>

145
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
<i>Amongst themselves,</i>

146
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
<i>people spoke only about
the fear of death and pain,</i>

147
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,800
<i>but never about the
promise of eternal life.</i>

148
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,800
<i>And every evening,</i>

149
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:15,700
<i>the rose withered,
unable to confer its gift to anyone...</i>

150
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,300
<i>forgotten and lost atop
that mountain of cold stone...</i>

151
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>alone... until the end of time.</i>

152
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Proceed.

153
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,750
– How is she?
– Very weak.

154
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,850
She’ll get rest, whatever it takes.

155
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,500
I’ll sleep down here.

156
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,000
– And my son?
– Pardon?

157
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,425
By your leave, Captain...

158
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,075
My son.

159
00:15:000,175 --> 00:15:01,000
How is he?

160
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
For the moment,
there’s no cause for alarm.

161
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,025
Very well.

162
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,850
Captain?

163
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,050
Your wife should not have traveled
at such an advanced stage of pregnancy.

164
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,200
That is your opinion?

165
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
My professional opinion – yes, sir.

166
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,400
A son should be born
wherever his father may be.

167
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,900
That is all.

168
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,200
Another thing, Captain.

169
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,150
Who has told you
that the child is male?

170
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,700
Don’t fuck with me.

171
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,950
At eight o’clock, activity was
detected in the northwest sector.

172
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Gunshots.

173
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
Sergeant Bayona combed the area
and apprehended a suspect.

174
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,050
The other one is his son,
who has come from town.

175
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,600
Captain, my father
is an honorable man.

176
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,000
I’ll be the judge of that.

177
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Uncover yourself
when you’re before me.

178
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,350
The detainee was found with
this weapon. It’s been discharged.

179
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,250
– My father was hunting rabbits, Captain.
– Shut up, cunt.

180
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
“Neither God, nor country, nor master.”

181
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,500
That takes some fucking balls.

182
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Red propaganda, Captain.

183
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
It’s not propaganda, Captain.

184
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,650
It’s an old almanac, Captain.

185
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
We’re farmers.

186
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,300
Continue.

187
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,000
I went up into the hills,
Captain, to hunt rabbits...

188
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,000
for my daughters, who’ve fallen ill.

189
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,150
Rabbits, huh?

190
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,850
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

191
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,425
No! Leave him in peace!

192
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,500
You’ve killed him!

193
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,100
You’ve killed him!

194
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,050
Murderer!

195
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,700
Son of a bitch!

196
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,750
See that you learn
to search this rabble

197
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,650
before coming to bother me.

198
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,950
Yes, Captain.

199
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,975
Mother... Mother, wake up...

200
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:13,275
Mother... there’s something in the room.

201
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,600
Hello.

202
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,500
Have you followed me here?

203
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Are you a fairy?

204
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Look.

205
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,200
This is a fairy.

206
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
You want me to go with you?

207
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,600
Outside?

208
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,200
Where to?

209
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,100
Hello?

210
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,200
Hello?

211
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,800
Echo!

212
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
Echo!

213
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Hello?

214
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,800
Hello?

215
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:49,000
Is it you?

216
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,000
It is you! You have returned!

217
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,500
No, do not be afraid, I beseech you.

218
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,700
Look! Look!

219
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,225
My name is Ofelia. Who are you?

220
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,900
I?

221
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,900
I.

222
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,950
I have had so many names...

223
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,900
old names that can only
be pronounced by the wind...

224
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,000
and the trees.

225
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:35,450
I am the mountain,
and the forest, and the earth...

226
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,050
I am...

227
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,500
I am... a faun.

228
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,400
Most humble of your subjects,
Your Highness.

229
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,100
– No... I’m...
– You are Princess Moanna,

230
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,550
– daughter of the King of Bethmoora,
– No...

231
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,750
the Underground Realm.

232
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,125
My father was a tailor.

233
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
You are no daughter of man.

234
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,425
The moon begat you!

235
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,875
On your left shoulder,

236
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:11,300
you will find a mark that proves it.

237
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:16,400
Throughout the world,
your true father

238
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,400
did open portals that
would enable your return.

239
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,700
This... is the last of them.

240
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,500
But... we must make certain

241
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,100
that your essence has not been lost...

242
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,900
that you have not turned into a mortal.

243
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,400
You shall have to pass
three tests before the full moon.

244
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,500
This...

245
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,200
This is “The Book of Crossroads”.

246
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,700
When you are alone, open it.

247
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,700
It will show you your future.

248
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,700
It will show you... what to do.

249
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,600
But there’s nothing here.

250
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,000
Mercedes.

251
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Prepare these rabbits
for tonight’s dinner.

252
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:23,100
They’re a bit too young, sir.

253
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,100
– Well, see if they might do for a broth.
– Yes, sir.

254
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:33,000
This coffee is badly burnt. Try it.

255
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,500
You should watch it more carefully
when it’s on the flame.

256
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,300
As you command, sir.

257
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,000
To the table.

258
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,550
He’s been displeased with the coffee.

259
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,725
That one’s a prissy dandy.
A prissy dandy!

260
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,075
We’re going to need some
lamb and one more hen.

261
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,850
Well, let’s see where we’re
getting it from, my girl.

262
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,075
Since the Doctor’s and
Mayor’s wives are coming.

263
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,200
Those women?
They eat more than a suckling pig!

264
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,975
And they don’t shut their mouths.

265
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,600
Not even underwater.

266
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
Mercedes, I’ll carry
these downstairs now.

267
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,000
Ofelia.

268
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,000
Your father’s giving
a dinner party tonight.

269
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,700
And look what I’ve made for you.

270
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,700
Do you like it?

271
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,200
What I would’ve given as a little girl
to have a dress like this!

272
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,700
And look at the shoes!

273
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:57,900
Patent leather!

274
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,500
Do you like them?

275
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,300
Yes, they’re very pretty.

276
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
Go on, now. Take your bath.

277
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,100
Ofelia?

278
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
Ofelia?

279
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,500
Ofelia, don’t take long.

280
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,300
I’d like to see the dress on you.

281
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,000
I want you to be beautiful
when the Captain sees you.

282
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,950
Truly...

283
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,570
You will look like a princess.

284
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,500
A princess.

285
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,625
You’re cleaning those hens well, eh?

286
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:41,000
And the beans in the black pot –
don’t forget them.

287
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,300
You are precious, my girl!

288
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,900
– Precious!
– What a cute little dress!

289
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,100
Go on, now. Back to work.
You’re all wasting time.

290
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:57,950
Do you want a bit of milk with honey?

291
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,800
Stand back, my girl.
I wouldn’t want to splash you,

292
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,100
with you being so gorgeous.

293
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,200
Mercedes...

294
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Do you believe in fairies?

295
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
Not anymore...

296
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,000
but when I was a little girl, yes.

297
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,400
Back then I believed in
many things that I don’t now.

298
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
Well, last night, a fairy visited me.

299
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,750
You don’t say?

300
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,050
Okay, it wasn’t just one.
There were others – and a faun.

301
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,150
A faun?

302
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,175
That’s what he said.

303
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:37,600
He’s very tall, very old,
and smells of earth.

304
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:41,400
As my grandmother used to say:
with fauns, one must tread carefully.

305
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,700
Mercedes.

306
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,400
Come with me.

307
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,100
Captain, everything is here.

308
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Flour, salt, oil, medicine, <i>Caldo de Gallina</i>...

309
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Olives, bacon...

310
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,300
What tobacco! What tobacco!

311
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,250
And the ration cards.

312
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
– I need you to look over the inventory, Captain.
– Very well.

313
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,800
Mercedes.

314
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,200
– The key.
– Yes, sir.

315
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,900
– Is this the only copy?
– The only one, sir.

316
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,200
As of today, I’m carrying it.

317
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:32,875
Captain!

318
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
It may not be anything, Captain.

319
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,800
It’s them.

320
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,700
<i>“At the dawn of time,
when the forest was young,”</i>

321
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,800
<i>“there lived in harmony animals,
men, and magical creatures.”</i>

322
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,900
<i>“They protected one another”</i>

323
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,400
<i>“and slept together under
the shade of a lush tree”</i>

324
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,600
<i>“that grows on the
hillside near the mill.”</i>

325
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>“Now, the tree is dying –”</i>

326
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>“its branches are barren,
its trunk old and crooked.”</i>

327
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,500
<i>“Beneath its roots
has nested a monstrous toad”</i>

328
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,625
<i>“that does not allow it to heal.”</i>

329
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,100
<i>“You will have to put the three
magic amber stones in its mouth”</i>

330
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,300
<i>“and retrieve a golden key
hidden in its belly.”</i>

331
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,800
<i>“Only in this way shall
the tree flourish again.”</i>

332
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:22,275
Probably less than twenty minutes ago.

333
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,800
They took off like a shot.

334
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,800
A dozen, at most.

335
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,125
Antibiotics.

336
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,350
For fuck’s sake!

337
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,450
On top of that, they forgot
their lottery ticket!

338
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,000
They’re here.

339
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Those sons of whores are here.

340
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,050
They’re watching us.

341
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,900
Hey!

342
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,900
You’ve left this behind!

343
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,150
And your lottery ticket!

344
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,000
Why don’t you come down for it?

345
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,500
If you had any balls,
you could play with yourselves!

346
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
H-hello...

347
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,700
I’m Princess Moanna...

348
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,000
and I’m not afraid of you.

349
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,200
Aren’t you ashamed
of staying down here,

350
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
eating all these bugs,

351
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

352
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,600
Hey!

353
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,000
Have you looked in the bedroom
and the storehouse?

354
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,500
Yes, madam.

355
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,800
Have you checked the garden?

356
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,100
– And the granary?
– Yes, madam.

357
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,100
But where will that girl
have gotten to?

358
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,787
Through here, please.

359
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,000
Allow me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

360
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,700
– Charmed.
– My pleasure.

361
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,600
Starting today,
one ration card per family.

362
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,900
Have a look at them.

363
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,100
– Only one?
– Only one.

364
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,100
– Captain, I don’t know if it’ll be enough.
– If the people are prudent, yes.

365
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,500
What we can’t allow is for anyone to keep
sending food to those in the mountains.

366
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
They’re losing ground,

367
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
and they’ve been towing
at least one wounded.

368
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
Pardon me, Captain.
How are you so sure?

369
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,800
Today we almost caught them,

370
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,400
and they were carrying this:

371
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
antibiotics.

372
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,600
These people, God has
already saved their souls.

373
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,500
What befalls their bodies
matters very little to Him.

374
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,000
We’ll assist you in all that
you may require, Captain.

375
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,500
We know you’re not here by choice.

376
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,300
In that, you are mistaken.

377
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,700
I’m here because I want my son

378
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,900
to be born in a cleansed, renewed Spain.

379
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,100
Because these people
share a misconception:

380
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
that we are all equal.

381
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
But there’s a big difference:

382
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,900
the war is over, and we won.

383
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,300
And if, in order for everyone to understand this,
we have to kill those bastards,

384
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,600
then we kill them, and that’s it.

385
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,500
All of us are here by choice.

386
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,250
By choice!

387
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,400
Paz, put the coffee on, please.
I’m going for more wood.

388
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,400
What has you so ill at ease?

389
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,850
Ofelia?

390
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,800
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

391
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,750
Ofelia’s father used
to make his uniforms.

392
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,250
Ah. Well, then.

393
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,700
And when he died, I started
working in a general store,

394
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,300
and a little more than a year ago...

395
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,550
the Captain and I...

396
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,600
we met again.

397
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,500
How curious, isn’t it?

398
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,800
I mean, running into each other
again – after so long.

399
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,900
Curious. Most curious.

400
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,650
Pardon my wife.

401
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,100
She hasn’t seen much
of the world, you know?

402
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,000
She believes we’re all
interested in that bullshit.

403
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,600
As you say, Captain.

404
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,675
Madam, the girl has turned up.

405
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,075
If you would excuse me?

406
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,750
Have I told you before that I was
acquainted with your father, Captain?

407
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,800
No. I had no idea.

408
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,700
In Morocco.

409
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,100
I knew him briefly,
but he left a vivid impression.

410
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,600
A great soldier.

411
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,400
The men in his troop used to say

412
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,200
that when General Vidal
died on the field of battle,

413
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,800
he dashed his watch to the ground

414
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,600
so that it might show
the exact hour of his death –

415
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,000
so that his son might know
how a valiant man dies.

416
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,200
Rumors.

417
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,900
He didn’t have a watch.

418
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,600
What you’ve done... it hurts me.

419
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,900
When you get out of the bath, 
you’ll go to bed without supper.

420
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,800
Did you hear me?

421
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,900
Sometimes I think that
you’ll never learn to behave.

422
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,500
You’ve disappointed me, Ofelia.

423
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,500
And your father, as well.

424
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,200
The Captain?

425
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,000
Him even more than me.

426
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,400
I already have the key.

427
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Take me to the labyrinth.

428
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,000
Hello.

429
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,400
I’ve brought the key.

430
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,350
That is me...

431
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,400
and the girl... is you.

432
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
And the baby?

433
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,200
You have acquired the key.

434
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,100
I am delighted.

435
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,093
She has believed in Your Grace
from the beginning.

436
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,700
She is quite pleased by your success.

437
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,300
Preserve the key.

438
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,600
You shall have need of it –
very soon.

439
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,400
And also this: a bit of chalk.

440
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,300
Only two more tests remain,

441
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,200
and the moon will presently be full.

442
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,000
Have patience.

443
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:37,050
Soon enough, we shall promenade through the
seven concentric courtyards of your palace.

444
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,150
How do I know that
what you say is true?

445
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,500
Why would I lie,
a poor faun like me?

446
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:09,075
Let’s go.

447
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,750
Card in hand, in view!

448
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,350
Let’s go, let’s go!

449
00:46:14,725 --> 00:46:15,725
Your name?

450
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,650
Sofía Nadal, and my children.

451
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,600
First name and last names?

452
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,300
Narciso Peña Soriano,
at your service.

453
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,650
Name?

454
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,400
This is our daily bread in Franco’s Spain,

455
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,875
which we keep safe in our granaries.

456
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:35,600
The Reds lie.

457
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,000
Because in Nationalist Spain –
One, Great, and Free –

458
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,900
there is neither a hearth without fire
nor a family without bread.

459
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,850
Come on.

460
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,850
Tell me what’s going to happen now.

461
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,950
Tell me.

462
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,200
Ofelia...

463
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,400
Ofelia...

464
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:40,400
Ofelia, help me...

465
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,150
This is our daily bread in Franco’s Spain,
which we keep safe in our granaries.

466
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,700
– Captain! Captain!
– The Reds lie.

467
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,500
They lie when they say
there is hunger in Spain.

468
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,650
– Come, quickly!
– Do not believe them.

469
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,500
Because in Nationalist Spain –
One, Great, and Free –

470
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,200
there is neither a hearth without fire
nor a family without bread.

471
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,600
This is our daily bread in Franco’s Spain.

472
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,300
Your wife requires absolute repose.

473
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,300
She must remain under sedation
most of the time.

474
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,600
The girl ought to sleep 
in another room.

475
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,000
I will stay here until the delivery.

476
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,500
Make her well.

477
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
I don’t care what it takes
or what it costs.

478
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,500
Make her well.

479
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,200
Don’t you worry.

480
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
Your mother will get better
very soon. You’ll see.

481
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,900
Having a baby is complicated.

482
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,700
Well, then I’m not going to have any.

483
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:21,450
You’re helping those
in the mountains, right?

484
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,500
Have you mentioned
this to anybody?

485
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,500
I won’t tell anyone. Ever.

486
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,100
I don’t want anything bad
to happen to you.

487
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,350
Nor I to you.

488
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,800
Do you know a lullaby?

489
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,200
Only one...

490
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
but I don’t remember the words.

491
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,000
It doesn’t matter. I want to hear it.

492
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,600
No, no, no! Don’t be alarmed! It’s me.

493
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,200
Ready?

494
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,500
Yes.

495
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,600
Let’s go, then.

496
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,100
This is sheer madness.

497
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,000
When that man finds us out,
he’s going to kill us. All of us!

498
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,800
Do you realize that?

499
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,600
Are you so afraid, Doctor?

500
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,900
No. It’s not... it’s not fear.

501
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,100
At least not for myself.

502
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,500
Pedro!

503
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,300
Pedro!

504
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,200
My brother!

505
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,400
You have avoided the test.

506
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,600
No... my mother is sick.

507
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,000
That is no excuse for negligence!

508
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:21,050
See here. This... is a mandrake...

509
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,900
a plant that dreamt of being human.

510
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,800
Place it underneath your mother’s bed

511
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,400
in a bowl of fresh milk.

512
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,900
Each morning, give it
two drops of blood to drink.

513
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Now – carry through with the test.

514
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,600
The full moon is already upon us.

515
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Let them be your guides.

516
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,550
You will be going to
a very dangerous place.

517
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,600
Take heed:

518
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,200
that which slumbers there...

519
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,400
is not human.

520
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,100
You will see a lavish banquet.

521
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,500
Do not eat or drink anything.

522
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,600
Absolutely nothing!

523
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Your life depends on it.

524
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,575
I’ve brought you some
brandy and tobacco...

525
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:52,325
Cheese...

526
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:55,000
A couple of letters
for Trigo and Piloto...

527
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:56,675
Powder for lice...

528
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,075
How’s that leg, Francés?

529
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:01,375
Well, how’s it going to be, Doctor?

530
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,100
It’s fucked.

531
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
Let’s see.

532
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,500
“T-t-troops from N-N-North America,”

533
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,800
“B-B-Britain, and C-C-Canada”

534
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:19,000
“have landed on a small beach
in the north of F-F-F...”

535
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,200
– “Of France,” stutterer.
– “France.”
– “Of France.”

536
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,450
“More than one hundred
fifty thousand soldiers”

537
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:30,000
“under the command of
General Dwight D. Eisenhower...”

538
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:33,325
Is it serious, Doctor?

539
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,350
Look, Francés...

540
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,225
There’s no way to save it.

541
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,000
I’ll try to do it in
as few cuts as possible.

542
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,600
One moment, Doctor.
One moment.

543
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:46,050
<i>“With the chalk, you shall trace the
outline of a door anywhere in your room.”</i>

544
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,800
<i>“Once the door is opened,
start the hourglass.”</i>

545
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,425
<i>“Let yourself be guided
by the fairies,”</i>

546
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,950
<i>“do not eat or drink
anything during your stay,”</i>

547
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,850
<i>“and ensure that you return before
the last grain of sand falls.”</i>

548
00:58:22,575 --> 00:58:23,775
No.

549
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,200
It’s this one.

550
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,300
No! No!

551
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:23,275
Before long, we’ll have
people in from Jaca.

552
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:25,200
About fifty men.

553
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,200
Then we’ll go head-to-head with Vidal.

554
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,400
And? What’s going to happen?

555
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,550
You kill him and another like him will come. 
And another. And another still.

556
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:39,050
You all have it really screwed up.
Vidal has guns, shelter.

557
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,600
You need food, medicine.

558
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,500
You should be looking after Mercedes.

559
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,875
If she really does matter to you, cross
the border with her. This is a lost cause!

560
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:49,600
I’m staying here, Doctor.
There’s nothing else.

561
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,000
You have to leave.

562
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:05,800
The key.

563
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,600
But you can’t go down there now.

564
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,650
That’s what he’s waiting for.

565
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,100
Leave it to me.

566
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I’m a coward.

567
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,300
No. You aren’t.

568
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,800
Yes. Yes, I am.

569
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,900
A coward, a piece of shit.

570
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,500
Stuck there all day beside
that son of a bitch.

571
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,000
Washing his clothes,
making his bed, feeding him.

572
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,900
And what if the Doctor’s right,
and we can’t win?

573
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
At least we’ll make it difficult
for that asshole.

574
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,900
Left... turn! Left... turn!

575
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,500
Captain Vidal.

576
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,800
Her fever’s going down.
I don’t know how, but it is.

577
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,900
But she still has one?

578
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,400
Yes, but it’s a good sign.
Her body’s responding.

579
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,150
Listen well.

580
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,000
If you have to choose...

581
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,600
save the child.

582
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,200
That boy will bear my name,
and my father’s name.

583
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,300
Save him.

584
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,900
My brother...

585
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,800
my brother...

586
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,900
If you can hear me...

587
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,500
things around here aren’t that good...

588
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,900
but soon you’ll have to come out.

589
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,000
You’ve made Mama very ill.

590
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,400
When you do come out,

591
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,700
I want to ask you for one thing.

592
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,900
Just one.

593
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,800
Don’t hurt Mama.

594
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,300
You’ll get to know her.

595
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,300
She’s very pretty,

596
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,500
although sometimes she may
feel sad for many days,

597
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,300
but you’ll see it when she smiles.

598
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,400
You’re going to like her a lot.

599
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,800
Listen...

600
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,600
if you do what I say,

601
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,100
I promise you this:

602
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,700
I’ll take you to my kingdom,
and you’ll be a prince.

603
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,900
I promise you. A prince.

604
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,300
I blew the whistle,
but they didn’t move aside.

605
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,700
I attempted to stop the engine,
but it was much too late.

606
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,400
The stoker and I
jumped out in time, but...

607
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,200
just look at the mess they’ve made!

608
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,200
What was contained
in the cars that they raided?

609
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,300
They haven’t opened
a single car, Captain.

610
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,900
What the fuck are you talking about?

611
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,300
They’ve blown it to hell,
and they haven’t opened one car.

612
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,700
They haven’t taken anything.

613
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,500
Nothing?

614
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,900
Are you sure?

615
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,000
God alone knows
what they were going after –

616
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,000
besides making us waste time.

617
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,950
Captain! Captain!

618
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,650
They came out of nowhere, Captain.
All of a sudden.

619
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
They’ve looted the storehouse. They have grenades.
And they’ve pulled back up the mountain.

620
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,700
Captain, we’ve corralled a group
that has lagged behind.

621
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,100
They’ve taken shelter on an outcrop.

622
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,950
Come, Serrano – be fearless!
This is the only decent way to die!

623
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,000
Serrano!

624
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,350
Let me see.

625
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,500
Let me see!

626
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,150
Can you talk?

627
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,600
Fuck.

628
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,650
These are good for nothing.

629
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,300
One alive is worth more than ten dead.
Do you understand, imbecile?

630
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,900
There’s no way to get anything out of them.
Anything! Do you hear me?

631
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,200
Captain!

632
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,700
Here’s a live one!

633
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:43,250
He only has a hit to his leg.

634
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,400
– What’s going on?
– They’ve caught one!
– What?

635
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,000
They’ve caught one of them – alive –
and they’re taking him to the storehouse!

636
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,100
Mercedes!

637
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Pedro...?

638
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,550
Pedro...?

639
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,800
Mercedes?

640
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,550
Captain, I need to get
into the storehouse...

641
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:24,750
Not now.

642
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:26,250
Fall back.

643
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,800
My girl, enough.

644
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,600
Shall I carry it?

645
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,950
Take this. It’s just half the dose.

646
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,700
I don’t think I need it, Doctor.

647
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,750
I’m feeling better. Much better.

648
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:31,150
I can’t account for it, but I’m glad.

649
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,400
Mother.

650
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,000
Fuck, is this good!

651
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,850
Shag tobacco.
Hard to come by, eh?

652
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,400
F-f-fuck off.

653
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,600
Fucking hell, Garcés. We finally catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

654
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,200
We’re going to spend
the entire night here.

655
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,300
As long as he talks, Captain.

656
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,700
Garcés is right.

657
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,150
You’re going to tell us
everything, aren’t you?

658
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,700
Because to do just that,
we’ve brought along a few little things –

659
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,550
things one picks up here and there.

660
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,300
At first, I’m not going
to be able to trust you.

661
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:38,950
But when I finish using this...
you’re going to tell me one thing or another.

662
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,850
When we move on to these...

663
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,300
we’re going to have
a relationship that’s...

664
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,900
how should I say...?

665
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,400
Much closer.

666
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,700
Like brothers, eh?

667
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,300
You’ll see.

668
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
And when we get around to this...

669
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,150
I’m going to believe
everything you say to me.

670
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:13,575
I’m going to propose
something to you.

671
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:17,500
If you count up to three –
without st-t-tuttering –

672
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,100
you’ll be able to leave.

673
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,900
Don’t look at him.
Look at me.

674
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,450
Above me, there is no one.

675
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:28,200
– Garcés!
– Yes, Captain?

676
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,150
If I say this lucky fellow is going to leave,
is anybody going to contradict me?

677
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,600
No one, Captain. He can go.

678
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,000
Come on.

679
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,000
Up to three.

680
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,450
One.

681
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,100
Very good.

682
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,350
Two.

683
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,000
Come on.
One more and you’ll be free.

684
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,000
Pity.

685
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,600
Your mother has improved,
Your Highness.

686
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:48,950
Surely, now, you must
be greatly relieved.

687
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,850
Y-y-yes. Yes, thank you...

688
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,400
but...

689
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
things haven’t come out
all that well.

690
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,400
Ah? No?

691
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,850
– There was an accident.
– An accident?

692
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yes.

693
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,825
You have broken the rules!

694
01:17:14,925 --> 01:17:17,775
It was only two grapes,
and I thought that no one would notice!

695
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,400
We have been mistaken!

696
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,850
Mistaken?

697
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,900
You have failed!
You cannot return!

698
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,650
– It was all an accident.
– You cannot return!

699
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:34,500
The moon will be full in three days!

700
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:41,100
Your spirit shall remain
forever among men!

701
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,100
You will grow old like them,
you will die like them!

702
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,400
Your memory shall vanish in time,

703
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:54,000
and we will disappear along with it.

704
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,200
You will never see us again!

705
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:10,600
Good morning, Doctor.

706
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,200
Sorry to bother you so early,

707
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,400
but I think we need your help.

708
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,975
My God, what have
you done to him?

709
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:41,450
Not much.

710
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,125
But things are on the mend.

711
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,100
I like having you around, Doctor.

712
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,550
It has its advantages.

713
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,650
Serrano, stay with them.

714
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,150
I talked...

715
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,100
V-very... little...

716
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,050
B-b-but... I talked...

717
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,550
I’m sorry.
I’m so very sorry.

718
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,650
K-k-k...

719
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,500
Ki-ki-kill me...

720
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,100
Ki-kill me now... p-please...

721
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,550
Son of a bitch.

722
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:05,700
You won’t feel any more pain.

723
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:13,575
It’s almost over.

724
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,150
Keep an eye on Doctor Ferreiro.
I’ll be right there.

725
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,350
Yes, Captain.

726
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,750
You’re not moving anymore.

727
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:52,900
Are you sick?

728
01:20:56,475 --> 01:20:59,275
What the fuck are you doing
down there? Huh?

729
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,275
– Call him!
– Who?

730
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:16,925
Who else, imbecile?
Ferreiro!

731
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,925
What the fuck is this?

732
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:47,800
No, no, no, no!

733
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,075
– Leave her alone!
– No, no!

734
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:51,625
Leave her alone already!
Please.

735
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,800
Look! Look at what
she had under your bed!

736
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,750
Huh? What does it
look like to you?

737
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,450
Ofelia, what was this thing
doing under the bed?

738
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,250
It’s... a magic root.

739
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,750
The faun gave it to me.

740
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,550
This is because of that
shit you let her read.

741
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,800
Look at what you’ve
accomplished!

742
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,200
Please, leave us alone.

743
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,350
I’ll talk to her, darling.

744
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,800
Very well.

745
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,750
As you wish.

746
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:27,125
He told me it would
make you well. And it did!

747
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,800
Ofelia, you have to
listen to your father.

748
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,200
You have to change.

749
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,175
No! I want to leave here!

750
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:38,125
Take me far away
from here, please!

751
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:39,600
Please, let’s go!

752
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,100
Things aren’t that simple.

753
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,325
You’ll be getting older...

754
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,675
and soon you’ll understand that
life isn’t like your fairy tales.

755
01:22:50,975 --> 01:22:53,825
The world is a cruel place.

756
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,800
And you’re going to learn that...

757
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,900
even if it hurts you.

758
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:00,850
No! No!

759
01:23:00,925 --> 01:23:02,675
Ofelia!

760
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:05,600
Magic does not exist!

761
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:09,100
It doesn’t exist – not for you,
not for me, not for anybody!

762
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,950
Mother! Help!

763
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,800
Help!

764
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,200
Help!

765
01:23:32,825 --> 01:23:34,350
Why did you do it?

766
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,450
It was the only thing I could do.

767
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,200
No. You could have obeyed me.

768
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:46,150
I could have, but I didn’t.

769
01:23:47,325 --> 01:23:50,050
Then it would have been better for you.
Do you know that?

770
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,950
I don’t understand it.

771
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:54,500
Why didn’t you obey me?

772
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,100
The thing is...

773
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,550
to obey for the sake of obeying...

774
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,200
just like that,
without thinking about it...

775
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,100
that’s only something
people like you do, Captain.

776
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,975
Captain!

777
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:51,875
Garcés!

778
01:24:51,975 --> 01:24:54,100
Summon the chief paramedic!
Let him come up immediately!

779
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,700
Yes, Captain.

780
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,600
Captain, your wife has died.

781
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,650
<i>Because the ways
of the Lord are inscrutable.</i>

782
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,850
<i>Because in His word
and in His mystery</i>

783
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,150
<i>lies the essence of His mercy.</i>

784
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:55,050
<i>Because even though God
sends us the message,</i>

785
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,450
<i>it is on us to decipher it.</i>

786
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,525
<i>Because upon opening
its arms to us,</i>

787
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:05,975
<i>the earth takes in only
a hollow and senseless shell.</i>

788
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:09,750
<i>Far away now is the soul
in Eternal Glory.</i>

789
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:14,700
<i>Because it is in suffering
where we find the sense of life</i>

790
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,300
<i>and the state of grace
that we lose at birth.</i>

791
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,800
<i>Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.</i>

792
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:31,100
<i>And because only
in His physical absence</i>

793
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,900
<i>does He reaffirm the place
that He occupies in our souls.</i>

794
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,750
You knew Doctor Ferreiro pretty well,

795
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:01,850
isn’t that so, Mercedes?

796
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,450
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

797
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,900
The stutterer spoke to us
of an informant – inside the mill.

798
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,400
Can you imagine?

799
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,500
Right under my nose.

800
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,800
Mercedes.

801
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,250
Please.

802
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,700
What must you think of me?

803
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,350
You probably think that I’m a monster.

804
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,750
To you, sir, it doesn’t matter
what someone like me thinks.

805
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,500
I want you to go to the storehouse tonight
and bring me more brandy, please.

806
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,900
Yes, sir.

807
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,900
Good night, sir.

808
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,950
Mercedes.

809
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,950
Aren’t you forgetting something?

810
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,700
Sir?

811
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:07,850
The key.

812
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,000
I have the only copy,
isn’t that true?

813
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,200
Yes, sir.

814
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:17,100
Do you know... there’s
something that’s bothering me.

815
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,800
A small detail.

816
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,700
It’s not very important, but...

817
01:28:20,925 --> 01:28:22,675
The day that they
got into the storehouse –

818
01:28:22,775 --> 01:28:25,775
with all those grenades
and explosives –

819
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,400
the lock wasn’t forced.

820
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,275
In any case...

821
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,000
Surely it’s not important.

822
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,900
Be very careful.

823
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Until tomorrow, sir.

824
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:25,700
Ofelia!

825
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,500
Ofelia!

826
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,725
Ofelia, I’m leaving tonight.

827
01:29:30,075 --> 01:29:32,650
– Where to?
– I can’t tell you.

828
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,825
– I can’t tell you, but I promise...
– Take me with you.

829
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:36,700
– No, no. I can’t. I can’t. No.
– Take me with you.

830
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,500
– I promise to come back for you, my girl.
– Take me with you.

831
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,700
– I can’t. I promise...
– Take me with you.

832
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,750
I’ve heard something...

833
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,500
No...

834
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,900
It seems that it’s nothing. It’s quiet.

835
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,350
Mercedes.

836
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,500
Ofelia.

837
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,825
Since when have you
known about her?

838
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,725
How long have you
been laughing at me?

839
01:30:46,825 --> 01:30:48,500
Whore!

840
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,900
Watch her!

841
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:56,350
And if anyone tries to get in...

842
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,400
kill her first.

843
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,450
Sausage.

844
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,600
Tobacco.

845
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,600
If you’d asked me for it,
I’d have given it to you, Mercedes.

846
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,100
I want the names of those
who have written these letters.

847
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,100
And I want them
in front of me tomorrow.

848
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,500
Yes, Captain.

849
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,400
Remove yourself, Garcés.

850
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,300
Are you sure, Captain?

851
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,475
For the love of God,

852
01:31:48,575 --> 01:31:50,000
she’s nothing more than a woman.

853
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,275
That’s what you’ve always thought.

854
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,350
That’s how I could get close.

855
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,750
Because I was invisible to you.

856
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,500
Fuck.

857
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,700
You’ve discovered my weak point:

858
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,400
Pride.

859
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,900
But we’re here in order to
search for your weak points.

860
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:18,125
The matter is quite simple:

861
01:32:18,225 --> 01:32:20,000
you’re going to talk...

862
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,100
and I have to know...

863
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:26,350
that you’re telling me the truth.

864
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,600
To do just that...

865
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,400
we’ve brought along a few little things.

866
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,250
Nothing complicated.

867
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,850
Things one picks up here and there.

868
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,800
At first, I’m not going
to be able to trust...

869
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,850
I’m not an old or injured man,
motherfucker!

870
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,200
Motherfucker!

871
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,200
Don’t you even think
about touching the girl.

872
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,150
You won’t be the
first pig I slaughter!

873
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,000
– Hey.
– Shhh!

874
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,100
He let her go.

875
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,700
What the fuck are you saying?

876
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,300
Hey!

877
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,600
Catch her!

878
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,500
– Go! Bring her to me!
– Captain...?

879
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,400
Bring her to me, you cunts!

880
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,900
To the mounts!

881
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,400
It’s best that you
come along willingly.

882
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
The Captain has told me
that if you behave...

883
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,500
Don’t do anything foolish,
pretty one.

884
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:09,150
If anyone’s going to kill you...

885
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,300
I’d rather it be me.

886
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,300
I have decided to give you...

887
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,600
another opportunity.

888
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,750
Do you promise to obey me?

889
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,650
Will you do all that I tell you?

890
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Without question?

891
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,800
This is your last chance.

892
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,700
Then...

893
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,550
listen to me well.

894
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,350
Collect your brother

895
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:55,300
and bring him to me
in the labyrinth

896
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,800
as soon as possible...

897
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,950
Your Highness.

898
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,300
My brother?

899
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:02,900
We have need of him.

900
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
But...

901
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,300
No more questions.

902
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,300
The door is locked.

903
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,950
In that case...

904
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:17,800
make your own door.

905
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,750
By your leave, Captain.

906
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,400
Come quickly.

907
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,900
So now what’s happening?

908
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,400
Serrano has returned.
He’s wounded.

909
01:40:17,025 --> 01:40:18,100
Wounded?

910
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:06,150
Where is Garcés?

911
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:14,950
How many were there?

912
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,600
I don’t know exactly, Captain, but...

913
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,200
no fewer than fifty men.

914
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,950
None of the others have returned, and the
checkpoints are not responding to our calls.

915
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,800
How many men are left
in the encampment?

916
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,100
Twenty... perhaps fewer, sir.

917
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,725
We’re going to get out of here.

918
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,750
You and me, together.

919
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:43,900
Don’t be scared.

920
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,400
Nothing’s going to happen to you.

921
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,750
Set a watch at the
perimeter of the woods.

922
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,100
As soon as one of the patrols
gets back, I want to see them.

923
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,100
Communicate by radio with
the Lieutenant Colonel.

924
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,750
We need support, urgently!

925
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:01,150
Yes, Captain.

926
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,600
Leave him.

927
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,500
Ofelia!

928
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,600
Quickly, Your Highness!

929
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,400
Deliver him to me!

930
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,900
The full moon shines in the sky,

931
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,900
and we can open the portal.

932
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:58,900
What do you carry in your hand?

933
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,900
The portal will only open if
we shed innocent blood upon it.

934
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,500
Just a little blood.
Merely a prick.

935
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,200
It is the final test.

936
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,550
Come on.

937
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,600
You promised to obey me
without defiance!

938
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,950
– Surrender the child!
– No!

939
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,950
My brother stays with me.

940
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:31,200
You will sacrifice your sacred title
for this brat you scarcely know?

941
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,700
Yes. I sacrifice it.

942
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,900
You will renounce your
birthright for him?

943
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,500
He, for whom you have been
humilated, ignored?

944
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,500
Yes. I renounce it.

945
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:53,350
Then let your will be done...

946
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:55,600
Your Highness.

947
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,600
No!

948
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,700
My son.

949
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:41,550
Tell my son...

950
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:49,650
Tell him what time his father died.

951
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,250
– Tell him that I...
– No.

952
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,125
He won’t even know your name.

953
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,600
Rise to your feet, daughter of mine.

954
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,000
Draw near.

955
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:11,425
Father.

956
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:15,600
You have shed your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

957
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:20,100
That was the final test,
and the most important.

958
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:36,050
And you have chosen well,
Your Highness.

959
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:38,350
Come to my side,

960
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:41,050
and be seated alongside your father,

961
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,600
so long a time has he waited for you.

962
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,200
<i>And it is said that the Princess
descended to her father’s realm...</i>

963
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:46,700
<i>and that there she reigned with
justice and kindness for many centuries...</i>

964
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,850
<i>that she was loved by her subjects...</i>

965
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:55,500
<i>and that she left behind small traces
of her passage through the world...</i>

966
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,000
<i>visible only to those...</i>

967
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,250
<i>who know where to look.</i>

968
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:08,500
