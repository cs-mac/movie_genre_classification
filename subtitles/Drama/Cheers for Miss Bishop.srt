1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,233
Excuse me. l'm here in response
to the ad in the newspaper

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,158
about Mrs Tortelli's children.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,874
What,
is she trying to sell them again?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,079
- What?
- Never mind, never mind. Carla?

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,076
Yeah? What is it?

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,475
- There's a lady here to see you.
- Oh, yeah?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,309
l'm Miss Gilder. We spoke earlier
about your ad for a tutor.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,955
Oh, yeah. Have a seat
over there and we'll talk.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,753
l'm takin' five.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,279
OK.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,916
Here are my resume
and references, Mrs Tortelli.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,758
You will see l teach all subjects.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,916
l have a great deal of experience,
and,

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,918
if l may say so myself,
l'm very highly recommended

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,758
by those for whom l've worked.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,998
Forget that. Have you ever been
in any major military skirmishes?

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,630
What?

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,433
lt's important
l know you can handle yourself.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,551
Just stand up for a minute.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,156
- Give me one.
- Give you one what?

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,352
Your best shot, right here.
Coldcock me, honey.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,311
- Don't hold back.
- Waste her.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,476
- Lay one on her.
- Let's go.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,670
You don't really expect me
to strike you ?

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,678
Six bucks an hour.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,313
Great shot!

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,515
Sit right down here
and we'll work out the details.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,593
Afternoon, everybody.

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,234
- Norm!
- Norman...

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,028
What's the story, Norm?

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,311
A thirsty guy walks into a bar.
You finish it.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,437
Norman, you are looking
especially spry today.

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,199
Thank you. ln fact,
l joined a health club today.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,914
Good for you. Nice facilities?

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,996
Excellent snack bar.

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,629
Norm,
it's gonna add years to your life.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,115
Coach, l felt l had to do something.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,796
Sammy, this guy over here doesn't
believe me about your bar slide.

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,229
Would you serve one up
to save my good name?

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,191
- My pleasure.
- Thank you, Sammy.

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,118
- Let's get this garbage out of here.
- Clear the runway.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,474
- OK, Sammy. Any time you're ready.
- There you go.

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,791
Hit the bricks, pal.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,954
OK. How do you do it?

45
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,756
lt's just
one of my two hidden talents.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,677
The other is just as impressive.

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,955
But you can hardly
charge a buck for it.

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,919
Cheers.

49
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,598
Yeah. Just a sec.

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,711
- lt's for you, Sam.
- Give me a second.

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,671
l'll put you on hold.

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,713
- Thank you, Coach.
- All the classy joints do that.

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,394
Hello? Sam Malone.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,035
Hey. Of course l know who you are,
Rick Walker.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,071
Well, it's not too crowded.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,269
lf you're across the street,
come on over.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,799
Yeah.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,799
Hey. You're in luck here.
A genuine Red Sock's on his way over.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,558
No kiddin'?

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,473
What are you doing?

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,239
Sam, l don't want
a Boston Red Sock to come in here

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,432
and get a glass with lipstick on it
or crud at the bottom.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,837
Sit up straight, will ya?

64
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,552
So who is it, huh? Evans?

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,478
Rice? Yaz?

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,238
You heard of Rick Walker?

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,638
He can use that one.

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,116
Carla...

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,595
For five years,
when he pitched for Detroit,

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,392
we couldn't win a game against them.

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,909
Then he signed for the Sox
for big bucks

72
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,759
and now he's leading the league
in early showers.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,155
Carla, he's supposed to be a nice guy

74
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,555
and l'm glad
not everybody feels like you do.

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,557
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Rick!

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,393
l'm sorry about that.

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,239
That's OK. For me, this is cordial.

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,759
- How you doing?
- Good.

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,192
Nice to see you.
Let's sit and have a little privacy.

80
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,475
Sam, l know it's crazy for a stranger
to come here for advice

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,275
but the pitching coach said
you're the only man who can help me.

82
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,753
Well, l'm flattered.

83
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,553
He said if anyone knows
about slumps, it's you.

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,199
- The legend lives on, huh?
- Sam, can l buy you a beer?

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,629
No, thanks.
l don't drink anymore.

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,877
Yeah. l heard rumours
you used to hit the bottle sometimes.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,638
Well, they're true.

88
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,273
Did you drink during a game?

89
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,756
Never on the mound.
Sets a bad example for the catchers.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,554
- Did drinking help?
- No. Quite the contrary.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,358
How about an early shower?

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,120
- Carla, come on.
- The guy's a rag arm.

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,595
l'm sorry.

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,030
Sam, didn't that guy used to be
a pitching coach for the Red Sox ?

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,913
That's Ernie Pantusso.
He works here now.

96
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,156
Good idea. Let's ask him some stuff.

97
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,236
Coach, l want you
to meet Rick Walker.

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,635
Hey, Rick. How are ya?
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,512
- l'll get you a beer.
- Great.

100
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,870
Sorry things are not
going good for you.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,958
Coach, l just don't know
what l'm doing wrong.

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,595
Sam? Who is that man?

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,638
That's Rick Walker,
relief pitcher for the Red Sox.

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,035
Poor guy's in a slump.
Going through hell.

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,515
Try to get out of those things,
the worse it gets.

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,393
Well, you know what he needs.
Meditation.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,913
- lt gives you total serenity.
- Well, maybe l could suggest it.

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, it worked for me.
l used to have this facial tic.

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,796
Started meditating, right away.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,233
Really?

111
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,678
- Absolutely.
- What kind of tic ?

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,438
Well, it was hardly noticeable.

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,233
- Come on. Let me see.
- No. l got rid of it.

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,191
lt's a thing of the past.

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,710
So, anyway, suggest meditation.
lt just might do wonders.

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,310
- l can see it did wonders for you.
- l'm a living endorsement.

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,998
Gotcha.

118
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,556
Sam, what am l gonna do ?

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,433
Well, have you ever
thought about meditation ?

120
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,516
- l tried everything, Sam.
- Really ?

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,158
Sam, forget that meditation. What he
needs to do is beef up his sex life.

122
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,510
See the ladies, take the edge off.

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,837
He's right. Sammy's taken
more edges off than a carpenter.

124
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,876
Listen, Rick. ln my day, there was
always attractive young dames

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,195
outside the stadium
waiting for players.

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,788
- They're still there, Coach.
- Are you kiddin'?

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,276
Say hello to Rosie McGonagal for me,
will ya?

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,392
- Different ones are there, Coach.
- Yeah.

129
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,152
Listen. Now, he's been in baseball
for a long time.

130
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,669
Maybe there's something
to this sex stuff.

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,873
No, Sam, l appreciate the suggestion
but l don't think that's the answer.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,118
Wait just a minute. Don't say it's
not the answer until you've tried it.

133
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,356
- Diane, Diane -
- Excuse me.

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,552
My name is Diane.
l have done this for years,

135
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,595
and... l'll tell you, l would be
happy to teach you how to do it.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,079
Diane, this is very kind of you
but l don't think...

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,159
No, no, no. Please. Do me
the favour of trying it with me.

138
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,550
- ls she serious?
- Oh, yes. She's serious.

139
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,591
Does it all the time. She just said.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,073
That's right.

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,553
Er... Do you...

142
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,911
Oh, are you kidding? Him?
He'd just make jokes.

143
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,235
Well, OK, then. OK.
What time's good for you?

144
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,713
Well, personally,

145
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,752
l like to get at least half an hour
in before breakfast,

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,233
but...

147
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,231
Look. Any time's alright with me.

148
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,954
Darling, l like you.

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,637
There is something so beautiful
about experiencing it outdoors.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,391
Don't people stare at you?

151
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,150
Yes. Sometimes.

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,555
But they end up learning something.

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,794
Sometimes people even join in.

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,828
All this talk has gotten me excited.
What the hell? Let's do it now!

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,353
Outside?

156
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,358
No. lt's a little cold
and l prefer to take my shoes off.

157
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,392
Sam, could we use your office, huh?

158
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,317
Wait. l've let this go...

159
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,671
No, no, no. We don't need
to hear from Mr Sceptic.

160
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,349
Rick here is after something
and l can show him where it is.

161
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,193
Start doing different things.

162
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,073
You gotta... l dunno.
Maybe discover some rituals

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,634
or... superstitions.

164
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,352
Maybe carry a lucky charm.

165
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,993
l know that sounds silly,

166
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,237
but what you gotta do now
is break up your routine.

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,555
Do you have any superstitions, Sammy?

168
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,156
Well, yeah,
l had one crazy little one.

169
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,239
l never pitched to anybody
named Reggie, Willie or The Bull.

170
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,830
You did have the lucky charm, Sammy.

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,590
Yeah, l did. That's true.

172
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,119
What was it?

173
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,277
Well, it was a bottle cap
that l found once.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,597
For some reason, l picked it up
and started carrying it around.

175
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,199
After a while, l figured

176
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,357
it had something to do
with things going my way.

177
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,152
l sure could use that bottle cap.

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,157
lt doesn't have to be this one.

179
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,158
lt could be any bottle cap really
or anything.

180
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,679
Sam, you still have it?

181
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,231
Well, yeah. l just started carrying
it around more as a superstition.

182
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,511
- Could l borrow that for a few days?
- This?

183
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,235
Please, Sam.
This could mean my whole career.

184
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,078
Well...

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,509
A couple of days. Sure. l guess so.

186
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,871
l can't guarantee
that it's gonna work.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,310
Hey, Sam, l'm desperate.
l'll try anything.

188
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,351
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

189
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,233
- Let me buy you a beer.
- No, thanks. l got practice.

190
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
l'll see you in a couple
of days. Thanks a lot.

191
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,350
- See ya, bud.
- Best of luck. So long.

192
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,913
Hey, Rick?

193
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,278
Hey, Sammy? How about
another beer down here?

194
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,833
Sure.

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,520
l never thought
you'd part with the bottle top.

196
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,077
Come on, Coach. lt's er... only
going to be for a couple of days.

197
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,237
lt's not like it's special
or anything magical.

198
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,669
Hey, Cliffy. Here you go.

199
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,755
Gee, l hope you haven't lost
your other talent too.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,195
Did Rick Walker
pitch again last night?

201
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,311
Yeah. He got another save.

202
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,079
That old bottle cap
comes through again, huh?

203
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,079
That's 3 saves and 2 wins in 2 weeks.

204
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,033
All of a sudden, the city of Boston's
in love with him.

205
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,038
- Yeah. Everybody but Sammy.
- Yeah.

206
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,516
Sam and his pre-scientific notions
of magical bottle caps.

207
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,631
You gotta admit. He's had bad luck.

208
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,990
- l know.
- Sorry l'm late.

209
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,473
What is it today, Sammy?

210
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,478
Nothing too exciting.
l locked my keys in the car.

211
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,953
Hey! l won the pool!

212
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,355
Cliff wins three days in a row.
lt's uncanny.

213
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,072
What did you have yesterday?

214
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,351
Scrapes and nicks,
and he cut himself shaving.

215
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,358
And the day before that,
l had... stubbing something.

216
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,038
lt still hurts.

217
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,396
Tell me. What do you like tomorrow?

218
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,154
l see a mine shaft.

219
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,759
Sam, come on.

220
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,919
Tell me you don't think this is
because you've lost your talisman.

221
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,556
Look what's happening to Rick with
that cap, becoming a Hall of Famer.

222
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,070
- He was on AM Boston this morning.
- No kidding. What did he say?

223
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,672
l don't know, l left my TV by
the heater last night. lt exploded.

224
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,314
- Were you hurt?
- No. Luckily l was unconscious

225
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,919
in my bathtub.

226
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,471
Sam? Do you realise that you are
causing these accidents yourself?

227
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,352
What are you talking about ?

228
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,631
Well, you've obviously
got something else on your mind.

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,432
You're not concentrating,

230
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,994
You're making these
terrible things happen.

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,640
Sammy, let me have
a Dewar's rot and a red wine.

232
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,354
Coach. Listen.

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,956
How many games did he win
with that silly thing in his pocket

234
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,752
that he takes it so seriously?

235
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,634
None.

236
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,270
- None?
- None.

237
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,868
Then why does he think
it's a good luck charm?

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,991
lt had nothing to do with baseball.

239
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,118
l knew it.

240
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,878
l knew there was more to this.

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,672
Come on. Why's it so important?

242
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,792
Please, Diane. l can't tell you.
l'm sorry. l can't.

243
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,036
Come on, Coach. l'm real curious.

244
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,948
OK. You can ask me
a yes or a no question.

245
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,479
OK.

246
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,636
- One question?
- Yes.

247
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,716
Sam, would you take that, please?

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,958
Sammy, you grabbed
the coffee pot by the sides.

249
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,672
- Yes l did.
- Doesn't it hurt?

250
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,791
Hurt's not the right word.

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,150
Anybody have any money down
on the coffee pot?

252
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,518
Sammy, you've got to
get that bottle cap back.

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,791
For the first time in my life,
l'd rather be me than you.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,515
Yeah, Sam, ask the kid for the cap,
will ya? He's goin' good now.

255
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,916
Maybe he's rolling again.
He's got the old confidence back.

256
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,632
Maybe he doesn't need it now.

257
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,513
Sam, please, give him a call.
He'll understand.

258
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,119
- Go on.
- Think so?

259
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,992
Absolutely. Go on. Right now.

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,957
Well, alright. lf you guys insist.

261
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,593
Wait a minute, Sammy.

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,429
You can't call him now.
His game's started at Fenway.

263
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,551
<i>And the Red Sox take the field...</i>

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, l guess you're right.

265
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,196
l can survive nine innings, huh?

266
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,595
With your luck,
it'll go into extra innings.

267
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,074
<i>That's out</i>, <i>number 3.</i>
<i>Walker has done it again.</i>

268
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,955
<i>He retires the side and we head into</i>
<i>the bottom of the 2 1 st inning.</i>

269
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,553
Perfect...

270
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,797
No kidding.
Norm, is it the 21 st inning?

271
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,670
Let's see...

272
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,479
l get 22, but this one
could be the national anthem.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,719
That's too much baseball for me.
l'm heading out.

274
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,356
Not me, Cliffy. l'm a real Red Sox
fan. l stay to the very last out.

275
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,789
lt's closing time.
l can't serve you anymore.

276
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,196
Not like it's the World Series
or anything.

277
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,792
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Norm.

278
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,480
Wake up, Diane.
Cliffy, let's go do something.

279
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,593
Not tonight, Norm. l gotta be at the
post office soon to pick up my bag.

280
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,393
l gotta go crawl into bed with mine.

281
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,314
Well. l think l might
get on home too.

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,715
l'll see ya tomorrow, Sam.

283
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,751
Come on, Carla. l'll give you a lift.

284
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,711
Nah, l don't wanna miss the game.

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,558
You can hear it on the car radio.

286
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,398
How far away is your car ?

287
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,193
- A block and a half.
- Wait for the right moment.

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,834
<i>We pause 1 0 seconds</i>
<i>for station identification.</i>

289
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,359
Coach, the keys!

290
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,833
Which direction?

291
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,157
One block north
and about a half a block east.

292
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,236
Or did l take the bus today?

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,113
Goodnight, Diane. Sam, don't worry
about a thing. lt's gonna be alright.

294
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,996
Well, l guess l'll knock off too, OK?

295
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,473
Yeah.

296
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,718
Yeah. l could go to the all-night
bookstore in Cambridge

297
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,515
or l could go home
and make myself a cup of tea.

298
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,915
- What do you think l should do, Sam?
- Score!

299
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,270
That would have to be the bookstore.

300
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,073
<i>lt's a high drive. lf it stays</i>
<i>fair</i>, <i>that's a home run.</i>

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,270
<i>lt's fair and it's gone!</i>

302
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,791
Right. The game's over
and my baby's comin' home.

303
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,069
May l ask a question?

304
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,795
Could you hold that? l've got
a very important phone call to make.

305
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,717
- You're calling Rick, right?
- Yeah, l think that's his name.

306
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,717
Do you have
the number of the bull pit?

307
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,072
No. They'd probably
be in the bunkhouse by now.

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,958
Marty. Hey. Yeah,
lt's, well, it's Mayday Malone.

309
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,433
How are you doing?

310
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,118
Yeah, thank you. l'm fine.

311
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,117
Listen, is Walker there?

312
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,038
Alright.
When he gets out of the showers,

313
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,469
tell him to call me here at Cheers.

314
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,352
Alright? OK. Thanks.

315
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,389
l believe you had a question there.

316
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,637
Well, l guess lt isn't important now.

317
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,639
lt's just that l know this bottle cap
has nothing to do with baseball

318
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,151
and... l was sort of hoping that
you'd tell me what it's about.

319
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,596
l know you've been curious.

320
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,793
l didn't wanna tell you the real
situation cos you'll think l'm silly.

321
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,950
Well, would it ease your mind at all

322
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,548
if l told you
l already think you're silly?

323
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,636
Yeah. That might help a little bit.

324
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,111
You see, that little bottle cap
keeps me from drinking. Silly, huh?

325
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,910
You don't...
hear it speaking, do you?

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,595
Well, nothing beyond
an occasional little small talk.

327
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,676
lt is a very little bottle cap.

328
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,988
Alright. l'll buy it.

329
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,275
How does it keep you from drinking,
just out of curiosity?

330
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,268
lt's the cap off the last bottle
of beer l ever drank,

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,278
the last anything l ever drank.

332
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,110
l remember holding onto that bottle
cap during some pretty rough nights.

333
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,471
l'd wake up in the morning
and have its imprint in my palm.

334
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,398
lt was flat cos l was
squeezing it so hard.

335
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,316
When l was tempted to have a drink,
sometimes l'd look at the bottle cap

336
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,874
and it would stop me.

337
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,678
That's a pretty great
little bottle cap, huh?

338
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,872
You wanna know something
really crazy?

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,551
The last couple of nights, l've
really had an urge to have a drink.

340
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,552
- lt's probably for you.
- Probably.

341
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,638
Listen. Thank you.
Thank you for listening.

342
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,159
Oh, well...

343
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,319
lf l wasn't here, l'd be at home in
bed with <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

344
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,271
Don't say anything.

345
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,118
Hello? Hey, Rick. How ya doing?

346
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,596
Hey, that's a pretty terrific win
you got there for yourself.

347
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,438
Yeah. Congratulations.

348
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,838
Listen. l guess you're kinda back
on the beam now, wouldn't you say?

349
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,110
You know,
l was thinking this afternoon.

350
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,394
You remember l loaned you
a bottle cap or something?

351
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,636
Well, it's gonna sound funny

352
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,957
but l'm kinda missing
that dumb thing.

353
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,673
You did?

354
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,754
Why didn't you tell me that, Rick?

355
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,073
No, that's all right.

356
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,952
No, never mind. That's...

357
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,313
What's wrong?

358
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,911
He lost it a week ago in Kansas City.

359
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,554
He was putting off
telling me about it.

360
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,513
Kansas City.

361
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,199
One town
l've always wanted to see. Huh?

362
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,515
We'll jump on a plane.

363
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,550
Well, what's the difference?
Easy come, easy go, huh?

364
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,511
Come on, Sam. Let's get out.

365
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,317
Go home. Diane...

366
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,716
l tell you what. Even better.
Let's just talk, you know?

367
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,634
What are you gonna tell me that
l haven't heard a hundred times, huh?

368
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,359
Oh, come on, Sam. lt's important
that you not be here tonight, huh?

369
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,033
You don't wanna be in a bar.

370
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,675
Where am l gonna be tomorrow night,
and the next, and the day after?

371
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,153
l'm gonna be in a bar.

372
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,271
You're gonna feel better tomorrow.

373
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,791
No.
No, l'm gonna feel better tonight.

374
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,196
Here's an idea.
Why don't you watch me get drunk?

375
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,992
l'll get real sick...

376
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,752
- Sam, no...
- Don't. Just don't.

377
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,349
l guess l gave
the wrong one to Rick, huh?

378
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,277
l'm sorry. Are you alright ?

379
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,194
Yeah, l'm fine. l knew you could
do it. l knew you could do it.

380
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,992
You're...

381
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,515
