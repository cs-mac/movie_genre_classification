1
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,473
My bleeding feet!

2
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,512
Hello, Mrs. Joseph.

3
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,030
I like your hair.
Is that strawberry blonde?

4
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,878
You're only jealous.

5
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,796
What's for the old man's
supper tonight?

6
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,878
He'll be lucky to get
faggots and pease pudd, he will.

7
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,913
Well, he can't do much
on that, can he?

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,593
All I want him for
is to keep me feet warm.

9
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,632
Excuse me, dearie.

10
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,836
Here, Gert.

11
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,113
I wouldn't mind having this little lot
in my stocking for Christmas.

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,358
What would you do with him?
You've been a widow too long.

13
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,919
You speak for yourself.

14
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,590
It's like riding a bicycle.
You never forget how.

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,033
I'll tell you what I'll do.

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,278
I'll send my Alfie to you.
He's not bad once he gets going.

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,758
Well, I hope he's well-sprung.

18
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,390
Morning.

19
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,758
Looking for someone, mate?

20
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,552
Nice day, isn't it?

21
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,590
Sorry.

22
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,798
Hackman's in the staff room.

23
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,230
Where he bleeding well belongs.

24
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,870
Good morning.

25
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,869
My name is Thackeray.
I'm a new teacher.

26
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,039
We were expecting you.

27
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,552
So you're the new lamb
for the slaughter.

28
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,355
Or should I say...

29
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,789
...black sheep?

30
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,356
No, just a teacher, Mr. Hackman.

31
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,269
I'm not Hackman.
Perish the thought.

32
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,111
He's departed,
God rest his soul.

33
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,150
He's probably pouring out his woes
to the divisional officer by now.

34
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,989
Weston.

35
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,799
I'm Mrs. Evans, Grace.
Deputy head.

36
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,115
Mrs. Evans.

37
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,038
Have you seen any children yet?

38
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,118
I looked in on Mr. Hackman's class
for a moment.

39
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,111
I take them for domestic science.

40
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,789
Like a cup of tea?

41
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,275
No, thank you, not just now.

42
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,673
You been teaching long?

43
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,957
This is my first appointment.

44
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,472
We call them jobs.

45
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,795
American, are you?

46
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,036
British, from British Guiana.

47
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,197
But I spent some years
in the States.

48
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,994
- Where?
- In California.

49
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,192
Weather as good as they say?

50
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,754
It's better.

51
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,950
What was your subject?

52
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,917
What did you major in?

53
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,758
Engineering.

54
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,029
I must be off.
Make yourself at home.

55
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,276
Wander around, if you like,
or stay here.

56
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,357
I'll introduce you at lunch.

57
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,789
Thank you.

58
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,148
This is Gillian, Mr. Thackeray.

59
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,434
Gillian Blanchard.

60
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,631
She's new here too.
Came the day before yesterday.

61
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,838
- Tea, Gillian?
- Thank you.

62
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,280
This is Mr. Mark Thackeray,
the new replacement.

63
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,596
Jose Dawes,
Euphemia Phillips.

64
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,552
They teach the little ones.

65
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,068
Theo Weston, you know.

66
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,954
I've had the pleasure.
He mistook me for Hackman.

67
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,958
- He's fled.
- I don't blame him.

68
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,071
That's enough to destroy anybody.

69
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,952
He got what he deserved.

70
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,708
I'm Clinty Clintridge.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,479
Clinty's a marvelous artist.

72
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,354
Got one at the Royal Academy
a couple of years ago.

73
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,312
Teaching provides the bread and butter.

74
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,398
Well, that's all the staff
except for Mr. Bell...

75
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,193
...our P.T. Instructor.

76
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,311
I hope you're
going to stay with us.

77
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,949
I shouldn't if I were you, old man.

78
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,912
Row home while you can.

79
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,832
Don't discourage him, Weston.

80
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,638
Well, I must go.

81
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,559
I have to fix a bath
for a girl in Clinty's class.

82
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,670
Why?

83
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,996
Kids complained again.
Won't sit near her.

84
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,269
What's the matter?

85
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,278
Personal hygiene problems.

86
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,198
Fourteen and helpless.

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,319
You men are lucky.

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,872
The things we women have to do
for these kids.

89
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,355
Gillian, dear...

90
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,233
...encourage him to stay.

91
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,354
Why is it everyone thinks
I need encouraging?

92
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,358
They said the same to me.

93
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,873
There's something frightening but
also challenging about this school.

94
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,391
There's no form of corporal
punishment or any punishment.

95
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,715
None?

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,514
I have no real teaching experience.
I'm lost.

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,631
I don't have any experience either.

98
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,197
But it'll be much easier for you.

99
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,997
I'm a little afraid of them.

100
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,034
Midday dance session.

101
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,790
At lunch, the older kids use the hall.
I sometimes join them.

102
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,638
Even the old man shakes a leg.

103
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,388
Dancing is merely their way
of keeping fit...

104
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,036
...for the more exciting pastime
of teacher baiting.

105
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,356
Couldn't you be
a bit less discouraging?

106
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,790
It's the last thing I want to do.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,479
The music's louder than usual.

108
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,593
They're probably celebrating
victory over Hackman.

109
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,276
I better go and see Mr. Florian.

110
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,039
I'll show you the way.

111
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,515
- They're good, aren't they?
- I suppose so.

112
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,673
The head's study is this way.

113
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,875
<i>Do you two...</i>

114
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,155
Do you two shake?

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,674
Well, I'll see you later,
Mr. Thackeray.

116
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,075
Well?

117
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,116
Thank you.

118
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,595
But I have to go
and see the principal.

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,350
You have excellent qualifications,
astonishing ones, in fact...

120
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,392
...as a communications engineer.

121
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,274
<i>Field experience in South America...</i>

122
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,398
Why do you want to be a teacher?

123
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,670
Reasons.

124
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,349
You've already tried to get
an engineering post?

125
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,756
I tried for 18 months, sir.

126
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,995
We have no blueprint in North Quay.

127
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,716
Most of our children are
rejects from other schools.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,195
We must help and teach them
as best we can...

129
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,038
...and as much as we can.

130
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,039
The local authorities are not
totally on our side.

131
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,154
And if you accept this position,
you'll be entirely on your own.

132
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,637
I and the staff will do
everything we can to help you...

133
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,037
...but success or failure
will depend entirely upon you.

134
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,476
What's it to be?

135
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,068
I want the job, sir.

136
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,390
Good.

137
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,869
Then it's settled.

138
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,388
Tomorrow, you'll take over
Hackman's class.

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,035
Sapiano.

140
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,869
Wong.

141
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,395
Osgood.

142
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,190
Tuffen.

143
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,076
Pegg.

144
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,996
Pegg?

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,355
Joseph.

146
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,349
Dare.

147
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,876
Potter.

148
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,716
Potter.

149
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,430
Denham.

150
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,556
Buckley.

151
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,789
Purcell.

152
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,995
Fernman.

153
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,910
Jackson.

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,554
Strong.

155
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,949
Seales.

156
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,556
- Palmer.
- Yes, Guvnor.

157
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,469
Campbell.

158
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,556
Present.

159
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,552
I don't know how much you know,
so we'll start from scratch.

160
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,518
First, as I call your name...

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,349
...will you read anything you like
from one of your schoolbooks?

162
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,275
Fernman.

163
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,995
Right.

164
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,793
"Only those who...

165
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,678
...arrived on...

166
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,713
...horseback...

167
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,915
<i>...or in a public coach. "
- Thank you.</i>

168
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,230
Denham.

169
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,590
"If 14 hens lay an egg
a day for 30 days...

170
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,839
...how much are the eggs a dozen,
and how many have you to sell?"

171
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,676
Moira Joseph.

172
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,350
"Pete Gilroy's weight
and the ever-tightening noose...

173
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,153
...about her neck...

174
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,110
...began slightly to impede
the wild mare's speed.

175
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,030
But Pete was only too fully aware
of what his fate would be...

176
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,390
...for he could not hope
to escape death...

177
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,830
...from being battered and crushed. "

178
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,591
Put that away, please.

179
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,230
Thank you.

180
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,872
Would anyone else like to read?

181
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,316
- Your name, please.
- Pamela Dare.

182
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,792
"And he had learned to love.

183
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,149
I know not why...

184
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,113
...for this in such as him
seemed strange of mood.

185
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,874
But thus it was.

186
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,191
And though
in solitude's small part...

187
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,869
...the nipped affections
have to grow.

188
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,719
In him this glowed...

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,673
...when all beside
had ceased to glow. "

190
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,194
Thank you, Miss Dare.

191
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,596
Next, weights and measures.

192
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,554
What's avoirdupois?

193
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,637
- Avoir de what?
- Avoirdupois.

194
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,075
Weights.

195
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,789
Heavyweight, light-heavy,
cruiserweight...

196
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,640
...middle, light, bantam,
fly, featherweight.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,877
Thank you very much.

198
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,913
It's encouraging that
you have a sense of humour.

199
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,992
It seems you know so little
and are easily amused...

200
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,111
...I can look forward to a happy time.

201
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,750
Copy down the following tables.

202
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,758
Who does he think he is, there?

203
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,234
The cheeky devil.

204
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,994
Hello, ducks.

205
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,477
Thought you might need this.

206
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,948
How'd it go?

207
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,234
Let's just say, battle was joined.

208
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,789
I don't know what we'd do
without a cuppa.

209
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,308
What's your name?

210
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,791
I know that.
I mean, your other name.

211
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,149
Mark.

212
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,958
Couple of things, Mark.

213
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,711
We all know the old man's views.

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,036
Basically, we agree with them.

215
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,550
But he's safe in an office.

216
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,636
These kids come from homes where
an order is accompanied by a blow.

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,037
One rude word to their parents,
the roof will hit them.

218
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,354
There's nothing like that
going on here, right?

219
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,517
So they've got us
at a great disadvantage.

220
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,232
Hackman tried to be popular.
He hung himself.

221
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,192
Weston couldn't care less
about them, and that's no good.

222
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,550
I can't guide you...

223
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,197
...but don't take any nonsense
from these little tykes.

224
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,790
They're good kids, Mark,
most of them.

225
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,759
But if you don't solve them,
they'll break you and damn quickly.

226
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,314
That's been tried...

227
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,669
...by experts.

228
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,071
They're very expert.

229
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,916
Please can I leave the room, Guv?

230
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,515
Yes. And it's "Thackeray. "

231
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,275
Yes, Guv.

232
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,790
Most of you girls help your mothers
with the shopping.

233
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,073
So sorry, Mr. Thackeray.

234
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,835
Proper drafty in these parts,
isn't it?

235
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,549
About multiplying...

236
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,994
...there are a few
valuable tricks to know.

237
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,438
Say that you're offered roast beef
at seven shillings per pound.

238
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,990
Potter.

239
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,036
Must you do that?

240
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,755
I can't help it, Sir.
It's me desk.

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,149
Poor old Potts!

242
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,870
Sit down.

243
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,753
I'll speak with the caretaker
about it after school.

244
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,955
Isn't he nice?

245
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,230
I hope I didn't miss nothing.

246
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,636
Where was we?
About shopping or some...?

247
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,751
That's enough, Denham.

248
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,555
I was only asking, Mr. Thackeray.
I don't wanna miss nothing.

249
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,759
Bert, he was just about to show us
a new and valuable trick.

250
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,470
- When you're shopping, you see...
- I said, that's enough.

251
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,190
Sit down.

252
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,433
Do exercise four, five and six.

253
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,118
Very quietly.

254
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,790
Don't worry.
The worst is still to come.

255
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,554
You're still getting
the silent treatment.

256
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,512
What's the next phase?

257
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,272
Well, unless you can work up
a little black magic...

258
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,150
...these little bastards have
a multitude of tricks.

259
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,078
Why did you take up teaching?

260
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,429
It's good to have some kind of a job.

261
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,032
But I'm teaching them nothing.
I'm not even getting to first base.

262
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,348
Don't worry,
your lot leaves this term.

263
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,874
The next will be better.

264
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,270
They'll be just as bad.
Probably worse.

265
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,235
What's your answer?

266
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,509
What they need...

267
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,235
...is a bloody good hiding.

268
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,912
I feel rather sorry for them,
you know?

269
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,392
Most of them can hardly read.

270
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,158
You're so naive,
my dear old colleague.

271
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,351
They'll be earning twice as much
as us before you can shake a stick.

272
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,519
They'll happily be part
of the great London unwashed:

273
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,630
Illiterate...

274
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,759
...smelly...

275
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,837
...and quite content.

276
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,513
An education's a disadvantage
in this day and age.

277
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,152
That is ridiculous!

278
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,793
But still true.

279
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,990
So you'd better start
brushing up...

280
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,953
...on your voodoo if you wish
to remain sane.

281
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,756
Good morning.

282
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,431
All right, take your seats.

283
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,800
- All right, Sir?
- I hope you didn't hurt yourself.

284
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,790
You all right?

285
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,072
Cheap stuff they're selling nowadays.

286
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,548
Want me to help, Sir?

287
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,549
Sit down.

288
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,717
Take your proper places.

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,673
We can move around here,
you know, Sir.

290
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,754
Take your proper places.

291
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,798
Beg your pardon.

292
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,194
Something the matter?

293
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,356
Seales, is something wrong?

294
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,435
It's me mum.
She's awful sick.

295
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,713
I'm sorry.

296
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,754
Anything I can do?

297
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,550
Nothing.

298
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,960
- She's English.
- I see.

299
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,193
You're like my old man,
except bigger and younger.

300
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,549
Rotten bastard!

301
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,512
You shouldn't speak like that.

302
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,439
You know nothing.
I hate him!

303
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,835
Why not?

304
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,112
Never forgive him for
what he did to me mum. Never!

305
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,035
He married her, didn't he?
Didn't he?!

306
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,592
Today, let's take a look
at South America.

307
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,476
I'm sorry, Mr. Fackeray.
The bloody things just slipped.

308
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,675
The name is Thackeray,
and they are not "bloody things. "

309
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,235
They were a pile of books.

310
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,352
That's a good netting score.

311
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,872
Pam, luv, that's not a bloody pile,
but it's a pile of books.

312
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,229
All right, settle down.

313
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,119
I was only trying to help,
Mr. Thackeray, Sir.

314
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,753
That's right, Mr. Thackeray.

315
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,589
Curley was only trying to put
that little scrubber in her place.

316
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,876
I know what Curley was trying to do.
Now, just settle down.

317
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,431
We are going to study
South America.

318
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,318
Now turn to page 37
in your geography book.

319
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,669
"They were alone...

320
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,635
...but not alone as they who
shut in chambers think it loneliness.

321
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,276
The voiceless sand and the drooping
caves that lay around them...

322
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,510
<i>...made them to each other press as if
there were no life beneath the sky... "</i>

323
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,113
Sorry, luv.
It's the bleeding desk.

324
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,112
You speak such words
to your father?

325
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,316
You're not my bleeding father!

326
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,159
All I want to know is,
who does he think he is?

327
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,478
Mate, shut up!

328
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,350
Morning.

329
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,829
Hello, Thackeray.
How goes it?

330
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,794
Fine, thank you, sir.

331
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,638
All you boys, out!

332
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,318
The girls stay where they are.

333
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,709
What's the matter?

334
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,473
Out!
Out at once!

335
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,829
All right.

336
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,240
I am sick of your foul language...

337
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,717
...your crude behaviour
and your sluttish manner.

338
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,070
A decent woman keeps
some things private.

339
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,635
Only a filthy slut
would have done this!

340
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,751
Those who encouraged her
are bad too!

341
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,793
I don't care who's responsible!
You're all to blame!

342
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,355
I'm leaving for five minutes,
by which time...

343
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,989
...that disgusting object
had better be removed!

344
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,271
And open the windows
to clear the stench!

345
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,229
If you must play these filthy games,
do them in your homes...

346
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,553
...and not in my classroom!

347
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,956
What's the matter?

348
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,593
Man, oh, man!

349
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,917
I lost my temper. The one thing
I swore I would never do.

350
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,872
God, did I lose my temper!

351
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,910
What happened?

352
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,435
After all the bull
I've taken in my life...

353
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,912
...in a few short weeks,
those kids have got me so steamed up...

354
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,033
...so easy, so quickly.

355
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,072
I never would have thought it.

356
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,995
- Perhaps you're trying too hard.
- Those kids are devils incarnate.

357
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,397
I tried everything. Everything!
But nothing I tried...

358
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,035
Kids.

359
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,755
Kids.

360
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,109
That's it!

361
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,959
Those are out.

362
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,752
They are useless to you.

363
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,878
I realized you are not children.

364
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,119
You will be adults in a few weeks,
with all the responsibilities.

365
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,075
From now on, you will be treated
as such by me and by each other...

366
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,716
...as adults.
Responsible adults.

367
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,117
Next, we'll be reasonable
with each other.

368
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,789
We are just going to talk,
you and I.

369
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,231
You will listen
without interruption.

370
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,229
And when I am finished,
one of you may have your say...

371
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,192
...without interruptions.

372
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,435
Next...

373
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,434
What a morning!
Everything's gone wrong.

374
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,837
The alarm didn't go off.
Then I had to wait hours for a bus.

375
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,315
I must've stood there
three bleeding hours...

376
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,589
Example:

377
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,471
There are two ways to enter a room.

378
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,035
One is like an adult,
a lady with dignity.

379
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,713
The other is like a brat.

380
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,638
Miss Dare's shown the second way.
Perhaps you'd demonstrate the first?

381
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,998
I'm sorry I'm late.

382
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,230
Next...

383
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,479
...we are all going to observe
certain courtesies in this classroom.

384
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,831
You will call me
Sir or Mr. Thackeray.

385
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,714
The young ladies will be
addressed as Miss...

386
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,513
...the boys by their surnames.

387
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,234
Why should we call them Miss?
We know them.

388
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,794
I beg your pardon?

389
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,355
I said, why should we
call them Miss, Sir?

390
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,675
We know them.

391
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,871
Is there a young lady you feel...

392
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,799
...does not deserve to be
addressed as Miss?

393
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,473
- No, Sir.
- Good.

394
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,316
Next, general deportment.

395
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,312
First, the young ladies.

396
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,315
They must prove worthy of
the courtesies we'll show them.

397
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,551
Soon boyfriends and marriage
will concern you.

398
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,268
No man likes a slut for long.

399
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,120
Only the worst type will marry one.

400
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,994
And the competition for men
on the outside is rough.

401
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,399
Next, men.

402
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,592
I've seen garbage collectors
who are cleaner.

403
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,271
Toughness is a quality
of the mind...

404
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,074
...like bravery,
honesty and ambition.

405
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,629
If you want to wear your hair long,
clean it...

406
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,639
...else you'll soon get lice and smell.

407
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,669
Soon your principle interest
will be girls.

408
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,037
You will be more attractive
with clean clothes, shoes...

409
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,635
...hands, face, teeth, et cetera.

410
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,634
Any questions?

411
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,076
Miss Pegg.

412
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,278
What about Mr. Weston, Sir?

413
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,348
He's never tidy, his shoes is
never brushed and his hair's a mess.

414
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,390
It's filthy.

415
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,153
Mr. Weston is not your teacher.
We won't discuss him.

416
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,316
I'm the one to criticize
if I fail to maintain the standards.

417
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,595
That's not fair.

418
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,510
Sir...

419
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,748
...or Mr. Thackeray.
Didn't you understand?

420
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,719
That's not fair...

421
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,915
...Sir.

422
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,670
I agree.

423
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,199
But it's an example of things
you'll have to put up with as an adult.

424
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,432
You'll just have to take it.

425
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,990
Next, we are going to talk
about various...

426
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,037
Good morning.

427
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,073
- I wanted to see how you were doing.
- Fine, thank you.

428
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,110
Good.

429
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,149
Thank you.

430
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,189
What is it?

431
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,275
Palmer?

432
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,270
What are we gonna talk about, Sir?

433
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,589
About life...

434
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,955
...survival...

435
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,915
...love...

436
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,953
...death, sex, marriage...

437
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,152
...rebellion, anything you want.

438
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,835
I never did see one like him, Pam.

439
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,317
Even when he blew his stack,
no swearing or nothing.

440
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,350
Blimey!

441
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,110
Ain't natural, that's what.
Does he really mean what he says?

442
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,276
I don't know.

443
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,473
It'd be a change, though, to see
those creeps acting like gents.

444
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,471
Here, which one do you fancy?

445
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,955
I like Babs.

446
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,119
Yeah? Watch this.

447
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,520
- Come on, Pam, luv.
- Get lost, Denham!

448
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,230
I don't like
your smelly tricks, do I?

449
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,351
And it's Miss Dare to you.

450
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,554
Get stuffed.

451
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,189
Come on then, luv.

452
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,993
You heard what Sir said,
Mr. Smarty Denham.

453
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,878
If you want to dance with me,
you bleeding well ask proper.

454
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,759
May I have the pleasure
of this dance, Miss Pegg?

455
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,268
Blimey!
Good old Potts.

456
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,470
Get you, Potter.

457
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,790
Shut up!

458
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,554
Who does he think he is,
bleeding Fred Astaire?

459
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,388
Come on, Miss Pegg.

460
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,637
Look at me.
I am a lady, I am.

461
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,553
Rotten tarts, all of them.

462
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,751
Chimney sweep was right about that.

463
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,395
He won't catch me
spending me nicker on them.

464
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,070
He said we could talk about anything.

465
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,992
You are so right, Tich, mate.

466
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,310
He did say
we could ask him anything.

467
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,033
Questions and answers.

468
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,753
Last night on the telly,
there was this travelogue picture.

469
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,237
You know, a lot of black women
dancing around with no tops.

470
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,195
Don't they ever dress proper?

471
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,710
What's proper varies
throughout the world...

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,831
...depending on
customs and climate.

473
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,675
For their climate and customs,
they were dressed properly.

474
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,313
Are you from South Africa?

475
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,637
Of course not.
South Africans is white, isn't they?

476
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,869
A South African is a native
of South Africa, regardless of colour.

477
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,116
I was born in British Guiana.

478
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,669
What did you mean the other day
about rebellion, Sir?

479
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,475
Change.

480
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,875
Take your hairstyles.
That's a form of rebellion, isn't it?

481
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,150
What, Sir?

482
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,352
Don't you do it
to be different from adults?

483
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,710
They've messed up the world,
haven't they?

484
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,309
- You can say that again.
- So you rebel.

485
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,832
Even the way you dress is
a form of rebellion, isn't it?

486
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,792
It's just the new fashion, Sir.

487
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,516
Of course, the adults look
proper stupid in our gear.

488
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,837
Do you think it's wrong
to be different, to rebel?

489
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,312
It is your duty to change
the world, if you can.

490
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,954
Not by violence.

491
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,152
Peacefully, individually,
not as a mob.

492
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,552
Take the Beatles.
They started a huge social revolution.

493
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,832
The fashions they set in dress...

494
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,509
...and hairstyles are worldwide now.

495
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,398
Every new fashion...

496
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,949
...is a form of rebellion.

497
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,714
There's an exhibit
of costumes through the ages...

498
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,916
...at the Victoria
and Albert Museum.

499
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,873
I think you should see it.

500
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,118
Also, you should see
the Museum of Natural History.

501
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,630
What, us lot go to a museum?

502
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,955
- Sure.
- You're joking.

503
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,313
You'll discover that
your hairstyles are 200 years old...

504
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,916
...and that your costumes
or your dress...

505
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,872
...is right out of 1920.

506
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,032
Shut up!
Look, Sir, when can we go?

507
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,835
There's no time after school,
and I've got to look after the kids.

508
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,430
I have to do the housework
and get the supper for the lodgers.

509
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,076
Me mum's expecting a baby any day,
and I got to babysit.

510
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,232
Why don't you take us?
We could go in the morning.

511
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,395
Who would like that?

512
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,795
What a drag!

513
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,594
Don't you want a day off?
Put your hand up.

514
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,034
- Put both hands up.
- Fat chance!

515
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,348
It wouldn't work.

516
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,037
It's not the sort of risk
we'd dare to take at North Quay.

517
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,639
I would like to try, Sir.

518
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,833
The best of pupils are inclined
to show off in public.

519
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,430
Your class?

520
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,875
You'd never be able
to supervise them.

521
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,997
When I took this job,
you said you wouldn't interfere...

522
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,840
...as long as I stayed
within your framework.

523
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,599
If you can get another
staff member to go with you...

524
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,677
...I'll approach the council.

525
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,031
I see little hope of approval.

526
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,669
Thank you, Sir.

527
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,670
Miss Blanchard, I think I can
arrange an outing with my class...

528
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,190
...if I can get
another teacher to go along.

529
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,198
I'd love to.
And it's Gillian.

530
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,549
When is the outing?

531
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,035
When we get travel warrants
and permission.

532
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,753
Just let me know when.

533
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,110
Thanks, Gillian. Bye.

534
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,235
Good morning.

535
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,353
What would you like
to talk about today?

536
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,314
Ladies first.

537
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,270
Miss Joseph.

538
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,199
Marriage, Sir.
You know, boyfriends and things.

539
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,199
How do you know he's the right one?
What to look for.

540
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,993
How to avoid divorce.

541
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,759
Don't get married.

542
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,874
Where's Miss Purcell?

543
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,675
She's to look after the home.
Her mum had the baby last night.

544
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,029
What hospital?

545
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,234
No hospital, Sir.
The doctor came to her.

546
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,230
She all right?

547
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,636
Well, she just had a kid.
Didn't she?

548
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,830
Now, marriage.

549
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,435
First, let us lay some ground rules.

550
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,871
I've never been married,
so what I say is as an outsider.

551
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,276
Now, what should a girl
look for in a man?

552
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,870
I think first we ought
to determine what is marriage.

553
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,750
Miss Joseph.

554
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,078
Holy wedlock.

555
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,829
Potter, be serious.
You'll get your turn.

556
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,509
Miss Pegg.

557
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,994
It's life, isn't it, Sir?

558
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,431
Everyone gets married.
I mean, sometime.

559
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,630
Why didn't you?

560
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,234
No one would have him.

561
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,635
I was very poor.

562
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,397
There was something in me
that wanted an education...

563
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,750
...so I put all of
my energies into that.

564
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,555
Well, I got started later.
Just never met the right girl.

565
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,237
What should a girl
look for in a man?

566
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,555
- Miss Clark?
- What work did you do, Sir?

567
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,276
I waited tables.
I cooked in a hamburger joint.

568
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,790
I washed dishes for a time, cars.

569
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,039
For a year I was a janitor
in an apartment block.

570
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,072
- Lots of jobs.
- You washed dishes?

571
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,070
I did.

572
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,509
But you talk posh.

573
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,917
- That wasn't easy.
- You didn't always talk like that?

574
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,875
When I was your age, I used a patois,
a kind of simple English.

575
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,397
I going bust your booby
if you don't get up off of this...

576
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,039
I didn't understand a word.

577
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,278
Well, I don't always understand
what you say either.

578
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,438
If you work hard,
you can do almost anything.

579
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,314
You can get any job you want.
You can even...

580
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,595
You can even change your speech
if you want to.

581
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,913
After I got my degree, I worked
in South America for an oil company.

582
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,077
The only women in that region...

583
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,955
...were jungle Indians who carried
blowpipes and poison darts.

584
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,836
You could have broke my hands.

585
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,518
We were discussing marriage.

586
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,710
To my mind, marriage is
no way of life for the weak...

587
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,069
...the selfish...

588
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,794
...or the insecure.

589
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,913
What's the matter, Weston?

590
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,838
These damn fool Americans!

591
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,714
They bog up everything
they're connected with.

592
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,274
What a shower!

593
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,795
I'll never forgive the President
for missing Churchill's funeral...

594
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,719
...nor sending the vice president.
Rotten manners.

595
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,275
- It was very naughty.
- I quite agree.

596
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,109
A typically stupid, appalling
and unnecessary mistake.

597
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,790
- What can you expect?
- Still beefing?

598
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,072
Give them a chance.
They've not been leading the world...

599
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,753
...as long as Britain has.

600
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,600
You continue to astonish me,
old chum.

601
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,550
I should've thought
if anyone took a point...

602
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,955
Now what?

603
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,034
Miss Pegg wants to know
if the netball's fixed.

604
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,514
Miss who?

605
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,552
Barbara Pegg.
Miss Pegg, Sir.

606
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,273
Here you are, Fernman.

607
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,795
Thank you, Sir.

608
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,029
What's going on in
this classroom of yours?

609
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,029
Suburban formality? It's a bit
foreign in this neck of the woods.

610
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,392
Some sort of experiment
in culture for the masses?

611
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,069
It's an elementary
experiment in courtesy.

612
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,318
And do we ignorant critters
have to follow suit?

613
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,758
- Please yourself.
- Thank goodness for that!

614
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,759
Do you object to being
taught manners by the boys?

615
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,190
I won't to be taught
by those morons.

616
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,199
So long as we learn,
it doesn't matter who teaches us.

617
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,277
Good afternoon, everybody.

618
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,349
Now we're talking.

619
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,639
Nothing like payday.

620
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,515
By the way, your museum visit
has been approved.

621
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,836
If things go wrong,
the school suffers.

622
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,758
Nothing will go wrong, Sir.

623
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,833
For a moment, I thought
I was in the wrong classroom.

624
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,955
Where's Jackson?

625
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,276
We don't know.

626
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,075
Tich wouldn't miss this
unless he was sick or something.

627
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,998
We'll give him a few minutes.

628
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,190
It's me, Jackson.

629
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,915
I have to take the wash for mum.
Can you wait?

630
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,430
Sure.
How long will it take?

631
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,994
Half a mo.
Just up the frog.

632
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,076
God love you.

633
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,395
Hang on, Tich.
I'll give you a hand.

634
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,673
All right.

635
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,552
Back on the sidewalk.

636
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,435
What's a frog got to do with it?

637
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,995
It's rhyming slang.
Old-fashioned cockney.

638
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,151
It's only used by old people now.

639
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,475
It's a drag, Sir.

640
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,756
Frog means road.
Frog and toad, road.

641
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,990
Trouble, strife, wife.

642
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,236
Weeping willow, pillow.
The first word.

643
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,556
Like the old currant bun,
that's the sun.

644
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,110
- Apples and pears, stairs.
- Happy kill, skill.

645
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,474
Ginger beer, queer.

646
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,509
All aboard.

647
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,871
I think he fancies her.

648
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,513
I know you do.

649
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,153
Pamela has a crush on you.

650
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,198
Women say the damnedest things.

651
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,033
I think he's nice.

652
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,789
So do I.

653
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,069
You've noticed.

654
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,277
I treat her as I do
the other girls.

655
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,556
I hope we can go out again,
don't you?

656
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,590
I hope so.

657
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,115
I hope we can go with him,
because he's nice.

658
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,839
Don't be mistaken...

659
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,680
...Pamela's a woman
in every sense of the word.

660
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,516
I mean...

661
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,392
...not that I blame her.

662
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,236
Bleeding rotten taste he's got.

663
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,794
Good night, Sir.

664
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,995
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

665
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,631
Perhaps I could tidy your desk.

666
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,514
- That's all right.
- It's no trouble.

667
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,031
You should get a flat nearby.
Brentwood's much too far away.

668
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,595
- There's nice ones around.
- I've thought of it.

669
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,599
I tell you what.
I'll keep my ears open for you.

670
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,390
That's kind of you,
but I'm fine.

671
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,557
I'll let you know.
Thank you.

672
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,431
Don't worry about your desk.
I'll tidy it for you every day.

673
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,234
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

674
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,953
That's perfectly all right.

675
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,117
A woman's work is never done.

676
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,075
Good night, Sir.

677
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,352
Hi, fellas. How are you?

678
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,919
Good morning, Sir.

679
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,837
Mr. Florian has given us
permission for more outings.

680
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,840
I'd like to hear suggestions
of what we might do.

681
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,792
- The pictures.
- Wembley, Sir.

682
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,269
Cup Final Day.

683
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,549
Chamber of Horrors.

684
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,159
What about the Cavern?

685
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,118
You know, Liverpool.
The Beatles.

686
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,150
How's it going?

687
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,039
Fine, thank you.

688
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,151
He'll come with me on my day.

689
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,512
- You're under a supervision order too?
- That's nothing, Sir.

690
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,438
Most of us have broken the law.

691
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,872
Breaking windows, truancy,
raising hell and cussing the coppers.

692
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,393
You've cut yourself.

693
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,433
You'd better put something on that.
You'll get lockjaw.

694
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,948
Blimey!
Red blood.

695
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,036
What do you expect, pinhead?
Ink?

696
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,156
I didn't mean no harm.
It was a joke.

697
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,919
I didn't mean no crack, Sir.

698
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,189
It's all right.

699
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,030
What's with you?

700
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,590
Are you addressing me, Denham?

701
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,154
Potts was only being funny.

702
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,069
What you calling him pinhead for
in front of chimney sweep?

703
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,510
I was only joking.
Sir didn't mind.

704
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,915
He said, ask anything.

705
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,158
You call those questions?
Always on about his colour.

706
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,035
You're wasting our time.
Seales, you ought to know better.

707
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,272
What've I done?
I said nothing.

708
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,596
You never do,
and you're half-coloured.

709
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,633
You quietly sit on your ass.

710
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,075
If they wanna know,
why don't they ask you?

711
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,431
I'm not Sir, that's why.

712
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,118
I only wish I was.

713
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,033
I know what's eating you.

714
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,436
You fancy him, that's what.

715
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,429
This is a fine how-do-you-do,
isn't it, Potts?

716
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,870
You lay off, Denham,
you son of a bitch.

717
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,636
Today, I'm gonna show you
how to make salad.

718
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,911
You mean we've to cook and all?

719
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,154
Sure, why not?

720
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,351
My old man never cooked in his life.

721
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,030
He says that's women's work,
the kitchen and all.

722
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,833
But suppose you're on your own,
as you certainly will be shortly.

723
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,237
You'll have to do it for yourself
sometimes, won't you?

724
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,077
Not again, Sir.

725
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,676
This is survival training.

726
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,393
A normal English salad...

727
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,309
...not fit for human consumption,
even if you remove the slugs...

728
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,229
...and add a dash of the extraordinary,
a bit of mayonnaise.

729
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,159
Look at this.

730
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,834
Sorry I'm late.

731
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,594
Mum's at the doctor.
I didn't want to miss today.

732
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,756
He won't be trouble.

733
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,759
It's all right.

734
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,195
Sit down.
Make room over there for her.

735
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,229
Okay, come on.

736
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,038
Never be afraid to experiment.

737
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,436
And remember that you can eat well...

738
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,312
...even though you're broke.
See?

739
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,910
You ever been broke, Sir?
Real broke, skint?

740
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,235
Many, many times.

741
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,431
I don't understand you a bit, Sir.

742
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,470
I mean...

743
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,631
...you're a toff and you ain't.

744
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,393
<i>What he means is...</i>

745
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,119
Blimey, I can't sort of put it
into words or anything.

746
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,196
Well, Sir...

747
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,995
...you're like us, but you ain't.
I mean, you're not.

748
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,396
It's kind of scary but nice.

749
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,398
You know what I mean, don't you?

750
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,757
I don't know how to answer you,
except to say I teach you my truths.

751
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,918
It is kind of scary,
dealing with the truth.

752
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,190
Scary and dangerous.

753
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,512
Have you ever had a salad
with almonds and grapes...

754
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,156
...and tomatoes and lettuce
and pineapple?

755
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,312
She's in love with you, Mark.

756
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,715
You shouldn't be so surprised.

757
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,560
We have marvelous schools now
in the East End.

758
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,434
It's still difficult
to get quality teachers.

759
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,995
Take us,
the bottom of the pile.

760
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,234
Goodness knows we've had
a scruffy lot here.

761
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,435
Then along comes
Mr. Mark Thackeray...

762
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,917
...big, broad, handsome,
clean, intelligent...

763
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,510
...looking like
he stepped out of a bandbox.

764
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,518
What do you expect?

765
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,199
What do I do?

766
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,869
Nothing. Just be patient.

767
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,594
Thanks.

768
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,079
Pamela's just finding out
she's a grown woman.

769
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,550
You're probably the only real man
she's ever met in her life.

770
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,115
Don't spend too much time
alone with her.

771
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,592
Why didn't you ask Gillian?

772
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,073
I thought you'd be wiser.

773
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,235
Thanks.

774
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,753
Hello, Sir!
We can't have you queuing up.

775
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,033
It's Sir. He teaches
our Moira up at North Quay.

776
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,754
He's only got an hour for his lunch.

777
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,837
- What'll it be?
- Half a dozen oranges.

778
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,951
You'll like them.
They're lovely.

779
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,309
Here you are, Guv.

780
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,520
Penny's wedding cake.
Jeannie's older sister.

781
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,916
She got married,
so here's a bit of cake.

782
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,912
Jeannie Clark.

783
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,913
Yes, Miss Clark.

784
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,431
That was a lovely museum outing.
Will they do it again?

785
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,475
We're trying to arrange one a week.

786
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,113
That'd be lovely, won't it?

787
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,190
The more education, the better.
That's what I always say.

788
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,593
It's a proper bleeder,
what with the bomb and all.

789
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,678
Ain't the bombs.
It's them bleeding Yanks!

790
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,719
Shut your gob!
My Gert's married to a Yank.

791
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,230
And a proper nice gent he is and all.

792
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,397
Keep your opinions to yourself!

793
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,195
<i>God all bloody mighty!
The entente cordiale?</i>

794
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,268
Cast the mote out of your eye
before you cast the bomb out of mine!

795
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,949
He's a proper faggot.
Here, you'll like them.

796
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,076
Thank you.

797
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,396
Who's next?
Come on, girls.

798
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,874
Speak up!

799
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,198
I was wondering if you would also give
the girls some lessons in makeup.

800
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,394
I think quite a few
of them would be...

801
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,349
...very pretty if they knew
how to do it.

802
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,232
Why, certainly.

803
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,356
You are getting involved
with your children, aren't you?

804
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,598
I'm just trying to help.
That's the job, isn't it?

805
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,030
- You want some of this?
- No, thanks.

806
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,232
Is that all you're having?

807
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,078
You on a diet?

808
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,715
I'll tell you, I'm a weak man.

809
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,798
At the moment, a little skint.

810
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,799
When I eat, do I love to eat!

811
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,389
I love wine,
but I just can't have a glass.

812
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,954
I want the whole bottle.

813
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,152
So I avoid wine
and pastrami sandwiches...

814
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,953
...and baked potatoes...

815
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,437
...with butter and bacon...

816
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,639
...and strawberry shortcake
and cheesecake.

817
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,350
But I like to eat light for lunch.

818
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,355
How's the Dare girl?

819
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,753
No problems.

820
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,433
- Are you gonna stay on here?
- Until I get sorted out.

821
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,593
No luck with the jobs?

822
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,552
But I'm plugging away.

823
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,751
Remember a few weeks ago,
you thought you'd lost the battle?

824
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,354
I thought you had too.

825
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,279
There's a good angel
looking after me, somewhere.

826
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,590
Come on.
Sort yourselves out.

827
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,634
Come on, hurry up!

828
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,592
All right? Go!

829
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,230
Come on, Denham, hurry it up.

830
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,157
Land on your toes.
Do it again. Next!

831
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,390
Next!

832
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,879
Buckley!

833
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,070
Come on, boy.

834
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,554
I'm not a boy.
I'm a man.

835
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,592
I don't want to do it.
It's too high.

836
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,552
You're a fat boy.
Come on.

837
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,512
I'm waiting.
Get that jelly off!

838
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,870
Fats can't do it.
It's too high for him.

839
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,559
Of course, he can't do it!

840
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,872
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask, boy.

841
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,116
- I'm not a boy.
- Shut up!

842
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,237
Buckley, do as you're told!

843
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,634
Come on!

844
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,835
- Move out of the way, boy.
- Shut up!

845
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,110
Is he all right?

846
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,276
I don't know.

847
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,915
You bloody bastard!

848
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,394
Put that down!

849
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,558
You knew Fats couldn't do that.
You had it in for him.

850
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,314
Potter, put that down!

851
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,999
They're fighting in the gym!

852
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,759
Come on, Potts!

853
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,199
That was no accident!

854
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,839
I'll take that.

855
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,874
Go and help Buckley.

856
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,275
Go on!

857
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,473
Potts should have done the bastard
like he did Fats.

858
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,356
You all right, boy?

859
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,835
Yes, thank you.
Me stomach didn't half hurt.

860
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,032
Jackson, Ingram?
Help him up to Mrs. Evans.

861
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,394
All right.

862
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,553
What happened?

863
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,913
Buckley's all right.

864
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,115
More frightened than anything else.

865
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,636
Why'd you make him do that jump?

866
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,074
He just stood there
and refused to obey.

867
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,796
When he jumped, he sent the buck flying
and I couldn't catch him.

868
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,112
Thanks for helping me out.
That Potter went berserk.

869
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,037
I understand that Buckley is
a pet whipping boy of yours.

870
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,389
Is that right?

871
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,073
I'd better report it.
There'll be the devil to pay.

872
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,310
Potter, I can't think of anything
that excuses your behaviour.

873
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,118
But it was him!
He made Fats do it.

874
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,870
Fats said he couldn't do it.
The bully always had it in for him.

875
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,589
I am not concerned with
Mr. Bell's behaviour, but yours.

876
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,189
What if a gun or knife
had been handy?

877
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,637
Potter was narked.
We was all narked.

878
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,876
That bleeder was wrong
and you know it.

879
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,594
You're missing the point.
You all are.

880
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,950
Soon you will be out in the world.

881
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,549
Will you use a weapon every time
someone angers you?

882
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,520
You're supposed to
be learning self-discipline.

883
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,155
You owe Mr. Bell an apology.

884
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,277
Why?
Just because Bell is a teacher?

885
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,471
You better answer that, Potter.

886
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,910
Do you think you behaved
like an adult?

887
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,557
How about Bell
apologizing to Buckley?

888
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,912
My business is with you,
not Mr. Bell.

889
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,192
It's easy for you to talk.
No one pushes you around.

890
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,633
Are you a man or a hoodlum?

891
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,393
Do it, Potts!

892
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,195
Or Bell will call the law
if you don't.

893
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,833
You've got to have recommends
for a job in a couple weeks.

894
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,269
He's got to sign one.

895
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,988
This has nothing
to do with what I sign.

896
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,232
You can't trust a teacher.

897
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,080
We're only safe together.
Against them.

898
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,316
But Sir is different.
If he says Potts...

899
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,068
That he is, and he's wrong now.

900
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,958
You all know Bell's been after
old Fats for years.

901
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,993
Go on, Potts.

902
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,314
If you apologize
because you're afraid...

903
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,512
...then you're a child, not a man.

904
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,159
When I leave,
I'll have me own barrow.

905
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,592
So you can't touch me,
letters or no letters.

906
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,993
I'm sorry I'm late, Sir.

907
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,959
But it's me mum.

908
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,478
She's dead.

909
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,435
I've been helping me dad
with her things.

910
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,669
- I didn't know where to go, Sir.
- That's all right.

911
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,194
Ingram, take over the class.

912
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,073
I understand that
the passing-out class holds...

913
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,511
...some kind of a celebration
at the end of term.

914
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,119
What happens?

915
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,074
We dance...

916
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,634
...Sir.

917
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,071
Did you apologize because of Denham?

918
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,830
One should fight
for what one believes...

919
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,394
...provided one is absolutely sure...

920
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,114
...one is absolutely right.

921
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,954
Pass these out.

922
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,671
You have to fill those out...

923
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,518
...for national health insurance
and so on.

924
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,557
What are you doing, Jackson?

925
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,550
It's for Seales.
For flowers and a wreath.

926
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,197
That's wonderful of you.

927
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,234
May I be permitted
to contribute something?

928
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,511
No, thank you, Mr. Thackeray.

929
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,790
Here, Pam, you buy the wreath.

930
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,509
The name's Dare.

931
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,789
Miss Dare.

932
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,593
Well, you buy the wreath.

933
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,355
Send it around when the time's right.

934
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,354
Send it?
Aren't you going to take it?

935
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,670
You don't think
girls could take it, do you?

936
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,031
Well, why not?

937
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,035
It's what people would say, Sir.

938
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,597
What the family would say...

939
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,750
...if they saw us going
into a coloured person's home.

940
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,511
We've got nothing against you, Sir.

941
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,915
Honest.

942
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,557
<i>But if one of us was to...</i>

943
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,035
You can't imagine the things be said.

944
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,355
Thank you, Miss Pegg,
for making it clear.

945
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,677
Does that apply to the men also?

946
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,596
You're dead right it does.

947
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,509
I'll take the flowers.

948
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,273
Why should you do that?

949
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,676
Wouldn't that make you
subject to gossip?

950
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,359
Gossip don't worry me.
I've known Seales since kindergarten.

951
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,911
I'll take the flowers.

952
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,915
I wouldn't if I were you.

953
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,472
I've been looking for you.

954
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,228
There's a lady to see you.
Mrs. Dare.

955
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,998
And by the way, I've canceled
all outings for your class.

956
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,275
Why?

957
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,272
The adult approach hasn't worked.

958
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,077
It'd have been better
to let things be.

959
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,716
You'd better take your boys in for P.T.
Until I get a replacement.

960
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,390
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir.
It's about Pam.

961
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,635
I'm Mrs. Dare.

962
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,878
What can I do for you?
Would you have a seat?

963
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,550
Would you talk to her, Sir?
I'm sure she'd listen to you.

964
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,956
- She's always talking about you.
- What's the problem?

965
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,874
She always stays out
late at night, Sir.

966
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,549
Often she doesn't get home
till past 11.

967
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,236
She never says where she's been.

968
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,080
She's a big girl.
I'm worried about her.

969
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,995
She won't listen to me.

970
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,518
I'm just a teacher, Mrs. Dare.

971
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,233
I know she'd listen to you.

972
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,751
It's always "Sir said this"
or "Sir said that. "

973
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,157
See, she won't listen to me.
She just won't.

974
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,432
Why doesn't her father
talk with her?

975
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,592
We're divorced.

976
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,519
He's up north somewhere.
He doesn't...

977
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,634
It's not wrong to...

978
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,436
When your marriage breaks up,
life doesn't end, does it?

979
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,551
Please talk to her, Sir.
I'm frightened for her.

980
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,196
You never know what sort
of trouble she can get into.

981
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,869
Please?

982
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,917
All right, I will.

983
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,994
Thank you.

984
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,949
Morning, Sir.

985
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,516
Hello, luv.

986
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,314
- Morning.
- How are you? How's the kids?

987
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,476
Hello, Guv!

988
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,430
Hello, Sir.
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

989
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,950
Your kid ain't top of the class.

990
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,034
My, you look as if
you've won the pools.

991
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,350
Better!

992
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,438
I got me a job.
A real one for when school ends.

993
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,234
Assistant engineer
in a factory in the Midlands.

994
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,795
They even sent me the fare!

995
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,229
That's marvelous.

996
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,193
It's not that good,
but it's a start after so long.

997
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,357
Do you think
she'll take the flowers?

998
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,988
I don't know.

999
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,752
Go in. Sir wants you.

1000
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,428
Sit down.
I'd like to talk to you.

1001
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,717
Has my mum been in?

1002
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,472
The funeral's Saturday, 10:30.

1003
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,353
About my mum, Sir?

1004
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,359
She's very worried about you,
Miss Dare.

1005
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,037
Couldn't you call me Pamela?

1006
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,430
I think not, for the moment.

1007
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,792
She says that
you've been staying out late.

1008
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,039
I've just been to Gran's.
Just around the corner, not far.

1009
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,831
Why haven't you told your mother?

1010
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,633
She doesn't care about me.

1011
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,876
You know that's not true.

1012
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,754
You're not in trouble, are you?

1013
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,715
Nowadays that's only for fools,
isn't it?

1014
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,240
We're the luckiest kids,
the luckiest generation...

1015
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,795
...that's ever been, aren't we?

1016
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:23,039
We're the first to be really free
to enjoy life if we want...

1017
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,548
...without fear.

1018
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,154
What is the trouble?

1019
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,670
If you don't want to talk,
say the word.

1020
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,279
It doesn't bother me.

1021
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,913
It was all right
up till about a year ago.

1022
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,073
Of course, I miss Daddy.
He was wonderful.

1023
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,750
But it's just one of those things.

1024
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,152
Mum works up in a dress shop
on the West End.

1025
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,152
And we got on fine.

1026
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,599
Then men friends started
calling on her.

1027
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,796
You know what neighbours are like.

1028
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,434
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

1029
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,877
She doesn't like me.
I'm in the way.

1030
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,716
She's young and pretty, isn't she?

1031
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,470
I'll be glad to leave school
and be on my own.

1032
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,351
Obviously your mother loves you.

1033
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,790
And you owe her much more
than any teacher.

1034
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,389
I think you're wrong about her.

1035
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,912
Did she tell you that I found her
with one of her friends?

1036
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,316
At home? At my home?

1037
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,110
No, I bet she didn't,
but she was!

1038
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,234
I can't solve your problems for you.
But staying out late won't help.

1039
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,795
It helps me.
I can't stand the sight of her!

1040
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,355
And if you were me,
you'd feel the same.

1041
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,837
I'm in no position to judge.
I know people make mistakes.

1042
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,394
You're saying it's my fault?

1043
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,672
Forgiveness is the gift of God.
People make mistakes.

1044
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,598
It's up to you to make peace.

1045
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,312
- Why should I? I haven't done anything.
- Grow up.

1046
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,471
Give her another chance.

1047
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,075
Why are you taking her side?

1048
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,871
You're wrong not to give her a chance.
Everybody deserves that.

1049
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,194
I thought you'd understand.
I thought I could trust you.

1050
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,189
But you're just as Denham said.
I'm not taking the bloody flowers!

1051
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,228
All right.

1052
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,476
Let's line up here
in the centre.

1053
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,831
Could we box first today, please?

1054
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:16,910
Why?

1055
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,639
It would make a change.

1056
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,869
Just sort yourselves in pairs now.

1057
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,230
Do you mind having a go with me?
Sapiano's hurt his wrist.

1058
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,033
That's right. I sprained it.

1059
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,996
I think you ought to wait and have a go
at Potter or one of the others.

1060
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,952
He'll be done in, Sir.

1061
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,440
I don't mind having
a punch out with you.

1062
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,033
I think you'd better
forget that for today.

1063
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,073
Let's go!

1064
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,076
Let's go.

1065
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,833
Stay where you are!

1066
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,033
Put your head down.

1067
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,475
Collect the gloves and put them back.

1068
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,354
The rest of you,
line up for vaulting.

1069
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,673
Put your head down.

1070
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,588
You all right?

1071
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,708
- Come over here for a minute.
- I'm all right.

1072
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,711
I think I'll go wash up.

1073
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,908
You all right, mate?

1074
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,235
Are you sure?

1075
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,317
Can I ask you something?

1076
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,160
- How many times did you hit me?
- Once.

1077
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,075
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1078
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,588
I lost my temper.

1079
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,399
I was meaning to hurt you.

1080
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,194
You did.
You're pretty good.

1081
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,118
Why didn't you hit me again?

1082
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,711
Why didn't you fight?
You had me easy.

1083
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,036
I've been after you
since you got here.

1084
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,197
Are you afraid or something?

1085
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,114
Hitting you wouldn't solve much,
would it?

1086
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,233
It's the truth.
I don't understand you at all.

1087
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,429
What's a barrow?

1088
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,952
A barrow? With fruit on it.
A barrow!

1089
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,958
You was wrong about Potts.

1090
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,073
Yes, from his point of view,
at his age, I was.

1091
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,158
- The girls was right about the gossip.
- From their point of view.

1092
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,998
What other point is there?

1093
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,714
You have to figure that out
for yourself.

1094
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,432
Would you like a job teaching
the youngsters how to box?

1095
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,199
I'll speak with Mr. Florian.
There will be some money for you.

1096
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,672
Me? A bleeding teacher?

1097
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,157
It's important the youngsters
know how to defend themselves.

1098
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,514
Why are you doing this?

1099
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,633
Good luck with your barrow.

1100
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,391
What's the matter?
You going to a bleeding wedding?

1101
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,835
You don't half pong, Potts!

1102
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,314
- What's up with you, Fats?
- Nothing, Bert.

1103
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,149
Another week and
we'll be through here.

1104
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,712
I ain't got a job yet.

1105
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,796
You had the bleeder yesterday.
Lucky punch.

1106
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,760
You got eyes in the back of your head.

1107
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,793
He could have done me
with one hand behind his back.

1108
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,834
And none of your bleeding here.
There's ladies present.

1109
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,992
What Sir said about the truth,
it's kind of scary, isn't it?

1110
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,713
Good morning.

1111
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,313
About the party,
we've got a group and all.

1112
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,160
And the girls is fixing the grub.
You coming?

1113
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,636
You inviting me?

1114
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,472
Yeah, you're invited.

1115
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,553
Thank you.

1116
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,152
If I can, I certainly will.

1117
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,476
What you said is right,
about a man making up his own mind.

1118
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,432
My goodness!

1119
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,111
You certainly look lovely.

1120
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,549
Thank you.

1121
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,674
Would you dance with me tonight?

1122
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,034
Of course.

1123
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,278
But nothing too fast.
I am getting too old for that.

1124
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,712
We'll make it special.
Promise?

1125
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,189
Promise.

1126
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,789
Thank you.

1127
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,038
Would you call me Pamela tonight?

1128
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,350
Pamela.

1129
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,674
Thank you.

1130
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,188
Excuse me a minute, Bert.
It's Pam.

1131
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,918
- You look marvelous!
- You look great!

1132
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,156
- Where's the other earring?
- It's the thing.

1133
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,908
- I wanna talk to the group. Come.
- Why?

1134
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,599
Come on, I'll tell you.

1135
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,114
Good evening.

1136
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,833
I hear you're leaving.

1137
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,874
It's a pity.

1138
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,111
I'm sorry about that.
You're damn good.

1139
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,072
You've done wonders for this show.

1140
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,556
Thank you very much.

1141
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,276
<i>Anybody can be an engineer,
but teaching this mob is...</i>

1142
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,596
I wish I had your gift.

1143
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,636
Why so serious, Mark?

1144
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,070
Good God, it's Weston!

1145
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,878
Wrap up, Clinty.

1146
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,468
Well, I'm damned!

1147
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,908
He wasn't giving you
a hard time, was he?

1148
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,679
On the contrary.

1149
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,553
Will you wave your magic wand
and make me sweet 16 again?

1150
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,675
Nothing to do with me.

1151
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,879
A fine lad.
Your hand's in this, all right.

1152
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,960
If you must leave,
go to another school.

1153
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:16,029
You can't waste your talent
on electronics.

1154
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,639
Damn!
I swore I wouldn't interfere.

1155
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,118
Would you like some more?

1156
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,997
- Who made it?
- I did.

1157
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:50,035
It's salad North Quay,
one of Sir's special recipes.

1158
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,629
It's bloody marvelous, Barbara.

1159
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,798
I mean, Miss Pegg.

1160
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,640
Thank you, Mr. Weston,
I'm sure.

1161
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,715
Actually, I don't like it.
I think it's terrible, don't you?

1162
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,353
Blimey, I'm hot!

1163
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,510
Thank you.

1164
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,519
Excuse me, Sir.
I got the job I wanted.

1165
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,710
That's wonderful.

1166
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,150
- What is it?
- Pageboy at the Hilton.

1167
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,035
He can't wait to get
all that Yankee money.

1168
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,719
You're right there.

1169
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,991
I don't want to be
a pageboy all me life.

1170
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,350
Will you help me get
into night school?

1171
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,789
I'd be glad to.

1172
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,354
Ta, Sir.

1173
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,676
You ain't half a dolly, Miss.

1174
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,189
Ready, Pam.

1175
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,434
Attention, everybody!

1176
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,796
By special request,
it's a lady's choice.

1177
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,116
Hold that, please.

1178
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,079
Come on.
Everybody, come here.

1179
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,194
Thank you.

1180
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,792
Can I come and see you
sometimes, next term?

1181
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,195
I won't be here.

1182
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,393
Everybody's got to move on.

1183
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,958
I'm glad I met you, though.
You've helped me a lot.

1184
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,798
We were lucky to have you.

1185
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,516
The whole world's waiting for you.
You're a smasher!

1186
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,550
Thanks.

1187
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,110
Bye.

1188
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,914
Hold it! Listen, everybody.
I've got an announcement.

1189
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,110
It's about Sir.

1190
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,798
We'd like to thank you
for everything you've done.

1191
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,638
We'd like to give you
a present to remember us by.

1192
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,672
- Come on, Babs.
- You mean, Miss Pegg.

1193
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,350
<i>The time has come</i>

1194
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,436
<i>For closing books</i>

1195
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,717
<i>And long last looks must end</i>

1196
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,079
<i>And as I leave</i>

1197
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,316
<i>I know that I am leaving</i>

1198
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,636
<i>My best friend</i>

1199
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,672
<i>A friend who taught me
Right from wrong</i>

1200
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,752
<i>And weak from strong</i>

1201
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,156
<i>That's a lot to learn</i>

1202
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,035
<i>What can I give you</i>

1203
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,269
<i>In return</i>

1204
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,032
<i>If you wanted the moon</i>

1205
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,840
<i>I would try to make a start</i>

1206
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,874
<i>But I would rather you let me</i>

1207
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,436
<i>Give my heart</i>

1208
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,070
<i>To Sir, with love</i>

1209
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,150
Speech! Speech!

1210
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,675
I think I'd better go
and put it away.

1211
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,596
Evening, Guv.

1212
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,548
Nice, isn't it?

1213
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,479
I'm in your bleeding class
next term.

1214
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:44,835
