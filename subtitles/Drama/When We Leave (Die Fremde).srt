1
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,168
Well?

2
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,588
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,347
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,079
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:23,583
- Yes. Thank you.
- Are you sure this is legal?

6
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,170
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,756
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,925
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,770
We're ready.

10
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,783
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

11
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,459
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I didn't touch it.

12
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,462
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

13
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,617
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

14
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,620
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

15
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,456
but they definitely cracked our door.

16
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,834
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

17
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,921
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

18
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:39,093
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. This
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

19
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,181
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it happened to us. Do it.

20
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,850
Sir, it's night.
They're all over the country.

21
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,852
Get local law enforcement help.

22
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:53,107
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

23
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,427
- Jim. I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

24
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,596
- Get out.
- What?

25
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,932
- Get out of the car now.
- Don't touch me.

26
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,892
- No means no.
- What are you doin'?

27
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,395
- John, stop it.
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.

28
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,106
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

29
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,901
Dad. Stop it. I mean it.

30
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,029
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

31
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,908
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

32
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,869
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

33
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,248
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

34
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,458
- No.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,295
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

36
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,298
What are you doing here?

37
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,177
- You don't answer your phone, return calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

38
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:08,015
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

39
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,812
How about stuff like this: you spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

40
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,897
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not.

41
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,025
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

42
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,363
You are such an asshole.

43
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:30,037
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

44
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,835
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

45
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,296
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

46
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

47
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,719
Damn right you're going to bed alone.

48
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,806
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

49
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,851
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

50
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,228
if I wanna talk to you -

51
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,857
I'll call you.

52
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,235
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,031
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

54
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,660
Chicks, right?

55
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,374
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

56
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,947
John?

57
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,449
John? It's Sclavino.

58
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,996
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

59
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,542
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

60
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,046
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

61
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,383
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

62
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,802
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

63
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,306
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

64
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,518
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

65
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,479
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

66
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,024
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

67
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,027
Send a jughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

68
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:29,615
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

69
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,201
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

70
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,955
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

71
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,917
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

72
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,003
Great.

73
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:47,216
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

74
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,135
You owe me one, Jack.

75
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,106
What?

76
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,577
Aw, come on.

77
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,586
Goddammit.

78
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,114
- Who is it?
- NYPD. Open the door, please.

79
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,415
- Hi.
- NYPD?

80
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,336
OK. I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

81
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,174
I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

82
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,552
No. He actually does not live here any more.

83
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,264
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

84
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,895
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

85
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,773
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

86
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:16,199
"Detective". Yeah, that looks real.
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

87
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:21,037
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.

88
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:26,375
<i>Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of
the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?</i>

89
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,963
No. Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

90
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,133
Open the door.

91
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,635
Shit.

92
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,477
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

93
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,855
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

94
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,942
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

95
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,445
- Feds?
- Yeah. The feds.

96
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,624
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

97
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,501
Such a pain in the ass.

98
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,962
You play with dolls?

99
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,422
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a GI Joe?

100
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,634
No, it's not. It's a limited edition,

101
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,468
and...

102
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:21,222
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

103
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,226
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

104
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,562
I got some other cool shit you can break.

105
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,482
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

106
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,738
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls.

107
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,577
Are you really trying to escape?

108
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,079
Jesus, don't shoot.

109
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,581
Get down.

110
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,339
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

111
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,149
Go.

112
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,986
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low. Stay down.

113
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,738
Come on.

114
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,416
It's all right. Stay low, all right? Stay down.

115
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,920
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

116
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,592
OK.

117
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,443
That'll wake the neighbours.

118
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,571
Get down. Get inside.

119
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,537
They're back in the room.
They're back in the room.

120
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,335
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now.

121
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,087
- I'm trying to...
- Now.

122
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,295
Get back in there.

123
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,304
Get ready to run.

124
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,925
- What the hell was that?
- What?

125
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,011
- Did you do that?
- No.

126
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,014
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

127
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,686
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

128
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,774
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit.

129
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,278
Come on.

130
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,363
Watch it. Slow it down.

131
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

132
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
Let's go. Come on.

133
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,415
Come on, come on. Stay close.

134
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,554
Stay with me. Stay with me.

135
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,809
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

136
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,564
Get in the car. Go, go.

137
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,448
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

138
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,825
- Can you reload a gun?
- I...

139
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,121
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now.

140
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,212
Grab the gun from the back seat.

141
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,566
You OK?

142
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,869
Get your head down.

143
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,749
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

144
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,178
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

145
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:41,477
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

146
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,937
Go ahead.

147
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,899
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

148
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,484
Stand by.

149
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,989
- This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

150
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,493
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

151
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,183
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

152
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,440
Wait one.

153
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,758
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

154
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,470
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

155
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,931
I did send five of you, is that right?

156
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,687
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

157
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,612
- Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

158
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,074
I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.

159
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,035
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

160
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,289
Yeah, I'm scared.
Weren't you scared, back there?

161
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,584
Yeah. I was scared.

162
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,422
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.

163
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,716
Have you done stuff like that before?

164
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,470
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

165
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,725
Yeah. But not for a long time.

166
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,938
So who were those guys?
Why were they trying to kill you?

167
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,441
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

168
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,486
They were there to kill you.

169
00:19:55,611 --> 00:20:00,741
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

170
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,802
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

171
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,598
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,480
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

173
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,357
On it.

174
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,862
What's with all the guns?

175
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,656
Operational prudence.

176
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,328
Think of them as hardware to your software.

177
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:00,760
Good morning, DC. It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

178
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:05,640
If you've got any big plans, get started
early, cos the traffic is ramping up.

179
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,435
So here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

180
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,273
What? What... What...

181
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,651
What are you doing? What is that?

182
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,736
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

183
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,949
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

184
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,327
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

185
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,330
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

186
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,625
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

187
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,546
OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

188
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,589
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

189
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,512
We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

190
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,643
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

191
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,438
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

192
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,566
Begin stage one.

193
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,626
What? Nothing.

194
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:35,271
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

195
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,400
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

196
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,445
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

197
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,447
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?

198
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,911
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

199
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,330
Hold on. You listen to the news?

200
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,541
You got a problem with the news now?

201
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,628
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

202
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,423
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

203
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,718
Everything you hear, every single day,

204
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:10,973
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: to keep you living in fear.

205
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,975
- Fear?
- Total fear.

206
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,188
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

207
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,024
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

208
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,153
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

209
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,280
I'll drop a bomb on you...

210
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,115
- What?
- Shut up.

211
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,577
That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

212
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,007
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

213
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,719
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

214
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,056
Hey, man. Hey.

215
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,810
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

216
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,854
OK.

217
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,773
Jesus Christ.

218
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,464
All the lights are green.

219
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,258
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

220
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,428
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

221
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,350
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

222
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,727
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

223
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,646
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

224
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,939
What are we doing?

225
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:27,693
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

226
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:41,165
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the el train network.

227
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:48,047
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

228
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:52,385
FAA just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

229
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,470
We're under attack.

230
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,975
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

231
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,238
That's the anthrax alarm.

232
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,076
All right, everyone out. Now. Now.

233
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,832
Taylor, move. Go. Move.

234
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:42,894
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

235
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,979
This is not a drill.

236
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:51,110
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

237
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,964
We need you inside, sir.

238
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:22,725
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

239
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,562
We gotta know what's there.

240
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,066
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to ID the point of origin.

241
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,154
Begin stage two.

242
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,455
What's going on?

243
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,047
They're already starting to panic.

244
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,261
Of course they are.

245
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,847
They think that someone's
taking their money.

246
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,684
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

247
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,812
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

248
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,857
Prep the video package.

249
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:28,541
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

250
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:33,462
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

251
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,925
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

252
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,846
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

253
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:46,100
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

254
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:49,270
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

255
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,563
I'm Bowman.

256
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,322
Video package is ready for upload.

257
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,119
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

258
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,247
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

259
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:12,460
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

260
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,046
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

261
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,423
- Sir?
- No?

262
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:26,015
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

263
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,227
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

264
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,230
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

265
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,650
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

266
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,861
Man, that is all bad.

267
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,115
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

268
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,910
- These your suspects?
- Were.

269
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,579
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

270
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,000
Recognise any of these people?

271
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,837
No.

272
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,755
Not one?

273
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,758
Sir, we got a system error.

274
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,772
- My fellow Americans...
...it is time to...

275
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,984
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

276
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,529
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

277
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,657
...what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

278
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,493
- The answer is...
...nothing whatsoever.

279
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,080
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

280
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,456
...useless.

281
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,127
Read my lips.

282
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:41,549
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

283
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,343
has come to... an end.

284
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:48,556
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

285
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:52,810
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

286
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,897
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

287
00:30:56,564 --> 00:31:00,860
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

288
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,447
We will not tire, we will not falter,

289
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,324
and we will not fail.

290
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,160
I don't know how they're getting in.

291
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,077
Thank you.

292
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,955
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

293
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,544
That was creepy.

294
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,546
I tried to find more Nixon.

295
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,257
Think they bought it?

296
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,384
Absolutely.

297
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:31,224
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

298
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,101
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

299
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,105
It's a fire sale.

300
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,733
- We don't know that yet.
- It's a myth, anyway.

301
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:45,238
It's a myth? Really? Please tell me
she's actually not in charge of anything.

302
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,323
What's a fire sale?

303
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:51,869
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

304
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:56,332
Step one: take out transportation.
Step two: the financial base and telecoms.

305
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:00,294
Step three: get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water, electric, nuclear...

306
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,882
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

307
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,052
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

308
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,596
Listen. What's your name? Farrell?

309
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,851
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

310
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:19,021
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

311
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,399
No, man. I'm just saying...

312
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,110
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

313
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:27,155
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

314
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,075
Nothing. I said I understand.

315
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,622
They didn't send the girl scouts out to get this
kid. They sent professionals, full tactical gear.

316
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:42,378
They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

317
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,714
but somebody wants this kid dead,

318
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,051
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

319
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:52,555
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

320
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,600
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

321
00:32:55,683 --> 00:33:01,022
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

322
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:04,233
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

323
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,236
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

324
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,948
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

325
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:15,536
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

326
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:20,208
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

327
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:25,713
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

328
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:30,426
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

329
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:34,764
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

330
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,456
How long till we get to DHS?

331
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:05,378
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

332
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,381
DC Metro, this is the FBI
requesting you to clear a route...

333
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,470
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

334
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,598
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

335
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,476
- Close that loop, now.
- Isolate the frequency.

336
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:25,064
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

337
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:28,276
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

338
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:36,450
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

339
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,703
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

340
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,998
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

341
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,876
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

342
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,336
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

343
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,797
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

344
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,508
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

345
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,803
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

346
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,350
OK. OK, OK.

347
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:06,731
They were my competition.

348
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,611
Make the next right onto Concord.

349
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,072
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

350
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,533
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

351
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:21,078
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

352
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:30,046
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

353
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:34,217
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

354
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:38,971
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

355
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,474
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

356
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,021
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

357
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:50,066
an accessory to Armageddon.

358
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,652
Take the next left at Lexington.

359
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,906
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

360
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,658
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

361
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:01,869
Clear a route for two FBI vehicles
approaching on Concord.

362
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,246
Copy, dispatch.

363
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:04,831
That's her.

364
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,916
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

365
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,337
- It's them.
- You're saying it's "them" them?

366
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:15,341
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

367
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:20,930
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

368
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,599
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

369
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:28,104
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587 s.

370
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,232
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

371
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,529
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

372
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:40,032
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

373
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,621
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

374
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,426
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

375
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:03,723
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

376
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:07,185
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

377
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,395
Your address in Brooklyn,

378
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:14,108
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

379
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,943
And how's Holly?

380
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:20,281
That's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

381
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:28,414
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

382
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,583
And it gets worse.

383
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:36,005
Your 401k no longer exists.

384
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:40,468
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

385
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:43,679
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

386
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,432
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

387
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:52,146
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

388
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,816
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

389
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,986
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

390
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:04,325
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

391
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,244
You're gonna lose.

392
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:10,206
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

393
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,876
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that?

394
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,254
Hold your position.

395
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,675
He's not responding.

396
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,222
Get down. Get right down.

397
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,854
Just stay down.

398
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:40,361
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down.

399
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,756
Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.

400
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,970
Goddammit. Just stay down!

401
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,769
Get down. Just hang on.

402
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:27,867
Base, we've got a squad car under fire.
We need backup.

403
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,661
This is base. We're sending backup.

404
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,418
Just brace yourself.

405
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:53,768
Hang on.

406
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,119
Hang on.

407
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,506
Yeah!

408
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:31,639
- We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

409
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,859
- They're back.
- I know.

410
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,613
Take the tunnel. Left.

411
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,746
God, what are you... Oh, God!

412
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,716
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

413
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,342
The tunnel!

414
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,314
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

415
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,405
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

416
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:49,258
- Now open the other side.
- What?

417
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,635
Move.

418
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:56,307
Hang onto something.

419
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:36,597
Don't get out of the car. Don't...

420
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,606
Just stay there. Stand still.

421
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,994
Run. Run.

422
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:06,127
Oh, God.

423
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,467
Don't hesitate like that again.

424
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:15,386
Can you help me get my wife...

425
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,930
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

426
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:22,101
- You OK?
- I can't move my arms.

427
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:25,354
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?

428
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:28,149
"It can't be a uniform, John. No."

429
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,737
Get over to the wall, sir.
"Feds called in a favour."

430
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:40,077
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

431
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:44,624
"How hard can that be?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

432
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:48,377
"No, gotta be a senior detective."

433
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:56,761
Think a traffic jam,
throwing a car at me's gonna stop me?

434
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:59,013
Rand, get in there and get it done.

435
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,404
This is not a good idea.

436
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:56,445
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

437
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,781
Are you OK? Oh, my God.

438
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:05,288
- Pretty lucky shot.
- Yeah, lucky. That was...

439
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,623
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

440
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:09,834
I was out of bullets.

441
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:16,799
- How you doin'?
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

442
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:23,723
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

443
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:35,401
Rand, check in.

444
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:40,698
What about Farrell and McClane?

445
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,285
Come back in.

446
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,496
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

447
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:50,041
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

448
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:54,545
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

449
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:03,429
ID, sir.

450
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:06,307
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

451
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,809
Man the gate. You're with me.

452
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:21,447
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

453
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:25,701
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

454
00:46:31,582 --> 00:46:35,419
Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.

455
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:52,061
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

456
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:02,864
OK, we are in.

457
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:38,941
This is insane.

458
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:41,986
This is absurd.

459
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:47,450
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

460
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:50,036
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

461
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:52,121
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No.

462
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:53,498
Come on.

463
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:56,125
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

464
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,864
He's in.

465
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,742
Get outta the way.
Make a hole, please. Come on.

466
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:34,413
Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on.

467
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,583
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

468
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,924
Excuse me. Thanks.

469
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,385
NYPD. NYPD.

470
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,554
Coming through.

471
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:50,847
Sergeant?

472
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,975
Sergeant. I need to speak to you.

473
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:58,938
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

474
00:48:59,063 --> 00:49:01,399
Just give me a minute.

475
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,818
Sergeant.

476
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:09,323
Oh, my God.

477
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:17,790
Let's get outta here.

478
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,347
We're a go.

479
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,516
Launch the downloads.

480
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:47,987
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

481
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:53,493
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

482
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,000
See? There you go.

483
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:05,755
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

484
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:10,218
I need you to please remain calm.

485
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,014
Excuse me.

486
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:20,228
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Holy shit.

487
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:22,563
- Kid? Kid, hey.
- Yeah, yeah.

488
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:25,191
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

489
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,276
Come on. Let's go.

490
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:34,992
And here you go, Agent Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

491
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:59,976
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

492
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,146
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

493
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:22,915
Due to recent activity, law enforcement
agencies are being cautious.

494
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,503
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

495
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:31,549
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

496
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:35,094
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

497
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:37,555
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

498
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,057
- FAA just grounded all flights.
- Good.

499
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:45,688
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

500
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:48,024
- Excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

501
00:51:48,107 --> 00:51:51,819
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

502
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:55,823
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

503
00:51:55,948 --> 00:52:00,661
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

504
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:06,000
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.

505
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:09,295
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

506
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,737
- Wait. No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

507
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:38,533
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

508
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,451
- You sure?
- Yes.

509
00:52:40,535 --> 00:52:43,788
Or smash it. You didn't have to smash it.

510
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:46,624
Excuse me. It's a police emergency.

511
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:49,710
He'll call you right back.

512
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:52,588
Here, right in here. Come here.

513
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,465
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

514
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:59,262
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

515
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:01,597
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

516
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:05,184
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

517
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:08,062
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

518
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,526
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

519
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,695
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

520
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,864
Yeah, I'll hold on.

521
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,120
Another day in paradise.

522
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:29,375
They just swarmed into everything -
the telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

523
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:44,307
They're blanketing every station.

524
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,879
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

525
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:19,091
Been this way for a few minutes now.

526
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,400
Oh, my God.

527
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:46,035
McClane.

528
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:48,037
Look out.

529
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:49,705
Look out.

530
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:52,542
Look out.

531
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:56,295
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

532
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,714
Bowman, it's a fake.

533
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,512
I see it.

534
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,390
Thank God.

535
00:55:08,891 --> 00:55:10,685
Shit.

536
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,603
- McClane?
- Bowman.

537
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,653
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

538
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:41,424
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

539
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:43,676
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

540
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:46,429
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

541
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:50,516
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

542
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:56,397
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

543
00:55:56,522 --> 00:55:59,942
It's not a system. It's a country.

544
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:03,279
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

545
00:56:03,404 --> 00:56:06,908
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

546
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:13,289
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

547
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:17,335
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

548
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:22,215
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

549
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:28,095
OK, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

550
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:33,184
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

551
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:37,146
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

552
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:41,400
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

553
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:43,319
And...

554
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:46,781
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

555
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:52,495
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

556
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:57,124
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

557
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,960
How do you know all this stuff?

558
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:03,381
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

559
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:06,259
OK. National power grid.

560
00:57:06,342 --> 00:57:09,846
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

561
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:12,473
each with a primary hub.

562
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:14,642
Here it is.

563
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:18,604
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

564
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:24,235
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

565
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:26,737
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

566
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:31,784
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

567
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:35,872
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane.

568
00:57:35,997 --> 00:57:38,249
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Shit.

569
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:43,004
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

570
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:46,174
I don't care how, you find me a line.

571
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:49,552
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

572
00:57:49,677 --> 00:57:54,307
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

573
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:57,768
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

574
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,521
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

575
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:02,315
OK, let's open it up.

576
00:58:05,151 --> 00:58:07,820
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

577
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:12,408
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

578
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,079
Don't do that. You're gonna disable it.

579
00:58:18,372 --> 00:58:19,832
Jesus Christ!

580
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,211
That was crazy. Did you see that?

581
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:27,507
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

582
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:32,178
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

583
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,434
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

584
00:58:38,518 --> 00:58:40,394
Sorry.

585
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:47,693
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

586
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:50,655
I mean, I've read about it.

587
00:58:50,738 --> 00:58:53,741
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

588
00:58:53,866 --> 00:58:58,412
Yes. Please, we just hit a tree
and my dad is having a heart attack.

589
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:00,915
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

590
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,793
Hold while we contact emergency services.

591
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:08,965
No, no. He's dying. I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

592
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:14,095
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

593
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,806
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

594
00:59:17,598 --> 00:59:20,768
My name is... Frank,

595
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:25,565
and my dad's name is... is...

596
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:30,194
Dvorak Tsajanski.

597
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:35,324
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

598
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,660
Emergency services are on their way.

599
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:40,496
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

600
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:42,331
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

601
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:45,668
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

602
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:48,045
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

603
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:52,133
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

604
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:56,470
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

605
00:59:56,596 --> 00:59:58,890
So please start the goddamn car.

606
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:05,188
Thank you, Dolores.

607
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:07,690
Pass the PDA. I gotta call the Warlock.

608
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:11,360
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

609
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,924
- Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBI. We suspect a security breach.

610
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,801
You can't land here without authorisa...

611
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,115
That was pretty good back there, kid.

612
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,742
Thanks.

613
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:03,496
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

614
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:06,082
No. I'm just...

615
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:10,920
- Well, what? What's the matter you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

616
01:01:11,003 --> 01:01:13,506
What's that mean? Like what?

617
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:18,344
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

618
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:21,138
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

619
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:23,850
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

620
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:27,145
Just doing my job, that's all.

621
01:01:28,729 --> 01:01:33,609
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

622
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:37,738
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

623
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:42,618
You get divorced.

624
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:45,830
A wife that can't remember your last name.

625
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:48,291
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

626
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:52,753
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

627
01:01:52,837 --> 01:01:56,382
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

628
01:01:56,966 --> 01:02:00,887
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.

629
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:04,098
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

630
01:02:04,182 --> 01:02:07,101
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

631
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:11,314
And that's what makes you that guy.

632
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,200
Thing's flying now.

633
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:25,244
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

634
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:35,588
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

635
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:02,740
Stay here.

636
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:33,729
All right, come on.

637
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,209
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

638
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:07,930
Guess you were right, kid.

639
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:11,309
OK, that's awful.

640
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:14,812
We got company.

641
01:04:23,696 --> 01:04:26,073
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

642
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:30,328
- Come on.
- Central control room. OK...

643
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:35,041
- Fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

644
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,046
You take the right.

645
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:45,927
Shit.

646
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:50,515
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

647
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,810
I am. I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

648
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:57,313
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

649
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,753
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

650
01:05:33,057 --> 01:05:35,726
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

651
01:05:35,852 --> 01:05:38,688
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

652
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:41,190
With the amount of hardware they're running,

653
01:05:41,315 --> 01:05:45,945
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

654
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,739
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

655
01:05:48,865 --> 01:05:52,743
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

656
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,848
Play time's over, sweetheart.

657
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,099
Don't.

658
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:17,685
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

659
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,521
Stand up.

660
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:29,071
Go on. Now.

661
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:31,908
Let's go, kid. You're up.

662
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,659
OK...

663
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:36,871
As fast as you can.

664
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,042
Jesus!

665
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,936
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

666
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:04,440
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

667
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,572
Still awake?

668
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:13,908
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'.
- OK.

669
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:16,536
- How much time do you need?
- Not much.

670
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:32,510
- Are you done?
- I...

671
01:07:32,593 --> 01:07:34,512
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

672
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:37,598
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

673
01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:42,395
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their API and booting the host.

674
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:45,857
- What?
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

675
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,317
Not the easiest thing to do when...

676
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,748
OK...

677
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,877
Undo everything you just did. Now.

678
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,171
OK. OK, OK.

679
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:13,134
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

680
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:15,511
I'm a righty.

681
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,797
One last door to open.

682
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:55,885
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realise what this'll do to the country?

683
01:08:55,968 --> 01:09:00,056
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

684
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:03,684
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

685
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:13,027
You do? I'm glad you know.

686
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:30,837
How you doin'?

687
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,514
Hang on.

688
01:10:54,795 --> 01:10:57,882
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

689
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:05,515
How you doin'?
That's not too tight, is it?

690
01:11:08,518 --> 01:11:10,478
Damn it.

691
01:11:12,438 --> 01:11:14,482
Smile pretty.

692
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,392
McClane!

693
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:53,479
Shit.

694
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,691
McClane, get out of there.

695
01:11:57,859 --> 01:12:00,111
Come on, man. Come on.

696
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:06,242
Come on, man.

697
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:28,055
Did you see that?

698
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:33,978
So you stopped it, right?

699
01:12:34,061 --> 01:12:37,440
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

700
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:40,943
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

701
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:47,241
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

702
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:52,371
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

703
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:58,503
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

704
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:02,298
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

705
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:08,513
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

706
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:13,392
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

707
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:15,937
It's an e-bomb.

708
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,700
All right, wait, wait.

709
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:36,040
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

710
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:41,045
Yeah - little Asian chick, likes to kick people?

711
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:45,007
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

712
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:50,513
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

713
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:54,433
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

714
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:58,062
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

715
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:04,360
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

716
01:14:04,443 --> 01:14:10,575
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

717
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:13,327
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

718
01:14:13,411 --> 01:14:17,206
I will focus all my attention on you.

719
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:21,294
You wanna make things personal, fine.

720
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:46,819
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

721
01:14:47,403 --> 01:14:52,033
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

722
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:53,284
Do it.

723
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:55,244
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

724
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:00,833
Please, no.

725
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,753
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

726
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:08,716
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

727
01:15:08,799 --> 01:15:12,345
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

728
01:15:12,428 --> 01:15:16,474
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

729
01:15:16,557 --> 01:15:20,686
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

730
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,396
You think so?

731
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,691
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

732
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:29,987
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

733
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,490
We got a pretty serious problem.

734
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:34,742
Hold on one minute.
What?

735
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:38,871
I think we need to get out of here right now.

736
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,500
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

737
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:43,709
Christ.

738
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:49,465
All of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

739
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:53,094
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

740
01:15:53,177 --> 01:15:56,597
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

741
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:59,100
McClane? McClane?

742
01:15:59,183 --> 01:16:01,519
Let's go. Finish this up.

743
01:16:07,108 --> 01:16:10,486
Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.

744
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,174
Get in there.

745
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:20,056
You OK?

746
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:27,814
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

747
01:17:27,897 --> 01:17:30,191
Knock that off, come on.

748
01:17:30,274 --> 01:17:35,863
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

749
01:17:35,947 --> 01:17:39,700
Win? When do we start winning?

750
01:17:39,784 --> 01:17:44,121
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

751
01:17:44,205 --> 01:17:46,707
We just got the shit kicked out of us.

752
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:48,876
You think I'm holding out on you?

753
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,964
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you.
I would happily tell you.

754
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,424
Jesus.

755
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:34,672
The Warlock. The Warlock.

756
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:37,800
Great. There goes the cellphone.

757
01:18:37,884 --> 01:18:41,512
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

758
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:43,389
- We should go see him.
- Who?

759
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:46,267
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

760
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:50,146
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- This is me helping you.

761
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:55,610
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

762
01:18:59,947 --> 01:19:03,993
- How do you feel about flying?
- About what? Like, with a pilot?

763
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:14,295
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

764
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:17,173
Here, put these on.

765
01:19:17,256 --> 01:19:19,842
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

766
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:23,930
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

767
01:19:24,013 --> 01:19:26,474
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

768
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:30,019
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

769
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:33,064
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

770
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:40,905
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

771
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:47,036
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

772
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:48,663
Really? I heard...

773
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:53,251
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha. You did? Really?

774
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:57,755
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

775
01:19:57,839 --> 01:20:01,425
- Oh, God.
- Here we go. We're up.

776
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:03,386
Oh, God.

777
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:10,560
That's good. That's pretty good.

778
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:14,939
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

779
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:19,360
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

780
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:22,655
It's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

781
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:35,877
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

782
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,463
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

783
01:20:39,547 --> 01:20:42,049
How the hell are they getting past us?

784
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:47,889
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

785
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:49,682
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

786
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:56,564
What? Are we gonna land down there?

787
01:20:58,357 --> 01:21:00,318
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK.

788
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,323
Fence. Fence. Fence.

789
01:21:07,783 --> 01:21:09,452
- Fence. Fence.
- I see it.

790
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,537
Watch...

791
01:21:23,549 --> 01:21:25,468
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

792
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:29,013
Yeah, yeah. "Taking off's the hardest part."

793
01:21:29,096 --> 01:21:30,056
Let's go.

794
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:38,147
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

795
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:41,526
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

796
01:21:50,326 --> 01:21:52,245
Shit.

797
01:21:52,328 --> 01:21:54,622
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

798
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:56,374
Is Freddy home?

799
01:21:58,334 --> 01:22:01,379
I'm Matt Farrell and this is...

800
01:22:01,462 --> 01:22:03,256
Billy.

801
01:22:03,339 --> 01:22:08,261
We're friends from Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

802
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:11,722
Freddy!

803
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:14,475
- Freddy?
- You got company.

804
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:24,110
Frederick. Didn't you hear me?

805
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:26,237
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

806
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,532
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the...?

807
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,203
Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

808
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:39,250
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.

809
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:42,587
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

810
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:47,341
Dude, what are you doin' here? Cos of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

811
01:22:47,425 --> 01:22:53,806
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

812
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:56,809
And don't touch that, all right?

813
01:22:56,893 --> 01:23:00,730
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

814
01:23:00,813 --> 01:23:04,442
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

815
01:23:04,525 --> 01:23:08,029
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

816
01:23:08,112 --> 01:23:10,323
whether they be zombies or not.

817
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:14,660
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

818
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:16,913
Nice poster.

819
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:23,377
<i>- What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.</i>

820
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:26,797
<i>- Star Wars guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...</i>

821
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:29,300
Dump truck. I'm not his dad.

822
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:33,429
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.

823
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:36,641
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

824
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:39,101
Command centre. It's a basement.

825
01:23:39,185 --> 01:23:41,604
- It's a command centre.
- I can explain.

826
01:23:41,687 --> 01:23:45,566
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

827
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,735
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

828
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:50,154
Get out. I want you outta here, right now.

829
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,491
Calm down. Just calm down, big boy.

830
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:55,993
You calm down. It's my house.

831
01:23:56,077 --> 01:24:00,790
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

832
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:19,600
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

833
01:24:19,684 --> 01:24:21,811
First day on the job, tells his bosses

834
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:25,481
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

835
01:24:25,565 --> 01:24:30,778
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up cos he is committed.

836
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:33,781
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

837
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:38,786
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defence network.

838
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:42,206
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

839
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:46,460
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

840
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:49,297
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

841
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,550
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

842
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:54,844
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

843
01:24:54,927 --> 01:24:58,347
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

844
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:04,061
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

845
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:07,482
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

846
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:11,360
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

847
01:25:11,444 --> 01:25:14,614
The only security system in the country
that I can find

848
01:25:14,697 --> 01:25:19,160
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

849
01:25:19,243 --> 01:25:24,624
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

850
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:27,835
- Whoa. What the hell? God.
- I know, right?

851
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:31,631
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

852
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:35,426
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- Why are there chilling towers?

853
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,886
Hello.

854
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:39,472
What's a chilling tower?

855
01:25:39,555 --> 01:25:41,974
See what I've been dealing with?

856
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:45,645
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

857
01:25:45,728 --> 01:25:47,146
But why there?

858
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:52,068
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

859
01:25:57,573 --> 01:26:02,745
I got a red flag over here.
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

860
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:06,791
Honing in on the host server right now.

861
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,669
"Frederick Kaludis."

862
01:26:09,752 --> 01:26:11,921
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

863
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,302
McClane.

864
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:22,807
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

865
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:24,475
You'll love this.

866
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:31,357
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

867
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:45,371
- Freddy?
- What?

868
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:49,041
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

869
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,214
McClane?

870
01:26:55,298 --> 01:26:57,216
I thought I killed you already.

871
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,302
I get that sometimes.

872
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,975
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

873
01:27:06,058 --> 01:27:11,105
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

874
01:27:12,398 --> 01:27:18,571
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

875
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:22,325
but I'm still alive, ain't I?

876
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:28,748
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right?

877
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:33,419
Gabriel?

878
01:27:35,004 --> 01:27:38,382
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

879
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:43,262
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

880
01:27:43,346 --> 01:27:45,723
And I bet you're still on hold with,

881
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:51,354
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?"

882
01:27:51,437 --> 01:27:57,443
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

883
01:27:57,527 --> 01:28:00,822
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

884
01:28:00,905 --> 01:28:04,575
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

885
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:06,494
Yeah?

886
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,248
Is this one of them?

887
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:17,588
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

888
01:28:17,672 --> 01:28:19,507
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

889
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:23,302
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

890
01:28:23,386 --> 01:28:26,222
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

891
01:28:26,305 --> 01:28:30,476
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

892
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,436
Everything is gonna be all right.

893
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,191
- Lucy, hang up the phone.
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

894
01:28:39,944 --> 01:28:42,947
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

895
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,575
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

896
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:49,996
- Even if I have to come down there myself.
- Thank you.

897
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:53,666
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

898
01:28:53,749 --> 01:28:55,459
Yeah.

899
01:28:56,252 --> 01:28:58,504
My dad.

900
01:28:58,588 --> 01:29:02,300
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

901
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:09,182
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you, very soon.

902
01:29:10,766 --> 01:29:12,768
Thank you.

903
01:29:13,811 --> 01:29:18,649
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

904
01:29:19,108 --> 01:29:21,694
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

905
01:29:21,777 --> 01:29:23,863
Come on, John.

906
01:29:25,072 --> 01:29:27,617
Make a joke.

907
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,745
Say somethin' funny.

908
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:39,128
Where...? Where you goin'?

909
01:29:39,545 --> 01:29:44,133
McClane. Hold on.
Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?

910
01:29:44,217 --> 01:29:48,429
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

911
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:52,600
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

912
01:29:52,683 --> 01:29:56,270
- I think I...
- I'm doing you a favour.

913
01:29:56,354 --> 01:29:58,773
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

914
01:29:58,856 --> 01:30:00,858
I'll take it from here.

915
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,361
Thanks for your help.

916
01:30:10,117 --> 01:30:14,121
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

917
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:18,000
Buckle up.

918
01:30:43,901 --> 01:30:46,195
FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.

919
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:48,281
Mind if I see your ID?

920
01:30:48,364 --> 01:30:50,449
Not at all.

921
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,878
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

922
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:06,007
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

923
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:12,805
Kid, can you get Bowman?

924
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:14,974
Yeah.

925
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:26,611
It's completely dead.

926
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:30,323
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

927
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:38,080
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

928
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,877
About all of it.

929
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,797
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

930
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,590
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

931
01:31:52,678 --> 01:31:55,681
- Let go of me, you bastard.
- This bitch is a handful.

932
01:32:01,687 --> 01:32:04,065
Are you gonna be all right?

933
01:32:06,234 --> 01:32:08,694
Behave or I will hurt you.

934
01:32:08,778 --> 01:32:13,866
Yeah? Let's step outside, just you and me.
We'll see who hurts who.

935
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:18,079
You really are his daughter.

936
01:32:18,162 --> 01:32:19,831
Tie her wrists.

937
01:32:27,004 --> 01:32:29,340
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

938
01:32:29,423 --> 01:32:31,968
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

939
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:34,637
OK.

940
01:32:35,596 --> 01:32:38,349
I'll be back in a second.

941
01:32:43,187 --> 01:32:45,106
No, no, no, please.

942
01:33:30,234 --> 01:33:33,154
We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

943
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,827
Go take a look.

944
01:33:40,369 --> 01:33:42,622
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

945
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:57,970
McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

946
01:33:58,054 --> 01:34:00,097
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

947
01:34:00,181 --> 01:34:04,060
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

948
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:08,272
Come on.

949
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:15,571
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

950
01:34:20,034 --> 01:34:22,119
I think mine's locked.

951
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:29,669
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

952
01:34:40,555 --> 01:34:45,935
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

953
01:34:46,894 --> 01:34:48,896
If I can just hack in,

954
01:34:50,606 --> 01:34:53,442
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

955
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:03,703
Someone set off the alarms.

956
01:35:03,786 --> 01:35:07,915
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

957
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:14,130
What have you got?

958
01:35:15,173 --> 01:35:18,676
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

959
01:35:19,969 --> 01:35:21,888
It's gotta be him.

960
01:35:21,971 --> 01:35:24,182
And what's Woodlawn?

961
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:32,398
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

962
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:37,236
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

963
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:42,325
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

964
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:47,497
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

965
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:51,417
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

966
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:53,920
All in one location?

967
01:35:55,046 --> 01:35:56,714
What could Gabriel do with it?

968
01:35:56,798 --> 01:36:00,760
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

969
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:06,724
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

970
01:36:06,808 --> 01:36:08,392
We couldn't trace it.

971
01:36:08,476 --> 01:36:14,398
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

972
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:19,862
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

973
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:22,031
My pay grade?

974
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:29,956
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

975
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:34,127
He designed it.

976
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:37,463
It was his program.

977
01:36:37,547 --> 01:36:42,844
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

978
01:36:42,927 --> 01:36:44,512
That's brilliant.

979
01:36:44,595 --> 01:36:48,474
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

980
01:36:53,813 --> 01:36:57,567
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

981
01:36:58,109 --> 01:37:00,069
Don't move.

982
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:02,697
You, get away from the bag. Now.

983
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,407
OK, OK.

984
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:06,742
We've been waiting for you.

985
01:37:07,493 --> 01:37:10,872
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

986
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:40,026
McClane!

987
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,862
McClane!

988
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:46,866
Kid?

989
01:37:47,283 --> 01:37:48,409
Matt?

990
01:37:48,493 --> 01:37:49,619
Kid.

991
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:05,218
Emerson.

992
01:38:06,135 --> 01:38:08,554
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

993
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:10,014
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

994
01:38:10,097 --> 01:38:12,809
Find out what's going on.

995
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:22,693
Sir?

996
01:38:22,777 --> 01:38:25,488
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

997
01:38:25,571 --> 01:38:28,366
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

998
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:30,284
Then get us some helicopters.

999
01:38:30,368 --> 01:38:33,329
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1000
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:37,416
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1001
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:41,003
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1002
01:38:41,087 --> 01:38:44,048
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1003
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:46,217
Let's go.

1004
01:38:57,353 --> 01:38:59,438
Where's my daughter?

1005
01:38:59,522 --> 01:39:01,941
Russo, check in.

1006
01:39:04,902 --> 01:39:10,032
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1007
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:13,494
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1008
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:16,706
It's McClane. He's on the third floor.

1009
01:39:20,334 --> 01:39:23,588
Get all that? That's right.

1010
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:27,300
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1011
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:38,311
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1012
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:44,066
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1013
01:40:30,404 --> 01:40:32,281
My algorithm.

1014
01:40:38,329 --> 01:40:40,873
OK, please, God.

1015
01:40:41,332 --> 01:40:43,376
Please, God...

1016
01:41:19,495 --> 01:41:23,040
Jesus, they're going after the money.

1017
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:48,441
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1018
01:41:48,524 --> 01:41:50,735
Yep, that's my plan.

1019
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:54,197
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1020
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,575
- Cos you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1021
01:41:58,284 --> 01:42:01,579
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1022
01:42:08,544 --> 01:42:11,297
Stop there. Hands up.

1023
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,883
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1024
01:42:16,761 --> 01:42:19,013
Move away. Move.

1025
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:30,316
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1026
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:33,986
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1027
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:36,864
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1028
01:42:36,948 --> 01:42:40,451
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1029
01:42:40,535 --> 01:42:44,121
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1030
01:42:44,205 --> 01:42:48,042
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1031
01:42:48,126 --> 01:42:52,797
- I am doing the country a favour.
- By tearing it apart.

1032
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,010
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1033
01:42:58,094 --> 01:43:00,763
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1034
01:43:00,847 --> 01:43:07,103
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1035
01:43:07,186 --> 01:43:10,481
Bullshit. It's always been about the money.

1036
01:43:10,565 --> 01:43:14,777
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1037
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:18,531
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a cheque for you.

1038
01:43:21,617 --> 01:43:26,414
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1039
01:43:26,497 --> 01:43:27,540
Dad?

1040
01:43:30,543 --> 01:43:32,587
Hi, baby.

1041
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:35,047
Now there are only five of them.

1042
01:43:37,508 --> 01:43:40,094
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.

1043
01:43:50,313 --> 01:43:53,941
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1044
01:43:55,443 --> 01:43:57,403
We have a problem.

1045
01:43:58,154 --> 01:44:02,158
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1046
01:44:04,785 --> 01:44:06,871
This is a mess.

1047
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:13,002
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1048
01:44:13,085 --> 01:44:17,340
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1049
01:44:17,423 --> 01:44:20,593
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1050
01:44:20,676 --> 01:44:23,888
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1051
01:44:23,971 --> 01:44:26,474
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1052
01:44:27,099 --> 01:44:28,643
Matt Farrell.

1053
01:44:29,477 --> 01:44:31,813
Lucy McClane.

1054
01:44:31,896 --> 01:44:35,358
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1055
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:37,235
Not today.

1056
01:44:37,318 --> 01:44:41,280
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1057
01:44:41,364 --> 01:44:43,616
That's encouraging.

1058
01:44:45,284 --> 01:44:47,578
Take them with us.

1059
01:44:47,662 --> 01:44:49,789
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1060
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:55,128
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1061
01:44:55,211 --> 01:44:57,296
Keep an eye on it.

1062
01:44:59,173 --> 01:45:02,218
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1063
01:45:17,733 --> 01:45:21,445
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1064
01:45:28,035 --> 01:45:30,746
Christ! Goddamn hamster.

1065
01:45:31,414 --> 01:45:32,832
There you go.

1066
01:45:32,915 --> 01:45:35,376
Stay still, spider-boy.

1067
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,174
That's right.

1068
01:46:10,244 --> 01:46:12,079
Goddammit!

1069
01:46:21,255 --> 01:46:22,423
Oh, no.

1070
01:46:24,884 --> 01:46:29,347
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1071
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:33,851
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, cos you're gonna need 'em.

1072
01:46:33,935 --> 01:46:39,023
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1073
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,727
Sir.

1074
01:47:16,811 --> 01:47:18,688
ETA 15 minutes.

1075
01:47:43,379 --> 01:47:45,882
There we go.

1076
01:48:13,034 --> 01:48:14,785
Fix it.

1077
01:48:14,869 --> 01:48:18,206
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1078
01:48:24,921 --> 01:48:26,589
Oh, shit!

1079
01:48:30,218 --> 01:48:32,637
I'm not gonna do it.

1080
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:40,144
- No, no, no. Shit.
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1081
01:48:40,228 --> 01:48:42,396
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1082
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,524
Robinson is coming too fast.

1083
01:48:48,903 --> 01:48:50,863
It's not Robinson.

1084
01:48:50,947 --> 01:48:52,949
That would be my dad.

1085
01:49:04,293 --> 01:49:06,420
Freddy?

1086
01:49:07,338 --> 01:49:09,132
Freddy?

1087
01:49:10,007 --> 01:49:11,801
It's John McClane.

1088
01:49:11,884 --> 01:49:15,429
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1089
01:49:15,513 --> 01:49:18,266
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1090
01:49:20,935 --> 01:49:23,271
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1091
01:49:23,354 --> 01:49:25,439
Hacker jerk-off.

1092
01:49:29,485 --> 01:49:31,529
Warlock...

1093
01:49:31,612 --> 01:49:36,868
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBI.

1094
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:38,953
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1095
01:49:39,036 --> 01:49:41,622
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1096
01:49:41,706 --> 01:49:44,250
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

1097
01:49:44,333 --> 01:49:48,129
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1098
01:49:48,463 --> 01:49:50,882
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter.

1099
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:58,598
I can do that. Hold on.

1100
01:49:59,807 --> 01:50:01,893
Thank you.

1101
01:50:08,065 --> 01:50:11,444
This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1102
01:50:11,903 --> 01:50:14,906
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1103
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:17,241
Go.

1104
01:50:17,325 --> 01:50:19,785
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1105
01:50:19,869 --> 01:50:23,748
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1106
01:50:23,831 --> 01:50:27,794
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1107
01:50:27,877 --> 01:50:31,088
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1108
01:50:31,714 --> 01:50:36,385
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1109
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:38,679
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1110
01:50:38,763 --> 01:50:42,308
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1111
01:50:42,391 --> 01:50:44,519
Golf... Tango...

1112
01:50:46,062 --> 01:50:50,191
five... niner... two... November.

1113
01:50:50,274 --> 01:50:52,902
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1114
01:50:52,985 --> 01:50:54,529
He's with them.

1115
01:50:55,404 --> 01:50:56,906
Listen to me.

1116
01:50:56,989 --> 01:51:01,452
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1117
01:51:01,536 --> 01:51:06,082
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1118
01:51:06,165 --> 01:51:08,334
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1119
01:51:08,417 --> 01:51:11,838
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1120
01:51:14,173 --> 01:51:16,551
Yeah, you have it.

1121
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:18,427
McClane out.

1122
01:51:25,726 --> 01:51:26,894
There's the F-35.

1123
01:51:29,522 --> 01:51:31,816
Did you get the "go" codes?

1124
01:51:31,899 --> 01:51:34,318
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1125
01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:37,071
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1126
01:51:53,671 --> 01:51:56,174
Isolating his radio.

1127
01:52:01,053 --> 01:52:03,764
Sending him the "go" codes.

1128
01:52:09,937 --> 01:52:11,189
AV-81.

1129
01:52:11,272 --> 01:52:16,611
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1130
01:52:16,694 --> 01:52:20,364
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1131
01:52:21,824 --> 01:52:24,744
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1132
01:52:24,827 --> 01:52:27,580
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1133
01:52:27,663 --> 01:52:30,124
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1134
01:52:38,341 --> 01:52:39,550
What?

1135
01:52:47,433 --> 01:52:50,603
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1136
01:52:53,731 --> 01:52:55,608
You're shooting at the wrong guy.

1137
01:53:03,616 --> 01:53:05,952
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1138
01:53:19,715 --> 01:53:21,551
Jackass!

1139
01:54:08,514 --> 01:54:10,850
Is that it?

1140
01:54:13,811 --> 01:54:16,647
Is that your best shot?

1141
01:54:58,523 --> 01:55:00,066
Come on!

1142
01:55:08,616 --> 01:55:09,909
Damn.

1143
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:28,094
Come on.

1144
01:57:01,562 --> 01:57:03,523
Let's go. Come on.

1145
01:57:03,606 --> 01:57:05,691
That way. It's that way. Go.

1146
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,370
We are leaving in three minutes.

1147
01:57:20,623 --> 01:57:22,959
You have one.

1148
01:57:23,042 --> 01:57:26,546
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1149
01:57:30,383 --> 01:57:32,969
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Matthew?

1150
01:57:33,052 --> 01:57:34,303
Matthew.

1151
01:57:34,387 --> 01:57:37,223
I really need you to pay attention.

1152
01:57:37,306 --> 01:57:41,060
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1153
01:57:41,144 --> 01:57:43,521
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1154
01:57:43,604 --> 01:57:45,481
Nine.

1155
01:57:45,565 --> 01:57:47,150
I can't.

1156
01:57:47,233 --> 01:57:49,235
Eight.

1157
01:57:49,318 --> 01:57:51,112
I can't.

1158
01:57:51,904 --> 01:57:53,322
Oh, God.

1159
01:57:56,242 --> 01:57:57,535
OK.

1160
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,830
OK, OK, OK.

1161
01:58:00,913 --> 01:58:02,498
Six.

1162
01:58:02,582 --> 01:58:06,502
OK, stop. Stop, stop.
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1163
01:58:06,586 --> 01:58:09,213
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1164
01:58:22,727 --> 01:58:25,104
Feds are headed this way.

1165
01:58:25,188 --> 01:58:27,815
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

1166
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:39,310
- Dad.
- Careful.

1167
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:42,502
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1168
01:58:45,006 --> 01:58:46,384
Daddy!

1169
01:58:53,824 --> 01:58:55,160
Hold this.

1170
01:59:18,282 --> 01:59:19,417
No.

1171
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:23,079
Jesus Christ.

1172
01:59:23,662 --> 01:59:25,473
You got her?

1173
01:59:26,048 --> 01:59:27,867
You're sure?

1174
01:59:29,752 --> 01:59:31,379
Nice effort, though.

1175
01:59:32,004 --> 01:59:35,091
- Matthew.
- Oh, shit. All right, OK.

1176
01:59:35,174 --> 01:59:37,009
OK. I'm doin' it. I know.

1177
01:59:44,892 --> 01:59:46,594
McClane.

1178
01:59:46,978 --> 01:59:49,897
Would you do me a favour?

1179
01:59:51,632 --> 01:59:56,595
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1180
01:59:56,695 --> 01:59:59,790
as soon as Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1181
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:02,752
and I would love for you to see that.

1182
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,797
Goddammit. Matthew?

1183
02:00:06,581 --> 02:00:09,083
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1184
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:13,254
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1185
02:00:13,337 --> 02:00:14,465
McClane.

1186
02:00:16,507 --> 02:00:18,968
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

1187
02:00:19,699 --> 02:00:24,924
On your tombstone it should read, "Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1188
02:00:25,766 --> 02:00:29,729
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf..."

1189
02:00:44,651 --> 02:00:46,758
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1190
02:00:46,845 --> 02:00:49,615
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1191
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:53,098
I knew you'd come for me.

1192
02:00:53,285 --> 02:00:57,999
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1193
02:01:06,081 --> 02:01:07,746
Move, move.

1194
02:01:12,696 --> 02:01:14,319
Freeze!

1195
02:01:14,406 --> 02:01:17,184
Hold, hold. He's OK.

1196
02:01:19,386 --> 02:01:21,556
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around.

1197
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:25,104
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1198
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:29,063
Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1199
02:01:29,146 --> 02:01:33,115
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1200
02:01:33,219 --> 02:01:36,397
- You shot yourself.
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1201
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,088
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1202
02:01:52,553 --> 02:01:55,348
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1203
02:01:57,308 --> 02:01:58,664
Is he OK?

1204
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:03,247
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1205
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:09,987
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1206
02:02:12,998 --> 02:02:14,871
All right.

1207
02:02:16,577 --> 02:02:18,492
I'll be right back.

1208
02:02:22,258 --> 02:02:24,886
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1209
02:02:24,969 --> 02:02:28,389
He gave me some...
What's it called? Morphine.

1210
02:02:28,473 --> 02:02:34,145
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1211
02:02:34,428 --> 02:02:38,132
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really?

1212
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:41,736
Not that one.

1213
02:02:41,919 --> 02:02:43,709
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1214
02:02:43,896 --> 02:02:47,650
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1215
02:02:47,733 --> 02:02:52,279
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1216
02:02:54,064 --> 02:02:59,073
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1217
02:03:00,705 --> 02:03:02,707
That would suck.

1218
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:06,323
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1219
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:10,022
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1220
02:03:16,554 --> 02:03:20,275
Thanks for saving my daughter's life.

1221
02:03:21,058 --> 02:03:23,336
What was I gonna do?

1222
02:03:24,805 --> 02:03:26,764
That's what makes you that guy.

1223
02:03:37,825 --> 02:03:40,703
So, did he say anything about me?

1224
02:03:42,621 --> 02:03:44,665
Jesus, Lucy.

1225
02:03:44,749 --> 02:03:46,959
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1226
02:03:48,461 --> 02:03:50,880
I'm in enough pain already.

1227
02:03:50,963 --> 02:03:52,478
Hospital.
