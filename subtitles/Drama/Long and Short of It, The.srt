1
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,996
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT

2
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,189
Saturday the 6th of January, 1917,

3
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,308
five condemned soldiers
were escorted to Bouchavesnes

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,312
at the Front in the Somme.

5
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,114
Watch out for the wire!

6
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,391
The first,
once cheerful and adventurous,

7
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,270
wore the tag number 2124.
He was drafted from the Seine area.

8
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,232
On his feet were boots,
taken from a dead German.

9
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,036
Before becoming 2124,
he was known as Bastoche

10
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,271
and was hooked on a pretty redhead,

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,795
a certain Véronique Passavant.

12
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,791
He was a carpenter.

13
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,111
Taking a break from his woodwork,
they'd go for a beer

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,999
at Little Louis' bar,
in Golden Hand St.

15
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,916
He'd taken his boots from an enemy
who no longer needed them.

16
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,073
Stuffed with straw or newspaper,

17
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,590
they replaced his old clodhoppers.

18
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,550
He was court-martialed
for self-mutilation.

19
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,077
Gunpowder had been found
on his wounded hand.

20
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,351
He faced the death sentence.

21
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,798
Watch out for the wire!

22
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,399
The second soldier
was tag number 4077,

23
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,392
also from near the Seine.

24
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,395
He was a welder
for the State Railways, in Bagneux.

25
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,751
His name was Francis Gaignard,

26
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,833
nicknamed Six-Sous.

27
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,110
He knew the poor build the canons
of their own destruction,

28
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,510
but it's the rich who sell them.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,195
He tried to explain it to the troops,

30
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,317
but he wasn't a good speaker.

31
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,674
And cheap wine,
poverty's best friend,

32
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,036
deadened the soldiers' eyes,

33
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,874
making it difficult
to get through to them.

34
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,470
Number 1818 was surely the bravest
and the toughest of them all.

35
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,394
He had once
killed a fellow officer...

36
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,070
an officer who kicked the dead.

37
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,110
Get up!

38
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,429
You swines!

39
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,268
You lazy cowards!

40
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,591
You! Get up!

41
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,916
Attack! Attack!

42
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,517
You! Get going!

43
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,914
No one ever found out.

44
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,277
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer
from Dordogne.

45
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,955
One August morning,

46
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,436
they came to get him at his farm

47
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,477
and sent him off on a train.

48
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,594
Watch out for the wire!

49
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,554
The telephone wire is the only link
to the land of the living.

50
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,475
A flimsy wire, their only chance
for President Poincaré's pardon.

51
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,950
Even if the only one
to still believe in it

52
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,716
is him.
Number 7328, recruited in Corsica.

53
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,757
Angel Bassignano.

54
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,635
According to all who'd known him,

55
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,235
he was no angel at all.

56
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,155
He was a liar, a cheat, a show-off,

57
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,311
a sneak and a troublemaker.

58
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,069
Before all this,

59
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,351
Tina Lombardi worked as his whore.

60
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,718
He'd received a 5-year sentence for
an affair of either love or honour,

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,871
depending on who he was talking to.

62
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,669
It was, in fact, a conflict
between village pimps.

63
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,716
Summer 1916,
common-law criminals were enlisted

64
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,191
to beef up regiments
melted in the fires at Verdun.

65
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,555
They gave him the choice.

66
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,751
It's been shitting shells
round here!

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,353
No, it's been rather quiet.

68
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,194
Who are those for?

69
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,517
Well, actually...
you'll be attacking tomorrow.

70
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,078
We're getting a head start.

71
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,638
Watch out for the wire!

72
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,279
The fifth was a "Cornflower",
the nickname for the class of '17.

73
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,750
He was five months shy of 20.

74
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,749
These days, everything scared him.

75
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,712
French canons short-firing,

76
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,270
the wind that heralded
the mustard gas attacks,

77
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,511
executions to set an example.

78
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,151
He hadn't been like that before,

79
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,594
quite the opposite,

80
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,674
braving storms as he helped
lighthouse keepers.

81
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,915
And then came one shell too many.

82
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,317
There you go... The winning ticket
back to your fiancée.

83
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,118
The ticket for a court-martial.

84
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,557
Turn a blind eye, Sarge.
He's been through enough.

85
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,949
They could execute him.

86
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,838
- Be human for once.
- Shut up!

87
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,195
Please, Sarge!

88
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,156
Shut up!

89
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,353
The first time
Mathilde and Manech made love,

90
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,560
he fell asleep,
his hand on her breast.

91
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,637
Each time his wound throbs,

92
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,678
Manech feels Mathilde's heart
in his palm.

93
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,229
Each beat brings her closer to him.

94
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,591
If Manech were dead,
Mathilde would know.

95
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,832
Since the death notice,

96
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,039
she stubbornly holds on to her
intuition, like to a flimsy wire.

97
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,756
She never gets discouraged.

98
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,390
And Mathilde
is of a cheerful disposition.

99
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,237
If that wire doesn't lead her
to her lover, never mind...

100
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,790
she can always use it as a noose.

101
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,753
In June 1920, Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

102
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,072
A patient at the Rennes hospital
wants to see her.

103
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,512
He'd met Manech in January '17
at the Front in the Somme.

104
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,153
August 1912.

105
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,513
Handsome, wasn't I?

106
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,235
It's a De Dion,

107
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,559
with direct drive.

108
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,551
Please, tell me about Manech.

109
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,919
In January '17,

110
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,520
I escorted five condemned soldiers.

111
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,918
He was one of them...

112
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,036
Yes.

113
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,469
I was to take them
to a front-line trench.

114
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,149
Gendarmes were waiting
with the prisoners

115
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,590
near a bombed-out cemetery.

116
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,749
What are you doing
with those German boots?

117
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,830
Waiting.

118
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,110
What for?

119
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,511
Poincaré's pardon? You'll wait!

120
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,239
He'll sign it!

121
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,835
I shouldn't
even have been condemned.

122
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm Corsican, not French!

123
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,469
Leave him be.

124
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,950
He's lost it,
but that's for the best.

125
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,672
Finished, Lieutenant?

126
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,991
The cold has saved that one.

127
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,589
Gangrene would've got him
in summer.

128
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,554
And Manech?

129
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,638
Was he in pain?

130
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,710
They had to cut off two fingers,

131
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,678
but he wasn't suffering anymore.

132
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,279
I led them to a trench,

133
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,476
called "Bingo Crépuscule".

134
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,389
Bloody hell!

135
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,911
Couldn't you have lost them
on your way?

136
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,469
A kick in the ass
to get rid of them!

137
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,595
My orders
are to bring you these five.

138
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,273
And I'll tell you my orders!

139
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,473
I'm to throw these guys over the top

140
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,671
and leave them to die like dogs

141
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,797
between our line and the Jerries'!

142
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,349
Those are my damned orders,
Sergeant!

143
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,750
You see, Sergeant, with the Jerries,

144
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,355
It's a little too calm?
Let's start the fireworks

145
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,272
and watch all hell let loose!

146
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,313
Soup, guys!
You're lucky, it's still warm.

147
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,274
Beetroot and fennel.

148
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,996
What can I get for you?

149
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,398
A large hot chocolate
and some bread with honey.

150
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,234
I'd kill my parents to get you that!

151
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,672
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

152
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,559
He's an orphan!

153
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,515
He'll get it. Célestin Poux
is the "Mess Hall Marauder",

154
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,718
the "Kitchen Raider".

155
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,237
Fifteen minutes later,
he came back with it all.

156
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,158
Salted Guérande butter,

157
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,829
lavender honey,

158
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,150
and...

159
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,671
cocoa from Nigeria!

160
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,710
Grand...

161
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,714
Tell me, Cornflower,

162
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,118
you've no one to write to?
A fiancée?

163
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,509
Mathilde.

164
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,033
Her name is Mathilde.

165
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,793
I hear her heart beating,
like Morse code.

166
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,835
We're engaged.

167
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,915
Luckily, we won't have to wait
till the end of the war.

168
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,871
Now I can go straight home
after the execution.

169
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,790
Should I spare you the rest?

170
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,437
I'm lame, not dim.

171
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,599
What happened?

172
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,556
We opened the barbed wire

173
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,113
and equipped the five
against the cold.

174
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,356
Célestin Poux gave up a red woolen
glove to protect your fiancé's hand.

175
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,196
Are they far?

176
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,432
Too far for grenades,
too near for artillery.

177
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,070
Gas is out of the question.
The gasser always gets it!

178
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,389
Think they'll make it?

179
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,030
If they're not blown to bits,
they'll starve and freeze.

180
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,870
Either way, it'll amuse the Jerries.

181
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,631
A Corporal gave Bastoche,
the carpenter, a hug.

182
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,753
It was Corporal Gordes.

183
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,395
They clearly knew each other
before the war.

184
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,030
And then,

185
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,272
over they went.

186
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,992
- Shit...
- Shut up.

187
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,358
- Shit!
- Shut up!

188
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,629
September '14.

189
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,519
150 pound weight, easy!

190
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,555
And I wasn't at my best!

191
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,309
But that morning,

192
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,629
in January '17,
was Manech still alive?

193
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,716
At dawn,
Favart called out their names.

194
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,752
Apart from the Dordogne farmer,
they all replied.

195
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,115
Bassignano!

196
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,236
Sir!

197
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,356
Bouquet!

198
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,874
What now?

199
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,754
Langonnet!

200
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,879
Yeah, still here!

201
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,799
The Cornflower,
hide yourself better.

202
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,668
Notre Dame!

203
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,429
That's all I know.

204
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,311
I wrote up my report
with a heavy heart.

205
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,118
About time, Esperanza! The Brits
are replacing us, we're off.

206
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,191
So, Bingo-thingy?

207
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,750
What's that?

208
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,197
The condemned prisoners' list,
signed by Capt. Favourier.

209
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,714
Give it to me.

210
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,994
Don't just stand there like that.
This isn't Pompeii!

211
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,159
You've been promoted.
You're off to the Vosges.

212
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,799
Even so, Sir,

213
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,839
this expedition is going to be
hard to swallow.

214
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,956
Lucky you.

215
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,953
Where you're going, there's
mustard gas and throat lozenges.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
The famous Vosges sweets.

217
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,676
Dismissed!

218
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,078
A few months later,
I was wounded, in the Somme.

219
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,832
I ended up in the same ambulance
as Chardolot,

220
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,596
a corporal from Bingo Crépuscule.

221
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,990
But he only had
a few days left to live.

222
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,359
It's me. Esperanza.

223
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,439
Bingo Crépuscule, remember?

224
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,717
Sorry, I don't recognize you.

225
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,992
The five thrown over
into no-man's-land,

226
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,114
what happened to them?

227
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,555
What do you think?

228
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,149
No one made it.

229
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,439
Your conscience bothering you,
Esperanza?

230
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,871
You should've stuck around.

231
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,478
You'd have seen capital Ms,

232
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,837
underwear being waved
and a flying albatross.

233
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,390
You're delirious with fever!

234
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,870
We sent over five men
and recovered five stiffs.

235
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,235
Conclusion...

236
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,799
My eyes are gone but I can imagine
your expression and I like it.

237
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,677
He really spoke of capital Ms
and an albatross?

238
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,754
And underwear.

239
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,839
Here you go, Miss.

240
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,751
In here

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,118
are the prisoners' belongings
I was to return to their families.

242
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,191
My health's prevented it.

243
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,512
That's the letter
the Dordogne farmer, Notre Dame,

244
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,397
wrote to his wife.

245
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,400
I sent the original
just after Bingo.

246
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,710
You're here
because of the mustard gas?

247
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,115
Not even. Damned Spanish flu!

248
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,795
Death moves in mysterious ways.

249
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,630
If you can't cry, try talking.

250
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,232
If you can't talk, say nothing.

251
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,595
But sometimes,
talking can bring on the tears.

252
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,831
Tears say what you can't say,

253
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,672
if you get my drift?

254
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,400
Otherwise,
you can just keep that sour-face!

255
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,355
Little Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

256
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,477
Shame she won't talk to me.

257
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,790
Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

258
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,758
Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.

259
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,473
"Benoît Notre Dame, number 1818.
I won't be writing for a long time."

260
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,518
Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

261
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,912
His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.

262
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,396
Tell my Baptistin that I so love

263
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,473
that he'll be fine
if he listens to his dear mother.

264
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,116
She's the kindest person I know.
Love you. Benoît.

265
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,710
"For Tina Lombardi,
from Angel Bassignano."

266
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,713
If Chickpea comes in before
dinner's called, Manech is alive.

267
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,476
I'm not hungry.

268
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,759
Dinner's ready.

269
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,999
Mathilde, dinner!

270
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,629
Coming!

271
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,674
Mathilde was born
the 1 st of January, 1900.

272
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,235
It's easy for calculating her age.

273
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,439
In 1903, her parents died
in the n 44 bus accident.

274
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,317
Since then,

275
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,232
Mathilde often says to herself,

276
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,119
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."

277
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,554
Her uncle and aunt,

278
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,872
Sylvain and Bénédicte,
have raised her,

279
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,035
with her parents' life insurance
invested by Pierre-Marie Rouvière.

280
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,310
When she was five,
Mathilde came down with polio.

281
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,516
She was bedridden for months,

282
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,955
despite mustard compresses...

283
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,829
pendulums

284
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,792
and four-leaf clover infusions.

285
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,192
Today, Mathilde is twenty.

286
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,793
She plays the tuba.

287
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,749
It is the only instrument capable
of imitating a distress call.

288
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,517
Chickpea, the dog,
farts in his sleep.

289
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,152
When she hears it,
Bénédicte never fails to say,

290
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,072
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart.

291
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,709
Mathilde needs daily treatment.

292
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,714
Since the Armistice, Georges Cornu,
a swimming champion,

293
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,029
massages her.

294
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,393
She used to get embarrassed,
but she got over it.

295
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,030
Mathilde sometimes imagines
that Georges admires her,

296
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,599
tormented with desire.

297
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,717
What's more, he once said,

298
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,076
You do have a fine figure, Miss.

299
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,709
And I've kneaded quite a few.

300
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,000
After that,
how should she call him?

301
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,229
Dear Georges...

302
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,149
My dear Georges...

303
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,635
Jojo...

304
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,632
Sometimes,
before falling asleep,

305
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,952
she imagines herself
in arousing situations.

306
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,628
Mathilde doesn't need
to fantasize for very long

307
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,916
before reaching fulfilment.

308
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,073
Since his disappearance,

309
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,074
she can't bear to think about her
fiancé as she satisfies herself.

310
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,554
That's the way it is...

311
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,069
If I were you, Mathilde,
I'd forget him.

312
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,398
Why chase pipe dreams?

313
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,837
If he was alive,
you'd have heard from him.

314
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,679
He was taken prisoner.

315
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,393
And stayed with a German girl
with braids and big boobs!

316
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,154
A Breton boy eating sauerkraut!

317
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,071
Lmpossible!

318
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,952
- Can I help?
- Keep your feet on the ground.

319
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,792
I stand on my own two feet!

320
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,234
- What?
- Never mind.

321
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,799
I heard you anyway.

322
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,311
But your dreams don't stand up.

323
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,878
Manech
can't have been taken at Bingo.

324
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,839
Our men took the trench facing it.

325
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,516
Normally, it's the winners

326
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,988
who take prisoners.

327
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,673
So he's lost his mind.

328
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,878
Or he's in hiding,
to avoid hard labour.

329
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,350
Stop dreaming, Mathilde!

330
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,155
Face up to it.

331
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,914
You'll find a husband, despite...

332
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,312
Something's off-key.

333
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,988
I'll find the "Mess Hall Marauder",
Célestin Poux.

334
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,719
What can I get for you?

335
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,475
Or the Corsican's whore.
She might know more than me.

336
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,075
Tomorrow, I go to Paris.

337
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,437
What for?

338
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,830
To find a survivor
from Bingo Crépuscule.

339
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,954
Germain Pire, Private Detective
The Peerless Pry

340
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,073
I'm used to handling
red-hot affairs.

341
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,514
I've a cupboard full.

342
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,718
Scandals that would've been
brushed under the carpet...

343
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,520
brought to light by Pire's prying.

344
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,838
Take this big affair...

345
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,838
very delicate.

346
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,876
In '17, a train derails.
425 soldiers on leave, dead.

347
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,948
The enquiry reveals how
an officer ordered the departure,

348
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,509
despite faulty brakes.

349
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,832
A total cover-up
by Poincaré's government.

350
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,156
The victims' families only hope
of finding the officer?

351
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,269
Germain Pire!

352
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,629
The Peerless Pry.

353
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,792
Peerless, Miss.
I found their officer,

354
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,435
to the military's great displeasure.

355
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,314
Granted, he was dead and buried.

356
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,193
I'll just pack my bags and be on
my way to track down Poux Célestin

357
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,793
and the Corsican's fiancée.

358
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,992
And your fees, Mr. Peerless Pry?

359
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,358
The Pry only bleeds dry
sitting ducks, Miss.

360
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,236
For you, I can do...

361
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,553
20 francs a day.

362
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,872
Plus expenses, of course.

363
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,595
Why so kind?

364
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,910
Hélène, come and say hello.

365
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,632
Don't worry about expenses.
Germain Pire eats little,

366
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,838
doesn't drink and tips sparingly.

367
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,835
Notre Dame de Paris?

368
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,911
Not Notre Dame de Paris!

369
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,754
I'm calling from Paris
about Notre Dame Benoît!

370
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,554
Benoît Notre Dame!

371
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,313
A strapping,
good-hearted farmer.

372
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,269
Died for his country.

373
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,591
I've lost many a parishioner.

374
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,635
Are his wife and Baptistin
still there?

375
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,719
Quiet!
Miss Minet, I can't hear a thing!

376
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,869
No. She upped and left one day,
with no forwarding address.

377
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,108
Is that a choir I hear?

378
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,909
Of course, it's a choir!
We are in a church, Miss!

379
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,151
But that's no hymn at your end!

380
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,271
Thank you, Father. Goodbye.

381
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,799
Bingo Crépuscule!

382
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,237
I can't make head nor tail of it!

383
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,350
I thought you liked defending
lost causes.

384
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,672
Your impertinence
was charming at 10, not at 20!

385
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,239
Then start taking me seriously.

386
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,270
You're wasting your money
on a grotesque crusade!

387
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,594
Bingo Crépuscule!
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

388
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,597
I want access to army archives.

389
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,390
Let's say
there's an ounce of truth in this.

390
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,154
If one man has survived,
he risks hard labour!

391
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,594
And you know it!

392
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,513
Your prying would put him
in great danger!

393
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,073
Be reasonable.

394
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,592
Your parents entrusted me...

395
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,909
"Ashes to ashes..."

396
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,714
That's just it.

397
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,995
They entrusted you
with my happiness.

398
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,235
Goodbye.

399
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,395
Thank you, Pierre-Marie.

400
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,397
Don't be like that,
my dear Mathilde.

401
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,077
I'm thinking of your future.

402
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,793
Sorry to see your health's worsened,
despite the massages.

403
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,598
I'll see what I can do.

404
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,636
It doesn't only happen in Lourdes!

405
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,155
I'm looking for Tina Lombardi.
I knew her when she was little...

406
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,712
Ladies, I'm Tina Lombardi's uncle

407
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,076
and I'd like to know...

408
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,355
Excuse me...

409
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,797
I look after
the Lombardi family's interests

410
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,439
and I'm looking for Tina.

411
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,592
She's come into some money.

412
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,315
You're the one
looking for Tina Lombardi?

413
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,029
Well, actually...

414
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,357
Ever been to Corsica?

415
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,789
Very pretty, very picturesque.

416
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,077
But Tina's walking the street

417
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,230
somewhere else.

418
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,358
Luckily,
a highly-placed member of the Police

419
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,636
picked up her trail in Bar-Le-Duc.

420
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,270
Valentina Emilia Maria Lombardi,
aka Tina,

421
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,795
was registered in 1916

422
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,589
near the 23rd regiment's camp
of Marseilles.

423
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,157
Since the Armistice,
the chick has flown the coop!

424
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,072
I've lost her trail,
but I've been busy.

425
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,075
She's disappeared into thin air.

426
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,234
So, you're giving up.

427
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,390
Not at all.

428
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,439
Pire never admits defeat.
Pire is stubborn.

429
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,796
Pire's peer doesn't exist.

430
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,711
Perfect! Thank you.

431
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,472
Just a little bit.

432
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,919
Not my eyes.

433
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,753
Careful with that!

434
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,589
What can I get you?

435
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,829
This is my fiancé.

436
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,677
And him,

437
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,069
the carpenter...

438
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,719
I think you know him.

439
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,788
My throat's dry.

440
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,197
- "Good glass of wine..."
- "Keeps the doctor in line."

441
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,638
My great-aunt's motto.

442
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,394
Died in 1911 in Besancon,
she was 99.

443
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,279
Never sick a day...

444
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,315
Good luck.

445
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,914
Touch wood.

446
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,755
The war?

447
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,435
A hyena in the Botanical Gardens.

448
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,636
I was showing off, stroking it.

449
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,030
Bastoche and Biscuit made this.

450
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,870
Biscuit?

451
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,595
His best friend. They met in 1910

452
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,718
during the floods,
saving a lady's life.

453
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,839
Bastoche was talented

454
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,514
but Biscuit... a genius.

455
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,876
A magician with a chisel!

456
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,040
He pegged all the articulations.

457
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,155
This is for you.

458
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,835
"Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

459
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,798
"Shame she won't talk to me.

460
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,429
"Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

461
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,830
"Adieu, my friend. Bastoche."

462
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,269
To patch things up means
they'd argued. You know why?

463
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,631
A mystery.

464
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,716
They went through hell together,

465
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,913
the Marne, the Woëvre, the Somme...

466
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,076
Then one day, and who knows why,
they stopped talking.

467
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,639
Biscuit was transferred.

468
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,668
He died
in a military hospital bombing.

469
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,195
I'm glad they finally
patched things up.

470
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,556
They won't be queuing up outside,
today.

471
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,990
Pour me one?

472
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,913
She's thirsty!

473
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,597
A wooden hand, a heart of gold.

474
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,389
To love.

475
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,715
True love!

476
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,313
But who was Véro?

477
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,997
Véronique Passavant.
His regular, his woman.

478
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,673
They often came in together.

479
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,070
Why would they have argued?

480
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,199
He may have strayed
and she wouldn't forgive him.

481
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,316
There you go. '17, this way.

482
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
What exactly are the red files?

483
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,710
Secret defence.

484
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,996
You need a mandate
from someone high up.

485
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,468
Of course, they're upstairs!

486
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,835
Go and help him.

487
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,639
Let's say
you were someone high up...

488
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,440
then you could give us the mandate.

489
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,672
If I thought like that,
I wouldn't be an officer.

490
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,390
Consider yourself lucky
you've been allowed in.

491
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,837
It usually takes months.

492
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,514
It looks tidy
but it's really a mess.

493
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,678
So, the Somme...

494
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,957
The Bouchavesnes sector,
trench 108.

495
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,595
What a state...

496
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,712
Look at this. Appalling!

497
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,516
May I help?

498
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,797
Thank you for replying favourably
to the General...

499
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,911
We're very good friends.

500
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,118
Bouchavesnes...
two friends of mine died there.

501
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,072
Dreadful,
the battles in that trench...

502
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,117
Paris wasn't much better.

503
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,670
Couldn't even find a taxi
after the opera.

504
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,149
So I heard!

505
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,994
We'd like information on trench 108.

506
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,757
Posting slips, trenches 104, 105.

507
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,316
Trench 107. Where's 106?

508
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,310
Trench 108.

509
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,396
How annoying,
it's written on both sides!

510
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,399
Trench 108.

511
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,155
"Dug by the Germans,
taken by us in 1916 and renamed

512
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,470
"Bingo Crépuscule."
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

513
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,432
"January 6th, nothing to report.

514
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,511
"The 7th, heavy combat with losses.

515
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,752
"Killed in action:
Capt. Favourier, history teacher.

516
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,514
"Lt Benoît Estrangin,
insurance agent.

517
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,639
"Corporal..."

518
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,955
Strange.

519
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,395
Certain losses
are filed confidential.

520
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,949
Confidential? You mean...

521
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,709
Sorry.

522
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,715
Can't you...

523
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,951
Sorry, we can't look any further.

524
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,796
Not even the General.

525
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,071
Please.

526
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,154
Thank you for the time you've taken.

527
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,389
You're welcome.

528
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,313
Nothing here of interest.
Posting slips, commissary bills.

529
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,675
The routine.

530
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,478
I assumed as much.

531
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,278
It was to be expected.

532
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,599
You've gone too far!

533
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,833
I do hope this paper
wasn't filed secret defence!

534
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,190
You must tell me if it's important.

535
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,714
It's nothing.

536
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,991
Just a leave.

537
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,754
From the President?

538
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,675
That's right.

539
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,518
President Poincaré
sometimes granted a leave

540
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,159
to a deserving soldier.

541
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,995
End of story!

542
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,839
I'll see you out.

543
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,712
Corporal Bouquet Kléber...

544
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,072
Corporal Gaignard Francis...

545
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,956
Private Notre Dame Benoît...

546
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,475
Private Bassignano Angel...

547
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,035
Private Langonnet Manech...

548
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,557
For self-mutilation,
you are sentenced to death.

549
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,312
Lf, before the count of 7,
the train hasn't entered the tunnel,

550
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,630
or the ticket inspector hasn't come,

551
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,359
Manech is dead!

552
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,714
1, 2, 3,

553
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,993
4, 5, 6...

554
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,229
Ticket, please!

555
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,632
April fool!

556
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,438
When the newspaper strike is over,
we can place your ad.

557
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,719
"Reward for information concerning
Bingo Crépuscule."

558
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,633
Encouraging her
won't bring back her appetite.

559
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,393
Take her to the Quimper Fair.

560
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,959
What for?

561
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,434
A change of scenery.

562
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,031
You might meet a nice boy.

563
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,509
What for?

564
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,230
To get married and have children.
Tell her!

565
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,913
Can you pour me one?

566
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,070
You drink now?

567
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,790
"Glass of wine
keeps the doctor in line."

568
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,595
Where's that from?

569
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,990
Dead-Hand barman
with a wooden hand.

570
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,550
His aunt's motto. Died at a hundred,
in Besancon, 1911.

571
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,950
Repeat that?

572
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,516
In Besancon, in 1911,

573
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,913
a 99 year-old lady left behind
a wooden-handed nephew,

574
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,958
owner of the Dead-Hand bar,
in Golden Hand St,

575
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,634
to whom she often said
what Sylvain just asked me.

576
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,159
She's already drunk!

577
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,870
Look!

578
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,758
An albatross is stubborn.

579
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,150
He knows he can outlast the wind.

580
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,673
Hey, my gravel!

581
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,350
My gravel!

582
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,439
Véronique Passavant,
17th of July, 1920.

583
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,229
I'm writing from Little Louis' bar.
He told me about you.

584
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,755
I must tell you about an encounter

585
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,274
which left me quite shaken up.

586
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,712
I headed for Bastoche's workshop.
I was feeling down.

587
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,032
I want to talk to Bastoche.

588
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,995
Bastoche?

589
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,028
He died. At the Front in the Somme.
Didn't you know?

590
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,759
I know something else.

591
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,069
What?

592
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,116
From the hospital,
where I care for dying syphilitics,

593
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,312
a patient sends you this.

594
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,270
If you don't want to die, covered
with oozing sores, answer me!

595
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,515
The comrade hiding
with your Bastoche...

596
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,955
Tell me...

597
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,918
tell me he's Corsican.

598
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,110
I was already traumatized by nuns
when I was little!

599
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,113
Tina Lombardi
knows something we don't.

600
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,435
What?

601
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,079
The Lombardi girl...

602
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,789
she knows something we don't.

603
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,276
That would prove
Bastoche had escaped.

604
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,837
With another condemned prisoner.

605
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,999
That hussy obviously thinks
it's her Angel.

606
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,995
But if Bastoche had escaped,
he'd have looked out for Manech.

607
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,509
If he escaped...

608
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,636
Give me that.

609
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,959
With "ifs",
a flea could carry an elephant.

610
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,315
Maybe.

611
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,074
But without "ifs",
might as well hang myself.

612
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,552
Thanks to you, I spend my time
picking gravel out of the lawn!

613
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,278
When I see gravel, I make it a point
of arriving in style.

614
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,350
For the Miss.

615
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,553
Leprince Hardware,
Paris, 25th of July, 1920.

616
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,952
Sunday lends itself to writing.
I'm replying regarding

617
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,839
Célestin Poux and other survivors
from Bingo Crépuscule.

618
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,709
I knew the fellow.
The smartest thief I ever met.

619
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,349
Thanks to him,
I never went without!

620
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,710
Olivier Nergeton,
Animated Toys.

621
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,756
Célestin Poux was our salvation,

622
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,355
aka the Mess Hall Marauder
or Justa Bit More.

623
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,749
He falsified losses,

624
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,197
making up numbers
to give double rations.

625
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,274
If you should see him,
tell him we'll never forget him.

626
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,551
Etienne Morillon, teacher,
3rd of August, 1920.

627
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,756
He always had us laughing.

628
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,073
He had even trained
the company's mascot for us!

629
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,678
Good morning. What weather!

630
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,310
Germain Pire, private detective.

631
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,198
Mathilde has spoken of you.

632
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,150
Sylvain!

633
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,512
Tell Mathilde to come down.

634
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,876
That Mr. Pry is here to see her.

635
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,597
Poux's been hopping around.

636
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,754
Two days in Dreux,
then Troyes, Castre,

637
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,194
five days in Sète.

638
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,554
It'll take luck and patience
to land him.

639
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,036
Too bad.

640
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,954
Hélène, some savoury biscuits.

641
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,599
Taste them.

642
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,399
Tell me what you think.

643
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,276
The kitchen's more comfortable.

644
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,908
Thank you, Bénédicte.

645
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,190
I'll leave you.

646
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,350
Poux can't stay in one place,
whereas Tina Lombardi...

647
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,392
she's got us running in circles.

648
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,149
I know.
And she's the queen of disguise.

649
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,033
Anything new on Biscuit?

650
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,918
That's Benjamin Gordes.

651
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,115
The day he won

652
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,836
the Carpentry Prize
for the sixth consecutive year.

653
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,990
That's right.

654
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,476
Biscuit,

655
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,312
Bastoche's best friend,

656
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,278
is none other than Benjamin Gordes.

657
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,677
A soldier from their company

658
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,435
said they were like brothers
before it went sour.

659
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,596
- Why won't you tell me?
- Stop it!

660
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,756
Tell me!

661
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,636
I don't want to fight you,
so stop it!

662
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,757
Why won't you talk?

663
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,679
Whose idea was it?

664
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,553
Mine?
No, it was your idea!

665
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,710
Bastard!

666
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,279
It was his idea!

667
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,831
All because of a woman!

668
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,109
Véronique Passavant
finished with Bastoche in June '16.

669
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,148
And just after, he fought like
a mad dog with Benjamin Gordes.

670
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,356
Don't need to be Pythagoras!

671
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,114
They didn't meet again
before Bingo Crépuscule?

672
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,912
Where it all ended!

673
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,878
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.

674
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,629
Where it all begins...

675
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,793
Tina Lombardi is sure
Bastoche is alive.

676
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,438
What made him different
from the others that evening?

677
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,755
He was the only carpenter?

678
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,639
Something made Bastoche
different from the others.

679
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,194
His German boots!

680
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,316
He was the only one
with German boots!

681
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,278
Of course. You're right!

682
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,829
Tina Lombardi's discovered that
a man with German boots survived!

683
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,309
I bet he was seen with a comrade!

684
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,472
I saw two soldiers
who looked like tramps.

685
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,631
One wore boots taken from a Jerry.

686
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,791
He was holding up the other.

687
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,311
We also know Bastoche had patched
things up with his best friend!

688
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,515
Exactly!

689
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,872
Did it change the course of events
that night?

690
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,711
If I don't break the peel,

691
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,789
Gordes managed to save
Bastoche and Manech.

692
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,677
I'm never going to get that pie
in the oven!

693
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,433
I must go back to Paris.

694
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,039
I must go back to Paris.

695
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,316
Again?
That money's going up in smoke.

696
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,629
"Ashes to ashes..."

697
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,713
Pilot fish!

698
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,073
Excuse me, Elodie Gordes?

699
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,912
Over there, selling carrots.

700
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,835
Thank you.

701
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,029
Never seen him!

702
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,557
Which one don't you know?

703
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,518
Him, by any chance?

704
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,152
Why did Bastoche and Biscuit argue?
Was it over you?

705
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,355
I have nothing to say!

706
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,670
- I want to know!
- Leave me alone!

707
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,793
They last met at Bingo Crépuscule.

708
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,597
My fiancé was also there.
With Bastoche.

709
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,118
In that shithole of a trench!

710
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,999
I want to understand.

711
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,232
I want to understand!

712
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,199
It's not what you think.

713
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,318
I can't talk about it.
Give me your address.

714
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,032
My spelling's terrible

715
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,996
but I'll explain it all in a letter.

716
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,070
I promise.

717
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,230
Go ahead! My gravel!

718
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,354
Nothing for me?

719
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,195
What?

720
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,714
Nothing for me?

721
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,719
Just the newspaper.

722
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,038
They talk about everything
except Elodie Gordes.

723
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,110
Very funny!

724
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,432
You should read it,
one can learn things!

725
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,719
Has the President opened an inquest
on Bingo Crépuscule?

726
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,315
He might have done,

727
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,837
if he hadn't fallen from a train
in his pyjamas.

728
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,236
Well, he wears pyjamas!

729
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,037
He wears pyjamas!

730
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,991
We recovered five stiffs.

731
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,719
Conclusion...

732
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,191
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

733
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,236
All for me?

734
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,152
No. Just this one.

735
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,915
If I'm not picking up gravel,
I'm picking up the postman!

736
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,436
The gravel's gone? A fair fight.

737
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,033
Fighting is never fair.

738
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,589
- Can I offer you a short one?
- Won't say no.

739
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,390
Miss, I beg you to keep my secret
to yourself.

740
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,752
When I met my husband,
he already had four children.

741
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,194
None were his.

742
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,795
Out of kindness,
he'd married a widow with TB.

743
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,553
She was Polish, like me.

744
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,910
He adopted her children
before her death.

745
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,957
I was also an unmarried mother.

746
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,597
He then found himself
the father of five,

747
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,876
though he couldn't have any
of his own.

748
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,072
You're going to run me over!

749
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,670
We had four years of tenderness.

750
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,190
We had plans.

751
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,954
We dreamt
of seeing the sea together.

752
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,753
Then the war came.

753
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,360
I thought Bastoche
would take care of him,

754
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,828
their being posted together.

755
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,998
But during his leave,
in September, 1915,

756
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,958
just after the battle of Artois,

757
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,312
I knew
nothing would ever be the same.

758
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,595
Over there,
it's all we have to keep going.

759
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,353
Once, in a burning field,
I saw some comrades...

760
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,319
Their cartridge belts
exploded like fireworks.

761
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,109
Once, we even had to use
the body of a friend

762
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,991
as a shield.

763
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,949
There had been something
on his mind.

764
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,795
He came out with it
on the second night.

765
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,677
If I desert, the gendarmes
will come and get me.

766
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,793
My only way out
is to have a sixth child.

767
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,910
If you have six children,
they send you home.

768
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,834
As I said,
he couldn't have children.

769
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,436
I didn't dare think
what was on his mind,

770
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,750
but he just wouldn't let it go.

771
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,273
It's not betrayal if I'm asking you.

772
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,158
Especially if it's with Bastoche.

773
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,995
Don't touch!

774
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,955
The five aren't mine,
so why not a sixth?

775
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,715
You'd have nine months to wait.
The war will be over by then.

776
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,518
It will never be over. Never!

777
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,957
They'd be nine months of hope.
Have you no heart?

778
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,958
And then one day, I found a note
from Kléber Bouquet,

779
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,838
known as Bastoche,

780
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,358
saying to tie a coloured cloth at
the window if he wasn't to come up.

781
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,276
Coffee?

782
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,999
I'd love some!

783
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,828
- After you.
- Please.

784
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,315
Thank you.

785
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,796
Sugar?

786
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,553
No, thank you.

787
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,989
It's mother of pearl?

788
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,790
Yes, Benjamin made it.

789
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,798
- It's odd...
- How strange we never met.

790
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,917
The children aren't here?

791
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,309
Yes, but...

792
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,593
they're playing outside.

793
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,230
- A pick-me-up?
- Please.

794
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,831
No, no... Sorry.

795
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,032
I don't fancy one.

796
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,318
Neither do I.

797
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,198
Elodie, we'll say we've done it.

798
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,158
It'll calm him down.

799
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,119
It will make things easier
for you, for me...

800
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,308
for everybody.

801
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,873
Funny how your smile
opens the parentheses.

802
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,631
I'll close them
as late as possible...

803
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,830
In two days, at the train station.

804
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,389
Come on...

805
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,072
give me one last smile.

806
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,231
To close the parentheses.

807
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,198
I didn't even get pregnant!

808
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,832
But soon, fear no longer tormented
my husband.

809
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,393
It was jealousy.

810
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,393
"Where? When? Often?
Which positions?"

811
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,428
"Did you enjoy it?" It became
a living hell for both of us.

812
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,518
Now, Bastoche is dead,
as you know,

813
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,197
and my husband was killed
in a hospital bombing.

814
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,516
It's a relief to confide in you.
At times, I think I'm going mad.

815
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,153
Elodie Gordes.

816
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,557
Matti! Hurry up.

817
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,473
Mr. Rouvière is on the phone.
He's waiting.

818
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,789
Come on!

819
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,475
Mathilde? Pierre-Marie here.

820
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,474
I have some bad news.

821
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,875
Not really bad... News you're
already supposed to know.

822
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,354
But news you can no longer ignore.

823
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,273
You were right about one thing...

824
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,469
Manech and his four comrades
were in that absurdly named trench.

825
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,995
They were buried
in the Herdelin cemetery,

826
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,474
after being temporarily buried
under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater.

827
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,398
That's that, my dear Mathilde.

828
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,513
In June, 1909,
Mathilde is 9 years old.

829
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,191
Manech Langonnet is 10.

830
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,953
Does it hurt when you walk?

831
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,595
It's Friday, or Saturday...

832
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,477
Mathilde can't remember.

833
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,034
Do you have any friends?

834
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,596
I can be your friend.

835
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,158
Do I stink of fish?

836
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,510
Ever been
to the top of the lighthouse?

837
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,879
I can carry you
to the top of the stairs.

838
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,674
Because my dad's the keeper!

839
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,196
Be stuck-up then! Church mouse!
Country bumpkin!

840
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,635
Do you want a kick in the pants?

841
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,197
Can you see far from the top?

842
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,034
I'm going to gobble up your ears!

843
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,750
I'll throw you in the dungeon!

844
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,473
I am the squid's servant!

845
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,478
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart!

846
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,155
Manech's Marrying Mathilde!

847
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,193
Mathilde's Marrying Manech!

848
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,954
- I don't smoke.
- I know, but take it...

849
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,791
It'll help you make new friends.

850
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,076
If I reach the bend before the car,

851
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,117
Manech will come back alive!

852
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,878
If I reach the bend...

853
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,796
If I reach the bend
before the car...

854
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,397
Manech will come back alive...

855
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,359
If I reach the bend...

856
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,078
You used to brag
about being one year older than me.

857
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,516
Now I'm older than you.

858
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,269
The man who gave you his glove
is called Poux.

859
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,388
Célestin Poux.

860
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,193
Funny, isn't it?

861
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,269
The man I hired to find him is Pire.

862
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,593
Germain Pire.

863
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,474
Strange name, too.

864
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,596
Either way, he hasn't found him.
Nor the Corsican's whore.

865
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,317
The wire's snapped, Manech,

866
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,879
but I'm not giving up.

867
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,514
I still believe
that Tina Lombardi's a lead.

868
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,431
I need to be sure.

869
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,188
You understand, right?

870
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,517
That's why
I must find Célestin Poux.

871
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,756
You can be really annoying,
you know.

872
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,235
We would be
so much better in Brittany.

873
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,993
Let's go, Mathilde.

874
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,312
You'll catch cold.

875
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:50,991
Thouvenel!

876
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,799
What do you want?

877
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,719
Who are you?

878
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,512
Was it you who phoned?

879
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,469
Who are you?

880
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,754
The days go by.
Still no news of Célestin Poux.

881
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,951
Mathilde's sadness is overwhelming.

882
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,754
She must eat.
She's making herself ill.

883
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,752
Leave her the marrowbone.

884
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,153
Her sadness is beginning
to rub off on us.

885
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,715
And so,

886
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,232
in the middle of the night
on the 15th of September, 1920,

887
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,118
the wire is re-tied.

888
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,714
"Victory!
I've finally found the roaming Poux.

889
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,916
"Sent by the grace of God
and Davidson motors.

890
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,958
"All expenses paid, of course.
Germain Pire."

891
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,430
Célestin Poux, Terror of the Tarmac!

892
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,348
The ad was yours?

893
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,239
Mathilde tightly clasps her hands,

894
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,949
to keep from shaking and crying

895
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,550
and making a fool of herself.

896
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,436
I didn't actually see
your fiancé get hit.

897
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,874
I went to get the stew

898
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,156
and ran into Lebègue,
a guy I met in the Vosges.

899
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,279
A native of the Meuse.
Or rather a naïve of the Meuse.

900
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,836
Even so, he could tell good coffee
from a stomach remedy.

901
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,595
I know. I tried to sell him
a mixture of coffee and charcoal

902
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,478
in exchange for
some Dutch tobacco.

903
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,392
So, the last time you saw Manech,

904
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,593
he was alive?

905
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,550
You couldn't miss him.

906
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,836
Carving Ms on a burnt tree trunk,

907
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,191
smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

908
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,797
He carved three Ms
before the albatross got him.

909
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,550
Albatross!

910
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,513
"Albatross.

911
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,911
"Great sweeping sea bird,

912
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,879
"indolent traveling companion,

913
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,238
"gliding with ships

914
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,913
"upon bitter deep."

915
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,392
It's a poem by Baudelaire.

916
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,676
It was also a Jerry bomber.

917
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,638
The machine gun was at the rear.

918
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,394
We couldn't shoot yet
through the propeller.

919
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,516
It was you who gave him the glove?

920
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,678
A thick woolen red one.

921
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,430
My fiancée spent her time
knitting scarves and mittens for me.

922
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,474
I traded them
with frostbitten Senegalese

923
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,875
in exchange for Germans' gold teeth.

924
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,516
I melted them down
after the Armistice.

925
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,988
They paid for my Harley.

926
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,710
But...

927
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,756
are you sure Manech's dead?

928
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,474
A comrade told me,
with a wound like that...

929
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,911
he didn't stand a chance.

930
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,119
I only saw three of them get killed
with my own eyes.

931
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,515
I surrender!

932
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,470
I surrender!

933
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,715
Don't shoot!

934
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,118
I beg you! I surrender!

935
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,472
Let me through!

936
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,319
I'm on your side!

937
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,949
I'm not French, I'm Corsican!

938
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,838
I've nothing against you!

939
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,634
Poor bastard.

940
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,599
So, he's not French!

941
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,599
Let's cancel his birth certificate.

942
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,550
A French corporal dealt with him...

943
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,759
Thouvenel. A trigger-happy swine!

944
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,474
He had a heart made of stone,
but a sharp eye.

945
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,949
Poor bastard!

946
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,433
I guess you like it.

947
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,916
I'd kill my parents for a good stew!

948
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,113
Don't worry, he's an orphan.

949
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,952
The same goes for truffles.

950
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,397
If you like truffles,
I have one from Périgord...

951
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,596
Which ones did you see die?

952
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,079
The one with gangrene.

953
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,151
Six-Sous.

954
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,953
Yes, the welder.

955
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,628
Comrades...

956
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,914
Before dying...

957
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,753
I have a final request.

958
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,312
I want to piss standing up.

959
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,073
Like a man!

960
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,869
And then, you can fire away
to your heart's content!

961
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,516
So long to life, so long to love

962
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,389
So long to all those women

963
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,159
It's all over

964
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,155
Done forever

965
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,313
This shameful war

966
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,474
At Craonne, on the plateau

967
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,349
That's where we'll leave our skins

968
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,592
For we've all been sentenced

969
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,909
We are the sacrificed

970
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,516
And Bastoche?

971
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,352
He was so well hidden,

972
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,392
we couldn't locate him.

973
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,876
Even at dawn,
when he answered roll call,

974
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,511
no one knew where he was.
A ventriloquist!

975
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,432
No, he was a carpenter.

976
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,830
No matter.

977
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,875
He was shot down by the Albatross,
along with your fiancé.

978
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,230
The Albatross caught fire
and crashed on the enemy line.

979
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,799
Return to sender.

980
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,195
What about the Dordogne farmer?

981
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,398
He played dead from the beginning.
Not that it saved him.

982
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,317
The Jerries didn't appreciate
the grenade.

983
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,433
Don't look!
Lt'll only make it worse.

984
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,911
When I got back with the stew,
bullets were flying everywhere.

985
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,670
Heavy shelling had begun.

986
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,360
Damn! No one can imagine
what it's like.

987
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,677
Can't move your legs, your heart
beats like a scared animal.

988
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,672
Then I saw the Dordogne farmer
shatter into pieces.

989
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,955
Attack,
before we're all slaughtered.

990
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,711
Prepare bayonets!

991
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,350
All that was nothing
compared to what followed.

992
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,998
For France!

993
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,149
Charge!

994
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,233
We'd passed
the five prisoners bodies

995
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,677
when the Jerry machine guns
started spitting bullets.

996
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,395
We were wiped out!

997
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,157
That Lavrouye bastard!
He kept the paper to himself.

998
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,628
Stretcher-bearers!

999
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,597
What paper?

1000
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,913
That's all he said.

1001
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,755
That evening, there was enough food
to feed an army.

1002
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,198
Favart and Chardolot
were counting losses.

1003
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,399
Why do those five
show up on our battalion list?

1004
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,199
We're only following orders.

1005
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,029
Something stinks here.

1006
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,794
Something stinks?
Lavrouye stinks.

1007
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,715
This food doesn't.
Dig in before it gets cold.

1008
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,068
It's cold!

1009
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,958
So you only saw
three of them get killed.

1010
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,110
With your own eyes.

1011
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,912
False hope
will only make you suffer.

1012
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,195
They're not false!

1013
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,759
You'll taste my cake?

1014
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,274
I don't know if I should.

1015
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,158
With a bit of fresh cream.

1016
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,919
If you insist...

1017
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,951
I like people
who appreciate my food.

1018
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,912
I'll put her to bed.

1019
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,517
Let's all get some sleep.

1020
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,399
Slow down!

1021
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,230
You lack control, no style...

1022
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,119
You're better at raking
than skidding!

1023
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,033
Hey, Postman! I'll drop you off
at the next letterbox.

1024
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:18,996
And my bike?

1025
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,516
Leave it to me. I fought in the war!
I don't have a desk job.

1026
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,870
It's not my fault. I'm asthmatic!

1027
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,792
An asthmatic who rides a bike!

1028
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,996
- By the sea.
- Sure, by the sea!

1029
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,276
Célestin, it's not a sidecar.

1030
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,638
Those men, they never grow up...

1031
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,836
As long as they don't play soldiers.

1032
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,358
"Tell old Bernay... settle up
by March. His manure's too costly..."

1033
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,229
He wouldn't write such trivialities.
Don't you agree?

1034
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,358
There must be a code.

1035
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,874
Except lovers' codes

1036
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,510
can't be cracked with brains
or divine intervention.

1037
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,075
And Bastoche?

1038
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,115
If he was seen with his German
boots, he must have survived.

1039
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,913
Not so, Miss.

1040
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,909
Gordes didn't let him go over
the top with those boots.

1041
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,399
If the Jerries see these,

1042
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,394
they'll know
you've stripped one of their dead.

1043
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,559
So Tina Lombardi's
on the wrong track.

1044
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,759
The one with the boots

1045
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,668
wasn't Bastoche.

1046
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,194
It was Gordes!

1047
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,395
That's right, Miss!

1048
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,032
He was with a boy,

1049
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,838
from the class of '17...
Desrochelles.

1050
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,797
I'd met some stretcher-bearers
who'd just passed them.

1051
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,388
Are you from Bingo?

1052
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,029
Might be.

1053
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,157
Tell them Gordes is wounded.

1054
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,392
- He's with a boy who's worse off.
- Desrochelles.

1055
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,596
- They're off to first-aid.
- With German boots!

1056
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,955
Long Live Anarchy!

1057
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,199
Anarchy.

1058
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,678
What's happened, Matti?

1059
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,349
What did I say?

1060
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,393
Open up!

1061
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,678
Be reasonable.

1062
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,717
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1063
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,991
You've known he's dead
for three years.

1064
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,593
I call that stubbornness.

1065
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,911
No, I call that hope.

1066
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,633
Poux has just killed it.

1067
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,235
If I can do anything...

1068
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,476
You can.

1069
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,796
Take me to Bingo Crépuscule.

1070
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,194
An Indian princess on her elephant.

1071
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,868
With her hunters,
on the Trail of Sorrow.

1072
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,114
It was there!

1073
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,515
Right there!

1074
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,955
At a hundred yards, facing Bingo,

1075
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,279
was Erlangen, the Jerry trench.

1076
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,355
Where's the burnt tree trunk?

1077
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,114
All the stumps and debris

1078
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,991
were used to fill in the trenches.

1079
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:39,039
We found the five over there,
under a tarpaulin,

1080
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,236
covered with earth.

1081
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,716
- Not a pretty sight.
- No doubt!

1082
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,916
The youngest was only a boy.

1083
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,510
Was he wearing a glove?

1084
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,598
A red, woolen glove?

1085
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,957
They all had
one bandaged hand, but...

1086
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,715
nothing on the other.
I can't remember seeing a glove.

1087
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,597
Athos!

1088
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,193
I don't like him digging like that.

1089
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,634
Around here,

1090
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,032
you never know what junk
you might come across,

1091
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,430
that can blow off an arm or a leg.

1092
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,309
It's the crypt!

1093
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,070
There was a chapel
between the two trenches.

1094
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,750
It was in ruins.

1095
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,434
Incredible.
I don't recognize a thing.

1096
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,432
Could Manech have lost the glove
as he fell?

1097
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,959
It was tightly knitted
and tightly fitted.

1098
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,988
I used the other one in the kitchens
until the end of the war.

1099
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,037
Maybe he took it off to carve?

1100
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,955
I couldn't say.

1101
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,879
But I don't think so.

1102
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,874
What sort of red was it? Bright red?

1103
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,115
A flashy red.

1104
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,476
With white dots.
Looked like maggots on an apple!

1105
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,071
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1106
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,835
My husband's family
suffered greatly in the war.

1107
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,036
I didn't want to go over

1108
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,158
to a French soldier's table
in front of him.

1109
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,559
What can you tell me?

1110
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,350
Before dying, my brother Gunther

1111
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,639
saw your fiancé carve
those three letters on a tree.

1112
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,074
He was wearing a red, spotted glove.

1113
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,880
A comrade of Gunther's
told me the story.

1114
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,877
When our plane
shot down your fiancé,

1115
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,197
they were sick to the stomach.

1116
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,954
After that,

1117
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,599
it was a nightmare.

1118
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,629
God spared
that French soldier twice.

1119
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,149
Then... your side attacked.

1120
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,792
They killed my brother.

1121
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,273
He was 23 years old.

1122
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,599
I came to see his cross
at the cemetery.

1123
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:51,875
I'm sorry.

1124
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,672
Time heals all. You'll see.

1125
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,400
I'll get back,
he'll be getting worried.

1126
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,873
Seems I haven't killed it.

1127
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,391
Pardon?

1128
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,189
Hope!

1129
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,395
What now?

1130
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,473
Tina Lombardi.
She's going to the guillotine!

1131
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,517
They call her the "Officer Killer".

1132
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,634
She's killed Lavrouye and Thouvenel.

1133
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,394
And planned to kill Maréchal Pétain.

1134
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,073
When I think you sat in a wheelchair
to soften me up!

1135
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,513
I'll talk only to you,

1136
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,917
because I know we're very similar.

1137
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,711
We'll leave them alone.

1138
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,797
What I did,
you could've done, too.

1139
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,949
I don't think so.

1140
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,948
I'd be too scared.

1141
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,959
I'm not scared.

1142
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,673
And I regret nothing.

1143
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,629
Except my hair.

1144
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,516
I'll be treated to a bowl-cut
before the execution.

1145
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,071
I'll look like Joan of Arc
when I see my Angel!

1146
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,196
Why did you want to kill Pétain?

1147
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,273
Throwing mutilated soldiers
over the top was his idea.

1148
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,312
Why not Poincaré?

1149
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,194
He refused them a pardon.

1150
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,589
You don't know?

1151
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,473
He did pardon them.
All five!

1152
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,389
It's just a leave.

1153
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,678
Lavrouye kept the paper for himself.

1154
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,957
Why did that dog Lavrouye do that?

1155
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,276
Because dirty dogs play dirty.
That's all.

1156
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,192
Trust me on this.

1157
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,839
I took care of him!

1158
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,273
You and I have been running
the same investigation.

1159
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,959
Each in our own way.

1160
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,716
Looking for survivors from Bingo,

1161
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,516
I picked up a male nurse
who'd treated Angel and the others.

1162
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,311
This guy, Phillipot,
was sure he'd seen one of them.

1163
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,230
A big man, with a head wound.

1164
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,313
He was a big man.
Head wound, German boots...

1165
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,599
He wore German boots and
was carrying a thin-built soldier.

1166
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,752
I think that's about right.
I'm even sure of it.

1167
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,271
A big man, head wound...

1168
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,639
His superior told him
to keep his mouth shut.

1169
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,434
You can imagine
how overwhelmed with hope I was.

1170
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,994
And then, I met the man
who shattered my dreams.

1171
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,278
Chief Sergeant Favart.

1172
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:08,158
He told me how that pig Thouvenel
had shot my Angel, just like that!

1173
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,239
Like taking a leak.

1174
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,034
I took care of him, too!

1175
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,553
It was an obsession.

1176
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,309
Kill all those who hurt my man.

1177
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,316
Your Angel left you this.

1178
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,994
"Vengeance is pointless.
Try to be happy,

1179
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,992
"and don't ruin your life for me.

1180
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,912
"Your Angel from Hell."

1181
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,394
Departure for Paris,
Platform 2.

1182
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,871
Gordes, the one who switched boots
with Bastoche...

1183
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,235
was he big?

1184
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,950
Biscuit? He was no athlete.
Just a guy like you or me.

1185
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,231
And you have no news
of Desrochelles?

1186
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,678
He didn't make friends easily.
He lived alone with his mother.

1187
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,072
I must go. I'm boarding in an hour
for Venezuela.

1188
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,433
Good luck, Célestin!

1189
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:29,715
To you too!

1190
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,790
When I think
you hid Poincaré's pardon!

1191
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,397
I didn't want to throw salt
on the wound.

1192
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,153
I'd like one last favour.

1193
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,315
I suppose it concerns Bingo-thingy?

1194
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,148
Son of bookseller,
Desrochelles Paul,

1195
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,799
born in Sarreguemines,

1196
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,474
died in February, 1897...

1197
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,119
That's it, Desrochelles Jean!

1198
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,395
What?

1199
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,029
In Saintes.

1200
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,389
In the Charentes.

1201
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,910
Tell me, Mr. Pire, Tina Lombardi...
You had an inkling

1202
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,559
of what she was up to.

1203
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,956
Luckily, your paths didn't cross.

1204
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,714
He who pries, flies,
when danger lurks.

1205
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,115
He who pries, pries,
but, from a distance.

1206
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,510
I've a new lead for you.

1207
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,036
Jean Desrochelles. Evacuated from
the Front on the 7th of January '17.

1208
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,829
His only next of kin was his mother,
the widow Desrochelles.

1209
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,436
She lives at 22 rue de I'Abbaye.
Saintes, in the Charentes.

1210
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,199
All the work's been done!

1211
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,909
You've tried to reach me?

1212
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,273
My brother's comrade,
the one I told you about...

1213
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,593
He remembered something
that might interest you.

1214
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,795
The two French soldiers
escorting him that morning,

1215
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,873
wanted to go back through
no-man's-land.

1216
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,156
They saw the prisoners' bodies.

1217
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,675
One was in a kind of small cellar.

1218
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:05,559
The French soldiers
seemed surprised.

1219
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,232
I don't know if that can help you.

1220
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:11,836
Thank you.

1221
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,158
"Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

1222
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,915
"His manure's too costly,
watch out for him."

1223
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,550
"His manure's too costly..."

1224
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,995
There must be a code.

1225
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,718
Your Mr. Pry called!

1226
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,276
He's run into a dead-end in Saintes.

1227
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,475
I know!

1228
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,159
Hello! Go ahead.

1229
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,236
Yes, Miss. I remember you.

1230
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,429
Old Bernay? No, never heard of him.

1231
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,551
Benoît Notre Dame
used the manure from his animals.

1232
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,313
He never bought it!

1233
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,279
Thank you, Father.

1234
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,872
I must decode this letter.

1235
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,638
I think we're getting hot.

1236
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,914
Will be - Bernay - March

1237
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,428
Sell - Everything

1238
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:01,749
Say - Nothing

1239
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,070
Listen - No one

1240
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:05,590
Benoît

1241
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,079
Excuse me,
the "End of the World" farm?

1242
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,756
The last house
at the end of the road.

1243
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,233
And if he doesn't come?

1244
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,039
He'll come, don't worry.

1245
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,793
Come back in two hours.

1246
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,109
Hello, Mathilde.

1247
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,794
It's dangerous
to want to bring back the dead.

1248
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,910
When I saw your ad in the paper,

1249
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,914
I knew, in time,
the gendarmes would come.

1250
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,795
Don't worry.

1251
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,596
I had the chance
to do away with you...

1252
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,193
I let it go.

1253
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,512
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

1254
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,432
I couldn't kill you.

1255
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,553
Now, even the rabbits and chickens,
my wife has to do it.

1256
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,313
The war's taken it out of me.

1257
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,278
You know what I want to hear.

1258
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,475
Is he alive?

1259
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,436
The last time I saw him,
he wasn't doing well.

1260
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,279
But he's stronger than he looks.

1261
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,194
Don't stay together.

1262
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,997
When things calmed down,
I tried to get some sleep.

1263
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,073
- Gaignard!
- You think we're at the whorehouse?

1264
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,958
- Bouquet!
- What now?

1265
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,519
Notre Dame?

1266
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,515
Then the pimp tried to surrender.

1267
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,155
And the welder
from Paris was killed.

1268
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,590
Your fiancé started carving
on the tree.

1269
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,270
Then, the Jerries' Albatross arrived.

1270
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,234
I came to,
when the ground started shaking.

1271
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:35,076
I don't know what happened.
I just saw that trapdoor

1272
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,639
the shell had half-opened.

1273
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:54,995
For France!

1274
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,434
Charge!

1275
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,519
They entered no-man's-land.
At the second German line,

1276
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,237
the machine guns got them.
A few hours later,

1277
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,193
a voice woke me.

1278
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,069
My God! Bastoche is dead!

1279
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,549
We can't leave him here.

1280
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,711
We'll come back.
He's not going anywhere.

1281
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:25,593
Bastoche is dead.

1282
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,351
Look, this one's still moving.

1283
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,795
It's the Cornflower.
He's a goner as well.

1284
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:51,072
A shell had ripped the door off.

1285
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,511
One of the guys arrived,
in bad shape.

1286
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,193
Bastoche is dead!

1287
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,272
We're all going to die.

1288
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,909
I recognized Bastoche's friend.

1289
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,674
The one who'd taken
his German boots.

1290
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,555
After eating, I smoked his tobacco.

1291
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,878
Then, I heard more voices.

1292
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,559
Let's go look over there.

1293
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,795
Look here!

1294
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,589
Damn it!

1295
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,993
It's not the Cornflower.

1296
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,198
What's he doing in there?

1297
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,358
Where's the Dordogne farmer?

1298
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,316
- I'm cold.
- Don't worry.

1299
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,559
He was really messed up,

1300
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,993
but your fiancé wanted to live.
I saw it in his eyes.

1301
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:39,319
I put him on my shoulders
and set off through the trench.

1302
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,233
He was burning with fever.

1303
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,951
I felt the heat on my back.

1304
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,312
And he was delirious.

1305
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,672
Spoke of a heart
beating in his hand.

1306
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:02,875
Hey, Corporal!

1307
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,191
Only 500 yards to the hospital.

1308
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,351
Want us to put your friend
on the stretcher?

1309
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,589
No, thanks.

1310
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,070
If you see any officers from Bingo,

1311
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:15,836
tell them Corporal Gordes has gone
to the hospital with Desrochelles.

1312
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,399
Have it your way!

1313
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,076
I arrived just before the explosion.

1314
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,914
Headquarters had the good idea
of setting up hospital

1315
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,958
in a hangar containing
a hydrogen-packed zeppelin.

1316
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,273
The Cornflower
has just been evacuated.

1317
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,389
Will he make it?

1318
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:43,398
His hip wound isn't too bad. But
he has a severe case of pneumonia.

1319
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,077
You're both registered
according to your tag numbers.

1320
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,552
I don't want to know anything else.
But good luck anyway!

1321
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,588
Block the pulley!

1322
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,675
Please!

1323
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,314
After that, I walked to Bernay.

1324
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,674
I had no idea if my wife
had received my letter,

1325
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:54,519
so each day I waited for her
at the bus-stop.

1326
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,272
With the money from the sale,
we bought a farm here.

1327
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,275
The most isolated one we could find.

1328
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,995
They call it "The End of the World".

1329
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,915
That's it.

1330
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,229
Goodbye.

1331
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,389
How strange.

1332
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,715
You shot a hole
right through your lifeline.

1333
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,519
Of course.

1334
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,071
I died. At Bingo Crépuscule,
like your fiancé.

1335
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,872
If ever you find
Jean Desrochelles alive somewhere,

1336
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,559
let me know.

1337
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,354
You know where to find me.

1338
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,315
Make yourself at home!

1339
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,312
At Christmas,
come down the chimney!

1340
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,788
For Miss Mathilde.

1341
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,472
I'll give it to her later.

1342
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,313
If I were you...

1343
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:14,319
I would wake her up.

1344
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:20,789
What is it?

1345
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,269
"He's alive.

1346
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,798
"Stay where you are, Mathilde.

1347
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,871
"Just stay where you are.

1348
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,474
"I'm on my way.

1349
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,233
"Germain Pire."

1350
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,678
How silly I am!

1351
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:22,352
Peerless on the prowl,
faster than a whippet!

1352
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:26,151
He's well and truly alive,
but he's lost his memory!

1353
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,837
Total amnesia. He even had to learn
to read and write again.

1354
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:35,113
The psychiatrists treating him
since '17 aren't hopeful.

1355
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,039
But who knows?

1356
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,159
There are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1357
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:42,590
Where is he?

1358
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,199
In Milly-la-Forêt.

1359
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,593
Orphaned for the second time.
He's just lost his adopted mother.

1360
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,839
Pierre-Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1361
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,674
By reputation.

1362
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,955
An honour.

1363
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,315
Mathilde,
I'll believe it when I see it.

1364
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:03,989
"With my own eyes!"

1365
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,198
When Jean Desrochelles was born,

1366
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,795
his mother was 40,
and had no other children.

1367
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,632
When the gendarmes took him...

1368
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,996
To replenish the troops in Ardennes.

1369
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,639
She became depressed.

1370
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,719
One day,
a comrade of her son visited her...

1371
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,235
Chardolot!

1372
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,357
Unfortunately, it was Jean.

1373
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:27,036
A shell had got him. He'd already
been dead for a few hours.

1374
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:30,079
I should also tell you...

1375
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,557
Maybe the youngest prisoner
has taken Jean's identity...

1376
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,719
exchanging tag numbers.

1377
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,711
She went off her rocker
the day the hospital rang her,

1378
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,199
asking to come to her son's bedside.

1379
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,590
He's sleeping. I'll leave you.

1380
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,393
Who are you?

1381
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,757
Your mother, my darling.

1382
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,998
I'm your mother.

1383
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,792
I ran my own little investigation.

1384
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,117
Mrs. Desrochelles died
two months ago.

1385
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:31,033
Run over by a truck
after a fight with a shopkeeper.

1386
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,713
And I'm not guessing!

1387
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,715
- It's in the report.
- We already knew that.

1388
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,238
Don't get upset.

1389
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,310
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer,
she died straight away.

1390
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:48,834
It's not that.

1391
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,198
I feel so guilty!

1392
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:55,314
I didn't believe you,
my dear Mathilde!

1393
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,198
I should have known!

1394
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,473
I'm so sorry.

1395
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:09,518
In what she would refer to as
her "Milly Expedition",

1396
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,116
the sun, the sky
and nature are with her.

1397
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,756
As a true lady, she made
every effort to look her best.

1398
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,958
Dressed in white for freshness,

1399
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:22,636
lipstick for the occasion,
eyebrows shaped.

1400
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,599
But none of that black
which lengthens the eyelashes.

1401
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,956
She knows that tears
can make a mess of it.

1402
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,312
He knows about your visit.

1403
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,677
We said a young girl
he'd dearly loved was coming here.

1404
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,514
He asked your name
and found it very beautiful.

1405
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,594
He's in the garden.
He's waiting for you.

1406
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,472
Does it hurt when you walk?

1407
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,073
Want to see what I'm doing?

1408
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,956
I'll show you later,
when it's finished.

1409
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,999
But why are you crying?

1410
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,433
Mathilde leans back
against her chair,

1411
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,796
folds her hands in her lap
and looks at him.

1412
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:54,439
In the sweetness of the air,
in the light of the garden,

1413
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,792
Mathilde looks at him.

1414
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,118
She looks at him...

1415
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,999
She looks at him...

1416
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:28,794
