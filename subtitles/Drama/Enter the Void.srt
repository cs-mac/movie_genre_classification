1
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,705
Hey!

2
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:25,706
Hey, Linda! Come here!

3
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,789
Come outside!

4
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:35,330
I wonder what Tokyo
looks like from up there.

5
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,163
I don't.

6
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,538
Why not?

7
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,372
I'd be scared.

8
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:45,372
Scared of what?

9
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,955
Of dying, I guess.

10
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:53,956
Falling into the void.

11
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:59,873
They say you fly when you die.

12
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:07,206
It's fucking cold!

13
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,913
Hey, check out this book
Alex gave me.

14
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:16,788
- It's like the Tibetan Bible.
- Alex, the junkie?

15
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,789
It's all about what happens
after you die. Look!

16
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,455
So you're gonna become
all Buddhist on me, huh?

17
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,413
No.

18
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:35,414
You know they're all the same,
the fucking Catholics, the Jews...

19
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:41,789
Just a bunch of sects
out to get their hands on your money.

20
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:44,455
Alex is gonna make you a junkie

21
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,205
and then he's gonna
make you a fucking Buddhist.

22
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:51,163
No! He's just a friend.
I'm not gonna become a Buddhist.

23
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,705
Alex is a fucking junkie.
He's not your friend.

24
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:59,622
- Come on!
- He's not your friend!

25
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:04,623
I gotta go.

26
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,913
Hey!

27
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,788
I'll see you later?

28
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,872
See you.

29
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:15,705
Lock the door.

30
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:19,747
Just lock the door.

31
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:24,748
Okay, good.

32
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:29,038
Why did she say I'm a junkie?

33
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,622
I know I'm not a junkie.

34
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:35,705
I know who I am.

35
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,955
I know I'm not a junkie.

36
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,622
She's my sister,

37
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:45,623
but sometimes
she doesn't know who I am.

38
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:05,538
There you go!

39
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,539
This is the good stuff.

40
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,080
Why else would Bruno
give this to me?

41
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,538
He probably wants a blow job.

42
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,997
That's disgusting!

43
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:25,163
Who do they think I am, anyway?

44
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:30,164
I know I'm not a junkie.

45
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:09,414
Easy...

46
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:32,623
This stuff doesn't taste good.

47
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:39,164
This drug tastes like shit.

48
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:51,998
Wow! It's already kicking in.

49
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:56,788
This is it. It started.

50
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,455
Oh God!

51
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,955
This is the best.

52
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:06,163
What if I faint?
I'm not gonna faint.

53
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,997
Just calm down.

54
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:12,998
I've done this before.
You love this.

55
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:19,456
Wow!

56
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,205
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oscar... It's Victor.

57
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:44,330
Hey, I've been looking for you.

58
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,872
<i>Can you bring me my stuff?</i>

59
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,372
Can you come and get it?

60
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:52,288
<i>No, I need you to bring it to me.</i>

61
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:56,913
- Oh, okay. Where are you?
- I'm at The Void. <i>I'm....</i>

62
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:00,622
You know, I'm really sorry
about yesterday...

63
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:04,247
<i>- I'll wait</i> here.
- Actually, I'd rather...

64
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,247
<i>Don't be long.</i>

65
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,288
Hello?

66
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:09,788
Hello?

67
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,372
Come on!

68
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:17,373
Oh fuck!

69
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:30,289
Wake up!

70
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:34,955
Get a hold of yourself!

71
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:39,956
Oh God! What's that?

72
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:46,706
Wake up!

73
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:53,748
Collect yourself.

74
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,330
The balcony.

75
00:12:56,331 --> 00:13:00,288
Walk away from there!

76
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:04,372
Keep your eyes open.

77
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:09,373
My head is throbbing.

78
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:20,789
Oh, you look like shit!

79
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:27,122
Water.

80
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,372
Water.

81
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,913
Just fresh tap water,

82
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:33,705
from some natural place to here.

83
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:38,706
Nice, clean tap water will help.

84
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:49,331
That's perfect.

85
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:57,205
Back to normal.

86
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:00,872
Look at your pupils,
look at your eyes.

87
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,955
They look different.

88
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:06,913
Oh shit!

89
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,788
Is it the neighbours?

90
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,372
Did they hear me?
Did I scream?

91
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:14,413
Maybe I did.

92
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:19,414
Just calm down.

93
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:24,413
Alex!

94
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:29,122
Hold on.

95
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:33,122
- Hey, Oscar! You all right?
- What's going on, man?

96
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,247
Nothing much.
Doing pretty good.

97
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:41,622
I think I need a shower.

98
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:45,497
The balcony.
Don't go to the balcony.

99
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:49,413
Stay away from the balcony.

100
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,788
- Hey, have you read the book?
- The book?

101
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,663
- Yeah.
- Ah, the Book of the Dead?

102
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:54,955
Yeah.

103
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:59,288
I haven't actually finished reading
the whole thing, but it's pretty good.

104
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,080
- It's a wild book.
- I'm glad you like it.

105
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,163
Do you mind if I keep it,
so I can finish it?

106
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:07,413
- I don't mind.
- Thanks.

107
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:12,414
Thanks, thanks.

108
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,413
You Okay?

109
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:20,372
Yeah, well...

110
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,788
- I bumped into your sister.
- Yeah?

111
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,372
Yeah.
She was with that cunt, Mario.

112
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,997
I fucking hate that guy.

113
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:31,997
I can't believe she's
going out with him, you know?

114
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,247
If she ever gets pregnant,
I'll kill the baby.

115
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,205
I swear to God.

116
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,372
Hey, look, anyway... Do you mind
if we go and see her tonight?

117
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,872
- I'd really like to see her.
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,705
First, though,
we have to stop by The Void.

119
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,788
I have some stuff for Victor.
You wanna come?

120
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,413
- The Void?
- Yeah.

121
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,955
Well, I don't like that place,

122
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:51,497
but I'll follow you
and we go and see your sister?

123
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,913
- Oh yeah. Let's go.
- Great!

124
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:58,914
- Can I grab some water?
- Yeah, sure.

125
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:04,498
Water!

126
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,955
- You're not taking everything, are you?
- No, only his share.

127
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,497
- Man! That's a lot of gear!
- Yeah.

128
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:30,580
Shit!
That's fucking dangerous, you know?

129
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:32,663
You should let him come
and fucking pick it up himself.

130
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:36,205
No. He won't come by here anymore.
After what happened with his mother.

131
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,080
- What? He found out?
- Yeah.

132
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,747
- How did he find out?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

133
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,872
All right.
You don't mind if I take your water?

134
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:47,873
- No, bring it.
- All right.

135
00:16:55,081 --> 00:17:00,081
The streets are really empty.
Is it a holiday today?

136
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:07,664
Hey, what's wrong with you?

137
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:16,288
- You tripping, man?
- Yeah.

138
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:18,372
You can tell?

139
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:20,747
Yeah, you look really fucked up.

140
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,872
I popped some tabs this morning

141
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:27,872
and just took a hit of DMT
before you came, actually.

142
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:30,330
Shit!
Looks like you had a good day.

143
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:34,122
Yeah, and the day
isn't over either.

144
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:38,455
Hey! Do you think Bruno
has anything stronger than DMT?

145
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:42,080
Come on, you're gonna
fry your brain, man!

146
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:46,955
You should finish the Book of
the Dead, that'd be a lot better.

147
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,705
You can wait until you die,
then you'll get your big trip.

148
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,955
That book is still confusing to me.

149
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:55,788
How would you explain it?

150
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:59,497
It's a little bit hard to explain.
So, basically...

151
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:03,663
when you die
your spirit leaves your body.

152
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:06,705
At first you can see all your life,

153
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:09,497
like reflected in the magic mirror.

154
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,538
And then you start floating
like a ghost.

155
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,122
And you can see anything
that's happening around you.

156
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:17,622
You can hear everything,

157
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,538
but you can't communicate
with the world of the living.

158
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,997
And then you see these lights,
all these different lights,

159
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:26,247
of all different colours.

160
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,455
These lights are the doors

161
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,455
that pull you into
higher planes of existence.

162
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:34,080
But most people...

163
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,288
they actually...

164
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,289
they actually like this world so much
that they don't want to be taken away.

165
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,747
So, that's when the whole thing
turns into a bad trip.

166
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:50,748
The only way out
is to get re-incarnated.

167
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,038
- Does it make any sense?
- Yeah, I guess so.

168
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,747
I don't know.
What's the bad trip?

169
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:01,497
Well, the bad trip is
you get all these nightmares.

170
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,913
You go like real crazy.

171
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,747
All your fears become reality...

172
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:09,038
and it scares the shit out of you.

173
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,039
It's like what's left of your mind
has to be on top of everything, right?

174
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:20,123
At that point
you wish you never died.

175
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:25,497
Then some darker yellow lights
appear to you.

176
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:30,498
They represent
all these couples making love.

177
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:34,663
And then, the light comes out from
their bellies and if you get closer

178
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:38,288
they give you a vision
of a possible future life.

179
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,372
And you choose the life
that suits you the best.

180
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:46,913
You know? You end up in a womb
and you're reincarnated.

181
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,413
End of story.

182
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:52,330
And basically
you do this forever and ever,

183
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,788
until you manage
to break the circle.

184
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,913
You follow me?

185
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:03,163
So you mean we are stuck in this
shitty world for all of eternity?

186
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:08,164
You mean there's
nothing better out there?

187
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,705
Hey, you know what?

188
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,163
I can't wait to see your sister.

189
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,163
She looks really beautiful man,
you know?

190
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,330
I know,
but she's still MY sister, okay?

191
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:21,122
I know. I'm just saying, you know...
I'm not blind.

192
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:23,788
I mean, what can I say?
She's gorgeous.

193
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,789
Fuck off!

194
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:32,705
Fucking taxis!

195
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:36,247
Well, you should
look after her, you know?

196
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,372
What are you talking about?

197
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,372
You're turning into a dealer.

198
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,247
I'm not turning into a dealer!

199
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:45,705
Yes, you are.
What are we gonna do tonight?

200
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,955
You know, look at
what your sister is doing.

201
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,122
She's trying to stop you
from doing that.

202
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,747
What, are you schizophrenic?

203
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,913
You're the one who introduced me
to your provider!

204
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:55,372
Ah, come on!

205
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:59,247
No, honestly, you should try
to get a job, you know?

206
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:00,538
I don't know.

207
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,372
I mean, you're a smart guy, you know.
You could DJ.

208
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:05,872
Maybe ask the club, like,

209
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,205
to give you a job, part time,
like bar tending.

210
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:10,497
It's really fucking easy,
I did it!

211
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:13,372
It's a piece of cake, you know?
Especially in Tokyo.

212
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:18,373
You're a foreigner,
you're good looking...

213
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:23,497
You know, there's a big difference
between taking psychedelics,

214
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:24,997
and being a dealer, you know?

215
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,330
- I said, I'm not a dealer!
- You're a dealer!

216
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:30,205
And you're a mother fucker, man!

217
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,330
I can't believe you're fucking
that old bitch, you know?

218
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,788
You're in Tokyo and there's a lot
of fucking cute chicks everywhere

219
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,622
and you're fucking some old bitch!

220
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,122
And she is a foreigner as well!

221
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,913
At least, if you're fucking
a Japanese old bitch... You know?

222
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:44,038
She fucked ME.

223
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,080
Anyway...
Oh, man! Look at that! Cops!

224
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,788
Fuck!

225
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,205
Hey...

226
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:57,955
I wanna dump my bottle.
I'll be back in a sec.

227
00:21:57,956 --> 00:22:01,122
- Have you ever heard of datura?
- No.

228
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:04,288
- It's crazy shit.
- Why, what's datura?

229
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,622
- Is it a mushroom?
- Yeah! It's a plant...

230
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:12,580
that takes you somewhere, you know?
Pretty freaky!

231
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,581
What's it like? I mean,
what's the trip like on datura?

232
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:24,998
Like you don't even know
you're fucking tripping, you know?

233
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:28,413
You'd be on the floor, you'd be
talking to every fucking body,

234
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,747
but you realize two weeks later

235
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:33,497
that you were not talking
to anybody, you know?

236
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:36,788
I mean, I took it, I saw that chick.
Man, she was gorgeous!

237
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,955
- Hang on a sec! Hang on!
- Yeah?

238
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:42,122
She was fucking gorgeous,
I really fucking liked her, right?

239
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:45,747
And I tried to kiss her,
I'd been talking for thirty minutes.

240
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:50,122
She fucking disappeared,
she had never existed.

241
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:52,747
Look, Oscar.

242
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,747
I don't want to see you doing
that shit with Victor, right?

243
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,455
So I'll wait for you. I'll grab some
food and I'll see you in a minute.

244
00:22:58,456 --> 00:22:59,747
- Okay.
- All right.

245
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:04,748
- I'll catch in a minute, man.
- Okay, see you later.

246
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:12,373
Linda's right.
Alex is more of a junkie than me.

247
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:20,748
I hope Victor is here already.
I don't want to wait for him.

248
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,705
Hey!

249
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:42,997
I've brought your stuff.

250
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,455
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:48,705
- What?
- I'm sorry.

252
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:53,247
Oh shit!

253
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:55,330
Hold on!

254
00:23:55,331 --> 00:24:00,331
Police!

255
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:08,622
- Ah! Come on!
- Open up! Police!

256
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:13,163
What are you doing?
I'm gonna call my embassy!

257
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:18,164
Hold on! Hold on a minute!

258
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:25,248
I'm coming out!

259
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:32,914
Oh shit!

260
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:36,122
I have a gun!

261
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:39,538
I have a gun!
I'm gonna shoot!

262
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,663
If you don't leave, I shoot!

263
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:47,664
Why do you want me to...

264
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:55,122
What?

265
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,955
They shot me!

266
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:01,372
I can't die now.
They shot me?

267
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,372
Did they kill me?

268
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:08,373
Did they shoot me?

269
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:13,538
No, I don't want to die like this.

270
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,663
Not right now!

271
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:18,622
My sister...
There's blood on my hands.

272
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:22,580
They're gonna test my blood.
They'll find me positive.

273
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:25,163
They'll put me in prison.
They caught me.

274
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:29,330
It's the police, isn't it?

275
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:32,122
They'll rape me.

276
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:37,123
No, I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't hurt anyone.

277
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:42,206
Life sucks.

278
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:47,788
I can't feel my arms.

279
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:51,413
This isn't happening.
I'm just tripping.

280
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:55,372
That's what it is.

281
00:25:55,373 --> 00:26:00,373
It's the DMT.

282
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,372
No, I'm still alive.

283
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:06,997
I'm dying.

284
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,163
Am I dead?

285
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:14,164
I hope this isn't real.

286
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:20,497
What will happen to her?

287
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:25,205
Linda, please help me.
I need your help.

288
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:30,206
Take me home.

289
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:32,913
I don't wanna die.

290
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:37,205
I don't wanna die like this.

291
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:42,206
I don't wanna die.

292
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:30,998
Accident, accident.

293
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:58,288
Victor?

294
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:02,205
- Victor? What happened to Oscar?
- They shot him!

295
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:07,206
- They killed him!
- Get the fuck off me!

296
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:07,706
No, no, no! No stay!
Private! Private!

297
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:19,789
I have to get that.

298
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:11,581
Linda! The cops shot
your brother at The Void.

299
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,955
He was bringing some shit to Victor
and I don't know what happened.

300
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:17,913
I heard a shot.

301
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:20,080
And Victor said they killed him.

302
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:25,081
You should run...

303
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:16,373
- So, who was that?
- It doesn't matter.

304
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:56,747
Mario?

305
00:41:56,748 --> 00:42:01,288
Mario?

306
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:06,289
What the hell are you doing?

307
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:11,373
Bye.

308
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:04,456
<i>Linda! The cops shot</i>
your brother at The Void.

309
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:08,747
<i>He was bringing some shit to Victor</i>
and I don't know what happened.

310
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:10,747
<i>I heard a shot.</i>

311
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,788
<i>And Victor said they killed him.</i>

312
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,580
<i>You should run and find out.</i>

313
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:17,580
<i>Sorry, I was outside.</i>
I can't tell you more.

314
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:22,581
<i>The cops are after me now.</i>
I'll call you back.

315
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:32,122
And if you die?

316
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:34,497
What's gonna happen to us?

317
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:39,498
What will happen to us?

318
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:46,539
Will we ever see each other again?

319
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:57,081
You promised me.

320
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:14,289
We'll always be together.

321
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:21,039
Forever and ever.

322
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:10,163
Hey.

323
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:15,164
Oscar.

324
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:47,122
- Oscar, do you love me?
- Yes.

325
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:50,413
- How much?
- A lot.

326
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:55,414
What's a lot?

327
00:48:42,373 --> 00:48:47,373
Mommy!

328
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:58,248
Do you remember the pact we made?

329
00:49:01,164 --> 00:49:06,164
Kind of.

330
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:16,581
We said
we'd never leave each other.

331
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:21,580
Never ever?

332
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,538
Never ever.

333
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:26,122
- You swear?
- I swear.

334
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:31,123
- And if you die?
- I'll come back.

335
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:41,373
This is a blood pact.

336
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:59,623
Now we'll always be together.

337
00:50:21,206 --> 00:50:25,330
Stop it!
I'm not letting you take...

338
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:30,331
Oscar!

339
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:33,413
Oscar! Don't let them take me!

340
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,997
You promised me!

341
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:40,998
Oscar, you promised me!
No! No! No!

342
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:56,788
Then she was sent to a foster home
and I was sent to a different one

343
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:59,372
and life became like a nightmare.

344
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:02,122
You should take her to Tokyo.

345
00:51:02,123 --> 00:51:03,372
I miss her so much.

346
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:05,997
She's younger
and she's still in school.

347
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:10,998
Come meet my flatmate.

348
00:51:12,498 --> 00:51:14,747
Oscar.

349
00:51:14,748 --> 00:51:18,205
Hey-
- HEY-

350
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:22,372
Check it out!

351
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:26,705
What'?! Holy shit! No way!

352
00:51:26,706 --> 00:51:30,080
- Wow.
- Pretty cool, heh?

353
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:35,081
Yeah, that's actually pretty insane.
It's like Tokyo on acid.

354
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:40,956
And this is the plane
that brings your sister.

355
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:43,705
Trust me, I really want to.

356
00:51:43,706 --> 00:51:47,080
It's just money, man.
Money, money, money that I don't have.

357
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:50,872
Money, money, money.
You can make money, be smart!

358
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:53,622
- Rob a bank!
- Yeah.

359
00:51:53,623 --> 00:51:56,538
Yeah. That's like the hardest thing
I can think of.

360
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:58,788
I'd rather be a drug dealer.

361
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,913
No, man,
that's fucking dangerous, you know?

362
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,205
Shitty job.
Good drugs are nice, yeah,

363
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,163
you can make a lot of money,

364
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,122
but you can go like really deep
into the shit, you know?

365
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:11,955
You can end up in prison.

366
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:13,372
My mom says
that when she was young,

367
00:52:13,373 --> 00:52:15,288
to make money,
she was a go-go dancer.

368
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:17,538
- Really?
- Yeah.

369
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:20,872
She's an amazing woman! You
should come and meet her. Yeah.

370
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:24,538
Come out for dinner once,
and meet my parents.

371
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:27,747
When I met her,
she was a go-go dancer in Tokyo.

372
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:30,247
Yeah, I went down
to the club a few times,

373
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,538
got a disease...

374
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:33,663
- Anyway!
- That's just the story.

375
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:38,330
Anyway, tell us about you.

376
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:41,580
- Are your parents here, in Tokyo?
- No, no.

377
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:44,163
My parents passed away
a long time ago.

378
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:48,288
What happened?

379
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:51,747
If you want,
I can find the money to lend you.

380
00:52:51,748 --> 00:52:54,497
How about it?

381
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:59,498
You don't have a lot
of friends in Tokyo, right?

382
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:06,288
And Victor?

383
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:11,289
What about Victor?

384
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:20,622
Nobody knows I'm here, right?

385
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:25,623
Nobody.

386
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:02,248
Hey, it's beautiful.

387
00:54:02,998 --> 00:54:04,913
You know what it reminds me of?

388
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:07,538
- What?
- Smoking.

389
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:11,663
It reminds me of
sucking on my mother's nipples.

390
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:15,788
- The best thing in my life.
- You're a freak!

391
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:20,789
When is this acid
gonna be hitting me?

392
00:54:26,456 --> 00:54:29,080
You know the good thing about LSD?

393
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:32,038
If you can manage
to overcome your fears,

394
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:37,039
you can take your hallucinations
wherever you want.

395
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:05,997
Hey, Mom!
What happens if you die?

396
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:08,538
I'll be with you forever.

397
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,913
I will always watch you.

398
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:13,747
I will watch you from the sky.

399
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:18,748
- You promise?
- I promise.

400
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,913
You love Daddy
more than you love me?

401
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:24,413
No. I love you both.

402
00:55:24,414 --> 00:55:29,205
It's a different love,
a very different love.

403
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,080
Why?

404
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:36,081
Why?

405
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:19,289
Hey!

406
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:21,705
Do you remember me?

407
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:23,622
- No.
- No?

408
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:26,872
We were here last week,
you guys remember?

409
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:28,663
- Hey! Wait, wait, wait!
- Bye!

410
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:33,664
No, wait!

411
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:48,247
- Do you take drugs?
- Drugs?

412
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:50,455
- Yeah. Do you take drugs?
- No.

413
00:56:50,456 --> 00:56:53,122
- Never once have you taken drugs?
- Never once.

414
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,080
- Never once?
- Never once!

415
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,788
But I like alcohol.

416
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,205
Yeah, so you like alcohol,
then you like drugs.

417
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,122
It's like one step,
then the next step.

418
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:02,913
One step? Yeah.

419
00:57:02,914 --> 00:57:05,163
- So you're David?
- Yeah, what do you want?

420
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:06,247
What?

421
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,330
Some of my friends said
I could come by here

422
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:10,413
to get some stuff to party with.

423
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:12,122
Who's that?
Who's your friend?

424
00:57:12,123 --> 00:57:13,955
- It doesn't matter. What do you have?
- Why doesn't it matter?

425
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:16,330
Who's that, your friend?

426
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,455
- Gaspar.
- All right.

427
00:57:18,456 --> 00:57:21,413
Okay, what do you want?
Coke or X?

428
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:25,372
- How much is coke?
- Ten grams for sixty.

429
00:57:25,373 --> 00:57:27,705
- Okay, yeah, that's good.
- Are you sure?

430
00:57:27,706 --> 00:57:29,872
Here! Take it. Just...

431
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:34,873
There you go! Yeah!

432
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:12,289
- How strong they are?
- Be careful! They're really trippy.

433
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:38,455
- Hey, guess what?
- <i>What?</i>

434
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:41,455
- I finally found an apartment.
- That's great!

435
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:43,080
I have a job now.

436
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:46,205
Hey, and I have enough money
for your ticket.

437
00:58:46,206 --> 00:58:48,747
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>
- Isn't it exciting?

438
00:58:48,748 --> 00:58:50,913
<i>Wow! My God!</i>

439
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:53,955
<i>How did you make enough money</i>
to buy me a ticket?

440
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:55,288
<i>That's crazy!</i>

441
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:59,413
- Hey, I told you! I have a job.
- Wow! Oscar, I love you.

442
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:04,414
Start packing, okay?

443
00:59:18,873 --> 00:59:21,247
What?

444
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:25,497
Nothing.

445
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:29,163
So, what are we getting?

446
00:59:29,164 --> 00:59:31,247
E's and acid.

447
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:34,955
- And I guess I'll get some DMT too.
- Oh, nice.

448
00:59:34,956 --> 00:59:37,455
- Can I come with you?
- No chance.

449
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:39,747
The guy's so paranoid.

450
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:44,497
- You have the money, though?
- Yeah.

451
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,705
Here you go.

452
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:51,455
The drug guy,
he's a dirty bastard, you know?

453
00:59:51,456 --> 00:59:54,330
- Yeah, he likes boys.
- Who is this?

454
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:58,080
Bruno.
The guy that gets me drugs.

455
00:59:58,081 --> 00:59:59,747
Don't even take a drink!

456
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:02,038
If you go there on your own,
and you take a drink,

457
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,039
you might wake up two days later
with his shit on your mouth, you know?

458
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:11,705
Or your own shit, you know?

459
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:13,580
Actually,
I'll introduce him to you today,

460
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:17,538
but I won't come back with you,
so you should be careful.

461
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,997
You know what his new trick is?

462
01:00:19,998 --> 01:00:22,038
He can't even be turned on
by fucking now,

463
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:25,122
- so what he does is...
- Hey...

464
01:00:25,123 --> 01:00:28,247
I'm not gonna jump
from here, am I?

465
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:32,163
Hey! When some new guy
gives him a blow job, yeah,

466
01:00:32,164 --> 01:00:35,080
he sticks his finger
inside his own ass

467
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:39,205
and then he wipes his finger
on the back of their head.

468
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:43,747
So they walk around
with his shit on their hair!

469
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:45,413
That's the guy
I was telling you about.

470
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:47,955
Hey, you look just like me!

471
01:00:47,956 --> 01:00:51,913
- What's your name?
- Oscar.

472
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,997
- So, what do you want?
- Do you have any LSD?

473
01:00:55,998 --> 01:01:00,998
Let's have a look.

474
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:05,580
Cool.

475
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:10,581
Hey, Oscar, check this!

476
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:13,413
What happened to him?

477
01:01:13,414 --> 01:01:15,122
Poor baby!

478
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:18,372
Screaming for his mum all night.

479
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:23,080
Yeah, this is what I'm looking for.

480
01:01:23,081 --> 01:01:28,081
Cheers, mate.

481
01:01:28,914 --> 01:01:32,872
- Nice.
- Hey...

482
01:01:32,873 --> 01:01:35,580
- Do you have any DMT?
- DMT?

483
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:40,581
I might have a little bit left.

484
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:45,372
Have you ever tried GHB?

485
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:49,038
It's funny, you know?
DMT only lasts for six minutes,

486
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,497
but it really seems like eternity!

487
01:01:52,498 --> 01:01:54,580
It's the same chemical

488
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:56,747
that your brain releases
when you die.

489
01:01:56,748 --> 01:02:01,748
It's a little bit like dying
would be the ultimate trip, you know?

490
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:04,372
Hey.

491
01:02:04,373 --> 01:02:09,373
Let's try this!

492
01:02:10,456 --> 01:02:13,163
Be careful!

493
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:15,413
You see this tunnel?

494
01:02:15,414 --> 01:02:18,872
It leads to these huge gutters.

495
01:02:18,873 --> 01:02:22,663
You know,
all those bums are hiding there.

496
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:27,288
People go at night in those gutters.

497
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,622
What do you think?

498
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:33,955
- It's fucking awesome.
- Yeah?

499
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:36,455
Imagine if the walls were all clear

500
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:39,497
and all your friends
were inside it, fucking.

501
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:41,705
Massive...
Melt into this massive orgy.

502
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:43,872
- Oscar?
- Yeah.

503
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:48,873
Come and check it out.
I've got something for you.

504
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,747
You should read that
before you try DMT.

505
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:53,997
Tibetan Book of the Dead?
I assume it's about death.

506
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:58,288
It tells you how your spirit comes out
from your body after you die.

507
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:01,080
Have you ever had an
out-of-body experience?

508
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,163
- Have you?
- Yeah.

509
01:03:03,164 --> 01:03:05,705
- Once as well.
- What's it like?

510
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:08,205
First it fucking took me so long
to get there, you know?

511
01:03:08,206 --> 01:03:12,372
I had to practice slowing down my
breathing, slowing down, slowing down.

512
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:15,372
And it's like my mind is out

513
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:17,288
and I can see myself, you know?

514
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:20,163
Like, just above myself.

515
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,705
I really freaked out

516
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:24,955
because I was afraid I would
not be able to get back in my body.

517
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:28,622
Yeah! It's fucking crazy, you know?
Yeah, that's cool, you know, but...

518
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:32,247
<i>- Hey! It's me, again...</i>
- Hey! Check this out!

519
01:03:32,248 --> 01:03:34,247
<i>Hey! It's me, again....</i>

520
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:35,872
<i>- It's me, Linda.</i>
- Your sister, is it?

521
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:40,038
<i>Don't forget I'll be arriving at
the airport Monday evening at</i> 6 <i>pm.</i>

522
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:45,039
<i>You will be there, won't you?</i>

523
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:52,081
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:57,248
I missed you so much.

525
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:32,789
Look at that!

526
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:10,997
No! Mommy!

527
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:15,998
Mommy!

528
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,413
When you die and Grandpa dies,

529
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:58,372
what will happen to us?

530
01:05:58,373 --> 01:06:00,497
You'll be taken care of, dear.

531
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,538
We promise you'll be taken care of.

532
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:08,539
No! No! No!

533
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,372
Oscar!

534
01:06:14,373 --> 01:06:16,872
Oscar!

535
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:18,413
Oscar!

536
01:06:18,414 --> 01:06:21,122
Hey.

537
01:06:21,123 --> 01:06:25,247
You know what?
I dreamt again of the accident.

538
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:30,248
Yeah?

539
01:06:30,414 --> 01:06:34,247
Well... doesn't matter.

540
01:06:34,248 --> 01:06:39,248
We're gonna be like
a family from now on.

541
01:06:40,623 --> 01:06:45,455
Just you and me!

542
01:06:45,456 --> 01:06:50,456
Do you want some more?

543
01:06:54,998 --> 01:06:57,872
Was it good?

544
01:06:57,873 --> 01:07:02,122
Hey.

545
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:06,372
It's for a club.
You wanna go?

546
01:07:06,373 --> 01:07:11,373
Wow.

547
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:20,872
- Hey, take this pill!
- What is it?

548
01:07:20,873 --> 01:07:22,163
It's ecstasy.

549
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,372
- I never did it before.
- Just take it!

550
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,622
- Is it dangerous?
- No! It's a drug.

551
01:07:26,623 --> 01:07:28,913
- Come on, it's like a vitamin.
- Okay.

552
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:33,914
- You're gonna love it!
- Yeah? Okay.

553
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:44,998
My God!
It feels so fucking good!

554
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:03,206
Hey, Oscar, man! Your sister,
she's real fucking hot, you know?

555
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:09,164
You gotta take care of her.

556
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:12,705
Look at her, Oscar!

557
01:08:12,706 --> 01:08:15,413
- Come and dance with me!
- Hey.

558
01:08:15,414 --> 01:08:20,414
- Come on!
- Hey, hey, hey...

559
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:27,998
I think she likes me.

560
01:08:57,289 --> 01:09:00,455
All right, here's the deal.
You front me the money for the E,

561
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:02,663
I take the risk of scoring
and selling the stuff.

562
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:04,413
And we go for a fifty-fifty split.

563
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:06,663
It means you get all the profit.

564
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:09,247
Listen. Wait, wait!
Who's your dealer?

565
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:12,247
That's none of your business.

566
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:17,248
Okay. So how much do you need?

567
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:22,330
Look, where were you?

568
01:09:22,331 --> 01:09:27,080
- I was looking for you.
- That guy got you way too drunk!

569
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:32,081
Where were you?

570
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:37,580
Hey, guys!

571
01:09:37,581 --> 01:09:40,122
Hey, seriously, let's go!

572
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:45,123
Come on!

573
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:51,498
Watch the step!

574
01:09:53,373 --> 01:09:58,373
Let go of me!

575
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:07,748
You know that tomorrow is the
anniversary of Mom and Dad's death?

576
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:24,748
I'm having fun!

577
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:34,497
Wow!

578
01:10:34,498 --> 01:10:39,038
This is like heaven!

579
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:44,039
It's so beautiful!

580
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:54,705
I really feel so happy
here with you.

581
01:10:54,706 --> 01:10:58,247
I feel free.

582
01:10:58,248 --> 01:11:03,248
I feel very, very free.

583
01:11:03,498 --> 01:11:05,747
You promise me
you'll never leave me?

584
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:08,247
Of course.

585
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:11,372
- We'll die together?
- We'll never die.

586
01:11:11,373 --> 01:11:13,330
- We'll never die?
- Never.

587
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:16,080
- We're immortal.
- Yes.

588
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:21,081
- We will never die.
- Good.

589
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:27,913
What?

590
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:30,163
I missed...

591
01:11:30,164 --> 01:11:35,164
I just missed you so... so much.

592
01:11:48,498 --> 01:11:52,997
- Have I grown?
- Of course.

593
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:57,998
I look like a woman now?

594
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:10,581
Do you believe in re-incarnation?

595
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:18,414
I don't have a
mental age of five anymore.

596
01:12:26,664 --> 01:12:29,622
Don't you wanna find a real job?

597
01:12:29,623 --> 01:12:31,538
Fuck, no!

598
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:36,539
Everyone who has a job
is just a slave.

599
01:12:37,664 --> 01:12:40,163
There's one important thing though:

600
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:43,038
It's to have a goal... like...

601
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:47,747
Do you have a goal?

602
01:12:47,748 --> 01:12:51,288
- I don't know.
- You should have a goal.

603
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:56,122
Maybe have a big love affair?

604
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:57,997
You know?

605
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:02,998
Hey! What did that guy
want with you at the nightclub?

606
01:13:03,498 --> 01:13:08,498
- He offered me a job.
- Doing what?

607
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:27,080
Hey!

608
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:30,413
- You're Mario, right?
- Yeah.

609
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:33,663
Look, that's my sister.

610
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:38,080
Don't touch her, okay?

611
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:43,081
Don't be a bad brother.

612
01:13:44,623 --> 01:13:48,372
So, how much do you want?

613
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:51,247
Fifty pills. It's for me
and my friend Victor.

614
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:53,288
Look, man, I don't want
to know your friend,

615
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:55,538
and I don't want him
to know me, okay?

616
01:13:55,539 --> 01:14:00,539
Okay.

617
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:08,914
Hey, baby! You like snakes?

618
01:14:18,998 --> 01:14:23,998
And don't look so nervous!
We're all friends here.

619
01:14:24,664 --> 01:14:28,913
Does anybody want any coke?
Any ice?

620
01:14:28,914 --> 01:14:31,247
No.

621
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:35,288
- Do you have any DMT?
- No.

622
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:40,289
Come here!

623
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:50,539
What are you looking at?

624
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:04,413
- You wanna try some?
- Sure.

625
01:15:04,414 --> 01:15:06,913
Ready, you guys?

626
01:15:06,914 --> 01:15:11,455
Shit!

627
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:13,663
What the fuck are you doing here?

628
01:15:13,664 --> 01:15:15,705
It doesn't matter to you.
I'm not hurting anybody.

629
01:15:15,706 --> 01:15:17,205
Shit!

630
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:19,663
- Don't touch my stuff!
- You're selling drugs to my girls!

631
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:23,247
- Fuck off, give it back!
- Fuck!

632
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:26,413
If I ever see you again here,

633
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:28,372
I'm gonna kill you.

634
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:33,373
Out!

635
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:06,163
- Do you know what Mom and Dad said?
- What?

636
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:09,372
That they would bring us
to Japan one day.

637
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:14,373
- Can Doggy come?
- Yes.

638
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:02,580
What's up?

639
01:18:02,581 --> 01:18:05,705
Where the fuck were you?

640
01:18:05,706 --> 01:18:09,205
You didn't come home last night.
You didn't call me.

641
01:18:09,206 --> 01:18:13,205
You could let me know the next time
you get laid by a dicksucker.

642
01:18:13,206 --> 01:18:18,206
If you mean Mario,
I wasn't with him.

643
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:38,247
What?

644
01:18:38,248 --> 01:18:43,248
Are you jealous?

645
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:03,580
Oscar! Who is this man?

646
01:19:03,581 --> 01:19:05,038
I'm his friend.

647
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,039
He's doing...
he's trying to fuck me.

648
01:19:40,498 --> 01:19:42,288
- Bruno!
- Hey, Oscar, my man!

649
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:44,622
- How's it going?
- I'm glad you could make it.

650
01:19:44,623 --> 01:19:49,623
Come on!

651
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:57,247
So I know you like MDMA, right?

652
01:19:57,248 --> 01:20:00,622
- Sure.
- You wanna try some of this?

653
01:20:00,623 --> 01:20:03,372
- Yeah. I can just take it?
- Sure.

654
01:20:03,373 --> 01:20:06,330
You can worry
about the price later.

655
01:20:06,331 --> 01:20:10,247
Straight from Amsterdam!
Real trippy shit, man.

656
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:12,622
Cool. Thanks, man.

657
01:20:12,623 --> 01:20:15,997
And I got what you wanted.

658
01:20:15,998 --> 01:20:19,997
I got you a little DMT.

659
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:22,705
Just light her up!

660
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:25,497
A bit longer, come on.
Real, real go for it.

661
01:20:25,498 --> 01:20:27,372
That's a boy!

662
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:28,788
Just... You wanna be careful.

663
01:20:28,789 --> 01:20:32,163
You might drop it and
you might fucking burn yourself.

664
01:20:32,164 --> 01:20:35,580
So if you want...
I can help you out the next time.

665
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:40,581
I can hold it for you.

666
01:20:52,373 --> 01:20:55,288
Hey-
- HEY-

667
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:58,455
What are you doing here?

668
01:20:58,456 --> 01:21:00,622
I just came to see you.

669
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:05,623
You're fucking crazy.
Get off!

670
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:09,913
- Hello, Oscar! How are you?
- Hey! I'm fine.

671
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:11,663
Hey, darling!
Do you want to see what's on TV?

672
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:16,664
- Good.
- Let's go.

673
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,872
Hey! I brought your stuff.

674
01:21:19,873 --> 01:21:24,873
Okay, let's go to your place.

675
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:40,956
I don't know why
I'm paying you for this shit.

676
01:21:49,331 --> 01:21:54,331
Have you slept with my mother?

677
01:21:56,498 --> 01:22:01,498
What are you talking about?

678
01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:06,789
Have you fucked my mum?

679
01:22:13,414 --> 01:22:18,414
Yeah.

680
01:22:19,664 --> 01:22:23,205
Keep your fucking pills,
you piece of shit!

681
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:28,206
- You piece of fucking shit!
- Victor!

682
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:33,955
Victor!

683
01:22:33,956 --> 01:22:38,956
Shit!

684
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:43,330
Victor!

685
01:22:43,331 --> 01:22:47,413
Victor!

686
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:52,414
Victor!

687
01:22:58,956 --> 01:23:03,956
Victor!

688
01:23:08,706 --> 01:23:13,706
Victor, call me back.

689
01:23:17,914 --> 01:23:20,038
- Hello?
- Oscar, <i>it's Suzy.</i>

690
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:22,913
<i>Victor didn't come home last night.</i>
Do you know Where he is?

691
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:23,705
No.

692
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:28,706
<i>Will you call me if you</i>
hear from him, please?

693
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,330
What did you dream about, Oscar?

694
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:48,331
Do you remember the pact we made?

695
01:23:48,956 --> 01:23:53,956
Kind of.

696
01:23:58,164 --> 01:24:03,038
We promised
to never leave each other.

697
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,747
No matter what.

698
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:12,288
Never ever?

699
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:17,289
Never ever.

700
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:33,331
I got into a fight
with Victor last night.

701
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:42,038
You want a trip?

702
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:47,039
Are you sick?

703
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:09,414
Linda!

704
01:25:15,956 --> 01:25:20,956
I wonder what Tokyo
looks like from up there.

705
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:27,372
I don't.

706
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:30,205
Why not?

707
01:25:30,206 --> 01:25:34,205
I'd be scared.

708
01:25:34,206 --> 01:25:38,622
Scared of what?

709
01:25:38,623 --> 01:25:43,623
Or dying-

710
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:32,498
<i>Oscar, it's Victor....</i>

711
01:26:38,956 --> 01:26:43,205
I have to bring this shit to Victor.
You wanna come?

712
01:26:43,206 --> 01:26:48,206
Sure.

713
01:26:48,456 --> 01:26:53,456
By the way,
have you read the Book of the Dead?

714
01:27:14,164 --> 01:27:19,164
I'm sorry...

715
01:27:22,248 --> 01:27:27,248
Open the door! Police!

716
01:35:22,414 --> 01:35:25,663
Don't worry!
I'm burning his stash now.

717
01:35:25,664 --> 01:35:29,122
Yeah, everything...

718
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:34,123
gone.

719
01:35:34,206 --> 01:35:36,497
They're fucking assholes.

720
01:35:36,498 --> 01:35:38,538
First they said he had a gun

721
01:35:38,539 --> 01:35:43,539
and now they won't even
take a fucking autopsy.

722
01:35:44,456 --> 01:35:49,456
I can't believe this is real.

723
01:35:49,539 --> 01:35:54,539
Fuck!

724
01:36:28,373 --> 01:36:33,373
The police is still here.
They are looking for Alex.

725
01:37:22,873 --> 01:37:24,913
You're Alex's friend, right?

726
01:37:24,914 --> 01:37:26,997
Tell us about him.

727
01:37:26,998 --> 01:37:29,122
I'm asking you, say something!

728
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:30,580
- I don't know anything.
- Yes, you do!

729
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,455
Don't lie!

730
01:37:32,456 --> 01:37:36,372
I can smell when people lie.

731
01:37:36,373 --> 01:37:39,288
And if you can help us,
we can help you out.

732
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:42,288
We can help you
to get out of this situation.

733
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:44,580
If you don't, you go to jail.

734
01:37:44,581 --> 01:37:46,413
And you don't want to go there.

735
01:37:46,414 --> 01:37:48,372
So, tell us about your friend Alex.

736
01:37:48,373 --> 01:37:52,997
We know that he knows
the main supplier.

737
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:57,998
Say something!

738
01:39:19,289 --> 01:39:21,372
What did he say?

739
01:39:21,373 --> 01:39:23,705
They say
Linda's brother had a friend

740
01:39:23,706 --> 01:39:26,288
who attacked one of the officers,

741
01:39:26,289 --> 01:39:31,289
and they want us
to let them know any information.

742
01:40:38,914 --> 01:40:43,080
It's in Japanese.
I can't read it!

743
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:48,081
Come on! I can do it for you.

744
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:48,039
It's positive, isn't it?

745
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:13,623
Yes, it's positive.

746
01:45:05,873 --> 01:45:08,622
- You all right?
- Oh, man!

747
01:45:08,623 --> 01:45:13,455
You're sweating a lot.

748
01:45:13,456 --> 01:45:15,163
So?

749
01:45:15,164 --> 01:45:18,330
You mean I can't get
any coke from you?

750
01:45:18,331 --> 01:45:21,788
No. I got rid of my entire stash.

751
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:26,789
How do I know Oscar didn't give
my name to that slime bag Victor.

752
01:45:48,456 --> 01:45:51,330
- It's your fault!
- Who made the call?

753
01:45:51,331 --> 01:45:53,372
I didn't call the fucking bastards.

754
01:45:53,373 --> 01:45:55,330
You called them!

755
01:45:55,331 --> 01:45:58,663
- You get the fuck off me!
- Hey, we're a family here...

756
01:45:58,664 --> 01:46:01,288
- Stop it!
- I'm so fucking ashamed of you!

757
01:46:01,289 --> 01:46:03,122
You know, my mother is a bitch!

758
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:05,122
Don't talk of your mother like this!

759
01:46:05,123 --> 01:46:07,622
You idiot!
She fucked my best friend,

760
01:46:07,623 --> 01:46:09,413
and you think you can play
the man of the house?!

761
01:46:09,414 --> 01:46:13,330
- I'm still the man of this house!
- You're not the man of this house!

762
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:17,205
Now get out!

763
01:46:17,206 --> 01:46:18,288
Get out!

764
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:20,872
- Go fuck yourselves!
- Go fuck yourself!

765
01:46:20,873 --> 01:46:23,163
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think YOU'RE doing?

766
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:25,997
You tell your son
he's a fucking psycho!

767
01:46:25,998 --> 01:46:29,372
I fucking despise you!

768
01:46:29,373 --> 01:46:34,373
I fucking hate you!

769
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:09,788
Don't you see
she's just using you?

770
01:49:09,789 --> 01:49:12,455
No.

771
01:49:12,456 --> 01:49:15,205
That's not the point.

772
01:49:15,206 --> 01:49:20,206
It's just that I like Linda.

773
01:49:23,373 --> 01:49:28,373
She even wants
to have a baby with me.

774
01:49:45,373 --> 01:49:50,373
- Hi.
- Hey.

775
01:49:52,123 --> 01:49:57,123
Hey, are you okay?

776
01:53:27,164 --> 01:53:30,413
No, man, I'm not okay.
I'm in deep shit.

777
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:33,205
Look, can you do me a big favour?

778
01:53:33,206 --> 01:53:37,372
Can you go to my place
and speak to my roommate?

779
01:53:37,373 --> 01:53:41,247
Yeah, I need some money.

780
01:53:41,248 --> 01:53:45,205
Yeah, he knows where it is.

781
01:53:45,206 --> 01:53:48,205
And I need a jacket as well.

782
01:53:48,206 --> 01:53:53,206
I'm freezing!

783
01:54:00,206 --> 01:54:04,872
No, don't call him!
You go to my place.

784
01:54:04,873 --> 01:54:09,873
I'm sure the cops
are tapping our phones.

785
01:54:14,164 --> 01:54:19,164
Okay, look, I'll call you later and
I'll give you a place for the meeting.

786
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:22,663
All right.

787
01:54:22,664 --> 01:54:27,664
All right. Ciao.

788
01:55:39,498 --> 01:55:44,498
Mario is just a good fuck.

789
01:55:45,873 --> 01:55:50,873
I should have
listened to my brother.

790
01:55:51,456 --> 01:55:56,456
I should have been with Alex.

791
01:55:57,748 --> 01:56:02,748
I really liked him.

792
01:56:03,414 --> 01:56:08,414
Actually,
he contacted us, you know?

793
01:56:09,206 --> 01:56:12,122
- What did he say?
- He's okay.

794
01:56:12,123 --> 01:56:17,123
That's all we can say.

795
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:57,331
Why did you bring me here?

796
01:59:58,081 --> 02:00:03,081
The manager isn't happy
with your dance.

797
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:10,788
We can't keep you anymore.

798
02:00:10,789 --> 02:00:14,538
But what am I gonna do?

799
02:00:14,539 --> 02:00:17,997
I'm not your daddy.

800
02:00:17,998 --> 02:00:22,998
But I could take care of you.

801
02:00:26,248 --> 02:00:31,247
Are you listening?

802
02:00:31,248 --> 02:00:33,538
I would have already
committed suicide

803
02:00:33,539 --> 02:00:38,163
if I didn't have this sensation

804
02:00:38,164 --> 02:00:43,164
that Oscar is somewhere around me.

805
02:00:43,706 --> 02:00:48,706
I wish he could come back to life.

806
02:00:52,164 --> 02:00:57,164
Stop hurting yourself!

807
02:00:57,498 --> 02:01:00,330
I know that it's hard to admit.

808
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:05,331
But dead... is dead.

809
02:02:46,289 --> 02:02:51,289
Please let us know
if gets his speech back.

810
02:03:18,331 --> 02:03:23,331
That thing is not my brother.

811
02:03:24,706 --> 02:03:28,663
He's obviously not like he was.

812
02:03:28,664 --> 02:03:30,955
That thing is fucking disgusting!

813
02:03:30,956 --> 02:03:33,705
Shut up!

814
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:38,706
So, have you two decided
where we're going?

815
02:03:43,373 --> 02:03:48,373
Have you two decided
where the fuck we're going?

816
02:03:49,456 --> 02:03:50,788
So?

817
02:03:50,789 --> 02:03:55,789
There's no way
I could put up with him.

818
02:04:03,539 --> 02:04:08,539
Don't fucking touch me!

819
02:04:10,414 --> 02:04:15,414
Fuck!

820
02:04:15,498 --> 02:04:20,498
Let's get the fuck out of here!

821
02:04:28,706 --> 02:04:30,872
Hey, wake up!

822
02:04:30,873 --> 02:04:35,873
Hey! Hey, wake!

823
02:04:40,498 --> 02:04:45,498
Hey!

824
02:06:32,914 --> 02:06:37,163
They burnt you, didn't they?

825
02:06:37,164 --> 02:06:42,164
They burnt you, didn't they?

826
02:06:42,373 --> 02:06:47,373
They torched you!

827
02:06:50,581 --> 02:06:53,913
They torched you!
Come on! Think about it!

828
02:06:53,914 --> 02:06:56,038
Close your eyes
and think about it!

829
02:06:56,039 --> 02:06:58,663
If you're lucky,
you might find your ashes.

830
02:06:58,664 --> 02:07:01,080
Go on, little cunt!

831
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:04,747
Go on! Close your eyes!
Think about it!

832
02:07:04,748 --> 02:07:09,748
Go on!

833
02:07:44,123 --> 02:07:48,997
- Mario?
- What?

834
02:07:48,998 --> 02:07:50,872
I had another dream

835
02:07:50,873 --> 02:07:55,873
where my brother
resuscitated from the morgue.

836
02:08:04,539 --> 02:08:09,539
I find it creepy
keeping his remains in that box.

837
02:08:11,748 --> 02:08:14,622
What are you gonna do?

838
02:08:14,623 --> 02:08:19,623
That's your fucking brother.

839
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:36,331
Those remains are not my brother.

840
02:08:37,706 --> 02:08:42,706
Do what you want.

841
02:09:02,498 --> 02:09:07,498
Goodbye.

842
02:10:59,164 --> 02:11:01,122
- Here you go.
- Thank you, man.

843
02:11:01,123 --> 02:11:03,122
- Are you okay?
- Oh...

844
02:11:03,123 --> 02:11:04,705
- Shit!
- Thanks.

845
02:11:04,706 --> 02:11:09,706
- You got cigarettes?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I do.

846
02:11:22,956 --> 02:11:24,913
Hey! I'm gonna need some money.

847
02:11:24,914 --> 02:11:27,955
Okay. I'll ask Linda to bring it
to you. She wants to see you.

848
02:11:27,956 --> 02:11:30,288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

849
02:11:30,289 --> 02:11:34,163
- Is she still with Mario?
- Yeah, I think.

850
02:11:34,164 --> 02:11:39,164
Fuck!

851
02:12:35,164 --> 02:12:40,164
What do you want?

852
02:12:42,123 --> 02:12:47,123
I wanna say sorry.

853
02:12:48,289 --> 02:12:50,788
I wanna say sorry.

854
02:12:50,789 --> 02:12:52,538
I'm sorry.

855
02:12:52,539 --> 02:12:55,122
That's what you came here to say?

856
02:12:55,123 --> 02:12:57,747
That you're sorry?

857
02:12:57,748 --> 02:12:59,163
- Yes.
- Really?

858
02:12:59,164 --> 02:13:04,164
Yes.

859
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:09,872
Why don't you
go make yourself useful...

860
02:13:09,873 --> 02:13:14,247
and go kill yourself.

861
02:13:14,248 --> 02:13:16,455
Yeah.

862
02:13:16,456 --> 02:13:21,456
Why don't you go and make yourself
useful and fucking go kill yourself!

863
02:13:21,706 --> 02:13:23,997
You don't mean that.

864
02:13:23,998 --> 02:13:27,913
- I do.
- You don't understand.

865
02:13:27,914 --> 02:13:31,455
I mean, it's partly my fault.
Listen...

866
02:13:31,456 --> 02:13:33,663
For me and Oscar!

867
02:13:33,664 --> 02:13:37,538
Go fucking kill yourself!

868
02:13:37,539 --> 02:13:40,455
- No, you don't understand.
- You piece of shit!

869
02:13:40,456 --> 02:13:43,080
But Oscar started dealing drugs

870
02:13:43,081 --> 02:13:45,288
because you were with
all these sleazy people.

871
02:13:45,289 --> 02:13:48,122
Because it's me?!
Because it's my fucking fault?

872
02:13:48,123 --> 02:13:51,330
You piece of shit!
Get the fuck out of here!

873
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:53,372
I hate you!

874
02:13:53,373 --> 02:13:57,455
I hate you!

875
02:13:57,456 --> 02:13:59,372
FUCK you!

876
02:13:59,373 --> 02:14:04,373
FUCK you!

877
02:14:05,498 --> 02:14:08,997
You piece of shit!
Because it's my fault?

878
02:14:08,998 --> 02:14:13,497
Get the fuck out of my house!
Fuck you!

879
02:14:13,498 --> 02:14:18,498
FUCK you!

880
02:14:19,206 --> 02:14:21,372
I fucking hate you,
you piece of shit!

881
02:14:21,373 --> 02:14:23,330
It's my fault?

882
02:14:23,331 --> 02:14:28,038
My fault? Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of my house!

883
02:14:28,039 --> 02:14:30,997
Get the fuck out of my house!

884
02:14:30,998 --> 02:14:35,663
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

885
02:14:35,664 --> 02:14:37,247
Fuck!

886
02:14:37,248 --> 02:14:39,080
Fuck!

887
02:14:39,081 --> 02:14:44,081
I wanna fucking die!

888
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:48,122
Fuck!

889
02:14:48,123 --> 02:14:53,038
It's the fault of my brother
and his stupid fucking friends!

890
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:55,663
My life is fucked!

891
02:14:55,664 --> 02:14:58,163
My life is fucked!

892
02:14:58,164 --> 02:15:01,288
My life is fucked!

893
02:15:01,289 --> 02:15:06,289
Fucked!

894
02:15:11,539 --> 02:15:15,247
Calm down!

895
02:15:15,248 --> 02:15:17,372
Calm down!

896
02:15:17,373 --> 02:15:22,372
I don't wanna be here!

897
02:15:22,373 --> 02:15:26,997
I don't wanna be here
with these fucking evil...

898
02:15:26,998 --> 02:15:30,455
evil fucking people!

899
02:15:30,456 --> 02:15:35,456
They're fucking evil!

900
02:15:39,789 --> 02:15:43,455
They're fucking evil!

901
02:15:43,456 --> 02:15:46,080
They're fucking...

902
02:15:46,081 --> 02:15:51,081
evil people.

903
02:15:53,289 --> 02:15:56,538
- I wanna be alone.
- It's okay.

904
02:15:56,539 --> 02:16:01,539
- I just wanna be alone.
- It's okay.

905
02:16:04,914 --> 02:16:08,372
I just wanna be alone.

906
02:16:08,373 --> 02:16:12,372
You people are evil!
Fuck off!

907
02:16:12,373 --> 02:16:17,373
Fuck off!

908
02:16:17,998 --> 02:16:22,998
I just wanna die!

909
02:19:41,081 --> 02:19:46,081
Oscar! Calm down.

910
02:20:31,664 --> 02:20:36,664
Hey!

911
02:20:40,789 --> 02:20:45,789
- Hey! Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

912
02:20:50,748 --> 02:20:52,747
How have you been?

913
02:20:52,748 --> 02:20:57,748
I've been better.

914
02:20:58,414 --> 02:21:03,414
Me too.

915
02:21:06,206 --> 02:21:08,747
I'm sorry about your brother.

916
02:21:08,748 --> 02:21:13,748
It's okay.

917
02:21:23,248 --> 02:21:28,248
Watch out!

918
02:21:34,331 --> 02:21:39,331
No! No! No!

919
02:21:39,789 --> 02:21:43,788
No!

920
02:21:43,789 --> 02:21:47,663
Daddy! Mommy!

921
02:21:47,664 --> 02:21:50,247
Daddy! Mommy!

922
02:21:50,248 --> 02:21:52,997
No!

923
02:21:52,998 --> 02:21:57,622
No! No!

924
02:21:57,623 --> 02:22:01,580
No! No! No!

925
02:22:01,581 --> 02:22:06,581
Mommy! Daddy!

926
02:30:54,873 --> 02:30:59,873
Come!

927
02:31:02,081 --> 02:31:07,081
Come!

928
02:31:09,748 --> 02:31:14,748
Come!

929
02:31:46,373 --> 02:31:51,373
Linda!

930
02:33:24,039 --> 02:33:29,039
Come!

931
02:35:10,289 --> 02:35:15,289
Come!

932
02:35:37,623 --> 02:35:41,372
Come!

933
02:35:41,373 --> 02:35:41,372
Come inside me!
