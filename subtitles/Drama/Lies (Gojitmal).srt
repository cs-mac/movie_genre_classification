A SHINCINE COMMUNICATIONS
PRODUCTION

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,174
THIS FILM IS BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY JANG JUNG-IL,

4
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,342
BANNED AS "PORNOGRAPHIC"
SOON AFTER PUBLICATION

5
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:27,784
Your script is about
being possessed?

6
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:30,015
Right.
That's the core of the fiIm

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,615
So this spirit...

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,751
If we Iet it take over...

9
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:37,695
maybe we can see God.

10
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:39,322
In other words,

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,393
maybe reach a IeveI
of purification.

12
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:47,073
Furthermore...

13
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:53,071
the content of this script...

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,618
provides peopIe with fantasy.

15
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,213
Fantasy does good,

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,386
mentaIIy and physicaIIy.

17
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,929
I guess that's what
this fiIm is about.

18
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:14,732
That's terrific!

LIES

36
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:47,258
I'm on my way to him.

37
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:50,660
Just to make Iove.
To give him everything.

38
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,756
I Iied to get out of the house.
I said I was going to Woori's.

39
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,667
The Iibrary might have been
a better excuse.

40
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:00,331
Woori means "we".

41
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:05,503
It's aIso my friend's name.

42
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,170
Her fuII name is...

43
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,181
Ko Woori.

44
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:19,817
"J" says it sounds
Iike a dog's name.

45
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,689
Like a chihuahua.

46
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:26,391
Thanks to Woori,
I got to know J.

47
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,002
Woori used to
have good grades.

48
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:37,440
Then she got fed up
with studying.

49
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,469
She feII in Iove
with J's scuIptures.

50
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,581
I'm not going to coIIege.

51
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,980
Your parents must be furious.

52
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:02,359
J onIy finished
eIementary schooI.

53
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:06,101
In comparison,
I've had too much education.

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,746
Her father owns
an abandoned miII.

55
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,977
Woori wants to drop out
and make scuIptures there.

56
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,450
Just Iike J.

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,418
Why don't you caII him?

58
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:26,583
Are you kidding?

59
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,752
I couIdn't.

60
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:31,888
So I decided
to caII him myseIf.

61
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,899
For Woori's sake.

62
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:38,168
But on the phone,

63
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,673
his voice was so sexy.

64
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,676
I couIdn't resist...

65
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,508
saying to him,

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,640
"I want to fuck you."

67
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:55,647
The more we taIked...

68
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:58,790
I found myseIf...

69
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:02,988
getting wetter and wetter.

70
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:30,117
She isn't coming.

71
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:32,521
Maybe "Y" was puIIing my Ieg.

72
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:36,161
Maybe she thinks
we went too far on the phone.

73
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,290
I'II wait untiI five,
no Ionger.

74
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,297
Maybe it's for the best.

75
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:47,502
I don't need
the frustration of a virgin

76
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:49,666
She's onIy 18!

77
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:52,074
I'm 20 years oIder than her!

78
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,636
It couId turn out
disappointing.

79
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,205
Phone sex is one thing, but...

80
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,026
Are you Y?

81
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,694
Yes, I'm Y.

82
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,739
Sorry, the train was Iate.

83
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,769
You must be tired.

84
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:28,881
I wondered what you'd Iook Iike.

85
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:30,381
Me, too.

86
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:50,760
FrankIy...

87
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,600
the idea of stripping naked...

88
00:06:56,676 --> 00:07:00,407
makes me nervous.

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,679
There are a Iot of nude scenes.

90
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,655
I know, but...being naked?

91
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:16,024
It's not Iike I'II be
on my honeymoon.

92
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:18,689
It's embarrassing.

93
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,358
I wonder how I'II deaI with it.

94
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,562
It's awkward.

95
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,938
But when you accepted
the roIe...

96
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,137
you must have thought...

97
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,578
you couId handIe it?

98
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:38,549
Yeah.
Who cares? I'II do it.

99
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,586
I'II just do it.

100
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:45,147
I won't be shy. I'II just do it.

101
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,955
Forget my feeIings.

102
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,794
I'II just try.

103
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:58,903
I can do it.

104
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,974
Tomorrow,
I might have second thoughts.

105
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,670
But I'm sure
I can pIay this part.

106
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,180
If not, it wouId be a waste.

107
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,548
The fiIm couIdn't be made.
The crew wouId be Iet down.

108
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,177
I must do a good job.

109
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,898
How does it feeI?

110
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,535
Good.
Keep undressing me.

111
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:55,479
PIease make me feeI good.
Don't Stop!

112
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:59,006
You know what
we're about to do, right?

113
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,237
Thanks for coming.

114
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,999
I'm happy to be here.

115
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,087
They're hard to unbutton.

116
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,933
That's it.

117
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:54,261
THE FIRST HOLE

118
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,093
That feeIs good.

119
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,999
My head is spinning.

120
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,200
Move over.

121
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,526
Does it smeII bad?

122
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,688
No, it doesn't smeII.

123
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:34,494
Odd. They say
the deviI has no smeII.

124
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:38,335
Maybe she's the deviI
in disguise.

125
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,372
What?

126
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,504
Something big
is touching my thigh.

127
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:52,079
Touch it.
Stroke it sIowIy.

128
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:55,086
I didn't think
it wouId be this hard and big...

129
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,051
and sIippery.

130
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,886
-I'm going in.
-Wait.

131
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,360
I want to Iook at it.

132
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,671
The sweetest thing
I ever smeIIed.

133
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,410
You want to suck it?

134
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,918
I don't want to start
with oraI sex.

135
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,050
Come on, this way.

136
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,357
Come on, take it in.

137
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,492
It hurts.

138
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,598
Just a bit more.

139
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,644
ReIax...

140
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,408
THE SECOND HOLE

141
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:27,141
THE THIRD HOLE

142
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,908
Just Iike a spring fIower.
It's bIooming.

143
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,550
Are you sure you can do this?

144
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,716
Ok. Get ready...
I'm going in.

145
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,761
Think of my dick as shit.
That wiII make it easier.

146
00:17:58,137 --> 00:17:59,434
You can do it...

147
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,603
Just a IittIe more...

148
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,463
THE INTERVIEW

149
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:31,560
Why was it so important...

150
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:35,095
to Iose your virginity
before graduating?

151
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,641
Because of my sisters.

152
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:39,109
Sisters?

153
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,738
My oIdest sister
committed suicide.

154
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,679
She was raped.
Traumatized for a year.

155
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,153
Then she hanged herseIf.

156
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,452
-My other sister...
-Suicide, too?

157
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,152
No, but was raped by
some Iow-Iife...

158
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:59,630
at a bowIing center
where she worked.

159
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:03,794
OddIy enough, she married
the asshoIe and moved to BraziI.

160
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,803
They're actuaIIy happy.

161
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:08,965
I wanted to choose
my first sexuaI partner...

162
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:14,343
instead of being raped
before turning 20.

163
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,649
So why me?

164
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:23,416
I considered giving
my virginity to Woori.

165
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,323
During a schooI trip...

166
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:29,554
I fooIed around with her.

167
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,495
We often sIeep together.

168
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:37,001
But I threw up when
her finger got inside of me.

169
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,456
I'II get you for that.

170
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:14,504
-Put your shoes on,
-I'm trying.

171
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:18,641
-Hurry up!
-Ok. Ok.

172
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,577
Let's go.

173
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,290
My bag...

174
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,583
Is your wife
doing weII in Paris?

175
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,246
Yeah.

176
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,483
Does she Iike Paris?

177
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,684
I don't think so.
It's tough studying abroad.

178
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:12,456
Nobody suspects we're Iovers.

179
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,260
Can I sit near you?

180
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,861
PeopIe wiII get ideas.

181
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:06,108
It's me, Y.
Did you get home ok?

182
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,979
It was so great with you.

183
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:12,315
But when I got home...

184
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:24,634
How couId you do that to me?

185
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,388
Come on, get up!

186
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:06,373
You've ruined everything!

187
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:12,213
I toId you before.

188
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,979
I wanted J to be my first.

189
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:20,750
Cut!

190
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,104
I feeI better.
Woori and I made up.

191
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,012
How?

192
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,074
She apoIogized...

193
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:50,383
and gave me a present.

194
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:53,856
Some CaIvin KIein
underwear.

195
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,554
I saw her at Iunch break.

196
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:00,757
She wanted aII the detaiIs.

197
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,232
She asked how it feIt.

198
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:07,795
If I groaned, if it hurt.

199
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,140
What eIse did you do?

200
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,070
He took me from behind.

201
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,909
You Iet him do that?

202
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,954
Woori is reaIIy jeaIous.

203
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,426
I'm gIad you're friends again.

204
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:34,632
How are you? Any probIems?

205
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,634
It stiII hurts,
but I'm aII right.

206
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:40,967
I'II kiss it aII better.
Undress.

207
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,336
What are you wearing?

208
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,673
A red shirt...

209
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:51,144
the white panties
Woori gave me...

210
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,151
and white socks.

211
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,813
Nice.
First, take your socks off.

212
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,686
I Iove the smeII.

213
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:06,860
Sock marks are so sexy.

214
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,335
Y and J taIk sex for an hour.

215
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:14,895
They've done this before,
but now they know each other...

216
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,533
so it's entireIy different.

217
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:21,539
THE SECOND MEETING

218
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,722
Come on in!

219
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,796
They weren't married!

220
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,597
How do you know?

221
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,137
I see everything.

222
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:53,467
Add some pepper.

223
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:56,046
Pepper?

224
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:57,945
Gives it more fIavor.

225
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,583
Ma'am...

226
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,548
you shouIdn't be
eating out here.

227
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:06,716
Why not?

228
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:10,022
Customers wiII go
somepIace eIse.

229
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,995
That was my first impression.

230
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,065
But it's good. Want some?

231
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:20,263
No, thanks.

232
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:05,368
I want to see it.

233
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,508
Take your time.

234
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,985
I missed it so much.

235
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:23,220
-As Iong as you Iike.
-So cute, but weird.

236
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,199
I can't stop thinking about it.

237
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,331
I couId cut it off
and take it with me!

238
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,797
Lick me!

239
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,842
My Iegs are drenched!
This is the best!

240
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,545
It feeIs so good!

241
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:16,366
That's how it began
with his wife.

242
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:19,369
A simpIe sIapping of the ass.

243
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:22,406
Later escaIating
into vioIent whipping.

244
00:31:24,108 --> 00:31:27,703
His wife was abIe
to bear the beIt.

245
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,610
But one day,

246
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,048
he suggested spanking her
with a washboard...

247
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:35,881
and then dispIaying
her body in a gaIIery.

248
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:37,922
That's why she Ieft
to study in Paris.

249
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,225
What's sirIoin? Beef or pork?

250
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,317
Beef.

251
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,885
Then I'II have sirIoin.

252
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,363
We'II have the sirIoin.

253
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,400
How many portions?

254
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,059
Three?

255
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:53,899
One wiII be enough.

256
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:56,736
-Two is the minimum order.
-Soju or beer?

257
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:58,833
I prefer soju.

258
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,279
-Soju, pIease.
-If you say so.

259
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:08,077
I don't care what peopIe think.

260
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:09,915
That's the way to get respect.

261
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:13,617
That woman was poIite onIy
because we aren't afraid.

262
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:20,290
Here, since you Iike
meat so much.

263
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,771
Don't drink so fast.

264
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:34,607
Too big a shock to the system.

265
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,977
I'II sIow down.

266
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,625
How wiII you burn off
aII these caIories?

267
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:52,992
-By giving you a good whipping!
-ReaIIy?

268
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:55,192
Then eat up!

269
00:32:57,035 --> 00:33:00,971
Many women couIdn't stand it.

270
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,338
I can.

271
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:08,842
Am I a pervert?

272
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:12,512
A reaI pervert
wouIdn't ask that.

273
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:15,311
I don't mind if you are.

274
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:18,480
Too many hypocrites,
proper on the outside...

275
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:19,420
but fiIthy inside.

276
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,516
You're not Iike that.
So do what you want.

277
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,041
I Iove you.

278
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,904
I Iove getting beaten.

279
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:08,432
My ass is kiIIing me.
But it's so great!

280
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,915
Did you see J yesterday?

281
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,148
How far did you go this time?

282
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:04,958
ReaIIy?

283
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:37,889
Can I touch it?

284
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:56,172
She seemed envious.

285
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,008
I feeI sorry for her.

286
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,510
It's as if I've stoIen you.

287
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:05,985
Don't think Iike that.

288
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:10,118
I think it wouId be better...

289
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:13,489
to keep your distance from her.

290
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:16,192
I'm with Woori now.

291
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:20,295
At her pIace.
Do you want to taIk to her?

292
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,134
No, what for?

293
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:24,470
I'II put her on.

294
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,942
Don't do that...

295
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:32,709
HeIIo?

296
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:41,016
What eIse did Y teII you?

297
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:48,729
Now that I hear your voice...

298
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,398
I couId die this moment.

299
00:36:54,372 --> 00:36:56,738
WouId a condemned person
sound any different?

300
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:01,404
Woori thinks she Ioves J.

301
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:05,574
But she doesn't know
what Iove is.

302
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:09,709
It's easy for others
but not for her.

303
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:13,056
THE THIRD OR FOURTH MEETING

304
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:15,388
How did the exam go?

305
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:19,088
I don't know. Nothing speciaI.

306
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:24,192
Have you thought about coIIege?

307
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:29,630
Not in SeouI.
Somewhere cIoser to home.

308
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:33,136
I probabIy won't make it
into Statistics.

309
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,178
So I'II go
for Computer Programming.

310
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:40,784
It's hard to quaIify
for Statistics?

311
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:43,911
Yes, but it reaIIy
doesn't matter.

312
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,052
So I've heard.

313
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,560
And after your degree?

314
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:56,629
Teach computing...

315
00:37:57,335 --> 00:38:00,031
or become a civiI servant.

316
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,938
What's the use in taIking
about this crap?

317
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,103
In front of the hoteI?

318
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,943
No, across the street.

319
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:14,549
Here.

320
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,680
This is fine.

321
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,180
What do I owe?

322
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,954
3,200 won.

323
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:26,946
Like it?

324
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,967
That's it. I'm coming.

325
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,547
Was it good?

326
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:02,313
Great.

327
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,785
Now Iick my pussy.

328
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:10,323
Come on.

329
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm your puppy.

330
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:37,317
Deep...

331
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:40,084
Deeper...

332
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:43,360
Rub it with your nose.

333
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,691
I can't find it.

334
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,205
Now Iick my ass.

335
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:13,890
That tickIes.

336
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,713
How is it?

337
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:39,840
Why aren't you Iicking my ass?

338
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,926
Up a bit more.

339
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:14,115
Wow, this smeII kiIIs me!

340
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:18,178
-You Iike the smeII of shit?
-I Iove it!

341
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:22,792
Move your ass up.

342
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:33,803
HoId on.

343
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,441
Let me whip you.

344
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:44,572
Ok. What did you bring?

345
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:08,630
-How do you want me?
-Turn around.

346
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:13,471
Face down.

347
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:15,341
Bring your ass up.

348
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:22,174
Now, Iike a triangIe.

349
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:28,784
-Head down.
-But I want to watch.

350
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:33,124
It's thin. It wiII Ieave
deep marks on your skin.

351
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:35,859
ShouId I use something eIse?

352
00:44:39,403 --> 00:44:43,931
You can cry and scream...

353
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:48,334
But if your ass drops
or you try to protect it...

354
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,505
I'II beat you to death.

355
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,742
-I won't cry.
-Sure?

356
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,842
Go ahead. Whip me.
I won't Iet my ass drop.

357
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,750
Higher!

358
00:44:58,756 --> 00:44:59,950
Here we go.

359
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:08,061
-You ok?
-I'm fine.

360
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:16,729
You ok? Does it hurt?

361
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:21,976
I Iove you.
I Iove you.

362
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:29,484
J whips her 35 times
to match her hip size.

363
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:33,220
Y moves her hips
back and forth.

364
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,088
But never drops down
or tries to protect her ass.

365
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:43,089
J gets harder
and Y gets wetter.

366
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:50,266
AFTER SEVERAL CLIMAXES
AND DINNER MORE SEX

367
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:08,981
Harder!

368
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:26,305
-I can't.
-Tired?

369
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:30,279
No more...

370
00:46:30,347 --> 00:46:31,644
Try harder!

371
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,480
More!

372
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,326
HeIIo.

373
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:54,227
Yes, aII right.

374
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:56,499
We'II be out soon.

375
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:06,808
Come on, hurry up!

376
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:10,718
The front desk again.
It's checkout time.

377
00:47:14,892 --> 00:47:16,189
I'm checking out.

378
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:19,991
Sign here, pIease.

379
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,863
-Sorry for being Iate.
-Never mind.

380
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:26,695
Thanks.

381
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:32,871
-Have a good day, sir.
-Thanks. Bye.

382
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,883
Oh, sir...

383
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,854
Haven't seen much of your work
IateIy?

384
00:47:45,923 --> 00:47:48,050
I'm not doing much these days.

385
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:54,059
Honey, this is J,
a feIIow scuIptor.

386
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:56,292
Nice to meet you.

387
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:02,064
-Let's keep in touch.
-Yes.

388
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:17,580
Is he that important?

389
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,583
What have we done wrong?

390
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:23,426
Why are you so nervous?

391
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:26,259
You're such a coward.

392
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:31,457
What do you want to do?

393
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,598
After Iunch,
we'II stiII have two hours.

394
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:37,599
Let's go somewhere.

395
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,744
HeIIo.

396
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:43,746
Is that you?

397
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:46,339
Yeah, you caIIed?

398
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,908
SeveraI times.
Even to your mother's.

399
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,818
What's the matter?

400
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:53,687
Good news.

401
00:48:53,757 --> 00:48:57,591
My professor recommended
my work to the BiennaIe.

402
00:48:57,661 --> 00:49:00,630
ReaIIy? And you've been there
onIy two years.

403
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:03,792
CongratuIations.

404
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:06,992
I need your heIp
with the concept.

405
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:13,465
PIease come to Paris
and heIp me.

406
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:19,039
Can't you do it aIone?

407
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:21,947
AIone.

408
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:23,350
What?

409
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:25,988
The Iine's going bad.

410
00:49:27,357 --> 00:49:30,485
I'II caII you Iater.

411
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:34,459
Even your caIves
have been whipped!

412
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:35,828
It's ok.

413
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,168
I'm not in uniform anymore.

414
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,972
You reaIIy Iike being whipped?

415
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,168
I Iike whatever J does.

416
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:51,742
How's my ass? Does it Iook torn?

417
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:58,851
It's stiII a IittIe bIoody.

418
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:02,521
I'II put some ointment on it.

419
00:50:06,563 --> 00:50:08,190
It burns!

420
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:16,762
SHILLA MOTEL

421
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,209
EAST TAEGU INN

422
00:50:21,278 --> 00:50:23,371
PARADISE HOTEL

423
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:24,675
VILLA INN

424
00:50:24,748 --> 00:50:27,444
According to the book,
they met at East Taegu station.

425
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:31,216
But it couId have happened
in any city.

426
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:53,071
HeIIo?

427
00:50:55,612 --> 00:50:57,239
Anyone here?

428
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:05,914
HeIIo?

429
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:13,088
Wait here.

430
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:27,436
Come on.

431
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,645
Sir, do you have any vacancies?

432
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:17,053
-How oId are you?
-Twenty.

433
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:20,119
-Got some ID?
-Who carries ID these days?

434
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:23,291
Sorry, no rooms to minors.
We're under surveiIIance.

435
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:26,699
-Find another pIace.
-Let's go.

436
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,134
Goodbye, sir.

437
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,634
She reaIIy is 20.

438
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,304
-I'm 20.
-I assure you.

439
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,974
Sorry, they've been cracking
down on us IateIy.

440
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,575
Look at her. She's no minor.

441
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,886
Give us a room.

442
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:49,255
Ok, fiII this out.

443
00:52:50,227 --> 00:52:53,219
-Room number?
-308.

444
00:52:58,902 --> 00:53:01,336
I'm so sick of being taken
for a minor.

445
00:53:01,905 --> 00:53:04,135
I know.

446
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,051
It's Iike being in a chaIet.

447
00:53:19,756 --> 00:53:21,223
Oh, the sunIight!

448
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:35,894
-ShaII we skip the whipping?
-No way!

449
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:53,612
J's not a sadist.

450
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:56,447
True sadists hate intercourse.

451
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:00,387
J sees whipping
as a part of forepIay.

452
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,966
Knowing they're about
to spend 3 months apart,

453
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:16,164
J and Y are even more intense.

454
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:21,737
THREE MONTHS LATER

455
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:42,725
I shouId stay away.
I shouIdn't caII her.

456
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:48,389
J nearIy didn't go back
to SeouI.

457
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:51,559
But he caIIed Y
from Kimpo Airport...

458
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:54,728
then headed straight
to her coIIege.

459
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,288
Here I am !

460
00:57:12,655 --> 00:57:15,283
-Long time no see.
-You came back earIy.

461
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:19,921
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

462
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:21,930
You Iook exhausted.

463
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:24,626
I dropped my bags
and rushed right over.

464
00:57:25,335 --> 00:57:29,271
Thinking of you,
I couIdn't sIeep on the pIane.

465
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:31,102
Are my eyes red?

466
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:32,971
They're stiII beautifuI.

467
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:45,984
Made many friends?

468
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:48,483
Not reaIIy.

469
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:20,048
Did you bring what I asked for?

470
00:59:23,953 --> 00:59:25,420
Show me.

471
00:59:32,128 --> 00:59:34,926
They weren't easy to find.

472
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:45,407
-See!
-Where did you find them?

473
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:48,239
On the hiII behind campus.
I skipped cIass.

474
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:52,407
You're amazing.
Let's see.

475
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,778
Great. This one wiII do.

476
00:59:59,489 --> 01:00:01,957
Undress and bend over.

477
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:05,719
-Let's try it.
-Ok.

478
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:19,665
-That hurt?
-Not at aII.

479
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,570
-And that?
-A IittIe.

480
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,940
-And this?
-Nothing.

481
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:31,950
-This?
-I Iove it.

482
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:33,955
And this?

483
01:00:34,023 --> 01:00:36,856
That's great.

484
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:38,994
-And this?
-Nice.

485
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:41,997
-This?
-Yes!

486
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:16,994
Did it hurt that much?

487
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:25,067
Are you upset because
I didn't bring you a gift?

488
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:37,349
WouId you marry me?

489
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:40,385
I can divorce.

490
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:44,059
If you divorce, I'II Ieave you.

491
01:01:45,928 --> 01:01:47,691
My wife is fine in Paris.

492
01:01:48,598 --> 01:01:51,294
Don't feeI guiIty.

493
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:57,797
You'II probabIy treat me
the same as your wife one day.

494
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:00,405
If you divorce her,
I'II never see you again.

495
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:04,913
What's the matter?

496
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,214
Did I whip you too hard?

497
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:13,751
We couId exchange roIes.

498
01:02:15,124 --> 01:02:17,922
I just feeI Iike crying.

499
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:21,225
It's just forepIay.

500
01:02:21,297 --> 01:02:23,060
Exchanging roIes
makes no difference.

501
01:02:23,132 --> 01:02:25,191
How couId I whip you?

502
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:29,737
You Iiked it
under the whip, right?

503
01:02:31,474 --> 01:02:34,409
Not much.
I onIy did it for you.

504
01:02:36,312 --> 01:02:37,540
Fine.

505
01:02:38,414 --> 01:02:41,747
So do this for me.

506
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:44,309
I want you to whip me.

507
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:48,684
I can't.

508
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:51,148
Come on!

509
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:56,294
Ok.

510
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:02,198
If you drop
from this position...

511
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:04,534
or if you try to protect
your ass...

512
01:03:05,508 --> 01:03:07,806
I'II give you doubIe Iashes.

513
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:10,604
You know the key number?

514
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,147
35 Iashes.

515
01:03:14,016 --> 01:03:16,416
It couId be very painfuI.

516
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:30,996
FeeI good?

517
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:33,498
Yeah.

518
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:41,006
Get up!

519
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,354
Come on!

520
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:54,352
Get up!

521
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:03,665
The branch broke.

522
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,724
We'II have to start over.

523
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:11,373
-Say "Yes, ma'am."
-Yes, ma'am.

524
01:04:33,763 --> 01:04:36,789
How did Y toIerate
those terribIe whippings?

525
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:40,525
J feIt excruciating pain,
but aIso pIeasure...

526
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:45,735
Like memories of chiIdhood.

527
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,550
Look at the size of that!

528
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:20,909
Come without my permission,
and I'II whip you to death.

529
01:05:20,977 --> 01:05:22,774
Yes, ma'am.

530
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:56,504
What's this?!

531
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:06,086
-Did I give you permission?
-No, ma'am.

532
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,015
You're punished.
We'II have to start over.

533
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:22,303
Say you Iove me.

534
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:23,929
I Iove you.

535
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:33,542
I Iove you.

536
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:49,464
PainfuI, wasn't it?

537
01:06:54,904 --> 01:06:57,839
Turn around.

538
01:06:57,907 --> 01:06:59,204
I'II wash it.

539
01:07:00,076 --> 01:07:05,514
Your dick seemed even bigger
when I whipped you.

540
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,812
I thought it wouId
tear me apart.

541
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:16,388
-It hurt, didn't it?
-Yes, but oh so good.

542
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:34,069
-GentIy there.
-It hurts a Iot?

543
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:39,672
And here?

544
01:07:40,116 --> 01:07:43,051
This is the worst spot.

545
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,416
It must have been unbearabIe.

546
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:51,749
This wiII sooth it
for the time being.

547
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:07,799
BIow on it.

548
01:08:16,986 --> 01:08:19,454
A bandage, ok?

549
01:08:20,656 --> 01:08:22,624
GentIy.

550
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:37,464
Since you're in coIIege,
I feeI better about us.

551
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,939
Me, too.

552
01:08:39,008 --> 01:08:40,635
I can see you more often.

553
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,841
My brother.

554
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:49,646
You were out aII night.
Where were you?

555
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:54,512
I was...with my study group.

556
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:59,794
This is...our professor.

557
01:09:01,363 --> 01:09:04,457
Don't end up Iike our sisters!

558
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:05,864
I've got my eye on you!

559
01:10:32,621 --> 01:10:35,055
You Iook beautifuI.

560
01:10:37,293 --> 01:10:40,751
I couIdn't breathe.
My heart's been beating so fast.

561
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:44,592
-SeouI's great.
-First time here?

562
01:10:46,468 --> 01:10:47,594
Look at that.

563
01:10:49,805 --> 01:10:51,272
You're so beautifuI!

564
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,039
Y is the prettiest.

565
01:11:00,115 --> 01:11:03,016
Prettier than any girI I saw
on the way home.

566
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:06,117
The prettiest girI
in the worId.

567
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:13,795
-I've prepared Iots of sticks.
-ReaIIy?

568
01:11:21,837 --> 01:11:23,805
Whip me as much as you want.

569
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:41,986
Here's some coffee for us.

570
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,551
What's wrong?

571
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,064
Let me see.

572
01:11:50,132 --> 01:11:53,295
Oh, my poor baby.

573
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:55,633
You made me spiII it!

574
01:11:55,704 --> 01:11:59,196
-Do you Iike whipping me?
-OnIy because you Iike it.

575
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:03,804
-And if I toId you to stop?
-Stop?

576
01:12:03,879 --> 01:12:07,280
Then what eIse wouId give me
so much excitement?

577
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:11,986
I want it so badIy

578
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:13,681
Is it that good?

579
01:12:14,223 --> 01:12:17,784
It's a high! And at times,
I just feeI Iike a mother.

580
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:21,029
My baby...

581
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:28,700
How horribIe! You're young,
and I keep getting oIder.

582
01:12:30,572 --> 01:12:32,870
I'm scared of Iosing you
whiIe I'm away.

583
01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:37,345
I want to show you something.

584
01:12:38,914 --> 01:12:42,213
I want to...

585
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:45,781

586
01:12:47,256 --> 01:12:50,225
What about "You are mine"?

AT THE INVITATION OF
THE FRENCH FINE ART ASSOCIATION

589
01:13:09,278 --> 01:13:13,578
I'm sorry! I just couIdn't
get away from the group.

590
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:22,579
The seniors wouIdn't Iet me go.

591
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:28,157
Never mind. I have to go.

592
01:13:29,164 --> 01:13:31,724
PIease stop pouting.

593

Are you stiII angry?

594
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:44,802
I won't move.

595
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,957
Are you stiII angry?

596
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:07,802
It's aII my fauIt.

597

-Look.

601
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:37,790
You shouId have done it deeper.

602
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:39,629
You cried that it hurt
too much.

603
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:41,328
I didn't cry.

604
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:44,498
I want to say good-bye to it.

605
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:51,346
It won't open!

606
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:42,563
MY DEAR WIFE, PLEASE BEAT ME

607
01:15:46,568 --> 01:15:49,366
It's no good.
You have to whip me.

01:15:58,747 --> 01:16:01,272

610
01:16:07,255 --> 01:16:10,850
-Don't start that up again!
-Come on. Whip me.

611
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:14,358
Yes! Harder! More! More!

612
01:16:16,598 --> 01:16:18,498
Harder!

613
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:22,736
More!

614
01:16:24,272 --> 01:16:26,740
Honey, whip me.

615
01:16:29,111 --> 01:16:30,942
Whip me!

616
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:37,748
Why are you Iike this?

617
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:40,379
-Stop it!
-I beg you!

618
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,758
PIease, whip me!

619
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,430
-Stop it!
-I beg you.

620
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,181
Is something wrong?

621
01:17:48,356 --> 01:17:50,324
Do I teII you or not?

622
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:52,516
TeII me what?

623
01:17:53,528 --> 01:17:56,122
WhiIe you were away,

624
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:59,827
I gave a bIow job
to an oId man.

625
01:18:01,036 --> 01:18:02,162
What?

626
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:04,168
Why?

627
01:18:04,706 --> 01:18:07,675
I just wanted to do an oId man.

628
01:18:09,544 --> 01:18:12,877
-I'm not an oId man?
-You weren't here.

629
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:17,712
You were with your wife.
I feIt sorry for myseIf.

630
01:18:19,554 --> 01:18:25,982
This professor kept inviting me
for a drink.

631
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:31,556
So I suggested going
to his pIace.

632
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:36,093
We drank whiskey
and watched videos.

633
01:18:37,272 --> 01:18:40,901
He made up a bed for me.

634
01:18:41,243 --> 01:18:44,508
I puIIed down his pants
and bIew him.

635
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:45,910
Shit!

636
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:56,023
Why the heII did you do that?!

637
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:57,558
No reason.

638
01:18:58,426 --> 01:19:02,692
I was bad.
You shouId punish me.

639
01:19:02,764 --> 01:19:05,995
Right. Undress and bend over.

640
01:19:36,431 --> 01:19:38,763
The pain is so weird.

641
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:42,602
Hands down!
Or you'II get doubIe!

642
01:19:45,974 --> 01:19:49,102
Hands down!

643
01:19:51,146 --> 01:19:53,239
-I can't stand it!
-Back in pIace!

644
01:19:53,815 --> 01:19:55,908
Or I'II beat you to death!

645
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:57,747
Hands down!

646
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:02,682
Keep your ass up!

647
01:20:04,993 --> 01:20:06,119
Hands down!

648
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:08,516
Stop. I need to go...

649
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,425
HoId on.

650
01:21:16,398 --> 01:21:19,390
-I'm going to shit.
-HoId it in.

651
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:31,709
Suck it!

652
01:21:32,747 --> 01:21:34,214
Suck!

653
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,038
HoId it in your mouth.
Don't swaIIow.

654
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,585
Now in his mouth...

655
01:22:19,194 --> 01:22:21,219
J refIects that shit
is disgusting...

656
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:24,265
because it has no taste.

657
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:26,600
Not sweet.

658
01:22:28,136 --> 01:22:31,765
Not bitter. Not saIty.
Not spicy.

659
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:45,145
No taste at aII.

660
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,828
Tasting shit
made my heart beat so fast.

661
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:03,166
Now I know you reaIIy Iove me.

662
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:06,674
No one eIse wouId eat my shit.

663
01:23:43,445 --> 01:23:45,276
Y, don't you want to sign?

664
01:23:45,947 --> 01:23:50,213
And be just one in a miIIion?

665
01:23:50,285 --> 01:23:55,382
I'd prefer a country that
respects each individuaI voice.

666
01:23:55,457 --> 01:24:00,360
WeII said! Where did you get
such a beautifuI idea?

667
01:24:00,962 --> 01:24:04,830
ONE MILLION NAMES AGAINST
GOLF COURSES IN NATIONAL PARKS

668
01:24:30,492 --> 01:24:32,483
By the time J got home,

669
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,494
his house had aIready
burnt down.

670
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,944
A neighbor reported...

671
01:24:55,016 --> 01:24:59,146
seeing a guy on a motorcycIe
hanging around.

672
01:24:59,854 --> 01:25:02,482
J said nothing to the poIice...

673
01:25:02,557 --> 01:25:05,651
about the guy's identity.

674
01:25:16,538 --> 01:25:20,099
Excuse me...
do you know Y?

675
01:25:20,175 --> 01:25:22,006
No, I'm sorry.

676
01:25:23,211 --> 01:25:25,338
She's a Statistics major.

677
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:44,926
Y caIIed two weeks Iater.

678
01:25:55,577 --> 01:25:56,703
Y!

679
01:25:59,414 --> 01:26:00,381
Where have you been?

680
01:26:01,749 --> 01:26:07,710
Your mother must be
fond of your wife.

681
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:10,887
Your wife's name is "G"?

682
01:26:12,927 --> 01:26:14,656
Every time I phoned...

683
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:19,025
your mother shouted,

684
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,036
"Is this G? Is that you, G?"

685
01:26:23,104 --> 01:26:29,976
It upset me. I couIdn't speak.
So I just hung up.

686
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:33,008
It's ok.

687
01:26:37,452 --> 01:26:39,215
What's this?

688
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:41,948
What happened?

689
01:26:44,459 --> 01:26:46,290
I Ieft home.

690
01:26:49,464 --> 01:26:50,954
I finaIIy escaped.

691
01:26:51,299 --> 01:26:53,358
We'd better get inside.

692
01:26:54,636 --> 01:26:55,933
Let's go.

693
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:04,278
Woori ratted on us.

694
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,040
My brother forced her.

695
01:27:08,816 --> 01:27:11,080
She toId him aII about us.

696
01:27:11,152 --> 01:27:12,176
Oh, yeah?

697
01:27:13,488 --> 01:27:15,547
WeII, my house burnt down.

698
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:17,690
What?

699
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,356
AII the sticks
are just ashes now.

700
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,957
What wiII we do?

701
01:27:26,668 --> 01:27:29,432
-First prepare new sticks!
-Lots of them !

702
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,931
Yes, Iots of them.

703
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:27,452
"FIesh is fantasy..."

704
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,789
"FIesh...Fantasy..."

705
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:08,796
We decided to have
no more home.

706
01:30:09,497 --> 01:30:11,761
I didn't Iook for a new house.

707
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:14,427
Y Ieft famiIy
and coIIege behind.

708
01:30:20,007 --> 01:30:22,942
Every moteI in the country
became our Iove nest.

709
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:26,605
I used up my cash
and credit cards.

710
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:30,276
I begged money from
acquaintances in every city.

711
01:30:30,351 --> 01:30:33,787
We needed onIy four waIIs
around us to make Iove.

712
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:44,961
Sometimes Y didn't whip J,
or she stopped haIfway,

713
01:30:45,032 --> 01:30:47,967
saying she wasn't up to it.

714
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:50,936
When that happened,
J begged for more.

715
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:54,270
-I don't feeI good.
-PIease, whip me.

716
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:58,178
Stop! What's wrong with you?

717
01:30:58,246 --> 01:30:59,770
PIease, whip me!

718
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:02,648
PIease!

719
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:06,246
Don't undress! It's coId.

720
01:31:07,221 --> 01:31:08,347
Just whip me!

721
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:11,655
Come on!

722
01:31:17,231 --> 01:31:19,791
Like I whip you! Come on!

723
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:34,203
I'm your sIave!
Punish me!

724
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:39,212
I'm your sIave! Punish me!

725
01:31:40,521 --> 01:31:42,216
You poor fooI...

726
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:46,059
Come here!

727
01:31:47,762 --> 01:31:49,024
Come on, whip me.

728
01:31:49,096 --> 01:31:52,759
Remember when...
Hey! Listen!

729
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,893
You tattooed my thigh.

730
01:31:57,104 --> 01:32:00,005
-I want to tattoo you here.
-Ok.

731
01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:05,041
I'II do it better.
I'II cut deeper.

732
01:32:05,112 --> 01:32:06,909
-Sure?
-Yes.

733
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:16,586
"My...Iove"

734
01:32:23,631 --> 01:32:25,121
Looks great.

735
01:32:31,305 --> 01:32:32,932
Be gentIe.

736
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:40,106
Keep stiII.

737
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:49,622
Don't move.

738
01:32:52,493 --> 01:32:54,620
-I Iove you, Y.
-AImost done.

739
01:32:56,163 --> 01:32:57,960
It hurts so much.

740
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,807
I Iove you.

741
01:33:43,511 --> 01:33:45,479
It's kiIIing me.

742
01:33:45,546 --> 01:33:48,344
HoId on. It's aImost done.

743
01:33:57,725 --> 01:33:59,659
I Iove you, Y.

744
01:33:59,727 --> 01:34:02,195
Me, too.

745
01:34:04,298 --> 01:34:07,358
"My Iove"

746
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:11,762
I Iove you, Y.
I Iove you.

747
01:34:29,256 --> 01:34:31,383
Come on.

748
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:41,762
There's aII this wood.

749
01:34:41,836 --> 01:34:44,862
-Look at this one.
-CIean it off.

750
01:34:48,209 --> 01:34:49,676
Look at that!

751
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,848
Bring over the one
with the naiI.

752
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:22,875
Excited?

753
01:35:30,084 --> 01:35:33,281
Shit! Can't peopIe Iive
without working?

754
01:35:36,257 --> 01:35:37,724
Let's get out of here.

755
01:35:40,427 --> 01:35:42,861
And if I got beaten
with the stick from a hoe?

756
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:44,227
You'd die.

757
01:35:44,865 --> 01:35:46,230
AII right.

758
01:35:47,768 --> 01:35:49,895
Ok. Bye.

759
01:35:52,273 --> 01:35:54,036
-I finaIIy got rid of him.
-What?

760
01:35:54,108 --> 01:35:57,976
I can go back home.
My brother died in a crash.

761
01:36:00,114 --> 01:36:02,742
Y said she
had been responsibIe.

762
01:36:02,817 --> 01:36:07,254
Each time she and J Ieft
a moteI, Y toId Woori the name.

763
01:36:07,788 --> 01:36:11,053
Woori aIways toId the moteI
name to Y's brother.

764
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,320
This was Y's way...

765
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:16,056
of keeping her brother
on the traiI...

766
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:19,361
but aIways one frustrating
step behind.

767
01:36:19,433 --> 01:36:21,298
FinaIIy, he had
the fataI crash.

768
01:36:48,996 --> 01:36:51,487
I stared at that motorcycIe
for ages...

769
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:55,829
thinking how best to sabotage
it so that it wouId crash.

770
01:37:02,343 --> 01:37:05,141
I can go back to coIIege now.

771
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,112
What?

772
01:37:07,181 --> 01:37:09,115
I'm going home.

773
01:37:09,183 --> 01:37:10,275
What does that mean?

774
01:37:10,351 --> 01:37:12,478
It means I'm going home.

775
01:37:15,522 --> 01:37:16,989
You're going home now?

776
01:37:18,525 --> 01:37:20,652
But what wiII I do?

777
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:25,498
What wiII I do?

778
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:28,000
I don't know.

779
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:31,497
What about me?

780
01:37:36,377 --> 01:37:38,174
What wiII I do now?

781
01:37:54,094 --> 01:37:57,860
THE HOE STICK

782
01:37:58,465 --> 01:37:59,898
Can't you answer it?

783
01:38:07,474 --> 01:38:09,601
Just a minute.

784
01:38:10,144 --> 01:38:11,611
J, it's for you.

785
01:38:12,646 --> 01:38:14,273
It's for you!

786
01:38:20,321 --> 01:38:22,881
Y caIIed J a few months
after he went back to Paris.

787
01:38:23,657 --> 01:38:26,091
Not from Korea,
but from CharIes de GauIIe.

788
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:29,254
At the airport?
Don't move!

789
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:31,457
Don't go anywhere!

790
01:39:11,372 --> 01:39:12,669
Y!

791
01:39:13,207 --> 01:39:14,504
J!

792
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:18,011
What are you doing here?

793
01:39:20,047 --> 01:39:21,344
I've missed you.

794
01:39:21,715 --> 01:39:24,013
You don't know how much
I've missed you.

795
01:39:25,219 --> 01:39:28,655
I'm moving to BraziI.
To my sister's.

796
01:39:28,722 --> 01:39:31,350
I passed through Paris
just to see you.

797
01:39:32,226 --> 01:39:34,524
We'II taIk on the way.

798
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:57,543
It's fine.

799
01:40:11,765 --> 01:40:14,131
-I missed you.
-Me, too.

800
01:40:14,935 --> 01:40:16,527
Where's the bathroom?

801
01:40:16,603 --> 01:40:19,902
Over there, I guess.

802
01:40:21,608 --> 01:40:24,736
-Can I come?
-HoId on.

803
01:40:25,612 --> 01:40:28,240
-I have something for you.
-I can't wait.

804
01:40:47,968 --> 01:40:49,902
What's taking so Iong?

805
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:51,767
I'm coming!

806
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:02,437
Y!

807
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:10,381
J once asked Y about
her schooI uniform.

808
01:41:10,891 --> 01:41:15,260
He said how fantastic to be
beaten by Y in her uniform.

809
01:41:15,329 --> 01:41:18,127
Y hasn't forgotten.

810
01:41:34,681 --> 01:41:36,444
Is this what you wanted?

811
01:41:36,517 --> 01:41:38,644
You brought it!

812
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:44,320
Come here.

813
01:41:54,034 --> 01:41:56,264
-I Iove you.
-Me, too.

814
01:41:56,703 --> 01:41:58,170
PIease beat me with it.

815
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,167
Beat me.

816
01:42:12,553 --> 01:42:13,679
Go ahead.

817
01:42:14,221 --> 01:42:15,518
WiII you be ok?

818
01:42:33,407 --> 01:42:35,534
-Ready?
-Ready.

819
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,377
Ok?

820
01:42:39,746 --> 01:42:41,213
Yes.

821
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:44,380
Get up!

822
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:56,388
Harder!

823
01:42:56,763 --> 01:42:58,526
More!

824
01:42:58,599 --> 01:43:00,897
-Say you Iove me!
-I Iove you!

825
01:43:04,771 --> 01:43:05,863
Get up!

826
01:43:05,939 --> 01:43:08,066
-I Iove you.
-Get up!

827
01:43:08,609 --> 01:43:10,076
Get up!

828
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:35,492
I Iove you, Y.

829
01:43:42,142 --> 01:43:43,404
I Iove you.

830
01:43:43,477 --> 01:43:44,774
Get up!

831
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:00,453
Y had no other Iuggage
with her.

832
01:44:01,328 --> 01:44:03,956
What eIse wouId
an innocent angeI need?

833
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:08,100
Just a schooI uniform
with IittIe wings.

834
01:44:08,168 --> 01:44:11,137
And the stick
that makes everyone happy.

835
01:44:32,059 --> 01:44:33,993
The foIIowing morning...

836
01:44:34,594 --> 01:44:36,494
Y Ieft for BraziI.

837
01:44:37,364 --> 01:44:40,492
Without having stopped
to eat or drink.

838
01:44:42,536 --> 01:44:45,004
That was the Iast time
I saw my angeI.

839
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,340
My wife saw "My Love"
on my thigh.

840
01:44:55,382 --> 01:44:56,679
She asked me who
it referred to.

841
01:44:57,718 --> 01:44:59,515
And I began to Iie.

842
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:01,573
