1
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,829
BOY: Papi. Papi.

2
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,788
Shh.

3
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:19,289
(Whispers) Do they just
fall out of the hive?

4
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,973
Nothing's happening.

5
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,137
(Whispers) Just wait, Raimond.

6
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,739
They think it's the sun.

7
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,041
DOOR CREAKS

8
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:56,289
For luck.

9
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:58,798
(Blows)

10
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:30,765
Wait on, boy.

11
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,655
Concentrating.

12
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,811
Whoo-hoo! (Laughs)

13
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:25,882
See you later, Jack.

14
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,378
Night, Mick.

15
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,221
Why do they all call you Jack?

16
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,384
That's my new Australian name.

17
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:37,973
What do you mean?

18
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:41,314
Maybe 'Romulus'
is too hard for them to say.

19
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,493
WOMEN GlGGLE

20
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:58,032
Those girls keep looking at you.

21
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:05,330
They are just nice people.
They like to be friendly.

22
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,636
(All laugh)

23
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,846
Muti!

24
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:10,365
(Kisses)

25
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,866
It's so nice to be home.

26
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:20,447
You haven't come home for ages.

27
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,001
I’m sorry, darling.

28
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,622
I’ve been so busy in Melbourne.

29
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,888
Doing what?

30
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:45,851
And...just a little spray
of this please, sir.

31
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,065
This?
Mm-hm.

32
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,619
Mmm.

33
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,162
And here.

34
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,790
Do I smell good?
Yep.

35
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:04,291
Yep? Are we ready to go, then?

36
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,123
Go where?

37
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:09,632
Aren't you taking me to dinner
in some fine restaurant, young man?

38
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:18,550
How's school?
Good.

39
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,313
Guess what?

40
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,191
Women smile at Papi.

41
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,066
A lot.

42
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,493
Really?
Yep.

43
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:41,495
I smiled at him once too, you know.

44
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,163
DOOR OPENS

45
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,048
And look...

46
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,167
..here we all are.

47
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,678
Here we are.

48
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,061
Morning, Muti.

49
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:45,810
Morning.

50
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:51,461
SWlNG MUSIC PLAYS

51
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,210
Good.

52
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,627
Kick, kick, back.

53
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,221
(Laughs)
Whoo! (Laughs)

54
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,648
(Both pant and moan)

55
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,450
Cristal.

56
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,331
I miss you.

57
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,843
CHRISTINA: We used to meet
in secret,

58
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,968
because if my parents had found out,

59
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,598
I would have been in big strife.

60
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,176
Because you were too young?
Yep.

61
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,559
And your father was not German,
he was Romanian.

62
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,307
And he was poor.

63
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,893
It was not allowed.
Why not?

64
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,145
It was a bad time.

65
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,696
We were crazy about each other.

66
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,528
And I’ll tell you a secret.

67
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:44,454
He loved me so badly,

68
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,293
when I tried to leave him...

69
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:49,169
..he shot himself.

70
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,044
What?

71
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:58,214
Took a pistol, pointed it
to the side of his head

72
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:00,462
and then he just pulled the trigger
and... Bang!

73
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,884
But he missed! (Laughs)

74
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,301
The bullet just scratched his nose.

75
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:10,267
Bombs falling on our heads
out of the sky every night

76
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:13,808
and your poor crazy father
shoots himself in the nose.

77
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,980
(Laughs) Oh.

78
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,987
(Whispers) You think you can just
come here whenever you feel like it.

79
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,822
You don't write, nothing.
I shouldn't have to write.

80
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,326
You treat this place like a hotel.

81
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,040
Every time you come, Christina,
you cause trouble.

82
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,668
Yes, I always do or say
something wrong.

83
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,247
You had no right
to tell that story.

84
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:30,915
I love that story.
Why?

85
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,203
Because it reminds me...

86
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,041
Because you want him to think
I’m crazy fool.

87
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:35,248
No!
Shooting myself.

88
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,047
I love that story because
it reminds me we were happy.

89
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,094
Why you do this?
All that matters is your feelings.

90
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,385
Look where they got you, Christina.
You and your bloody feelings.

91
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:44,934
Who cares about my feelings?

92
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,973
Well, go back to bloody Mitru, then.

93
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:51,398
(Whistles)

94
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,271
ROMULUS: Raimond?

95
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:58,317
(Continues whistling)

96
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:01,191
Rai?

97
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,092
Coo-ee!

98
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,138
Hi, Vacek.

99
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,851
Here you are. Got you some eggs.

100
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:25,446
(Urinates)

101
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,557
Coo-ee!

102
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,518
WOMAN: You're sure
you don't want a cuppa, Tom?

103
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,899
No, no, I’m right.

104
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:41,191
We want you to eat until
you're as full as a goog.

105
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,861
Full as a tick, I’d say.

106
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,410
(Both chuckle)

107
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:49,284
And how's your mother, Rai?

108
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,996
Oh, she's gone back to Melbourne.

109
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:56,332
When she comes to stay,
she and Papi sleep in the same bed.

110
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,462
Ah, yeah.

111
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,625
But she never stays very long.

112
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,969
I reckon we should live together
all the time.

113
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:08,184
Well, sometimes what you reckon and
what you get ain't the same thing.

114
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,804
So, it's just you
and your father again, then?

115
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,272
And Jack and Orloff.

116
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:17,146
Oh. And would the bird like tea too?

117
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,644
Yes, please, Miss Collard.
And cake?

118
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,527
Yep, he likes his cake.

119
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:25,907
Here, Jack.

120
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,489
Oh, well. (Laughs)

121
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:28,991
(Both chuckle)

122
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:00,651
(Children laugh and call out)

123
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:05,031
(Whistles piercingly)

124
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,576
Hora!

125
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,117
Hello, Fritz.

126
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,957
Hup, hup. Up. Hey!

127
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,417
Whoa! (Laughs)

128
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:16,829
(Laughs)

129
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:20,090
APPLAUSE ON RADIO

130
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:21,918
MAN ON RADIO: Hi ho, everybody.

131
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,671
ALL: Hi ho, Jack.

132
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:26,597
Welcome to 'The Dulux Show'.

133
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:29,387
I’m thinking of sending him
to St Joseph's.

134
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,719
Well, that's good. Good education.

135
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,224
Steam engine.

136
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:34,393
Expensive.

137
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:36,439
Yes, but I have an idea.

138
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,269
Oh, yes.

139
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,359
Ohh!

140
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:46,777
I have to tell you something...
about Christina.

141
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,027
They've moved in together,

142
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,908
some place in Melbourne

143
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,368
and they're coming up here
to live in Maryborough.

144
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,001
Why?

145
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:04,009
Mitru's got himself
a job at the post office.

146
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:08,050
I’m ashamed.

147
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,343
He's my brother, but I’m ashamed.
Don't be. Hora, don't be.

148
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,726
RADIO PROGRAM CONTINUES PLAYING

149
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,186
It will be alright, huh?

150
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:28,742
Raimond, they've got
a new egg board in Castlemaine.

151
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,074
Yeah?

152
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,658
Shall we sell eggs?

153
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,287
CHICKENS CLUCK AND SQUAWK

154
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,711
Go, you stupid chicken. Come here!
Go, go, go, go, go.

155
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,340
Go, go, go.

156
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:45,711
(Squawks)
Holy moley!

157
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:56,682
There's billions of them.

158
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,351
They're all over the place.

159
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,480
Now you need to wash off
all the shit.

160
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,730
(Laughs)

161
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,657
(Raimond mimics racing car)

162
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,697
Come on, come on.

163
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,368
Go, go, go, go, go.

164
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,996
(All cheer and laugh)

165
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:19,748
(Whistles)

166
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,673
ROMULUS: Hey, Raimond, be careful.

167
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,917
Those eggs are sending you
through boarding school.

168
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:26,505
SPLAT!
Sorry.

172
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,942
Papi?

173
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:56,701
HORA: She's crazy. She's crazy.

174
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:59,877
Tell me you're not
going to agree to this.

175
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:01,505
Raimond needs to see his mother.

176
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,299
Yes, of course,

177
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,383
but is it right that she comes here
in front of you and your son...

178
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:08,093
No matter what she's done,
we're still family.

179
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,930
..with my brother, to sit at
your table, under your roof?

180
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:13,888
(Speaks Romanian)

181

These things don't change.

182
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,520
Tell me you're joking.
She's my wife.

183
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,231
But does she behave like your wife?

184
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:25,233
You just keep forgiving her, Gaita,
no matter what it costs.

185

190
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:06,735
That's very kind of you, Rai,
but I’ll sleep in the spare room.

191
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:17,366

193

Oh, she's beautiful.

Oh, yeah? Which one's that?

199

Just the most handsome constellation
in the whole universe.

There's no such thing.
Oh, yes, there is.

201

about it...

So why did you marry me, then?

218
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,412
Not because I loved you.

219

If you don't love me,
then why don't you divorce me?

00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:34,972
It might be important.

333
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,439
Later.

334
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,193
But I just wanted...
I said later.

335
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,150
Don't argue with me, Raimond.

336
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:19,307
Raimond.
Yeah?

337
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:20,944
Where's my razor?

338
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:26,489
What razor?

339
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:29,660
The one that was in the box
in my trunk.

340
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:31,489
Maybe Hora borrowed it.

341
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,213
Raimond.

342
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,174
Don't lie to me.

343
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,170
Even if you do something stupid
like...burn down the house,

344
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,390
you tell the truth.

345
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,937
Always.

346
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:57,851
You tell the truth, you don't get
into trouble, you understand?

347
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:02,399
I don't know where it is.

How are you?
Good.

360
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:12,053
Packed all his clothes in there.

361
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:17,181
Put the bathers in there as well,
just in case you take him swimming.

362
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,890
But be careful,
'cause he's just learning.

363
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:25,852
Would you like to hold her?

364
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:40,366
She's very beautiful.

365
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes, she is beautiful.

366
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,841

No, thanks.
No?

00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,505
Something else to drink?
No, thanks.

372
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:37,840
A beer?
(Laughs) No.

373

374
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,024

Would you like that?

Hello, my girl. How is she?

389
00:42:52,093 --> 00:42:53,719
Oh, she was just a bit stinky.

390
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,377
Oh, she's a stinky monkey, eh?

391
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,643
You're my stinky girl. Mwah!

392
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,054
Oh, you're a good boy.

You're OK, hmm?

398

Nice and clean now, eh?

399
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:16,282
Look, that's better.

400
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,611
Here we are. That's a good girl.

401
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:23,375
There we are. Look.

402
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:25,497
All better. Mm-hm?

403
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:27,412
Yeah. There.

404
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:31,039
Yes. Good. That's it, eh?

405
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,802
Yes, oh, that's better, huh?

Hmm? Where?

00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,512
You got yourself
a little girlfriend.

413
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:20,923
None of your business. Really.
Show me.

Come on.

Oi, oi, oi. Come on,

You know who that is? Huh?

498
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:53,746
Go home.
Why is she sending you kisses?

499
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,625
I said go home, Raimond! Now.

500
00:52:58,714 --> 00:52:59,994
Cheeky little bugger.

501
00:53:06,262 --> 00:53:08,835
MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY

502
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:10,923
SONG:#Got the jive,
got the message I’m alive

503
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:12,808
#I’m a wild, I’m a wild one

504
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:14,637
#Ooh, yeah, I’m a wild one

505
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:18,061
#I’m gonna keep a-shakin'
I’m gonna keep a-movin', baby...#

506
00:53:18,149 --> 00:53:19,608
Turn it off!

507
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:22,812
(Turns music up louder)

508
00:53:28,328 --> 00:53:29,786
(Turns off power)

509
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:32,444
You don't love Muti
and you don't love me!

510
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:33,800
Never believe that I don't love you.

511
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,494
(Squawks)

512
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,465
Surprise.

513
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:07,585
Oh, happy birthday, darling.

514
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:10,095
Happy birthday.

515
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,338
Muti, my birthday's not till Sunday.

516
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,717
Oh, well, it's nice to be early.

517
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,767
We get to spend some time together.

518
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:19,563
Hmm? Mwah!

519
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:25,862
Where's Susan?

520
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,524
She's at home with Mitru.

521
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,579
Is everything alright, darling?

522
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,160
Yep.

523
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,881
So everything's really alright?

524
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,497
Cristal.

525
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:23,418
My love.

526
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,209
Oh!

527
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,209
Can I give you a hand with all that?

528
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,923
No, thank you.
Everything's under control.

529
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,089
Imagine, in America
they have machines,

530
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,756
labour-saving devices
to do these things.

531
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:38,473
Still, we settled for here.
And here we are.

532
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,306
There's more to life than cooking.

533
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:45,060
Raimond was conceived in a graveyard
and look at him. Full of life.

534
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,613
(All crunch their food)

535
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,253
It's delicious.

536
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,875
Y... Mmm.

537
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,625
No peeking.

538
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,843
There we are.

539
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,845
You spelled my name wrong.
Oh, sorry. (Laughs)

540
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,608
It's R-A-l.

541
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:26,065
(Christina sings in German)

542
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,627
(Trails off singing)

543
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:50,260
Happy birthday, darling.

544
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,672
Now you can blow out the candles.

545
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:57,428
And make a wish.
And don't tell anyone what you wish.

546
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,225
Or it will never come true.

547
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:31,176
Muti! What are you doing?

548
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:49,225
KNOCK AT DOOR

549
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,572
(Knocks louder)

550
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,282
Do you want a cup of tea?

551
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:05,203
Muti?

552
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:10,757
(Panicked) Papi!

553
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,593
Papi!

554
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:20,144
What's the matter?

555
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:21,770
What's the matter?

556
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:29,737
Arghh!

557
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,398
What's wrong with her?
How many you take?

558
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:32,983
How many you take?

559
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:35,646
How many? How many you take?

560
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:40,906
OK, stay with your mother.

561
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:42,990
Talk to her.
Don't let her go to sleep, OK?

562
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,670
Where are you going?
Talk to her, don't let sleep, OK?!

563
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,412
Keep talk.

564
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,135
Muti.

565
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:58,464
RAIMOND: Um...once upon a time,

566
00:59:58,557 --> 00:59:59,933
a time...

567
01:00:00,018 --> 01:00:01,760
..a long time ago...

568
01:00:01,853 --> 01:00:04,771
Wake up!

569
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:06,894
..there was a tree.

570
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:10,767
It had leaves
and they were all new and green.

571
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,444
It had...silver branches

572
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:18,066
and a bird would come every day
and sing in the tree.

573
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,831
It would sing and sing and sing.

574
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:22,907
It was...it was a bloody good singer,
this bird,

575
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,537
but...but it was only small and brown

576
01:00:25,627 --> 01:00:28,166
and...and then this woman,
this beautiful woman

577
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:30,961
used to come and listen to it

578
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,588
and...and...um...and...

579
01:00:35,555 --> 01:00:37,677
..and they were very happy.

580
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:40,007
And that's the end of the story.

581
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:42,971
Muti, are you awake?

582
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:44,603
Open your eyes!

583
01:00:46,983 --> 01:00:49,140
Muti! Muti!

584
01:00:49,234 --> 01:00:52,733
Come on. Come on!

585
01:00:52,822 --> 01:00:55,277
Wake up.

586
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:57,239
RAPID FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

587
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:03,699
(Grunts with strain)

588
01:01:07,752 --> 01:01:09,710
What do I do?
Stay here, Raimond.

589
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:15,214
(Pants)

590
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:11,853
Thanks, Tom.

591
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,209
Orloff, down.

592
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:39,962
She's going to be OK.

593
01:02:48,023 --> 01:02:49,600
I wanna be with her.

594
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:53,234
No, Raimond, you can't.

595
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,988
I can. She needs me.

596
01:02:58,366 --> 01:03:01,817
BABY SCREAMS

597
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,029
A little more. A little more.

598
01:03:06,124 --> 01:03:08,246
No, no, no. Come on.
(Screams)

599
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,830
OK.

600
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:16,050
(Susan continues screaming)

601
01:03:16,135 --> 01:03:17,546
(Soothingly) Hey.

602
01:03:17,637 --> 01:03:19,131
I’ll do it. You go.

603
01:03:19,221 --> 01:03:21,547
I can do it. I can do it.
I can do it.

604
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,016
I can do it. Thanks.

605
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,594
Thank you.

606
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:28,137
Here, just a little bit.
SUSAN: Mummy!

607
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:30,803
Come on. Come on, Susan.
Mummy. Mummy.

608
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,473
(Wails)
Come on.

609
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,239
Come on.

610
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:40,523
Mummy! (Sobs)

611
01:03:40,618 --> 01:03:42,824
She wants you to feed her. Here.

612
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,936
CLATTERING
(Christina moans and pants)

613
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:02,782
(Man grunts)
(Christina moans)

614
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,575
Oh! (Cries out)

615
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:06,986
(Cries out in pain)

616
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,406
(Christina whimpers) Stop! Stop!

617
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:11,208
Stop it!

618
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:13,038
(Man grunts) Shut up!

619
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,859
(Susan cries)
Shh. Shh.

620
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:40,904
(Mitru yells)

621
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:42,782
(Christina screams)

622
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:45,785
(Hammers on door)

623
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,662
Hey!

624
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,832
HEY!

625
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:53,289
Stop it! Get off her!

626
01:05:55,504 --> 01:05:57,462
(Hammers on door) Get off her!

627
01:05:57,548 --> 01:06:00,004
(Mitru continues yelling)
(Christina screams)

628
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:02,714
Stop it. Stop it!

629
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:04,263
Muti!

630
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:14,525
Hey.

631
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,235
(Kisses)

632
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,896
Have they found the car?

633
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:47,450
Muti.

634
01:07:47,536 --> 01:07:48,994
Have they found the car?

635
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:51,741
What car?

636
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,866
The one that hit him?

637
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,502
No, darling.

638
01:08:03,176 --> 01:08:04,884
Mummy, Mummy.

639
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:20,146
Cristal, I’ll have more soon.

640
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,485
Anything else you need or...?

641
01:08:23,574 --> 01:08:25,780
Could you just stay
for a little bit longer?

642
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,576
No, we have to go.

643
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:29,239
OK.

644
01:08:38,297 --> 01:08:40,206
I’ve gotta go, Muti.

645
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:41,709
You go.

646
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,674
I’ve gotta go to school.
It's alright.

647
01:09:08,787 --> 01:09:10,495
(Chuckles)

648
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,454
What?

649
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:27,381
'Bye, Papi.

650
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:30,255
Go on.

651
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:30,529
DOOR OPENS

652
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,324
Excuse me. Gaita.

653
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,503
How smart you look.

654
01:10:50,723 --> 01:10:53,428
I got a job
as a shoe polisher in a factory.

655
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,928
Can you imagine?

656
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:58,055
Your mother ending up
as a factory worker.

657
01:11:00,358 --> 01:11:01,768
Where's Susan?

658
01:11:07,616 --> 01:11:09,368
She's in a home.

659
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:13,117
A good home, just un...

660
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:15,245
..until things get a little better.

661
01:11:15,332 --> 01:11:18,583
But she sometimes visits
and stays with me.

662
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:21,504
You haven't written to me for ages.

663
01:11:24,842 --> 01:11:26,301
I’m sorry.

664
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:31,889
Let's cheer this place up.

665
01:11:31,974 --> 01:11:33,384

CROONER BALLAD PLAYS

01:12:28,532 --> 01:12:29,943
Come on.

668
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:31,363
I don't want to!

669
01:12:42,254 --> 01:12:45,753
Darling, I’ve been thinking I’d like
to come home to you and your father.

670
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:49,927
I really miss you.

671
01:12:55,307 --> 01:12:57,016
I’d like to try again.

672
01:13:01,356 --> 01:13:02,306
Raimond.

673
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:08,989
Please.

674
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:15,321
Please.

675
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:17,322
I have to go in now.

676
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:31,045
'Bye, Muti.

677
01:13:31,138 --> 01:13:32,632
'Bye.

678
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,844
Excuse me, sir.

679
01:14:14,598 --> 01:14:17,007
Um...if my moth..

680
01:14:17,102 --> 01:14:19,509
..if my mother calls for me again,

681
01:14:19,604 --> 01:14:21,395
could you please tell her

682
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,972
that I don't want to see her
for the time being?

683
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,975
Mm-hm.

684
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:10,002
(Shouts inaudibly)

685
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:48,830

687
01:18:03,957 --> 01:18:05,369
Papi.

688
01:18:38,992 --> 01:18:42,776
If you touch the metal
with your fingertip,

689
01:18:42,871 --> 01:18:45,197
it turns to dust.

690
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,327
But here it is
in the heart of the fire.

691
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,434
Hey.

692
01:19:08,356 --> 01:19:09,850
Gaita...

693
01:19:12,277 --> 01:19:13,819
..eat your soup.

HAMMERING SEGUES INTO BELL RINGING

696
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:29,768
The bloody house is falling down.

697
01:20:38,407 --> 01:20:41,905
Remember the letters in my trunk...

698
01:20:41,993 --> 01:20:43,451
..with the photographs?

699
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:47,789
That was Lidia.

700
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:53,042
She's a good person,

701
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:54,590
good woman.

702
01:20:57,302 --> 01:21:01,050
I think if I ask her
to come out here,

703
01:21:01,139 --> 01:21:03,712
that she would maybe come here
and stay.

704
01:21:04,976 --> 01:21:08,843
And...we could adopt Susan

705
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:11,476
and she could come
and live here as well.

706
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:17,988
We would have to fix up the house...

707
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,824
..make it nice, you understand?

708
01:21:24,995 --> 01:21:27,237
But she lives on
the other side of the world.

709
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,244
And you haven't even met her.

710
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,785
Yes, but I am sure
she's a good person.

711
01:21:39,803 --> 01:21:41,629
A boy needs a mother.

712
01:22:55,088 --> 01:22:56,998
Come on, Orloff. Good boy.

713
01:22:58,175 --> 01:23:00,166
Give.

714
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,719
Here you go...

715
01:23:05,473 --> 01:23:06,932
Hora!

716
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:18,317
She's married. Hey, listen to me.
(Romulus grunts and roars)

717
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:20,111
She's already married.

718
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,236
(Grunts)
Look at me.

719
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:27,530
Gaita!

720
01:23:28,914 --> 01:23:30,656
Hey!

721
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:32,243
(Roars)

722
01:23:39,799 --> 01:23:41,839
So Lidia was just tricking him.

METALLIC HAMMERING

724

Come on.

725
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:59,857
Why didn't she tell him she was
already married to someone else?

726
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:02,152
Why would someone do that
to someone else?

727
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,481
I don't know.

728
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:07,067
But he sent money
for her whole family to come out.

729
01:24:51,123 --> 01:24:53,200
Gaita.

730
01:24:55,085 --> 01:24:56,794
Gaita!

731
01:24:56,879 --> 01:24:58,456
Come on, stop it. Hey.

732
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,504
(Snarls)

733
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:03,551
Arggh!
Papi!

734
01:25:06,722 --> 01:25:08,880
(Squeals) Papi, it's me.

735
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:11,547
It's me. It's me.

736
01:25:40,798 --> 01:25:44,213
(Whistles)

737
01:26:01,986 --> 01:26:04,774
(Sobs quietly)

738
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:16,785
Listen, I have to get us some money.

739
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:19,165
I can't stay off work any longer.

740
01:26:19,254 --> 01:26:23,382
Can I come with you?
No, Fritz, not possible.

741
01:26:23,467 --> 01:26:26,835
Working in a factory 6 hours a day,
what would I do with you?

742
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:28,340
Hmm?

743
01:26:30,474 --> 01:26:31,968
Will you be OK?

744
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:33,601
Yeah.

“Things change, but our life is
what our thoughts make it.”

746
01:26:55,917 --> 01:26:58,040
No, keep it.

747
01:26:58,128 --> 01:26:59,956
It's yours if you want it.

What's happening?

Let's get out of this bloody place.

How did Mitru die?

769
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:09,689
He hopped on his bike

770
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:11,899
and he rode to Pioneer Tower...

771
01:34:13,779 --> 01:34:16,186
..and he climbed
all the way to the top.

772
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,118
And then he jumped off.

773
01:34:37,806 --> 01:34:40,213
But you know what he did first?

774
01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:45,978
He put a knife in the ground,
pointing up,

775
01:34:46,063 --> 01:34:47,522
just to make sure.

776
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:04,040
