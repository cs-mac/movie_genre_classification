Of course you break it,
if you get drunk and step on it.

11
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,408
Told you to look at it before
we left port.

12
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,576
Ho-young!

13
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,006
Roll them up separately!

14
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,939
That's what I'm doing!
Rolling 'em up separately.

15
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,619
- You have to flip it.
- Okay.

16
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,825
Watch the spark!

17
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:13,260
Look at this part.
Feel how smooth it is.

18
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,563
Be careful!

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,009
Temperature in Yeosu will be similar
or slightly lower.

20
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,047
Relatively calm at sea with
the wave 1m high maximum.

21
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,574
A good day for fishing.

22
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,076
Overcome the IMF crisis...

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,587

Please let the catch be worth
a lot of money.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,835
And let it be a full haul.

27
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:23,897
The blade is all nicked.

28
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,680
Ho-young!
They're not anchovies!

29
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,724
They're pomfrets!
Get moving!

30
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,384
Let's get those pomfrets!

31
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,062
Kyung-koo!
Call out the engineer!

32
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,063
Dong-sik! Don't stand around.
Go help with the net.

33
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:55,896
You mean this?

34
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,734
What the hell?

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,373
- He's caught!
- Turn off the drum winch!

36
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,674
You have to be shitting me.

37
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,878
- It's stuck!
- Hold the net tight!

38
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,318
Just turn off the damn winch!

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,553
Holy shit.

40
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,526
The winch is jacked up.

41
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,494
How the hell did you check
the equipment?

42
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,922
You're lucky to be alive.

48
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,850
Hello, Captain.

49
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,953
Still no fish.
They better catch some soon.

50
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,059
That one.
That one looks good.

51
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,373
That one there.

52
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,070
Already back before the tide?

53
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,606
We missed a school of
pomfrets...

54
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,907
The drum winch got jacked up.

55
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,613
We should do a complete
overhaul of the boat.

56
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,087
Need to fix the radiator too.

57
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,648
Why spend money to fix
that piece of junk?

58
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,285
The government is reimbursing
old fishing boats now.

59
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:07,655
They're even turning in
boats that are in good condition.

60
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,599
Don't even joke about
giving away my boat.

61
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,331
For people like me,
that's like denying your family.

62
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,566
A load of crap.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,132
You can't give away the Junjin.
Never.

64
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,106
Loan me some money
to feed my crew.

65
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,479
You gotta be shitting me.

66
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,748
Hey, Captain.

67
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,915
Why is your sorry ass
is still a captain?

68
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,182
It's thanks to us!

69
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,450
You know what?

70
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,462
We're turning in that boat,
get our money in the bank!

71
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,898
Bank interest is good money now.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,399
Under the lMF crisis.

73
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,033
Excuse...

74
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,801
That rotten...!

75
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,771
You little!

76
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,006
You going somewhere?

77
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,225
Why're you back so early?

78
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,000
We returned with a full load.

79
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,365
Heard it's tough these days...

80
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,376
Your captain must be good.

81
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:25,570
Yeah.

82
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,140
Nana. Were you at the
market again?

83
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,205
No.

84
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,649
Told you not to work.
I can earn for both of us.

85
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,383
How can I stay home when
my baby's working out at sea.

86
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,732
You're home early.
Done fishing?

87
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,379
Excuse me.

88
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,380
The restaurant and the house
are a complete mess.

89
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,518
And you're here doing it
with that guy?

90
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,782
Better than you.

91
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,950
If you don't like it,
make yourself available.

92
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,393
Or bring home some money.

93
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,629
Husband my ass.

94
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,192
The door is jammed.

95
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,102
Where's the....

96
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,482
Can't even pay for a motel?
You're so cheap.

97
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,643
Shut up!
Push up closer!

98
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,817
Okay!

99
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,194
It's so dark.

100
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,357
- Mind the gap.
- What's going on?

101
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,592
Kyung-koo brought a girl.

102
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,936
With a call girl again?

103
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,702
Not again.

104
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,369
Oh, hello boys.

105
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,951
I can't wait.

106
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,750
Think of this as my yacht.

107
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,829
To your left and right.
4 beds total.

108
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,499
Take your pick.

109
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,128
You guys sleep on
bunk beds like kids?

110
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:07,998
What the...

111
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,439
Thought you were going out
on the town tonight.

112
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,608
What for? I live here.

113
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,946
Okay, whatever.

114
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,107
- I got a better place.
- Really?

115
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,048
Follow me.

116
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,147
What's your name, baby?

117
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,281
Huh?

118
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,460
We have to improvise.

119
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,656
Let's try the captain's bed.
Real comfy.

120
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,892
- Really?
- You don't trust me?

121
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,700
Hold tight.

122
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,600
There you go...

123
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,635
Oh!

124
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,641
How dare you bring a girl
on board!

125
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,973
Kyung-koo, get a room.

126
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,381
- Was the captain here?
- I didn't know either.

127
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,849
Was he here all along?

128
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,884
Is he sleeping on board
instead of home?

129
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,189
- Wait up!
- I'm leaving.

130
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,786
He's worried about the boat.

131
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,498
Are they really selling the boat?

132
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,995
It's burning. Flip it.

133
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,502
Okay.

134
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,553
Why do you need a big loan?

135
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,724
I'm getting my boat back.

136
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,230
Buying that piece of junk?

137
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,295
Its value is practically nothing.

138
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:48,833
Captain Kang.

139
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,101
Your income last year
is a total mess.

140
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,072
Your savings account is tapped out,
and you used up your loan.

141
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,681
- Restaurant is mortagaged.
- What?

142
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,149
Your wife's name is
Kim Jae-hwa, right?

143
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,056
It's going to be difficult.

144
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,625
It's not like the old days
for trawler captains.

145
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,911
The red tide's been bad
for business, huh?

146
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,475
It's not the red tide.

147
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,680
It's my luck running out.

148
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,149
Trawler captains used to spend money
like spoiled princes.

149
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,417
Didn't you spend 2 million
in one day at a bar?

150
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,693
It's become a legend here
in Dolsan Harbor.

151
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,528
Even now you can fool around
with these girls all day.

152
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,631
and still it doesn't cost 2 million.

153
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,233
- Go outside.
- Okay.

154
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,665
Guess times have really
been tough for you.

155
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,840
Even coming to see me.

156
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,708
Look...

157
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,648
Do you still take those jobs?

158
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,354
From China.

159
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,053
Of course.

160
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,490
You made a wise decision.

161
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,685
Didn't you hear about
Captain Hong?

162
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,987
He now became a construction
worker in Soonchon.

163
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,997
He's hauling bricks
for Christ's sake.

164
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,463
When I heard that,
it just broke my heart.

165
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,234
Who are we?
We're sailors, aren't we?

166
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,136
Sailors should make a living
at sea!

167
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,045
Enough bullshit.
Just give me the coordinates.

168
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,018
Captain. This is where the
money is now.

169
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,025
Aren't you curious
what you're shipping?

170
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,594
I just deliver.
Isn't it gold watches?

171
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,463
I just got this job.
Smuggling immigrants.

172
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,106
Not crates. Immigrants...

173
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,840
Smuggling in
Korean-Chinese people.

174
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,911
They call it 'croaker fishing'
in lncheon.

175
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,881
The government started busting,
so it came down south.

176
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,522
Now it's here in Yeosu.

177
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,090
Here, the coordinates.

178
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,820
Technically it's smuggling,

179
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,628
but we're doing
a great service for our country.

180
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,834
Without their cheap labor,
the economy won't sustain.

181
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,441
For you and your wife.
Call it a deposit.

182
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,351
This fake crap worth shit?
Are you kidding me?

183
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,456
Trust is important in this
line of work.

184
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,860
Let it be a symbol of
our mutual trust.

185
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,263
This is the actual deposit.

186
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,472
What if we get caught?

187
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,868
Just bring them over
in the fish hold.

188
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,746
What if we get caught with them
on the boat?

189
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,747
That's the Junjin crew's business.

190
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,814
That's a given
when transporting cargo.

191
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,218
Name check
for the departing crew.

192
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,297
Bos'n.

193
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,962
- And you, Kyung-koo?
- I'm on drum winch duty.

194
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,529
- I'm Dong-sik.
- Dong-sik.

195
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,703
- Where's Chang-wook?
- He's in the engine room.

196
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,439
Chang-wook?

197
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,740
Here.

198
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,875
You' re the engineer?

199
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,509
Yeah, so?

200
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,477
You?

201
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,349
That asshole.

202
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,587
One, two, three, four, five.

203
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,684
How come the crew is so small
these days?

204
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,018
The catch isn't so good.
That's why.

205
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,152
The weather forecast
doesn't look good.

206
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,457
We can't just sit around.
Gotta at least try.

207
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,130
I hope you catch enough
to cover the gas.

208
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,022
Wan-ho, this should stop.

209
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,593
Are you going to hide forever?

210
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,529
For as long as I owe money.

211
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,601
I'm a sailor. I'm fine as long as
I end up on a boat.

212
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,828
What's with the oil
on your face?

213
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,170
Here, let me help.

214
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,538
I look cool, right?

215
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,611
You know l...
Kyung-koo.

216
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,414
...fixed up the engine room.

217
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,586
Get everyone in the the cabin.
I have something to say.

218
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:41,016
If we get caught,
don't we all go to prison?

219
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,118
Of course.
Smuggling immigrants ain't a joke.

220
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,162
How much are we getting?

221
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,062
Forget the money.

222
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,668
How can the captain decide
without telling us?

223
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,671
Imagine why he'd go to
that snake, Yeo.

224
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,440
It's cuz he cares about us.

225
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:01,703
Still! Transporting people
won't be easy.

226
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:07,316
Then there'll be chicks among
the immigrants, right?

227
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,714
Sit, sit.

228
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,458
Bos'n.

229
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,162
This is an advance for all.

230
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,868
Once we unload the immigrants,
you get the rest.

231
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,105
So let's not screw up.
Okay?

232
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:32,340
Wan-ho, let's do a complete overhaul
on the engine room.

233
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,273
- But...
- Come on!

234
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,947
Eat.

235
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,045
Let's go eat.

236
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,892
Heavy rain is expected,
so stay cautious.

237
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:55,189
At sea, waves up to 4 meters
are expected.

238
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,665
Wave alert in effect tonight
all across the South Sea.

239
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,008
But should be calm tomorrow
once the rain stops.

240
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,134
Colder temperatures,,,

241
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,734
- Captain. Your dinner.
- Come in.

242
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,616
What?

243
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,447
Have you ever...

244
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,489
smuggled in people before?

245
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,457
Don't tell your grandmother.
You got that?

246
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,561
- Yes, sir.
- Go on.

247
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,299
Yes, Captain.

248
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,016
It's raining hard.
You think it's okay?

249
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,217
Don't worry.
It's gonna pass.

250
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,858
How many are we boarding?

251
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,928
Bos'n! Ho-young!

252
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,995
- Yes, Captain!
- 1 0 o'clock.

253
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,271
I see a boat coming.
Go take a look.

254
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,072
Chang-wook!
Dong-sik!

255
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,544
Dong-sik.
You watch this side.

256
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,349
Chang-wook!
Do you see anything?

257
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,678
It's too dark.

258
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,684
I can't see anything
cuz of the rain.

259
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,692
1 0 o'clock.
Up ahead in the distance.

260
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,519
I know! I'm looking.

261
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,263
It should be a small boat.
Keep a close watch!

262
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,662
- It's here!
- Where? Where!

263
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,670
9 o'clock.

264
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,797
- Over there.
- Where?

265
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,034
Turn on the searchlight!

266
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,971
Wait.
Need to make sure.

267
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,573
If it's the right one,
they'll signal.

268
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,287
That must be the right boat.

269
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,803
What is this? A game?

270
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,573
- What the fuck?
- It's a freighter?

271
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:27,819
Attention!

272
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,744
Let's get ready!

273
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,486
Load them up quick.

274
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,552
- Is this the Junjin?
- Yes.

275
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,894
Bring the boat closer!
Be careful!

276
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,327
- What?
- Throw the rope!

277
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,262
Boat closer!

278
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,171
- Pull it!
- Sending your way!

279
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,173
Throw the bags!

280
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,574
Jump, jump!

281
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,908
It's okay.

282
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,479
It's okay. Jump!

283
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,296
Now!

284
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,537
Watch where you jump!

285
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,209
Whose bag is this?

286
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,511
This is a complete mess.

287
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,214
Hurry up. Jump!

288
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,348
Go to the back!

289
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,515
Hey, sit down!

290
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,517
Please help these women.

291
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,531
Shit! That's bad luck.
Women on my ship...

292
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,092
- Hold on!
- I got you.

293
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,826
I want to do it.
Let me!

294
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,672
Here.
Come to me!

295
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,972
- Stretch your arm!
- I got it!

296
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,911
- Now!
- One, two, three!

297
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,583
Watch your step.

298
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,689
Hey, you.
Come to me!

299
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,281
I'll grab you. Over here!

300
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,518
Do you want to get caught?
Hurry up!

301
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,790
Haven't got all night.

302
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,864
Over here!

303
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,838
It's okay! Trust me!

304
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,832
Give me your hand!

305
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,370
Don't look down!

306
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,209
Here.

307
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,586
Untie the ropes!

308
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,851
Dong-sik, put these away!

309
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,621
No, no!
Someone fell in the water!

310
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,898
Dong-sik!

311
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,196
Son of a bitch.

312
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,567
Dong-sik!

313
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,567
Turn on the searchlight!

314
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,204
Chang-wook! Quick!

315
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,449
- Where'd he go?
- Dong-sik!!

316
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,455
Captain Kang,
turn on the lights!

317
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,820
Dong-sik's going to die
out there.

318
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,958
That crazy son of a bitch.

319
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,828
- Dong-sik!
- Where are you?

320
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,996
Hold tight.

321
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,820
We have to do
mouth-to-mouth.

322
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,088
She needs mouth-to-mouth.

323
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,223
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What?

324
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,133
She needs it.

325
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,903
Dong-sik!
Are you crazy?

326
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,798
Waves can swallow you up!
You think it's a joke?

327
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,373
Let's all gather over here!

328
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,506
Don't go in there!

329
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,915
Keep everyone out of
the engine room!

330
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,119
Are we supposed to
give these out?

331
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:07,298
You ignorant bastard.
Never been on Korean Air?

332
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,230
Meals are served right after
take off.

333
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,165
Like you've been on one.

334
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,395
Now...

335
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,133
each person take one ramen.

336
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,867
- Take just one.
- Water is limited, so take what's given.

337
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,952
Oh, no...
You' re all wet.

338
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,617
Which do you want?

339
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,826
Thank you.

340
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,796
Chang-wook. Chang-wook!

341
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,267
What are you doing?

342
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,633
Look at that guy sitting
dangerously on the anchor line.

343
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,999
Go stop him!

344
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,041
- Come out of there!
- Sorry, no more water.

345
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,510
Oh, no.
You're all wet...

346
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,609
Here, this will warm you up.

347
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,121
Haven't I seen you before?

348
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,251
Open the thermos.

349
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:09,889
Sure we haven't met?

350
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,124
You have to put this away.

351
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,800
Why did you?
That's your food.

352
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,238
You really meant for us
to eat it?

353
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,374
Is this boat going
straight in?

354
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,409
Yeah, of course.

355
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,710
Are you sure?

356
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,642
Yes, I'm sure.
Why're you so suspicious?

357
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,286
Then why hand these out?

358
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,748
This is to put us

359
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,948
in the fish hold for days,
so we can shit here.

360
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,159
What? Why shit in that?
There's a bathroom.

361
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,524
There's a bathroom back there!

362
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,356
Is this your first smuggling job?

363
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,425
Why?

364
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,999
Listen up!

365
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,804
Don't eat it. Salty food will
only make you thirsty.

366
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,502
This is our toilet.

367
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:03,843
- What's his problem?
- We're only trying to be nice.

368
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,210
Don't sit on the net.

369
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,513
- You shouldn't be here.
- What?

370
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,917
Come, It's cold out.
Watch your feet.

371
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,693
What are you doing?

372
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,563
It's okay. Go inside.

373
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,867
Watch your head.

374
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,540
Where're you taking me?

375
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,478
This is the engine room.
Never seen one before, right?

376
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,714
It's a little noisy,
but it's nice and warm.

377
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,218
What are you waiting for?

378
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,522
Watch your head.

379
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,135
I can go by myself.

380
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,683
- Come here.
- Let me go.

381
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,549
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

382
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,626
This is the best for
seasickness.

383
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:25,651
What are you doing?

384
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,799
You have to rub the arm
and circulate the blood first.

385
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,734
My grandma just shoves
the needle right in.

386
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,262
Your grandmother is wrong.

387
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,672
Here...

388
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,372
Too late for that.
Hands off!

389
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,994
Thank you...

390
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,227
for saving my life earlier.

391
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,465
That was nothing.
I'm a sailor, you know.

392
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,941
Sit over there.

393
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,714
Do you remember
what happened in the water?

394
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:27,955
Yes.

395
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,723
You squeezed my neck so tight,
I thought it'd break.

396
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,565
- Really?
- Yeah...

397
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,933
What's your blood type?

398
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,104
Why do you ask?

399
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,810
I'm a type O.

400
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,880
Hey! You're not nauseous
anymore.

401
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,950
- Hold on a minute.
- Where are you going?

402
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,383
Just wait a sec.

403
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,323
Captain Kang.
Why'd you stop the boat?

404
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,422
We're on standby.

405
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,734
It's too risky to go in now.
They're going to call us.

406
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,299
We'll just have to wait.

407
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,375
Going to keep them out like that?
What if someone sees?

408
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,840
There're no boats at this hour.

409
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,949
Don't worry. I'll put them all
in the fish hold.

410
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,281
The fish hold.

411
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,891
You should get some sleep,
or something to eat.

412
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,456
Dong-sik just took
the last ramen.

413
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,598
You can't pamper him
cuz he's young.

414
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,130
He has to learn the work.

415
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,804
Why did the boat
suddenly stop?

416
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,908
Probably nothing. Maybe just to
meet the schedule.

417
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,318
Have you ever tried this
in China?

418
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,382
Of course.
This is 'fanbeimei'.

419
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,851
What?

420
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,422
Pang-gah-mae.

421
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,525
Pangahmae.

422
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,463
Guess that's what you call it.
You have it in China too?

423
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,626
I've never
had this kind before.

424
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,696
It's 'cup'-pangahme.

425
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,408
It's probably ready.
Careful, it's hot.

426
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,746
Look at me.
I forgot the kimchi.

427
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,111
No, it's okay.

428
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,107
Do you want some?

429
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,415
No, you go ahead
and eat.

430
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,657
Can I have a sip?

431
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,106
It's good.

432
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,372
You made it...

433
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,207
Right.

434
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,718
Actually, this isn't the
real deal.

435
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,986
To cook the real pangahmae
that we fishermen eat,

436
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,858
you start with the seafood.

437
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,065
Crabs, sea squirts, octopus,
sea cucumbers, oysters,

438
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,497
and turban shells.
You put these in.

439
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,604
Then the sliced up hot pepper.

440
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,334
That's a real pangahmae fit for
a Yeosu fisherman.

441
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,006
You wouldn't know.

442
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,815
By the way, how old are you
to keep talking down?

443
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm...

444
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,122
twenty-six.

445
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,555
- Born in 1 974?
- Yeah.

446
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,790
Never mind then.

447
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,264
What's your name?

448
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,898
I'm Dong-sik.

449
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,836
You?

450
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,443
I' m Hong-mae.
Hong-mae.

451
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,368
Hong-mae...

452
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,206
How'd you end up on a
boat like this?

453
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,885
I' m going to Korea
to find my older brother.

454
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,055
He's been gone for 6 years,
but we haven't heard from him.

455
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,859
What's your relation to
this brother?

456
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,228
You don't know what
a brother is?

457
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,833
Course I know.
Your real brother?

458
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,303
- Yes.
- Oh!

459
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,573
It's just that in Korea, girls have
many kinds of brothers.

460
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,937
So... where is your brother?

461
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,315
In Seoul...

462
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,415
Oh, no!

463
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,655
It's all wet.

464
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,992
#247-6 Guro 3-dong.

465
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,425
Guro 3-dong.

466
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,662
Guro Gongdan Station.
On subway line #2.

467
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,339
I've been there. The subway
runs above ground.

468
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,172
- Then it's not a subway.
- No, it is.

469
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,103
It just runs above ground.

470
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,440
Then they should call it
an aboveground train.

471
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,284
I should go up to the deck.

472
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,154
You can stay here.
I'll talk to the engineer.

473
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,596
I can't stay here when
everyone else is in the cold.

474
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,463
Thank you for the ramen.

475
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,203
Have you already been to
the engine room?

476
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,336
Sorry?

477
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,413
I saw everything.
What did you do there?

478
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,313
What are you talking about?

479
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:32,279
A woman on a smuggling boat's
engine room, it's obvious.

480
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,924
Get yourself a marriage certificate
as soon as we arrive.

481
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,456
Then you'll be a Korean citizen.

482
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,065
You won't get deported.

483
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,962
I'm not interested.
Stop it.

484
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,996
He looked cute for a fisherman.
Nice little face and all.

485
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,303
You're unbelievable.

486
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,843
Why did you come back out?
It's warm in there.

487
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,642
Go back in. Come on.

488
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,269
Cover her feet too.
It's cold.

489
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,243
Anyone else hurt?

490
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,342
Can I get a Band-Aid?

491
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,956
What are you doing?

492
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,517
Nothing, nothing...

493
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,326
I'm sure we met before.

494
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,297
What on earth are you
talking about?

495
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,630
Come here.

496
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,209
Did you drink the water
I gave you?

497
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,039
- Are you warm now?
- Not warm enough.

498
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,914
I better take you to a
warmer place then.

499
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,812
Well, if you insist.

500
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,653
Watch the ropes.

501
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,858
Can I sleep here?

502
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,465
Of course.

503
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,134
Do you have leftover blankets?

504
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,571
Blankets?

505
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,475
We'll have nice, soft blankets
on the floor.

506
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,344
Can I stay here until
we arrive, huh?

507
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,310
That's exactly what I want.

508
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,750
You can stay for a
thousand years.

509
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,957
We can fool around
all we want.

510
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,774
Hey!

511
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,042
What the fuck?

512
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,316
- Pull it out, you little shit!
- Hold on!

513
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,522
Told you not to do it
on the boat! It's bad luck!

514
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,994
I was almost there.

515
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,020
- Get out!
- I'm staying!

516
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,765
Get a grip!

517
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,298
I didn't do it!

518
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,263
- Get out!
- I'm going!

519
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,002
Get over there!

520
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,604
Asshole.

521
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,009
Careful not to catch a cold.

522
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,401
Thank you.

523
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:18,610
Can I ask what you do? How can you
read a book in the middle of all this?

524
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,310
I was a grade school teacher.

525
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,810
Oh my...

526
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,319
A school teacher on
a boat like this.

527
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,686
We can make 1 0 times more
working in Korea.

528
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,097
You know that.

529
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,231
No one here is going there
to stuff his own belly.

530
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,699
They're all going for their
families back home.

531
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,643
It's the same for us.

532
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,971
What is that?

533
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,609
My wife and daughters.

534
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:58,751
Your daughters are very pretty.

535
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,514
Wake up.
Boat approaching.

536
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,783
Wake your asses up!

537
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,918
There's a boat coming!

538
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,800
Sit down, sit down.

539
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,680
Listen closely.

540
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,079
A boat is coming,
so get in the fish hold.

541
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,912
If they see you, we get
in trouble.

542
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,555
Dong-sik, open the hatch.
And get the ladder.

543
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,351
Hurry up and help him.

544
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,393
Be careful!

545
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,361
Move out of the way.

546
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,495
Use the ladder to go down.

547
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,966
Be careful.
It's deeper than you think.

548
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,764
Don't push!

549
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:22,768
To the engine room.

550
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,109
No, I won't go.

551
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,405
Want me there instead?

552
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,775
Come here.

553
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,269
Hurry up with the ladder!
Come on!

554
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,207
Come on, hurry.
Out the way.

555
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,338
Careful. Hold my hand.

556
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:06,109
Move out the way!
Move!

557
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,378
Poor thing.
It smells bad, right?

558
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,021
- Do I have to go in there?
- I know, it's horrible.

559
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,688
Not on the net.

560
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,299
I knew this would happen.

561
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,000
I'd better give you the
acupuncture remedy again.

562
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,194
Come here.

563
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,971
It's the smell.

564
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,102
That's what we fishermen
smell like.

565
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,941
Dong-Sik!
Fetch the mop!

566
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,643
- Go inside.
- Again?

567
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,487
Stay in the engine room
until we arrive.

568
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,758
No, it doesn't feel right.

569
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,823
I can't stand you being in
the fish hold.

570
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:57,963
Hey!

571
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,803
Are you going to put us
in there again?

572
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,639
That fish hold is no place
for people.

573
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,267
It's meant for fish.

574
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,614
There's nowhere else to hide.
Just hang on.

575
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,650
You'll get used to it
after a couple of times.

576
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,910
It can be several days.

577
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,023
Let us in the cabin or
the engine room.

578
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,783
Put us somewhere else.

579
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,955
The engine room?
Yeah, right.

580
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,229
Why didn't you just take
Korean Air then?

581
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,403
We paid a lot to be
on this boat.

582
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,203
Didn't you get your cuts?

583
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,269
How can you treat fellow Koreans
worse than the Chinese?

584
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,746
Don't you agree?

585
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,414
Yeah! He's right!

586
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,881
Fellow Korean my ass.

587
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,085
Do you know what lMF is?

588
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,524
These are rough times, pal.
Fellow Koreans?

589
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,418
It's hard enough cuz of
the lMF crisis!

590
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,394
Give us our money back!

591
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,523
You low-life scumbags.
Sit down!

592
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,308
Sit down. Sit.

593
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,181
You South Korean scumbag!

594
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,687
I'll fucking kill you!

595
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,719
Captain!

596
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,182
Captain!

597
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,751
You have to save him.
He could get killed!

598
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,765
Then you stay in the
engine room?

599
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,629
Captain Kang!

600
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,440
Stop! That's Dong-sik!

601
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,500
- You'll kill him.
- Yeah, it's enough.

602
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,576
Bos'n.

603
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,041
- Yes, Captain.
- Throw him in the water.

604
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,710
Are you deaf?!

605
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,644
Move over!

606
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,323
No, no!

607
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,089
- One, two, three!
- No!

608
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,668
You motherfuckers!

609
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,863
You fucking assholes!

610
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,238
Listen up!

611
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,372
On this boat, I'm the president,
the judge, and your freakin' father!

612
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,313
Your life is in my hands.
Understand?

613
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,683
Please forgive us.

614
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,018
Please help me!

615
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,131
- Please help! Help!
- Let's go inside.

616
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,061
- Please save me!
- Dong-sik, go help him.

617
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,502
I want to live!

618
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,404
Fucking South Korean scumbags.

619
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:53,834
Fuck!

620
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,880
Try to bear the smell a bit.
I'll keep the hatch open.

621
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,018
Thank you. See you later.

622
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,928
How could you...?
This wasn't the deal!

623
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,555
- It's the bos'n.
- Hey, Kyung-koo.

624
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,133
You go help Dong-Sik
with the rope.

625
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,265
Yes, sir.

626
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,635
Asshole.
Go fuck yourself.

627
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,340
Let me help you with
your bag.

628
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,671
Get off me.

629
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:31,246
- Let me help you go in.
- Hey! What is this!

630
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,825
Get up.

631
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,229
It's nice in here, right?

632
00:47:54,471 --> 00:48:00,239
Once I put this blanket here,
it'll be like first class.

633
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,772
This blanket's clean.

634
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,781
You just sit back and relax.

635
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,314
Wait a minute.

636
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,386
Are you trying to take
advantage of me?

637
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,347
No way.

638
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,557
Never.

639
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,324
I'm not capable of doing
such a thing. Really!

640
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,628
I mean...

641
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,141
I can do it cuz I'm a man.
Healthy and all...

642
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,838
But I'm not the kind
who'd treat a lady like that.

643
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,506
Yeah...
That's what I meant.

644
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:15,379
When I go to Seoul,
I'll invite you to Guro 3-dong.

645
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,521
- I promise.
- Really?

646
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,115
Seoul is very far away.

647
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,818
You can take a few days off.

648
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:29,059
True... Will you let me sleep
at your place?

649
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,931
We always have days off when
we return from sea.

650
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,399
Promise me you'll come?

651
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,410
Dong-sik?
Are you in here?

652
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:46,243
Yes?

653
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,484
What are you doing?
Get up here.

654
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:50,549
Wan-ho!

655
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:51,918
What?

656
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,455
Come here.

657
00:49:56,793 --> 00:50:00,661
Is it okay if Hong-mae
stays here?

658
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:06,201
Stay here where it's comfortable.
I'm the engineer.

659
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:12,335
In here, he's the king.
Even the Captain respects him.

660
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:18,512
This is the Taechang.
Patrol ship is making its rounds.

661
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,748
This is the Junjin.
Where exactly?

662
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,246
What brings you all the way
to international waters?

663
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,149
International waters?

664
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:34,662
What's wrong, Junjin?
Catch some endangered fish?

665
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,432
Get ready to fish.

666
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:49,136
Cover the fish hold
with the net.

667
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,907
Hurry!
Wan-ho, hide inside.

668
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,112
Stay absolutely still,
and don't make a sound!

669
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:13,802
- Will they be okay in there?
- lt'll be fine. Act natural.

670
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,201
Junjin!

671
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,508
Turn off your engine, hah?

672
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,405
Bring me closer to the boat.

673
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,795
I know these guys well,
so wait over there.

674
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,922
Don't just stand around.

675
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:53,070
You look younger every time.
What's wrong with your hair?

676
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,877
And you must be new.

677
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,675
Wan-ho!

678
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,886
Still hiding from debt collectors?

679
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,422
Come out!

680
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:25,305
Get up.

681
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:29,337
- Dick caught in the net, huh?
- What are you doing?

682
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,447
What did you catch?
Covering it all up.

683
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,484
We didn't catch shit.
We haven't even started.

684
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,015
Why are you sitting out
in this cold?

685
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,883
Let's go upstairs.

686
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,023
I'm busy today so let's have
a quick drink out here.

687
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,561
What are you, the Mafia?

688
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,865
Why are you standing around?

689
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,600
Dong-sik, go get the
leftover sashimi.

690
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:58,865
Get ready to cast the net.

691
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,108
I have something to discuss
with Chief Kim.

692
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:12,516
Measuring my mesh size?
Getting strict on me now?

693
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,086
Can't help it.
This is bureaucracy.

694
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:20,358
My men are watching.
I have to do it right.

695
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,092
- You can go now.
- Yes, Captain.

696
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,070
Seems like the mesh is
a little too small.

697
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,633
It would have been nicer
on the bridge.

698
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,621
So sweet.

699
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,482
This is the perk of being
a fisherman.

700
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,489
What was that?

701
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,627
Wait...
Did you hear that?

702
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,005
Is it coming from below?

703
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,245
Is Wan-ho fixing something
again?

704
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,878
Oh... Wan-ho!

705
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,544
He's fixing the radiator, sir.

706
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:21,086
It's an old boat.
The radiator is rusty.

707
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,549
Radiator?

708
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,917
It keeps breaking down.

709
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,522
Shit.

710
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,533
You won't find anything on
an old boat.

711
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,863
So go catch the big fish.

712
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,471
What time is it?
Let me see.

713
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,714
Heard these are quite popular
in Yeosu nowadays.

714
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,713
What are you talking about?

715
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,207
Come on.

716
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:53,879
Think you can fish these
without cutting me in?

717
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:59,123
I'm a sailor too. Need to make
a living out in the sea.

718
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,790
I've no idea what you're saying.
We'll miss the fish.

719
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,962
You should go.
We have to start working.

720
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,526
Damn it.

721
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:11,431
Do you want me to open this
to make my point?

722
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,907
What the hell are you doing?

723
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:18,007
If you're really a sailor, mind your
freakin' manners on my boat.

724
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,873
Who the hell are you?
Threatening to open my fish hold.

725
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,645
Get down here!

726
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,319
Open it!
It'll be your grave!

727
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,189
Such a temper.

728
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:39,258
Let's not do this
in front of the boys.

729
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,741
Asshole.

730
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,848
See you at Yeo's office.

731
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:55,948
I'm leaving.

732
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,486
Hey!

733
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,416
Hey! He's leaving!

734
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,058
Looks like a sea fog is
creeping in!

735
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,559
See you back on the
golden shore!

736
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,395
Sea fog my ass.

737
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,210
Kyung-koo!
Put this away.

738
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,113
- Open the hatch.
- Yes, sir.

739
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,580
What are you waiting for?

740
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,992
Are they asleep?

741
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,501
Must be sleeping.
Guess they got used to it here.

742
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,633
Sleeping on top of each other,
not minding the smell anymore.

743
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,705
Are you okay?

744
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,578
Hey!

745
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:01,979
Hey?

746
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,482
Get up.

747
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,863
Come on. Get up!

748
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,690
Anybody awake?

749
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,233
Get out.
The gas leaked.

750
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,003
- Gas?
- Don't breathe!

751
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,714
Dong-sik, come out.
Come out!

752
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:34,913
- Don't close the hatch.
- What's wrong?

753
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,411
He says the gas leaked.

754
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,416
Shit. Wan-ho!

755
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,154
Wan-ho!

756
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,804
- What happened?
- What is it?

757
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,475
It's Freon gas.

758
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,712
The freezer must've exploded.

759
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,279
- They' re all dead...
- Look!

760
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,248
He just moved.
He's still alive, Captain.

761
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,654
You guys, get back.

762
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,861
Go away.

763
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:04,929
Dong-sik.

764
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,126
Open the hatch
and let the gas out.

765
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,936
Guys, get the ladder.
Go down there once it's clear.

766
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,239
- Bos'n.
- Yes, Captain.

767
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,170
Bring all the bodies
up to the deck.

768
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,578
Sir?

769
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,017
It's better...

770
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,320
that they're all dead.

771
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,040
Dong-sik.

772
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,546
I think that's all of them.

773
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,683
- Right?
- Yeah...

774
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:50,899
Move!

775
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,893
What are you doing?

776
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,405
We have to draw the blood.
It'll attract the fish.

777
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,871
Better to be fed to the fish than
be bloated corpses.

778
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:15,385
If one of them
washes up ashore,

779
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,515
we're all finished.

780
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,084
Got it?

781
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,389
Wan-ho, you want to be in prison
or with your daughter?

782
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,203
You too, bos'n.

783
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:30,967
Make sure it's done properly.

784
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,755
Are we really doing this?

785
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,556
We have no choice.

786
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,957
It's the captain's orders.
We have to obey.

787
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,658
- Here.
- That's right.

788
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,963
Why're you standing around?

789
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,133
You're in your work clothes,
aren't you?

790
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,431
They're all dead.

791
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,310
It's not like it's going to
hurt, right?

792
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,377
Look, they're fine...

793
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,207
They're dead anyway.

794
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,781
We're doing them a favor.

795
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,625
Wan-ho, don't just stand there.

796
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,091
Dong-sik, you too.

797
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,104
Dong-sik, you go in.

798
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,197
He's just a kid, who went to
a marine science magnet.

799
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:42,570
What the hell?

800
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:48,583
He gets excused just cuz
he went to marine science high?

801
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,680
- You fucking...
- Stop it!

802
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,353
It's no time to fight.

803
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,083
Dong-sik, get to it.
What's your problem?

804
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,493
Goddamn it. Stop fighting
and get back to work!

805
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,326
There's no time.
Look at all the bodies!

806
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,907
See, chop the big ones up
into smaller pieces.

807
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,143
Otherwise they might surface.
Got it?

808
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:31,087
There was another girl
besides this woman.

809
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,857
Chang-wook,
what are you mumbling about?

810
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,988
Let's get to it.
We should hurry up.

811
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,762
- That one's big.
- Look, like this.

812
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,429
Look at him go.
Not shy after all.

813
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,537
With the small ones,
just draw blood and throw over.

814
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,377
Should be fine, right?

815
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,943
The intestines are
spilling out of this one.

816
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,621
What? I can't hear you.

817
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:19,891
Yeah, that's what I meant.

818
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,601
Here it is.

819
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,501
What the hell are you
mumbling about?

820
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,044
I'll let them know.

821
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,541
Really?

822
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,748
Let's see. It's hot...

823
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,724
Okay.

824
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,122
I'll let them know.

825
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,650
Is someone in here?

826
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,027
Anyone?

827
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,292
Kyung-koo!

828
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,200
You have that girl,
don't you?

829
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,660
The little one

830
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,072
Turning silent cuz I'm here?

831
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,320
I'll tell the bos'n.

832
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,364
- Chang-wook!
- Holy shit!

833
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,102
- Scared the shit out of me.
- What are you doing there?

834
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,606
Why?

835
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,472
Hurry up. The bos'n called
a meeting.

836
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,311
Come on.

837
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,645
Son of a bitch.

838
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,716
Creeping up on me.

839
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,523
Don't push.

840
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,363
- Hold still.
- You asshole!

841
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,595
Don't move.

842
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,570
Kyung-koo, did you see
that young chick?

843
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,607
How the hell should
I know?

844
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,208
- Should've had that woman.
- What're you saying?

845
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,280
You had her,
but I never got my turn.

846
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,145
Out of your minds?
What the hell?!

847
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:49,948
Get your shit together.

848
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,146
Listen up.

849
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,614
Nothing happened on
this boat today.

850
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,351
- No, no!
- What?

851
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,660
We can keep this a secret for
the rest of our life, right?

852
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,429
To be honest,
why should we care?

853
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,598
Captain ordered the smuggling
and chopping the bodies.

854
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,294
What?

855
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,429
If I tell the police,
the captain goes to prison.

856
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,275
What the fuck is wrong
with everyone?

857
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:30,754
We're all in the same boat.

858
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,487
It's literally a boat.
We're all in it!

859
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,762
- Bos'n.
- What?

860
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,693
Once the fog clears,
we're heading for shore, right?

861
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:42,497
That's right.
Then it's all over.

862
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,648
Hong-mae.

863
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,285
I know...
It's your last wish.

864
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,988
Wan-ho?

865
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,689
Stop doing this to me.

866
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:12,861
I should've listened.

867
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,599
Watch your head!

868
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:21,540
It's so hot.
They're burning.

869
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,033
Wan-ho, are you okay?

870
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:33,518
Hong-mae.

871
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,283
You can come out now.

872
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,584
I brought real ramen,
the pangahme for you.

873
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:53,001
- We didn't have hot pepper.
- Will you kill me too?

874
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,370
What?

875
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,513
I saw everything.

876
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:00,815
What are you talking about?

877
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,519
It's not what you think.

878
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,884
Don't come near me.

879
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,046
You have to be quiet.

880
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,919
Yeah, I know.
Take your filthy hands off me.

881
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:13,188
- Where are you going?
- Have to go home.

882
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,991
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

883
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:15,893
Wan-ho!

884
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,431
- Okay, I got it.
- Wan-ho!

885
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,769
Come down from there.

886
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,496
What?

887
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,572
It's scary up there.

888
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,198
Wan-ho, what are you doing?

889
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,577
My god, you were right.

890
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,976
It must have been so hot.

891
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,415
What are you doing with
dead people's belongings?

892
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,515
Look. Here it is.

893
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,592
Why did you take that out?

894
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:51,832
We have to burn it.
Why'd you fucking take it out?

895
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,064
This man...

896
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,037
wants me to tell his family
where he is.

897
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:10,107
I should take this
to the police station, right?

898
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:13,518
What? Are you saying
you'll turn us in?

899
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,422
We need to ask the police
for his address.

900
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,660
Forget the police.
This was an accident!

901
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:23,524
It's cuz the boat was so old!
You know that too!

902
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,294
Kang Chul-joo...

903
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,133
Let's just stop.

904
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,809
It's all my fault.

905
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,150
Wan-ho.

906
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,549
Where are you going?

907
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,121
Let's talk about this.

908
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:50,524
- Talk about what?
- Let's talk over a drink.

909
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:55,686
Where's the bottle of soju
you stashed away?

910
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:03,160
They're already dead.
What's the use!

911
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,098
Let's have a drink together.

912
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,108
What we did today.

913
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:13,471
Can't keep it just
in our heads forever.

914
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,748
Poor thing.

915
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,960
I'm sorry...

916
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,069
I'll send them the news.

917
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:39,364
Rest in peace.

918
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,378
I'll follow soon...

919
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,341
Even if I lose my life...

920
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,383
I'm taking you to the shore.

921
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:50,223
We're going to Guro 3-dong.

922
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,699
Kyung-koo, shine it my way!

923
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,503
The sun is up.
Can't even see in broad daylight.

924
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,176
You!

925
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,268
Where have you been?

926
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:11,909
Wan-ho's not
in the engine room, right?

927
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:14,876
Shit.
Where the hell is he?

928
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:16,143
Kyung-koo!

929
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,908
- Yes, sir.
- Shine it that way!

930
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,317
It's no use.
We can't see anything.

931
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,686
I definitely heard it.
Someone fell in the sea.

932
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,454
- Wan-ho!
- Did you hear anything?

933
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:31,865
Wan-ho's been acting strange
since yesterday.

934
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,500
Talking to himself and everything.

935
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:38,499
Can't see a thing.

936
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,267
Wan-ho!

937
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,766
Wan-ho!

938
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,434
Shit.

939
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,049
Your new place.

940
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,489
What are you doing here?

941
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,158
Can't you see?

942
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:03,359
Think they know
anything about the engine?

943
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:05,132
I'm the only one.

944
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:07,068
So...

945
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,137
you're going to stay down
here now?

946
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:13,297
What the hell are you doing
in the engine room?

947
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:22,649
Isn't it weird that
Wan-ho just disappeared?

948
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,011
Wan-ho? Don't remember
anyone like that.

949
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:29,857
I'm the engineer now.

950
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,418
What are you two doing here?

951
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,661
You two dating?

952
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,727
Move over.

953
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,869
I know Wan-ho used to
stash his...

954
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:46,972
Dong-sik.

955
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,409
Don't dare tell anyone,
you asshole.

956
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,978
You're keeping it all?

957
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,914
Fuck off.

958
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:59,347
You can be the engineer.
This is mine.

959
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,622
Kyung-koo, hold on.
Let's split it in half.

960
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,959
- Cut me off some.
- You idiot.

961
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:09,353
Damn! That's supposed to be
my money!

962
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:10,828
I'm the engineer.

963
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,329
Do you think there's
anything else?

964
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,168
What else would there be?

965
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,508
Should've looked for
the cash first.

966
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,567
That could have been mine.

967
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,951
Do you smell that?

968
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:32,915
What?

969
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,219
Chang-wook.

970
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:42,624
Don't you think Kyung-koo's
been acting weird?

971
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:43,928
What about?

972
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,698
He keeps taking stuff
and bringing it somewhere.

973
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,997
Like now. He took the money
and went somewhere.

974
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,570
Like he's going to
see someone, a girl.

975
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,877
- Girl?
- Let's follow him.

976
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,670
Kyung-koo, that asshole.

977
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:02,413
Chang-wook.

978
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:04,847
Chang-wook!

979
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:07,546
There she is!

980
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,388
Huh, nothing.

981
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:18,020
There's nothing here.
Let's just go. Come on.

982
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,402
She's here!
The girl, she's here!

983
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,004
The girl is here!

984
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,971
See? I told you!

985
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,633
Told you there's another girl.

986
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,946
Yeah, she's the one.
The little one.

987
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,144
Don't move.
Stay right there.

988
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,881
Chang-wook, come here.

989
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,860
Let's keep her hidden.
We'll keep it a secret.

990
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,159
Between you and me.

991
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:54,198
Fine, but she's mine.
I found her.

992
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,358
Also...

993
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,502
imagine Kyung-koo finding her.

994
01:22:58,673 --> 01:22:59,867
No way!

995
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,372
She's all mine.

996
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,909
I'll be the only one
havin' her.

997
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:06,941
What now?

998
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,209
Let's go up for now.
People will get suspicious.

999
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,546
I want her now.

1000
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,982
She'll be here, right?

1001
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,120
Hurry up and get over here!

1002
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,655
What the hell were you doing?
You lazy asses.

1003
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,734
Chang-wook!
You tend to the net.

1004
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:27,969
Dong-sik! On that side.

1005
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:28,993
We're fishing?

1006
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,396
- Dong-sik! Unwind anchor.
- Seriously?

1007
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:36,243
What the hell's the point?
In a situation like this.

1008
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:40,081
What situation? Huh?

1009
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:44,842
Cast the net, catch fish,
then we go home.

1010
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,887
Let go all lines!
Engine room get ready!

1011
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,646
Engine room!

1012
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,215
Turn on the generator
and get ready to cast the net.

1013
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:02,334
Get the fuck off her!

1014
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,196
Dong-sik, please!

1015
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:09,871
Huh?
"Dong-sik, please"?

1016
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:16,010
You already did her,
haven't you?

1017
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,051
You already did.

1018
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,753
She's fucking mine.
When did you do it?

1019
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:23,715
What are you two doing?

1020
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:27,860
Captain!
He's hiding a girl.

1021
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,160
He's been hiding her
all along.

1022
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:35,998
Captain.

1023
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,399
She really doesn't know anything.

1024
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:42,033
She's been here the whole time.

1025
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:46,607
I don't know anything.

1026
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,177
What would I know?

1027
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,322
And... when we get to Yeosu,

1028
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,922
I'm going to make her
my bride.

1029
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,451
We're going to get married.

1030
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,125
Even if she knows something,
I'm her husband.

1031
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:09,059
She couldn't possibly tell
the police, right?

1032
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,673
So she did see something.

1033
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,634
Captain.
I'll be responsible for her.

1034
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:21,573
Stupid fuck. If she tells anyone,
we're doomed.

1035
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,481
No.

1036
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:25,243
Dong-sik!

1037
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,312
She's not your problem.
He's going to snitch on you!

1038
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:31,290
- You crazy asshole.
- Kyung-koo's going to snitch?

1039
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,958
Kyung-koo's part of
the Junjin crew.

1040
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,994
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

1041
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,028
Dong-sik, you're part of
the Junjin crew, right?

1042
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,165
Yes, sir.

1043
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:42,494
What about her?

1044
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,830
What is she?

1045
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,099
- Dong-sik.
- What about Wan-ho?

1046
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,708
If we're all part of the crew,

1047
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,844
why did you kill him? Why?

1048
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,485
You must be out of your mind.

1049
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,513
Bos'n.

1050
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,484
Make sure she's
properly taken care of.

1051
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:06,753
So she doesn't float.

1052
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,222
- Dong-sik!
- What are you doing?!

1053
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,833
Kill me instead!

1054
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,559
- Dong-sik.
- Hong-mae!

1055
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,630
- Hong-mae!
- Dong-sik!

1056
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,272
Bos'n! This is murder!

1057
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:20,572
I know.

1058
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,670
- Hong-mae!
- Dong-sik.

1059
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:27,647
Get your shit together.
You don't even know her.

1060
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,777
Are you going to risk the crew,
our families,

1061
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,513
and the Junjin
just because of that girl?

1062
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,116
She's nothing!

1063
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,624
Captain...
I haven't done it with her yet.

1064
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,556
Can't kill her yet.

1065
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:41,354
- I'll be back.
- What the hell...?

1066
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:46,993
Hong-mae.

1067
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,260
Hong-mae!

1068
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,432
No!

1069
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:54,006
You freakin' bastard!

1070
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,337
Hong-mae!

1071
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:02,378
You bastard!
Enough is enough!

1072
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:03,677
Where's Hong-mae?

1073
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,311
Where are you fuckers?

1074
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:35,480
Hong-mae!

1075
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,576
Where's Dong-sik?

1076
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:41,854
Son of a bitch.
Hit the same place twice?

1077
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,858
Where's Dong-sik?
Did you get him?

1078
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,087
Captain,
Hong-mae went...

1079
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,060
- What?
- No... Shit!

1080
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,891
Son of a bitch lost his mind.

1081
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:52,530
Kyung-koo!

1082
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:56,935
Shit... Bos'n!

1083
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:58,163
The bridge!

1084
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,043
Coast Guard!
Junjin to Coast Guard!

1085
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,169
What are you doing?!

1086
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,768
- Door's locked!
- 1 27 degrees east,

1087
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:05,744
33 degrees north.

1088
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:06,677
Out of the way!

1089
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,708
Did you copy?
Junjin to Coast Guard!

1090
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,082
This is the Junjin!
1 27 degrees east...

1091
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,647
You ungrateful piece of shit.

1092
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:18,122
Get him out.

1093
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:20,018
Come here,
you son of a bitch.

1094
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,255
Where's Hong-mae?
You know where she is, right?

1095
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:23,427
Let me go.

1096
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,691
Coast Guard to Junjin!

1097
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,495
- Coast Guard can't do shit.
- Have you hit a reef?

1098
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,660
Calling nearby vessels
to the rescue!

1099
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:31,432
Coordinates are useless
in a sea fog.

1100
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:32,803
127 degrees...

1101
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,036
Get inside.

1102
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,934
In there, you piece of shit.

1103
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,878
Kyung-koo, I'll find the girl.
Stay here.

1104
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,145
Look closely.

1105
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,949
Dong-sik, you stay put!

1106
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,054
Coast Guard patrol is
on its way!

1107
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:55,024
Junjin, there are a lot of freighters
in your area.

1108
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:57,857
It's dangerous cuz of the sea fog,
so stop your engine and wait.

1109
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:10,909
Hong-mae!

1110
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:13,044
Hong-mae...

1111
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:16,174
Hong-mae.

1112
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,042
It's me, Dong-sik.

1113
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:21,919
I' m sorry. So sorry.

1114
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,421
I have to go home.

1115
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,892
I need to go home...

1116
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,765
We will.
We' ll go home.

1117
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,436
We'll go home together.

1118
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,731
Coast Guard will be here soon.

1119
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,007
Just hang on for a bit.

1120
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,743
Hong-mae...

1121
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,374
I hate it here.

1122
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,581
There, there.
You're with me now.

1123
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,089
Hong-mae's in here, right?

1124
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,617
Couldn't find her
anywhere else.

1125
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,858
Did you do it with her again?

1126
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,298
Did you?

1127
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:13,966
Look at our little Dong-sik.
You're scary.

1128
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,234
You were doing her,
weren't you?

1129
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:18,571
What the fuck?

1130
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:19,635
How many times, huh?

1131
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:22,748
Hong-mae, Hong-mae!

1132
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,617
You little...

1133
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:27,913
Now that you're up close,
your skin is so fair...

1134
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:31,514
You!

1135
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:32,752
You again!

1136
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:36,489
You! Trying to do it
all by yourself again!

1137
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:39,566
I didn't even get to do it.
You two already took turns.

1138
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,764
Are you okay?

1139
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:45,362
Hong-mae, you okay?

1140
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,336
Let's do it here.
Gosh, it smells in here.

1141
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,543
Hong-mae.

1142
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,007
Hong-mae!

1143
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,377
Where are you taking her?

1144
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:55,502
Wait here. I'll take care of
everything from here.

1145
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:57,744
You're not going anywhere,
right?

1146
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:00,510
I'm not going anywhere.

1147
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,741
That son of a bitch.

1148
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,813
Completely broke the engine.

1149
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:40,613
Dong-sik.

1150
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,052
If the Coast Guard finds us...

1151
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,923
we all go to prison and
she gets deported.

1152
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:49,526
Deported.

1153
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:52,432
Got it?

1154
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,126
If we shut her up...

1155
01:32:58,372 --> 01:33:00,932
Lay a hand on her and
I'll kill you first!

1156
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,508
You son of a bitch,
do you really want to die?

1157
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,248
You damn bitch.

1158
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,714
What are you?

1159
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:52,152
What the hell are you?

1160
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,590
Are you a person
or a witch?

1161
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:58,790
What the hell?

1162
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:01,596
There's a hole?

1163
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:12,668
Get up.

1164
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,974
Shit!
The ship's leaking!

1165
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,353
Kyung-koo!
Chang-wook!

1166
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,084
Shit!

1167
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,389
Stop right there!

1168
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:34,623
Dong-sik!

1169
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,538
Dong-sik! Hurry!

1170
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,518
Ho-young!

1171
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:25,951
Hong-mae!

1172
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:29,217
We have to untie this
to use the buoy.

1173
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:42,529
Help! Help!

1174
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:43,970
Who is that?

1175
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,706
Chang-wook, is that you?

1176
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:51,608
Yes! Captain!

1177
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,474
Captain, the ladder!
The ladder!

1178
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:56,438
Who is that?

1179
01:35:58,319 --> 01:35:59,343
Kyung-koo!

1180
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:08,752
Go to the engine room.

1181
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:11,730
The hull is punctured,
so go and plug the hole.

1182
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:15,263
- Or the boat may sink.
- Lot of holes here too.

1183
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,330
Did we hit something?

1184
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,768
Captain! The girl!
Don't kill her!

1185
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:23,036
Plug the hole!

1186
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:25,938
Useless fools.

1187
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:28,173
I'm the only one
who hasn't done it yet!

1188
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:32,682
She's mine!

1189
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:45,792
Bos'n!

1190
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,604
Where'd you all go?

1191
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:53,067
Dong-sik!

1192
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,837
We have to save the ship.

1193
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,946
I can't stop the leak.
Let me out.

1194
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,178
I'm scared!

1195
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,261
- Dong-sik, you bastard!
- Go up.

1196
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:16,829
What are you doing?
The boat is about to sink!

1197
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:19,698
You crazy son of a bitch.

1198
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,829
I'll throw that bitch.

1199
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:24,068
Throw her in the ocean.
Come here!

1200
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:27,735
- Let me go!
- Don't touch her!

1201
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:31,577
- You've gone insane!
- I'll kill you!

1202
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,203
Dong-sik!

1203
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,138
I'm the captain of this boat!

1204
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:38,140
We have to...

1205
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,186
at least save the boat.
Come on, Dong-sik.

1206
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,649
You're no captain.
You are a murderer.

1207
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:48,829
Murderer!

1208
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:03,140
Let's throw the anchor in
the water together.

1209
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:06,313
Wake up.
Our boat is done for!

1210
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,491
This is the Coast Guard patrol!

1211
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:21,617
Junjin, we have poor visibility!

1212
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,429
Sound your horn!

1213
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,029
Dong-sik,
it's the Coast Guard.

1214
01:38:27,468 --> 01:38:29,231
- Hong-mae.
- Junjin! Junjin vessel!

1215
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,998
It's time to go home.

1216
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:32,832
Sound your horn!

1217
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:35,939
Junjin!

1218
01:38:36,877 --> 01:38:38,310
Sound your damn horn!

1219
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:40,679
We can't see you!

1220
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:43,316
Sound your horn!

1221
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,401
We have to throw all this
over board.

1222
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:39,970
It's too heavy.
It' ll sink the boat.

1223
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:44,004
Guys, the boat...

1224
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,038
We can save the boat.

1225
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:14,285
Dong-sik...

1226
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:18,790
Dong-sik.

1227
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:21,695
Dong-sik!

1228
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:29,842
We have to go home...

1229
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:32,977
Go home...

1230
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:51,623
It's okay.

1231
01:42:58,372 --> 01:42:59,361
Hong-mae.

1232
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,141
Dong-sik.

1233
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,083
Thank you...

1234
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:46,001
6 years later

1235
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:15,306
Hey, Kim!

1236
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,637
How about some pork barbeque
with soju?

1237
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:22,982
- What about Guro-dong Dongpo pork?
- Dongpo pork?

1238
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,778
- Where?
- Where we went last week.

1239
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:27,686
Nah, it wasn't good.

1240
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:32,914
Let's go. Pork barbecue or
Dongpo pork, whichever.

1241
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:19,866
What would you like?

1242
01:46:21,575 --> 01:46:23,839
Ramen with rice cake.

1243
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:31,146
One ramen with rice cake!

1244
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:31,976
Got it!

1245
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:36,213
Ma'am.
Do you have hot pepper?

1246
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:38,620
- For the ramen?
- Yes, please.

1247
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:40,624
Can you chop one up
for me?
