Best ketchup we ever made, Katie.

11
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,459
- Too sweet.
- Mr. Smith likes it on the sweet side.

12
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:25,180
All men like it on the sweet side.
Too sweet, Mrs. Smith.

Hello.

14
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,939
- Too flat.
- You can always put spice in...

15
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:40,779
but you can't take it out.
That just came for you.

16
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,779
- Did you get everything?
- Everything.

17
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:46,180
Hay, it's my Princeton catalog.
I've been waiting for this.

18
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,659
Boy, Mama, you should've
taken a swim with me.

That's all I have to do.

So long, Esther. We'll see you later. Bye.

50
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,859
Certainly was hot on the tennis court.

51
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,779
Too hot, if you ask me. Don't
forget to wash your hair.

52
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,859
I won't. Rose is bringing
shampoo from downtown.

53
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,539
- Too sour?
- Just what I told Katie.

54
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,820
Is it all right?

55
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:55,460
Would it start a minor revolution in this
house if dinner was an hour early tonight?

56
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:57,659
Mr. Smith hates to eat early on a hot day.

57
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:01,419
It gives you more time to digest
your food before retiring.

58
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,219
Besides, I'm due at my sister's
house 7:00 on a family matter.

59
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,859
- Something wrong?
- Trouble with her husband...

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,299
him being a man.

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,099
It's all right with me. You
explain it to Mr. Smith.

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,178
Oh, he won't mind, seeing as how
tonight's corned-beef night.

63
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:22,219
- Is it all right, Katie?
- Yes, but I had to tell your mother lies.

64
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:24,378
- They're white lies.
- A lie is a lie.

65
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:28,580
Dressing it in white don't help it.
Now, if it's not asking too...

66
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,099
Just why was I lying this time? Why
must we have dinner an hour early?

67
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,820
- Rose is expecting...
- Don't blame your sister.

68
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,859
Blaming her? We're doing this for her.
You know Rose's problem.

69
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,776
Warren's been writing to
her for six months...

70
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,178
without one word that
smells like a proposal.

71
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,219
What's that got to do with
having dinner an hour early?

72
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,137
Warren Sheffield is telephoning
Rose long-distance at half past 6.

73
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,938
- Long-distance?
- From New York City.

74
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,017
If the family's sitting here,
she'll be loath to say...

75
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,938
what she's compelled to, to
get a proposal out of a man.

76
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,219
If he, unfortunately, is Warren Sheffield.

77
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:05,938
Personally, I wouldn't marry a man who
proposed to me over an invention.

78
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:08,862
Well, we can't be too particular.
Although we love Rose...

79
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:11,099
the brutal fact is that...

80
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,419
- well, she isn't getting any younger.
- Hello, Rose.

81
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,618
There's the poor old maid now.

82
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,219
Esther. Esther! He's out there.

83
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,260
- John Truett?
- On the porch.

84
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:48,938
Now, be perfectly calm. We have the perfect
right to sit on our own front porch.

85
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:57,779
- Isn't it a lovely day, Esther, dear?
- Heavenly, Rose. Simply heavenly.

86
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:17,219
Well! He's not very neighborly, I must say.

87
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,900
He's only lived here three weeks. You
can't expect him to fling himself at you.

88
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:28,178
Well, that's true. Besides, meeting across
the lawn for the first time would be...

89
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,580
so ordinary. I don't want to
be just introduced to him.

90
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:36,539
I want it to be something strange and
wonderful, something I'll always remember.

91
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,498
I'll get George to bring him
to Lon's going-away party.

92
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,900
Could you?

93
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,058
Rose. Esther. The water's hot.

94
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,659
You should wash your hair.
We're eating early.

95
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:48,331
- All right, Mother.
- Why are we eating early?

96
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,339
You certainly don't want the family in
there while a man proposes long-distance.

97
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:57,820
Proposes? I don't see why you assume
Warren's gonna propose to me.

98
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,058
Well, why else do you think
he's calling you long-distance?

99
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,618
- Do you know what it costs?
- I'm not even sure I'll be in.

100
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,017
When you get to be my age...

101
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,700

Too sour?

126
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,979
- Too thick.
- Oh, Grandpa!

127
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,739
Katie, where's my cat? Where is she?

128
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,340
I don't know. She got in the way, I
kicked her down the cellar steps.

129
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,493
I could hear her spine hit on every step.

130
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,540
If you've killed her, I'll kill you.

131
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:07,808
I'll stab you to death in your
sleep, and tie you to wild horses...

132
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,492
until you're pulled apart. Won't
that be terrible? There's your cat.

133
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,580
- Oh, poor Lady Babbie.
- Don't go away. We're eating early.

134
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,739
I can't get hungry till it gets dark.

135
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,259
Dinner's at 5:30. You can eat blindfolded.

136
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,019
We have to be out of the
dining room by 6:30.

137
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,779
Warren Sheffield is telephoning
Rose long-distance from New York.

138
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,779
Rose, I wouldn't commit
myself one way or another.

139
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
- After all...
- For goodness' sake.

140
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:37,180
We know very little about him.
We haven't even met his folks.

141
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,779
It seems to me...

142
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:43,060
It seems to me that one little phone call
is causing an awful lot of excitement.

143
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Besides, you're entirely too young. I
don't think your father would allow it.

144
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:50,580
If I keep lying for your
daughters, I'll need more money.

145
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,340
Not a word of this to Papa. He
plagues the girls about their beaus.

146
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:58,139
- Everybody knows but Papa?
- Your papa's not supposed to know.

147
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,499
It's enough that we're letting him
work hard to support the flock of us.

148
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,300
He can't have everything.

149
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,499
Where's Tootie? I haven't seen her all day.

150
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,499
- Did Tootie come home with you?
- No, Mama.

151
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,187
Oh, I suppose she's

Who gets ice now, Mr. Neely?

156
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:34,811
Oh, Mr. Neely!

157
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,499
- Who gets ice now, Mr. Neely?
- No one, Tootie.

158
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:42,379
Robin just can't seem to remember Mrs.
Wilkins moved. Now, you get out of there.

159
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,420
Poor Margaretha. Never
seen her look so pale.

160
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,859
Well, sun ought to do her some good.

161
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,139
I expect she won't live through the night.
She has four fatal diseases.

162
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,499
And it only takes one.

163
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,779
But she's gonna have a beautiful funeral
in a cigar box my papa gave me...

164
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,460
all wrapped in silver paper.

165
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,580
That's the way to go if you have to go.

166
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,979
Oh, she has to go.

167
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,300
Mr. Neely, is Robin a girl
horse or a boy horse?

168
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,659
- Girl.
- How old is she?

169
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,700
- Four.
- She's awful big for 4. I'm 5.

170
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:24,619
- Is she strong?
- Strongest ice horse in St. Louis.

171
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,420
Excuse me, Mr. Neely, but
it's pronounced St. "Louis."

172
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,180
Is it, now? I've got a cousin spells it
the same way, and we call him Louie.

173
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,619
- He's not a city, though, is he?
- No.

174
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,700
- Is he a saint?
- No.

175
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,859
- Then there's no comparison.
- Well, anyway, she's a grand old town.

176
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,460
It isn't a town, Mr. Neely. It's a city.
It's the only city that has a world's fair.

177
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,340

We're sorry, Papa.

195
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,859
That song. The fair won't
open for seven months.

196
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,420
That's all everybody sings
about or talks about.

197
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,019
I wish everybody would meet at
the fair and leave me alone.

198
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,899
Hello, dearest. Did you have a nice day?

199
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,779
- I lost the case.
- I'm sorry. You were so sure you'd win it.

200
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,499
I overlooked one thing.
That judge is an old thief.

201
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,619
If losing a case depresses
you, quit practicing law...

202
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,783
and go into another line of business.

203
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,460
That's a good idea.

204
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,540
Beginning tomorrow, I intend to play at
first base for the Baltimore Orioles.

205
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,180
- Sorry if I was bombastic.
- That's all right.

206
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,100
- You'll feel better when you have dinner.
- I suppose so.

207
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:51,580
But right now I'm going to soak in
that cool bathtub for one solid hour.

208
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,940
But that's impossible. Dinner's
being served in five minutes.

209
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,580
Five minutes?

210
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:02,820
- It's only 5:25, not 6:25.
- We're eating an hour earlier tonight.

211
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,698
- The plans have changed. I'm taking a bath.
- We're eating early for Katie.

212
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,540
Family trouble. She wants
to go there when we finish.

213
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:12,100
- Her sister's fighting with her husband.
- I see.

214
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:15,737
- And they'll stop if I don't bathe.
- Katie's been here 10 years.

215
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,060
She never asks favors.
We don't wanna lose her.

216
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,820
You can't get a maid for
less than $ 12 a month.

217
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,500
Lon, count three.

218
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:26,458
One, two, three.

219
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,820
I don't care if we have to pay a maid
$ 15 a month. Dinner will be at 6:30.

220
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,780
If Katie wants to hand in her notice,
she can reach me in the bathtub!

221
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,340
It's way after 6:30, and
Warren hasn't called yet.

222
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,698
- Maybe he got himself another girl.
- Quiet, you two.

223
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,780
I'm not the slightest bit
sensitive about Warren Sheffield.

224
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,859
- The queen has spoken.
- I suppose Warren's too young too.

225
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,260
- Everyone I introduce her to is too young.
- Now, listen.

226
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,379
Your father will be down in a minute. If
we eat quickly, we may get him out...

227
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:05,674
before the call comes through.

228
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:08,302
Warren's 21. I think that's a perfect age.

229
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,540
- Practically a child.
- Your father was 20 when we married.

230
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:16,540
We gave him a bachelor dinner the night
before. He almost missed the wedding.

231
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,859
The lord and master.

232
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,899
Now I remember where I left my other skate.

233
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,020
I hope I haven't held you up.

234
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:42,458
- I was just taking a little ride before dinner.
- Hello, Papa.

235
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,458
I buried Maude Rockefeller today.
You missed all the fun.

236
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I've had a pretty full day.

237
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:51,740
Tootie, remind me to spank
you right after dinner.

238
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,820
Okay, Papa.

239
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,139
Lord, we thank you for the bountiful
blessings we are about to receive. Amen.

240
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,500
- If I forget to remind Papa, you remind me.
- All right.

241
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,740
Katie, this is delicious.

242
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:22,780
Well, I guess this hasn't been exactly
a red-letter day for any of us.

243
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,698
Now, suppose we all relax and
enjoy a nice, leisurely meal.

244
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,698
Katie, I'm sorry I couldn't
eat an hour early.

245
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,619
Don't blame me if the corned
beef's an hour tougher.

246
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,100
You finished already, Tootie? That's
the way I like to see you eat.

247
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,980
You'll be a big girl if...

248
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,659
Either I've lost some soup,
or I've found a spoon.

249
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,458
- Oh, Katie.
- Lonnie, did you have a nice day...

250
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,500
Oh, no, you didn't, did you, dear?

251
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,500
- There's a fashion pavilion at the world's fair. 
- Isn't that exciting?

252
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:58,260
We have to wait six months for it to open.
I'll die. I'll simply die!

253
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,899
Anybody want dessert?

254
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,938
- What happened to dinner?
- I didn't think anyone could eat meat...

255
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,139
on a hot day like this. I'm not hot.

256
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,060
I had a cool bath, which
nobody can take away from me.

257
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:12,100
I have every intention of
eating an enormous dinner!

258
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,300
Anna, I think Katie's getting a little old.

259
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,698
Her mental processes baffle me.

260
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,820
Ah, corned beef and cabbage.

261
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,740
I could smell that cabbage
when I got off the trolley.

262
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,218
Cabbage has a cabbage smell.

263
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,540
In this house, we cut the corned beef.
We don't shave it. Where's the knife?

264
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,859
Mrs. Smith, you said you wanted
to make this go for two meals.

265
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,139
I'll take it.

266
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,938
Hello.

267
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,980
What?

268
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,218
You'll have to speak louder, please.
New York?

269
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:07,139
No, I'm not calling New York. Hello.

270
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,300
Hello.

271
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,017
- I'm taking that phone out.
- Alono.

272
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,218
- Yes, Anna?
- Every telephone call isn't for you.

273
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,139
That one wasn't.

274
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,178
Those operators!

275
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,740
Katie, take this out in
the kitchen and slice it.

276
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,500
Rose is crying.

277
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,060
What's the matter with you?

278
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,540
Oh, nothing, Papa. You've just ruined
Rose's chance to get married, that's all.

279
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,698
What?

280
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,780
That was Warren Sheffield calling
long-distance to propose.

281
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,419
Oh, I see.

282
00:21:55,938 --> 00:22:00,379
Tootie, did you know a long-distance
phone call was coming to this house?

283
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,178
The ice man saw a drunkard get shot.
The blood spurted out 3 feet.

284
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,060
Answer yes or no.

285
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:11,458
- Yes, sir.
- Agnes?

286
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,899
Yes, sir.

287
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,300
- Lon?
- Yes, sir.

288
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,100
Well, that's just fine.

289
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,820
Anna, I'm curious.

290
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,139
Just when was I voted out of this family?

291
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
- Oh, Lon, really, now.
- What else am I to think?

292
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,340
My eldest daughter is
practically on her honeymoon...

293
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,540
and everybody knows about it but me.

294
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:45,340
In view of the fact that this family refuses
to let me in on their little intrigues...

295
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,899
I'll handle the telephone in my own way.

296
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,938
From now on, I'll take all incoming calls.

297
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,820
- Rose, you answer that.
- Thank you, Papa.

298
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:00,780
Hello.

299
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,840
Yes, this is Miss Rose Smith. Yes,
you may put that New York call on.

300
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:13,980
Hello, Warren. Yes, I'm fine. How are you?

301
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:16,740
Oh, I'm fine, Rose. How's St. Louis?

302
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,977
- What did you say?
- I said, how's St. Louis?

303
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,376
- Oh, St. Louis is fine.
- Is it hot there?

304
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,178
Yes, it's very hot. It's as hot as July.

305
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,619
- Is it hot there?
- Yes, it's hot here too.

306
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm calling from a booth
in the Hotel Delmonico.

307
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,820
- Can you hear me all right?
- Yes, I can hear you fine.

308
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,740
- What did you say, Warren?
- Nothing.

309
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,948
I was waiting for you to talk.

310
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:48,143
Oh...

311
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,580
Well, did you want to discuss
anything in particular?

312
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,300
What?

313
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,020
I said, was there anything
special you wanted to ask me?

314
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:04,218
- I can't hear you, Rose.
- That's funny. I can hear you plainly.

315
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:08,891
Isn't this great? Here I am in New York,
and there you are in St. Louis...

316
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,260
and it's like you're in the next room.

317
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,139
- What was that?
- I said it's just like you're in the next room!

318
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,178
Say, Rose, I hope you won't
misunderstand what I'm going to say.

319
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,820
Yes?

320
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:26,020
I don't think you better
mention this call to anyone.

321
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,580
Why not?

322
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,740
Because there'd be "H" to pay if my
family knew I called long-distance.

323
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,571
- What did you say?
- He said there'd be...

324
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,659
"H" to pay if my family found
out I called long-distance!

325
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,060
That's strange. My family's home, and
they don't think anything of it.

326
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:45,060
Well, I better not waste any
more of your time and money.

327
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:50,500
- Wait, Rose. We've still got... 36 seconds.
- I have an engagement.

328
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,340
I think I can hear Joe's voice now.

329
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,938
Good evening, Joe.

330
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:59,698
- I was gonna write you tonight.
- You can write to me tonight if you want.

331
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,980
I'll write you right after I hang up.

332
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,379
Yes, do that little thing.

333
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,580
- Lon...
- I beg your pardon...

334
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,619
I'll bet there isn't another girl in St. Louis
who's had a Yale man call long-distance...

335
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,461
just to inquire about her health.
I should say not.

336
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,540
I've figured out a new move in chess.

337
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,060
I'd like a slice of corned beef.
I thought you were mad at me.

338
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,419
I couldn't be mad at you, Mr. Smith.

339
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,139
- Es, he's here.
- What did he say?

340
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,580
Nothing concrete, but
his voice is wonderful.

341
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,139
- It would've been nice to be a brunette.
- You should've been.

342
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,740
Nothing could've stopped us. Think
how we'd look going out together.

343
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:19,659
You with your raven black
hair and me with my auburn.

344
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,139
Rose, I've decided something.

345
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
- I'm going to let John kiss me tonight.
- Esther Smith!

346
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,659
If we're getting married,
I should start it.

347
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,419
Nice girls don't let men kiss
them until after they're engaged.

348
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,419
Men don't want the bloom rubbed off.

349
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,500
Personally, I think I have too much bloom.

350
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,659
Maybe that's the trouble with me.

351
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,938
Eve, it's been ages! And you
brought your violin. How nice.

352
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,619
Harry, how are you? How
nice of you to come.

353
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
Really, I'm so glad.

354
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,379
Yes, sir, Princeton's a peach of a school.
A peach of a school.

355
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,260
- Oh, Es.
- Yes, Alono?

356
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:40,419
- May I present our neighbor, John Truett?
- I didn't quite catch the name.

357
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,780
- John Truett.
- Welcome to our home, Mr. Truett.

358
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:48,859
Well, thank you. This is the first party
I've been to since we moved to St. Louis.

359
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,340
- Oh, do you live here?
- He lives next door.

360
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,419
Oh, well, that's where I've seen you.

- There was too much noise down here.

00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:19,100
- I want to sing too.
- One song, all right, Rose?

413
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,659

- Come on. You're so bad.

last night, dear Mother.

00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,980
- You can't sing that.
- Do let her. She's such a sweet little thing.

421
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,540
Sweet? She's a hoodlum.

422
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,938
- Oh, come on. Let her sing.
- Let her sing.

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:50,298
- Good night, Eve. You played beautifully.
- Thank you.

460
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:53,218
I can't find my hat anywhere, darn it.

461
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,698
- Oh, pardon the expression.
- Your hat? Why...

462
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,019
I put it here with the
others when you came in.

463
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:04,380
Oh, Es, have you seen Mr. Truett's chapeau?

464
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:09,659
It seems I saw it somewhere. I...

465
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,698
Excuse me just a minute.

466
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,579
Sorry to detain you. It was
right where I left it.

467
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:27,979
Thank you.

468
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:30,939
- Good night, Miss Rose.
- Good night, Mr. Truett.

469
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,218
- Good night, Miss Esther.
- Good night.

470
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,939
And thank you for your
neighborly hospitality.

471
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:39,698
Raisins.

472
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,618
- I wonder how those got there.
- That's funny, isn't it?

473
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:47,258
- Bon soir, Mr. Truett. Coming up, Es?
- Presently.

474
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:50,059
After all, someone has to
show our guest to the door.

475
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:54,860
Remember, Es, dear, you have
to get your beauty sleep.

476
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,860
- Well, I guess I better get going.
- You haven't very far to go.

477
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:04,539
No, I haven't at that, have I?

478
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:06,019
Well, good night.

479
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:08,298
We'll be seeing some more of you, won't we?

480
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,939
You bet.

481
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,178
You'll join the crowd Friday to
go to the fairgrounds, won't you?

482
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,298
- If basketball practice doesn't run too late.
- Yes.

483
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:20,139
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

484
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,459
That Welsh rabbit was ginger peachy.

485
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:28,579
- Good night.
- Good night.

486
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,659
- Mr. Truett?
- Yes, Miss Esther?

487
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:36,579
This is an untoward request, but...

488
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:40,778
will you mind accompanying me through
the house while I turn out the lights?

489
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,338
- Well, I...
- It's just that I...

490
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,459
I'm afraid of mice.

491
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,778
Well, sure, sure.

492
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,419
That's the least a man can
do for his charming hostess.

493
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:57,175
I have to turn them out everywhere.

494
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:01,099
In the dining room, and in the
living room, and everywhere.

495
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:17,860
- Would you?
- Sure.

496
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:27,818
No, it's here.

497
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,218
Well, it certainly is dark
in here with the lights off.

498
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,499
It certainly is.

499
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:45,298
- Shall we do the dining room next?
- Yes.

500
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,818
Say, that is nice perfume.

501
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:29,659
Do you like it?

502
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:35,939
It's essence of violet. I save
it for special occasions.

503
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:39,698
Exactly the kind my grandmother uses.

504
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,338
No, this one is different, you have to...

505
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,338
- There.
- I'll turn these last two out.

506
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:17,218
Hadn't you better leave those
lights on for your folks?

507
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,738
I'll just turn them down dim.

508
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,579
Gosh, Miss Esther.

509
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,059
I hope I'm not too presumptuous.

510
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,298
You don't need any beauty sleep.

511
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:51,099
What a nice compliment.

512
00:39:51,298 --> 00:39:53,698
- How does it go?
- How does what go?

This has been a great evening.
Really, it has.

- I'll never forget it, Esther.
- Do you mean that?

532
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,139
Yes, yes, I do. And you
know something else?

00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:34,738
What?

534

neighbor.

539
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:07,298
Hey! You boys, stop that!

540
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,860

My father was talking...

542
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:20,900
to the world's-fair commission, and
they estimate it'll cost 50 million.

543
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,618
- That's a lot of kale.
- I can hardly wait to see Skinker's Swamp.

544
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:29,099
- Yes, it must look like a fairyland!

up, there's plenty of room.

You be careful and don't run over Mrs.
Truett's lawn. It's just been planted.

618
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:21,218
We won't. She's nice.

619
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,979
But wait'll you see what we do to Mr.
Braukoff.

620
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:27,579
- That'll be a caution, won't it, Tootie?
- We'll fix him fine.

621
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:30,258
It'll serve him right for poisoning cats.

622
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:31,900
Does he poison cats?

623
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:37,019
He buys meat, and then he buys poison,
and then he puts them all together.

624
00:47:37,178 --> 00:47:41,059
Then he burns the cats at midnight in
his furnace. You can smell the smoke.

625
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:44,380
That's horrible. Are you sure?

626
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:47,218
Johnny Tevis smelled smoke
and peeked in the window...

627
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,059
and there was a box of dead cats.

628
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:54,298
And Mr. Braukoff was beating
his wife with a red-hot poker.

629
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:58,738
I never would have believed it.
He looks like such a quiet man.

630
00:47:59,778 --> 00:48:01,939
- And you know something else?
- Don't tell!

631
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,059
- You crossed your heart you wouldn't tell.
- I crossed it with my left hand.

632
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:12,099
Mr. Braukoff has empty whiskey
bottles in his cellar.

633
00:48:18,818 --> 00:48:20,258
- Boo!
- Boo!

634
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:23,258
Mrs. Smith, who are these boys?

635
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:25,218
It's me, Katie. It's Agnes.

636
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:29,179
The saints preserve us, it is!
You had me fooled.

637
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,539
Mama, we fooled her!

638
00:48:31,698 --> 00:48:34,778
Well, if you can fool
Katie, you can fool anyone.

639
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,738
- I'll answer it, Mama.
- I thought you were a drunken ghost.

640
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,979
Well, I am. She's a horrible ghost,
and I'm a terrible drunken ghost.

641
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:47,178
She was murdered in a den of thieves,
and I died of a broken heart.

642
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:51,698
I've never even been buried because
everyone's scared to come near me.

643
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,818
What's that?

644
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,258
Here's the flour.

645
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,738
- Did anyone hear a moan just then?
- I did.

646
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,380
Did it go like this:

647
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:06,298
I didn't hear it.

648
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:10,298
Now, children, when people answer the
doorbells, don't throw too much flour.

649
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:12,698
Just a small handful right in their face.

650
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,459
Mama, that was Mrs. Wilkins.

651
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,579
Said she'll leave the hammock on the
porch, and will the children return it...

652
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:22,698
when they're through stealing it? Yes,
and get back early or no ice cream.

653
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,221
- All right.
- All right, Mommy.

654
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:29,019
You couldn't catch me out on a night
like this for a million dollars.

655
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:32,255
We'll show them.

656
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:37,939
If you wet the flour before you throw it, it
makes it harder for the victim to get it off.

657
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,979
You, you, you, you, come here!

658
00:50:06,178 --> 00:50:09,659
- Take the Braukoffs!
- Oh, no. We ain't gonna take the Braukoffs.

659
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:11,059
What's the matter? Scared?

660
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:14,218
No. We'll take the Mitchells.
They're just as bad.

661
00:50:37,698 --> 00:50:39,258
Who's that?

662
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:41,539
It's me, Agnes.

663
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:44,778
- And who's that?
- That's Tootie.

664
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:48,539
Look at Tootie!

665
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:51,380
All right, go with them.
They're taking the Braukoffs.

666
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:54,738
- No, we're taking the Mitchells!
- All right, take the Mitchells!

667
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,818
- But pull down their fence and kill them all!
- All right!

668
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,338
No, not you! You're too little.

669
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,579
You stay here, Tootie. And
don't go too near the fire.

670
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:11,539
Let me help! Let me help! Let me help!

671
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,900
- Oh, let me help! Please let me help!
- Get out of the way.

672
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,298
Let me help!

673
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:21,618
Johnny! Hey, Johnny! We just killed
eight more people. Big ones too!

674
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,218
We tortured them! Burnt
the soles of their feet.

675
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:27,979
- Fine! Now go get the Braukoffs.
- No, we're gonna get the Ferrises.

676
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,900
All right then, the Ferrises. But
blow down their house, roof and all!

677
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,818
- Come on!
- Can I go too?

678
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:37,218
No, no, Tootie, you stay here.
You're too little.

679
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,499
Why don't you go home?

680
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,380
- Somebody's gotta take the Braukoffs!
- I'll take them!

681
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,778
I'll take the Braukoffs.

682
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:51,539
- Yeah, let Tootie take them!
- No! The Braukoffs have a fierce bulldog!

683
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,059
She'll be torn to pieces!

684
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:55,659
Yeah, you better go home. You're too small.

685
00:51:55,818 --> 00:51:58,939
I am not. I won't go home.
I'll take the Braukoffs.

686
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:03,738
All right. Tootie takes the Braukoffs.

687
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,258
Remember, if you don't hit Mr. Braukoff in
the face with flour and say, "I hate you"...

688
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:11,419
the banshees will haunt you forever!
Give her some flour.

689
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:13,499
No, I got my own flour.

690
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,298
Well?

691
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:28,698
I... I hate you, Mr. Braukoff.

692
00:54:58,059 --> 00:54:59,618
Tootie!

693
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,818
- What have you been doing?
- She took the Braukoffs.

694
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:04,939
- All alone?
- What's the matter, Tootie?

695
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:08,218
- Did the bulldog try to bite you?
- Did Mr. Braukoff chase you?

696
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,380
- Tootie, can't you talk?
- I killed him!

697
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:13,659
She killed him all alone.

698
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,499
Hey, wait a minute! Listen!

699
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:19,738
Listen! Quiet! Quiet!

700
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:23,860
Tootie killed the Braukoffs single-handed.
She's the bravest of them all!

701
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,139
Yeah! Tootie's the most horrible!

702
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:28,338
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

703
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:31,618
Tootie Smith, you're free.
Your banshee is dead.

704
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,778
- Here, throw that on the fire.
- I'm the most horrible!

705
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:37,419
I'm the most horrible!

706
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,900
Thank you for dropping
me off, Colonel Darly.

707
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,338
It was my pleasure, Miss Smith.

708
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:10,139
The ice cream would have melted if
it weren't for your thoughtfulness.

709
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:13,499
Glad to be of service. Good night.

710
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:15,900
Would you like to come in?

711
00:56:16,059 --> 00:56:19,419
There's plenty of ice cream, and
my folks would love to meet you.

712
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:21,539
Thank you, but some other time perhaps.

713
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:23,419
Oh, give my regards to Tootie.

714
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:26,258
Thank you. She's such a chère enfant.

715
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:30,099
Yes. Yes, she certainly is. Good evening.

716
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:44,099
- Rose! Him!
- Oh, Es, he's simply enchanting.

717
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:46,939
- And so mature.
- How'd it happen? Where did you meet?

718
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,659
I was coming out of
Huntsinger's, he was coming in.

719
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,178
- I bumped into him.
- Accidentally?

720
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:55,380
- Almost.
- Oh, Rose, I think that's the most exciting...

721
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:57,818
- Tootie.
- Where is she?

722
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:00,298
I thought I heard the trolley when...

723
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,459
Tootie!

724
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:09,178
- Rose, did you hear a scream?
- Yes, it's Tootie!

725
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:12,019
- I heard Tootie. Where is she?
- Down by the trolley.

726
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,860
Something's happened!

727
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,059
Oh, my Tootie!

728
00:57:20,258 --> 00:57:23,178
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, here!

729
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:26,499
- My, darling. Don't cry, honey.
- Somebody telephone the doctor.

730
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:29,178
If you can't get Dr. Girard, get Dr. Brown.

731
00:57:29,698 --> 00:57:32,778
- Katie, get some hot water.
- Yes, yes, right away.

732
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:37,539
- It's all right now.
- All right, honey. You'll be all right.

733
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:40,539
- He tried to kill me.
- Mama, I think it's her lip.

734
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:45,659
Let me see, honey. Now, Mother won't
hurt her baby. Let me see, dear.

735
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,298
- She lost a tooth.
- The doctor must be walking.

736
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:52,380
- Shall I call Papa at the office?
- Good heavens, no. What could he do?

737
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,900
- There, there, darling.
- He tried to kill me.

738
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,059
Now, tell Mama, what happened?

739
00:57:58,298 --> 00:58:01,900
- I think a streetcar hit her.
- It must have tossed her onto the cinders.

740
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:06,258
No, it wasn't the streetcar.
It was John Truett.

741
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:09,618
He tried to kill me.

742
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:13,380
- John Truett?
- John Truett hit you?

743
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:18,778
He tried to kill me, and when
I screamed, he ran away.

744
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:21,659
Tootie Smith, that's a monstrous falsehood.

745
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:25,539
John Truett wouldn't hit a
girl, least of all my sister.

746
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:30,178
Let me have your coat, doctor.

747
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:32,738
Well, Tootie, what is it this time?

748
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,659
- John Truett hit her, Dr. Girard.
- Well, let's have a look here, huh?

749
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:47,019
He hit her, all right. Someone did.

750
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,178
I'm afraid I'll have to
take a couple of stitches.

751
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:54,579
Well, no bones broken, though.

752
00:58:58,218 --> 00:59:00,099
What's that in your hand?

753
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:04,338
- Come on, Tootie, let the doctor see it.
- Let's see. What is it? Come on, what...?

754
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:08,539
It... It's hair, and I
don't think it's Tootie's.

755
00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:12,579
I had to do it. He tried to kill me.

756
00:59:12,738 --> 00:59:15,419
She must have had quite a
struggle fighting him off.

757
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:18,139
Most of it still has the roots on them.

758
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:21,380
Let's see, now.

759
00:59:21,778 --> 00:59:26,059
We'd better take her upstairs to bed.
Can you help me? There we are.

760
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:38,579
- Hello, Esther.
- John Truett?

761
00:59:38,738 --> 00:59:42,139
- Yes?
- I've come here to ask you something.

762
00:59:42,338 --> 00:59:45,218
What do you mean hitting
a 5-year-old child?

763
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:48,419
Esther.

764
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:54,139
The next time you want to hit somebody,
pick on somebody your own size.

765
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:56,258
Hey, Esther...!

766
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:06,380
If there's anything I hate, loathe,
despise and abominate, it's a bully!

767
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:14,979
- I want to sleep right here.
- Of course you may, dear.

768
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:19,618
- I want to wear Esther's nightgown.
- I'll get it for you right now.

769
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:23,499
I hate to think what your
father will say about this.

770
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:26,059
He may strike that Truett boy.

771
01:00:26,979 --> 01:00:29,979
- I'll do that, Mama.
- I'll get you some ice cream and cake.

772
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:33,019
Feed a cold, starve a fever.

773
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:37,139
♪ I was drunk last night, dear Mother

774
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:40,258
♪ I was drunk the night before.

775
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:43,099
♪ But if you'll forgive me, Mother

776
01:00:43,298 --> 01:00:46,019
♪ I'll never get drunk anymore

777
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:49,338
I got him. He didn't even
have a chance to scratch me.

778
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:50,860
Your dress is torn.

779
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:53,900
Must have happened while he
was trying to hold me off.

780
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:56,738
- I bit him.
- I bit him too.

781
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,900
Tootie, I saw the whole thing!

782
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:01,860
- You should've run when I did.
- What happened?

783
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:04,338
When I got loose from John, I ran back.

784
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:08,099
There was a policeman and a
big crowd, and he was mad.

785
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:10,860
- Everyone in the trolley was mad.
- Mad about what?

786
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:12,539
- Did it go off the track?
- No.

787
01:01:12,738 --> 01:01:15,698
But the cable came off when the
motorman put on the brakes.

788
01:01:16,178 --> 01:01:20,258
- What have you two been up to?
- Nothing. It was that dress we found.

789
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:24,738
- We stuffed it.
- It looked just like a body. A live body too.

790
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,419
We put it on the track. We thought
the streetcar would go off.

791
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:32,698
You're nothing less than a murderer.
You might have killed dozens of people.

792
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,499
Rose, you're so stuck-up.

793
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:39,338
Tootie, how did you get that lip?

794
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:42,539
Agnes and I put the lady on the track.

795
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,218
And when John Truett saw the streetcar...

796
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:50,979
he tried to make us stay in the woodshed
so the policemen wouldn't get us.

797
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:54,499
As though policemen ever
pay attention to girls.

798
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:57,818
Get out of that bed and
take my nightgown off.

799
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:01,618
Let her alone. After all, she was
good about her lip and didn't cry.

800
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,059
You're not my sister.

801
01:02:04,218 --> 01:02:07,778
You're the most deceitful, horrible,
sinful little creature I ever saw.

802
01:02:07,939 --> 01:02:11,298
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Were those people very mad?

803
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:14,818
- They were furious!
- The motorman nearly had a fit!

804
01:02:14,979 --> 01:02:18,459
You shouldn't laugh. There's
nothing to laugh at.

805
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:26,738
That's terrible!

806
01:02:27,939 --> 01:02:30,939
Merciful heavens! John...

807
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,900
John.

808
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:51,059
John, I've come to ask you something.

809
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:55,818
I just found out that...

810
01:02:57,178 --> 01:02:59,539
Did I do that?

811
01:03:00,698 --> 01:03:03,539
And this. And this.

812
01:03:04,419 --> 01:03:06,139
And this.

813
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:08,459
John, I...

814
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:13,860
- I'm terribly sorry if I hurt you.
- It's no worse than football practice...

815
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:16,380
except it's better with a girl.

816
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:19,338
How's Tootie?

817
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:21,139
Oh, Tootie...

818
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,939
- She'll live.
- I heard her crying.

819
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:27,419
I guess. So did everybody in St. Louis.

820
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,419
John, it's awfully nice of
you to accept my apology.

821
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:39,618
If you're not busy tomorrow night,
could you beat me up again?

822
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,618
Well...

823
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:49,499
I guess I'd better be getting home.

824
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:54,380
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, yeah, right. I guess so.

825
01:03:55,459 --> 01:03:57,659
Well...

826
01:03:57,818 --> 01:03:59,900
- good night.
- Good night.

827
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,659
Esther?

828
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:06,778
Would you mind helping
me turn off the lights?

829
01:04:09,419 --> 01:04:11,738
I'm afraid of mice.

830
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:16,818
All the lights are out.

831
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,579
Wouldn't take a minute to turn them on.

832
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:23,618
Well, wouldn't that be
kind of wasting a minute?

833
01:04:23,778 --> 01:04:26,900
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it would.

834
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:38,860
You know...

835
01:04:39,979 --> 01:04:42,818
you've got a mighty strong grip...

836
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,178
for a boy.

837
01:04:58,178 --> 01:05:00,218
Here comes the invalid.

838
01:05:01,659 --> 01:05:06,019
I have to have two kinds of ice cream.
I'm recuperating.

839
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:09,178
If I ever catch you fibbing
again like you did...

840
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,059
I'll give you something
to recuperate about.

841
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:31,900
Esther, your ice cream is melting.

842
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:33,818
Isn't it?

843
01:05:38,298 --> 01:05:40,860
Esther, is there anything wrong with you?

844
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:42,860
Yes, Mama.

845
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:53,419
Roses are red, John's name is Truett
Esther's in love and we always knew it

846
01:05:53,939 --> 01:05:57,818
I refuse to stay while my sister's
humiliated by these ghastly children.

847
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,579
They're your sisters too.

848
01:05:59,778 --> 01:06:01,939
Stop it, you two, or up you go.

849
01:06:02,298 --> 01:06:05,818
"Truett." "Knew it." That's pretty good.

850
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:08,698
I can't think of any word
that rhymes with "colonel."

851
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,059
Unless it's "infernal."

852
01:06:10,818 --> 01:06:15,459
It's very difficult for a person to
have any private life in this family.

853
01:06:16,979 --> 01:06:19,939
Well, another Halloween.
We're all a year older.

854
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:22,618
- This where the Smith family lives?
- Hello, Papa.

855
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:27,738
We stopped a trolley, I lost my tooth. I
got two stitches, and I didn't cry once.

856
01:06:27,939 --> 01:06:31,618
- What's this, Anna?
- She fell and cut her lip. She's fine.

857
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,618
That's a brave little girl.

858
01:06:33,778 --> 01:06:35,218
Anna?

859
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:37,778
- Sweets to the sweet.
- Louis Sherry!

860
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:40,380
Why, Lonnie, what a lovely box...

861
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,218
Is anything wrong?

862
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,260
Just because I bring you a present,
you think I've been up to something.

863
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:46,805
Well...

864
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,178
I have. I have good news.
Don't fly up in the air.

865
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:55,419
I'm as cool as a cucumber. You're
shaking like I don't know what.

866
01:06:55,422 --> 01:07:00,061
I was going to tell you before, but I
wanted to wait until it was definite.

867
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,099
The firm is sending me to New York.

868
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:06,338
Is that all? Well, we can
live without you for a while.

869
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:09,218
They'll be safe with me.
I've got 12 guns in my room.

870
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,979
- You'll be back by Thanksgiving.
- You don't understand.

871
01:07:14,178 --> 01:07:18,298
They're sending me to New York for good.
To be head of the New York office.

872
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,338
- New York!
- What?

873
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,778
I don't believe it.

874
01:07:25,218 --> 01:07:27,019
I simply don't believe it.

875
01:07:27,218 --> 01:07:28,939
It's true.

876
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:32,059
I start the first of the year.
We'll leave after Christmas.

877
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:35,019
I thought we'd like to have
Christmas in St. Louis.

878
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,698
I think I'll go pack.

879
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,218
It will take a week to dig up
all my dolls from the cemetery.

880
01:07:40,419 --> 01:07:43,218
Come back. There'll be no packing as yet.

881
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:48,380
There are many things to talk over and
you two are being very cool about it.

882
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:49,939
Why, Anna.

883
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:51,860
I thought you'd be overjoyed.

884
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,698
New York is a big city.

885
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,939
Not that St. Louis isn't big...

886
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:03,178
but it just doesn't seem very
big out here where we live.

887
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:06,618
And what will the children do?

888
01:08:07,258 --> 01:08:08,818
The same as they do here...

889
01:08:08,979 --> 01:08:11,860
go to school, play, have
their friends over.

890
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:14,099
What friends?

891
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:17,459
- Yes. What friends?
- The friends they'll meet in school.

892
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,298
I don't go to school.

893
01:08:19,459 --> 01:08:21,700
You will someday, if they'll take you in.

894
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,979
Agnes just ready to be promoted
and Esther going to be a senior.

895
01:08:25,138 --> 01:08:28,740
- I've worked all my life to be a senior.
- And Rose is to be graduated.

896
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,539
Graduation is the least. All the
people I care about are in St. Louis.

897
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,301
And what about me and my life?

898
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,900
You can take that with you.

899
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:40,218
It's settled. We're moving to New York.

900
01:08:40,379 --> 01:08:44,660
You're being very calm about
the way you pack us off.

901
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,900
I've got the future to think about.
The future for us all.

902
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:52,059
I've got to worry about money, with Lon
in Princeton and Rose going to college.

903
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:55,138
Maybe Rose won't have to go.
Things are happening.

904
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:58,780
Tonight she met Colonel Darly, and
he was very smitten with her.

905
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:02,419
I'm sure he was, but next year
she'll still want to go to college.

906
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:05,099
I hate, loathe, despise
and abominate money.

907
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:08,138
- You also spend it.
- And what about Katie...

908
01:09:08,298 --> 01:09:10,579
and Grandpa and the chickens?

909
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,579
- That's a minor detail we can discuss later.
- I'm a minor detail, am I?

910
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,258
You all know I was talking
about the chickens.

911
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:20,379
Of course. Never mind what
happens to your family.

912
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:23,539
At a time like this,
talk about the chickens.

913
01:09:29,379 --> 01:09:33,099
Now, I guess you're all a little excited.

914
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:36,099
We'll talk this over calmly tomorrow.

915
01:09:36,258 --> 01:09:39,178
Well, hickory nut cake as
only Katie can make it.

916
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:41,780
I can't move to New York. I just can't.

917
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:44,860
I'm taking my cat. Lady
Babbie goes wherever I go.

918
01:09:45,059 --> 01:09:47,740
Where you gonna keep her?
Cooped up in a tenement?

919
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,059
Don't they have houses in New York?

920
01:09:50,218 --> 01:09:54,499
Rich people have houses.
People like us live in flats.

921
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,338
I'd rather be poor if we could stay here.

922
01:09:57,499 --> 01:10:01,298
I'd rather go with the "orphalins"
at the orphalins home.

923
01:10:01,499 --> 01:10:03,258
And what about the world's fair?

924
01:10:03,419 --> 01:10:07,539
Just when St. Louis was going to be the
center of attraction of the universe.

925
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:11,178
We'll come back here to see the fair.
Maybe.

926
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:15,700
- Katie, it's as light as a feather.
- You can bake anything in that stove.

927
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,700
They have little box stoves in tenements.

928
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:25,059
- Anna, how's this?
- Oh, it's too much, Lonnie.

929
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:31,059
This is your favorite too, Rose.

930
01:10:31,218 --> 01:10:34,900
No, thank you, Papa. I'll
have some later before bed.

931
01:10:35,059 --> 01:10:38,499
- Esther?
- No, Papa. I had too much ice cream.

932
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:43,138
- Grandpa, I guess you can handle this, huh?
- Thanks.

933
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,900
I suppose you two are going to
fight over the candy flower.

934
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:55,860
- You can have the candy flower, Tootie.
- No, thank you just the same.

935
01:10:56,019 --> 01:11:00,059
I'm starting a tunnel tomorrow from our
garden under the streetcar tracks...

936
01:11:00,258 --> 01:11:02,138
and into Mrs. Middleton's terrace.

937
01:11:02,298 --> 01:11:06,099
Then while she's walking around her
lawn someday, I'll grab her by the leg.

938
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:09,138
- It'll take months.
- And I'm not going till I'm finished.

939
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:13,900
- Don't use that impudent tone to your father.
- She's just stating a fact.

940
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:18,338
Excuse me.

941
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,740
- How about a game of cribbage?
- Not tonight, Lonnie.

942
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,258
I've got some things to do.

943
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:33,979
Excuse me.

944
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:47,099
Aren't you afraid to stay
here alone with a criminal?

945
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,338
Well, that's what I'm being treated like.

946
01:11:50,499 --> 01:11:55,620
I'm trying to earn more money to give my
grateful family everything they deserve.

947
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,338
That's worse than murder.

948
01:11:57,499 --> 01:12:00,178
I'm wrecking everybody's life.

949
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:07,579
Now, Lonnie, it's not as bad as that.

950
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,178
If you think it's best for us to go
away, why, that's what we'll do.

951
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,939
Now, eat your cake, dear.

952
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,979
It's good to hear you play, Anna.
It's been a long time.

953
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,700
Whatever made you think of that?

Well, what's so funny?

977
01:16:36,102 --> 01:16:36,496
{A MightyMike77020 Video Sub}.

978
01:16:36,499 --> 01:16:39,900
This one's named Lucille Ballard.

979
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:42,539
Oh, it is, is it?

980
01:16:46,419 --> 01:16:50,099
- I suppose that was your idea.
- Lon, don't get so touchy just because...

981
01:16:50,258 --> 01:16:53,740
Lucille doesn't think you're good
enough to take her to the dance.

982
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,820
A girl has got a right to
go with anyone she wants.

983
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,700
- I just didn't ask her soon enough.
- Everyone knows she's an Eastern snob.

984
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,019
Keep Miss Ballard's name out of this.

985
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:05,820
Just because you had a
few dates with her...

986
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:09,099
- don't lose your sense of proportion.
- Look who's talking.

987
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,019
You're sulking because Warren
Sheffield didn't ask you.

988
01:17:12,178 --> 01:17:15,419
That's not true. Rose
turned down scads of dates.

989
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,900
- She could have had any man she wanted.
- Except Warren Sheffield.

990
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:24,338
Lucille Ballard's just throwing herself
at Warren because of his father's money.

991
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,740
This is what I call real Christmas spirit.

992
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:32,298
You two have spent this entire
vacation at each other's throats.

993
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:36,298
Alono Smith, did it occur to you you
might take your sister to the dance?

994
01:17:37,178 --> 01:17:39,820
Is there anything wrong with
going with your brother?

995
01:17:39,979 --> 01:17:42,860
- And be the laughingstock of St. Louis?
- Oh, thank you.

996
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:45,620
Katie's right. That solves
all of our problems.

997
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:50,939
- And it's so full of the spirit of Christmas.
- Leave Christmas out of this.

998
01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:53,740
It's our last Christmas dance in St. Louis.

999
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,019
- It'd be tragic if either of you missed it.
- You can talk. You have a date.

1000
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:01,059
- A real one.
- If I didn't have a date with John Truett...

1001
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,419
which I have...

1002
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,660
I'd be thrilled to go with my brother.

1003
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:08,700
- Then that settles it.
- Wait! What's she got to do with this?

1004
01:18:09,138 --> 01:18:10,539
Well...

1005
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,860
if you two won't go with each
other, I won't go either.

1006
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:17,660
You ought to be ashamed, wrecking
your poor sister's evening.

1007
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,900
Rose? I'd be willing...

1008
01:18:21,059 --> 01:18:22,780
I mean, glad to...

1009
01:18:24,019 --> 01:18:27,379
- You would, Lon?
- I was going to ask you anyhow, but I...

1010
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:30,660
You two will have the best time of anybody.

1011
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,900
You won't have to be polite to each other.

1012
01:18:34,939 --> 01:18:36,258
It'll be all right.

1013
01:18:36,419 --> 01:18:38,419
Now, take a deep breath.

1014
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:40,379
Oh, come on.

1015
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:47,138
That was all right, wasn't it?
It didn't hurt.

1016
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:55,258
Es, it does wonders for your figure.

1017
01:18:55,924 --> 01:19:01,123
- I'm like the ossified woman in a sideshow.
- You look grand, simply elegant.

1018
01:19:02,419 --> 01:19:05,499
I feel elegant, but I can't breathe.

1019
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,579
No, please...

1020
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:14,019
I think if I just can
sit down for a minute.

1021
01:19:23,099 --> 01:19:26,298
- I can't go through with it.
- You've got to start sometime.

1022
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:32,218
I went through this last year. And if we ever
needed every ounce of allure, it's tonight.

1023
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:37,338
If we're going to wreck Lucille Ballard's
evening, we've got to be a sensation.

1024
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,539
Don't you think I could be a
sensation without the corset?

1025
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:46,099
You're competing with an Eastern girl. I'll
wager she doesn't move without a corset.

1026
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:49,660
Well, I certainly don't
relish wearing this thing...

1027
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,298
but pride has come to the rescue.
For tonight, I'll do anything.

1028
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:57,419
It'll be worth it. If we create
a breathtaking effect...

1029
01:19:57,579 --> 01:20:00,579
it'll be simple to monopolize
all the worthwhile men.

1030
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,459
Exactly.

1031
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:06,138
There are only going to be about
20 boys worth looking at.

1032
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:08,700
We can certainly handle 20 men.

1033
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,539
I should hope.

1034
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,019
- Can you handle 10?
- Well, seven or eight.

1035
01:20:14,178 --> 01:20:16,900
If you guarantee eight, I can ha...

1036
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:21,579
I can handle the rest of them.

1037
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:25,740
- What about John Truett?
- I'll devote myself to John...

1038
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,499
but in between, I'll make my
presence felt amongst the others.

1039
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,178
- Es? Someone to see you at the back door.
- Who?

1040
01:20:32,338 --> 01:20:34,740
Someone that looks like John Truett.

1041
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:43,338
- What did you get me for Christmas?
- You'll find out tomorrow.

1042
01:20:43,499 --> 01:20:45,338
I hope it's a hunting knife.

1043
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,138
- Hello, John. Come in.
- Hello.

1044
01:20:51,298 --> 01:20:54,860
Es, I've got some bad news.

1045
01:20:55,019 --> 01:20:59,660
- Your aunt in the hospital?
- No, no. My tuxedo in the tailor's.

1046
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,338
- Well, what about it?
- I was playing basketball...

1047
01:21:02,499 --> 01:21:05,539
and when I got there, it was closed.
The tuxedo.

1048
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,019
I mean the tailor's.

1049
01:21:08,178 --> 01:21:12,099
- Well, can't you borrow one?
- Everybody who has one is going to the ball.

1050
01:21:13,019 --> 01:21:14,979
Well, what about your father's?

1051
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:16,620
That was my father's.

1052
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:20,700
Well, find the tailor and
make him open the shop.

1053
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:24,539
I know his name is Jones, but
I don't know where he lives.

1054
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:30,218
- Oh, this is ghastly.
- I'm sorry, Es.

1055
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:33,178
I wouldn't blame you if you
never spoke to me again.

1056
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,099
Oh, well, you didn't do it on purpose.

1057
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,740
Well, I guess there's nothing else to say.

1058
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,459
Unless you want to do
something else tonight.

1059
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:47,338
No, thank you. I think I'll
stay home and do some packing.

1060
01:21:47,499 --> 01:21:52,258
You know, we're leaving St.
Louis in a few days.

1061
01:21:52,419 --> 01:21:54,258
I know.

1062
01:21:54,419 --> 01:21:58,298
And this is a fine going-away present
I'm giving you for Christmas.

1063
01:21:58,499 --> 01:22:03,419
- I'll bet you really hate me.
- Oh, no, John, I don't hate you.

1064
01:22:04,298 --> 01:22:07,298
I just hate basketball.

1065
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:18,700
Es, darling, what is it? What's the matter?

1066
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:22,218
Nothing. I just wish I
were dead, that's all.

1067
01:22:22,379 --> 01:22:24,740
Did something happen with John?

1068
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,860
- He can't take me to the dance.
- Why not?

1069
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:31,740
His father's suit's locked
up in the tailor's.

1070
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:35,579
Oh, that's awful, you poor
dear, but don't worry.

1071
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,379
Lon will take the both of us.

1072
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:42,820
You don't think I'm going to the smartest
ball of the season with my brother, do you?

1073
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:45,539
Well, I like that. You
wanted me to go with him.

1074
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,579
Well, that was different.

1075
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,298
- You didn't have a date.
- Neither have you.

1076
01:22:50,459 --> 01:22:51,700
Well, I had one.

1077
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,099
If Lon's good enough to take
me he's good enough for you.

1078
01:22:55,258 --> 01:22:57,059
Besides, you have to go.

1079
01:22:57,218 --> 01:23:00,740
I can't handle 20 men alone. I admit it.

1080
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,419
One sister going with her
brother has been done...

1081
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:08,178
but two sisters makes the whole family
look ridiculous. I won't do it!

1082
01:23:08,338 --> 01:23:11,660
We'll see what Mama has to say about that.

1083
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:19,419
Come in.

1084
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:22,979
You know, the man that built
this house cheated your father.

1085
01:23:23,138 --> 01:23:26,019
The walls are as thin as paper.

1086
01:23:27,099 --> 01:23:29,379
- Oh, Grandpa.
- Now, now, now, now.

1087
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,780
You know, with your hair like this...

1088
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:35,660
you're the very image of your grandma.

1089
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,138
I remember the first dance I took her to.

1090
01:23:38,298 --> 01:23:41,218
Her father told her she'd
have to be home at 10:00.

1091
01:23:41,379 --> 01:23:44,820
And she was crying, just like you are now.

1092
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:46,939
I'm sorry. I...

1093
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,820
Oh, you must think I'm an awful baby.

1094
01:23:49,979 --> 01:23:51,820
Now, now, now. You go right ahead.

1095
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:56,258
It isn't often a pretty girl has
a real legitimate reason to cry.

1096
01:23:57,178 --> 01:23:58,820
A funny thing.

1097
01:23:58,979 --> 01:24:01,620
I took my tuxedo out of
mothballs yesterday.

1098
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,820
Looks pretty good too.

1099
01:24:03,979 --> 01:24:05,939
You know, suits are like men.

1100
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:08,740
They like to step out once in a while...

1101
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,178
with a pretty dress.

1102
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,019
That suit of mine does the
greatest one-step you ever saw.

1103
01:24:20,099 --> 01:24:22,780
Grandpa, are you actually...

1104
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,379
What's this about your
not going to the dance?

1105
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:30,338
Who says I'm not going?

1106
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,539
Of course I'm going...

1107
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,780
with the handsomest man in town.

1108
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,019
I'll pick you up at 8.

1109
01:25:21,298 --> 01:25:25,138
- Have you got her dance card filled out?
- Practically.

1110
01:25:25,379 --> 01:25:28,860
"Clinton Badger, Hugo
Boorvis, Sidney Gorcey..."

1111
01:25:29,019 --> 01:25:30,620
Oh, Es, you fiend.

1112
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,900
Everyone's a perfect horror!

1113
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:34,740
She'll remember St. Louis.

1114
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,459
Oh, look. There's Warren.

1115
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,620
- That must be her.
- Come on.

1116
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,258
No. You go on. I have one
more name to put in. Go on.

1117
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:48,338
- Did he go to Chicago and see the man?
- He started.

1118
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:50,539
He was going to see him. What happened...

1119
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,860
- Hello, Lon.
- Good evening, Lucille.

1120
01:25:53,019 --> 01:25:55,860
- How are you, Warren?
- Hello, old man. Good evening, sir.

1121
01:25:56,059 --> 01:25:59,138
- May I present my grandfather?
- Grandpa Prophater.

1122
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:01,820
- You're one of my favorite people.
- Thank you.

1123
01:26:02,019 --> 01:26:03,900
Lon has spent hours talking about you.

1124
01:26:04,099 --> 01:26:07,620
I can understand any young man wanting
to spend hours talking to you.

1125
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:09,338
On any subject.

1126
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,740
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1127
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:16,059
- Miss Ballard, may I present Miss Smith?
- Oh, I'm so glad to know you.

1128
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:19,419
- Is this Esther or Rose?
- Esther will be along in a few minutes.

1129
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,019
Then this must be Rose.

1130
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:26,338
Now, look. I'm gonna take my life
into my hands and say something.

1131
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:30,218
That is if I can say it before
Warren tries to strangle me.

1132
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:34,660
We're all grown up, and if we'd only act
that way, Warren would be here with Rose...

1133
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,660
instead of spending the
evening talking about you...

1134
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:42,099
- Lucille!
- Well, you're not going to deny it?

1135
01:26:43,138 --> 01:26:45,539
No. No, I'm not.

1136
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,900
Of course, that leaves Lon
and me without partners.

1137
01:26:49,059 --> 01:26:52,539
But otherwise it's a lovely arrangement.

1138
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,860
I think we can work out that problem
if we give it a little thought.

1139
01:26:57,059 --> 01:26:59,939
Well, we've got the whole
evening to think about it.

1140
01:27:01,059 --> 01:27:03,900
- Hello. How are you, Warren?
- Just fine, Esther.

1141
01:27:04,059 --> 01:27:07,258
Miss Ballard, this is Esther Smith.
Esther, Lucille Ballard.

1142
01:27:07,419 --> 01:27:11,099
- I've been anxious to meet you.
- Esther, we've been talking.

1143
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:12,740
Yes. I wish I'd been here.

1144
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,138
I hope you don't mind...

1145
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:17,499
but we've taken the liberty of
filling out your dance card.

1146
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,979
Thank you. How considerate.

1147
01:27:19,138 --> 01:27:21,539
I'm so thrilled about
you coming to New York.

1148
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,419
Promise to let me give you your
first party. You will, won't you?

1149
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,059
Esther, the plans have been changed.

1150
01:27:28,258 --> 01:27:30,820
Lucille suggested Lon and
she pair off tonight...

1151
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,138
and Warren and me.

1152
01:27:33,298 --> 01:27:36,740
The plans have been changed.

1153
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:46,419
What's this about Miss
Ballard's dance card?

1154
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:49,780
I must have mislaid it. I
better go and find it, though.

1155
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:52,660
Try looking in your hand.

1156
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,218
"Clinton Badger"?

1157
01:27:57,379 --> 01:27:59,419
"Hugo Boorvis"?

1158
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:01,820
"Sidney Gorcey"?

1159
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,539
- How about a dance?
- Well, if you're on my card.

1160
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,939
May I have my card, please?

1161
01:28:14,099 --> 01:28:16,860
Is this Miss Ballard's card?

1162
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,579
Well, let me see.

1163
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,218
Oh, no. I made a mistake and put
your name on my card. That's yours.

1164
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:24,939
- Thank you.
- This is mine.

1165
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:28,178
Why, Lon, you're down for the first dance.

1166
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:35,860
- Hello.
- Hey, Miss Esther!

1167
01:28:36,059 --> 01:28:39,499
Where's this Lulu Ballard you put
me down for? I'm ready and willing.

1168
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,298
Oh, well, Clinton, there's been a mistake.

1169
01:28:42,499 --> 01:28:45,019
- I'm taking her dances, if you don't mind.
- Mind?

1170
01:28:45,218 --> 01:28:47,178
I should say not!

1171
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:33,860
Pardon me, young man, but in
the great country of China...

1172
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:36,700
when a stranger admires one
of your possessions...

1173
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,419
it's courtesy to offer it to him.
Interesting.

1174
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:41,740
Yes. Well, I spent many years in China.

1175
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,979
If you want to make me feel at home,
you might offer me your partner.

1176
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,019
Spoken like a gentleman.

1177
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,138
Oh, Grandpa, you're the
first human being...

1178
01:30:01,298 --> 01:30:03,379
I've danced with all evening.

1179
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:05,820
Esther, I wouldn't want
this rumored about...

1180
01:30:05,979 --> 01:30:09,059
but I'm pretty proud of you.

1181
01:30:09,419 --> 01:30:12,178
It's our last dance in St. Louis.

1182
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:15,099
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

1183
01:31:10,019 --> 01:31:14,138
I wouldn't have said it, Esther, if
I thought it would make you cry.

1184
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:18,099
I've imagined you saying
it thousands of times.

1185
01:31:18,258 --> 01:31:21,620
And I always planned exactly how I'd act.

1186
01:31:23,379 --> 01:31:26,099
I never planned to cry.

1187
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,740
- Well, at least you didn't laugh.
- Laugh?

1188
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,860
I never asked a girl to marry me before.

1189
01:31:33,059 --> 01:31:35,740
- I guess maybe I was kind of...
- Oh, John.

1190
01:31:35,939 --> 01:31:39,178
No one could have done it more beautifully.

1191
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,218
I'm very proud.

1192
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:44,660
Esther, will you?

1193
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:47,740
- Will you, Esther?
- Of course I will, John.

1194
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:49,499
Well...

1195
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,379
Gosh, the time we've wasted.

1196
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:03,059
Say, do you realize I might have lost you?

1197
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:05,459
Three more days, you'd have been gone.

1198
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,579
Let's not even think about it.

1199
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:10,700
We might never have seen each other again.

1200
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:13,740
I kept telling myself
even if I did go away...

1201
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,138
we'd find some way to be together.

1202
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,298
But I never really believed it.

1203
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:21,178
When you go to New York,
it'll be with your husband.

1204
01:32:21,338 --> 01:32:24,860
Your folks can show us the town.
Meet us at the station.

1205
01:32:25,059 --> 01:32:28,258
- Let's go and tell them now.
- Oh, no. Not tonight.

1206
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:29,820
I mean...

1207
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:33,539
I'd rather just the two of
us knew about it tonight.

1208
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,459
Esther, you're not changing your...

1209
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:42,138
- You do feel it's the right thing, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

1210
01:32:42,338 --> 01:32:44,059
Yes.

1211
01:32:45,379 --> 01:32:49,338
I don't have to be an engineer.
College takes too long anyway.

1212
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:52,620
I can get a job right away
and support you in style.

1213
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:55,099
Of course you can, darling.

1214
01:32:55,419 --> 01:32:57,740
We're not gonna let them talk us out of it.

1215
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,700
After all, we are of age.

1216
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:04,379
Practically.

1217
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,860
John.

1218
01:33:09,379 --> 01:33:11,419
Even if I did go to New York...

1219
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:15,379
we could still work something out somehow.

1220
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:17,459
Couldn't we?

1221
01:33:19,138 --> 01:33:21,379
Do you think so?

1222
01:33:32,178 --> 01:33:34,499
Merry Christmas, John.

1223
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:38,218
Merry Christmas, Esther.

1224
01:34:09,459 --> 01:34:12,099
Tootie, you bad girl. You should be asleep.

1225
01:34:12,258 --> 01:34:13,539
Did he come yet?

1226
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:18,138
I've been waiting such a long
time, and I haven't seen a thing.

1227
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:21,178
- Did who come?
- Santa Claus.

1228
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,939
He's not going to come until you're asleep.

1229
01:34:24,099 --> 01:34:26,660
How will he know how to find us next year?

1230
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:29,499
He's so used to coming here.

1231
01:34:30,138 --> 01:34:33,459
Oh, you can't fool him.

1232
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:37,019
He can find anybody he wants to find.

1233
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:53,979
If Santa Claus brings me any
toys, I'm taking them with me.

1234
01:34:54,178 --> 01:34:57,298
I'm taking all my dolls. The dead ones too.

1235
01:34:57,459 --> 01:35:01,258
- I'm taking everything.
- Of course you are.

1236
01:35:01,419 --> 01:35:03,298
I'll help you pack them myself.

1237
01:35:03,459 --> 01:35:06,138
You don't have to leave anything behind...

1238
01:35:06,338 --> 01:35:08,939
except your snow people, of course.

1239
01:35:16,979 --> 01:35:20,820
We'd look pretty silly trying to get
them on the train, wouldn't we?

Tootie?

1255
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,178
Tootie.

1256
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,258
Tootie.

1257
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,700
- What's wrong with Tootie?
- I don't know, Papa.

1258
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,419
Tootie!

1259
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:20,019
Tootie, where are you?

1260
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,620
Tootie!

1261
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:38,218
What are you doing? Come in the house.
You'll catch pneumonia.

1262
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:41,059
Nobody's gonna have them if
we're going to New York.

1263
01:38:41,218 --> 01:38:43,820
I'd rather kill them if we
can't take them with us.

1264
01:38:43,979 --> 01:38:46,099
Tootie, darling, don't cry.

1265
01:38:46,258 --> 01:38:48,298
It's all right. Don't cry.

1266
01:38:48,459 --> 01:38:51,539
- You can build snow people in New York.
- No, you can't.

1267
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,979
You can't do anything
like you do in St. Louis.

1268
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,178
Oh, no, darling, you're wrong.

1269
01:38:57,379 --> 01:39:00,820
No, no, New York is a wonderful town.

1270
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:03,979
Look, everybody dreams about going there.

1271
01:39:04,138 --> 01:39:08,419
But we're luckier than lots of
families because we're really going.

1272
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:12,138
Wait'll you see the fine
home we're gonna have...

1273
01:39:12,298 --> 01:39:15,059
and the loads and loads
of friends we'll make.

1274
01:39:15,218 --> 01:39:17,539
Wonderful friends.

1275
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:21,019
But the main thing, Tootie, is,
we're all going to be together...

1276
01:39:21,218 --> 01:39:23,298
just like we've always been.

1277
01:39:23,459 --> 01:39:25,660
That's what really counts.

1278
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:30,138
We could be happy anywhere
as long as we're together.

1279
01:39:56,218 --> 01:39:58,700
What's the matter, Papa?

1280
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:02,298
Nothing, dear.

1281
01:40:02,979 --> 01:40:04,579
Nothing.

1282
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:09,820
Everything's fine.

1283
01:40:47,138 --> 01:40:50,660
Come on, darling. That's a girl.

1284
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:55,218
Come on, darling. That's a girl.

1285
01:40:55,379 --> 01:40:58,459
Santa Claus is gonna be here any minute.

1286
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,860
Don't cry.

1287
01:41:40,059 --> 01:41:41,780
Anna! Anna!

1288
01:41:47,459 --> 01:41:50,419
Anna! Anna! Rose!

1289
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:52,499
Grandpa! Esther!

1290
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:55,740
- Lonnie, what is it?
- What is it, Anna? I'm coming.

1291
01:41:55,939 --> 01:41:57,939
- What's the matter?
- What is it, Lon?

1292
01:41:58,099 --> 01:42:00,218
- Go on and sit down.
- What's happened?

1293
01:42:00,419 --> 01:42:02,620
Sit down, everybody. Over there.

1294
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:05,059
- Papa, what is it?
- All of you.

1295
01:42:13,218 --> 01:42:15,419
I've got a few words to say.

1296
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:18,900
We're not moving to New York. I
don't want to hear a word about it.

1297
01:42:19,419 --> 01:42:21,138
We're going to stay right here.

1298
01:42:21,298 --> 01:42:24,379
- We're going to stay here till we rot.
- We haven't rotted yet.

1299
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:27,419
But what will you say to Mr. Fenton?

1300
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,019
That I've changed my mind.

1301
01:42:29,218 --> 01:42:32,579
I'm a junior partner of Fenton,
Rayburn and Company, not a puppet.

1302
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:35,700
And if they don't like it,
well, that's just too bad.

1303
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,579
They'll have to like it.

1304
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,298
But Lonnie, you did think it was
a fine opportunity, didn't you?

1305
01:42:41,459 --> 01:42:44,099
New York hasn't got a
copyright on opportunity.

1306
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:47,419
St. Louis is headed for a boom
that'll make your head swim.

1307
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,099
This is a great town.

1308
01:42:49,258 --> 01:42:52,620
You don't appreciate it because
it's right here under your noses.

1309
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:57,178
The grass is always greener
in somebody else's yard.

1310
01:43:00,059 --> 01:43:02,459
Rose Smith, we can't go
on like this any longer!

1311
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:05,499
We're going to get married
at the earliest opportunity.

1312
01:43:05,502 --> 01:43:07,940
And I don't want to hear any arguments!

1313
01:43:08,298 --> 01:43:10,019
That's final.

1314
01:43:10,579 --> 01:43:13,059
I love you! Merry Christmas.

1315
01:43:14,338 --> 01:43:15,579
Merry Christmas.

1316
01:43:18,499 --> 01:43:22,579
- Anna, who is that boy?
- Now, Lonnie. He's a very fine young man.

1317
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:25,059
- We'll discuss it later.
- He's so excited...

1318
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:28,539
he's liable to leave on his
honeymoon without Rose.

1319
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:32,379
You handled the whole thing magnificently.
He's putty in your hands.

1320
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:34,298
Rose, I hope you'll be very happy.

1321
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:37,900
- I'd like to meet that boy sometime.
- Oh, Papa.

1322
01:43:38,059 --> 01:43:43,099
Mama, Rose is gonna get married. Maybe
she ought to open her presents now.

1323
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:45,820
You little faker, it's your
presents you're after.

1324
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:48,860
Good heavens. We've completely forgotten.
It's Christmas.

1325
01:43:49,499 --> 01:43:50,979
Merry Christmas.

1326
01:43:51,138 --> 01:43:54,178
- Merry Christmas, Mama.
- Merry Christmas.

1327
01:43:54,338 --> 01:43:56,298
Merry Christmas, Rose.

1328
01:43:56,459 --> 01:44:00,820
Oh, Papa, you've given us the nicest
Christmas present anybody could ask for.

1329
01:44:01,138 --> 01:44:03,019
Merry Christmas.

1330
01:44:03,178 --> 01:44:05,419
- Merry Christmas, Papa.
- Don't crowd, now.

1331
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:07,780
I hope you like that,
it's the same as mine.

1332
01:44:07,939 --> 01:44:11,820
- Gee, thanks.
- This is for you, Rose.

1333
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:13,820
Oh, thank you.

1334
01:44:14,099 --> 01:44:16,379
- This couldn't be a tie.
- It is. I wrapped it.

1335
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:19,099
- Really?
- This is for Agnes.

1336
01:44:19,258 --> 01:44:21,218
- Thank you.
- This tie is so light...

1337
01:44:21,379 --> 01:44:26,138
I'll have to wear a muffler. A hatpin!
Just what I needed!

1338
01:44:26,338 --> 01:44:28,979
Oh, Lonnie.

1339
01:44:55,138 --> 01:44:57,780
- Oh, look at Tootie.
- Oh, here's Warren!

1340
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:00,539
- Oh, Warren.
- How are you?

1341
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:11,099
We're gonna beat you.

1342
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:18,499
- Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

1343
01:45:19,059 --> 01:45:21,338
Perfectly beautiful day.

1344
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:24,579
- Grandpa, it'll be perfect.
- Come on. Here's the cab.

1345
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,820
Mommy's here.

1346
01:45:26,979 --> 01:45:29,700
Oh, Mommy, you're beautiful!

1347
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:42,379
- Get in.
- I want to sit with the driver.

1348
01:45:42,539 --> 01:45:44,099
All right, Tootie. Up we go.

1349
01:45:44,258 --> 01:45:45,820
- There we are.
- All right.

1350
01:45:46,019 --> 01:45:49,459
- Sit over there. Make room for Grandpa.
- There's room enough here.

1351
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,419
- All ready.
- Where to, Mr. Smith?

1352
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:56,499
- You tell him, Tootie.
- To the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

1353
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,419
Right you are.

1354
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,900
Mama, you should have seen what we saw.

1355
01:46:21,059 --> 01:46:24,539
- Daddy, you never saw anything like it.
- Stop eating that spun sugar.

1356
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,019
- You'll spoil your dinner.
- Papa, we saw the Galveston Flood.

1357
01:46:28,218 --> 01:46:30,499
Big waves came up and
flooded the whole city.

1358
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:33,338
When the water went back,
it was muddy and horrible.

1359
01:46:33,539 --> 01:46:35,740
- Full of dead bodies.
- Oh, Tootie.

1360
01:46:42,459 --> 01:46:45,218
Oh, isn't it breathtaking, John!

1361
01:46:45,379 --> 01:46:48,218
I never dreamed anything
could be so beautiful.

1362
01:46:48,379 --> 01:46:53,019
I liked it better when it was a swamp
and there was just the two of us.

1363
01:46:55,099 --> 01:46:57,258
Esther! John!

1364
01:46:58,939 --> 01:47:01,099
I forgot about it too.

1365
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:06,539
- Hurry up, you two. We're starving.
- I'm so sorry. We didn't mean to keep you.

1366
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:09,258
- We're all here.
- Where is the French restaurant?

1367
01:47:09,419 --> 01:47:13,138
- It's over there.
- No, it's across from Machinery Hall.

1368
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:17,860
Now, now, let's not lose our heads!
I know exactly where it is.

1369
01:47:18,019 --> 01:47:20,019
Just follow me.

1370
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:24,379
- Oh, look. The lights!
- Oh, how beautiful!

1371
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:38,579
There's never been anything
like it in the whole world.

1372
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:42,298
We don't have to come here on
a train or stay in a hotel.

1373
01:47:43,218 --> 01:47:45,660
It's right in our own hometown.

1374
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,740
Grandpa, they'll never
tear it down, will they?

1375
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,660
Well, they'd better not.

1376
01:47:51,019 --> 01:47:53,660
I can't believe it.

1377
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:56,860
Right here where we live.

1378
01:48:00,019 --> 01:48:03,419
Right here in St. Louis.

1379
01:48:14,059 --> 01:48:15,059
