1
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,159
Action, Jake.

2
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,927
Cut.
Look, what's the problem here?

3
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:47,839
Remember, I want you to open the coffin
a beat after you open your eyes.

4
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,375
Get him out of herel
Come on! Raise the camera!

5
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,173
Joe, give me a hand.
Something's the matter with him.

6
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,681
That's all right, Jake.
Just relax.

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,685
We got you. Something's going on.
Something's weird.

8
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:00,187
- Are you okay, babe?
- Give him some air.

9
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:03,248
What's the matter? Speak to me.
Come on, talk.

10
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,351
What's the matter?

11
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:08,863
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

12
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,367
I was in the coffin. I closed my eyes.
I thought everything would be okay.

13
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:14,926
I opened my eyes, and the camera
was right on top of me...

14
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,700
and I couldn't move.

15
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:19,867
It's no big thing.
I just...

16
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:23,037
For a second there,
I just couldn't move.

17
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:25,205
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,045
Firel

19
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:29,051
Nol What happened?

20
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,885
Get up there!
Put some water on it!

21
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,221
This is great.
That's terrific.

22
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:39,729
You got it under control?

23
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:46,404
Look, Jake,
you really look exhausted, babe.

24
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:50,239
Why don't you take a shower
and go on home. We lost the sun.

25
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,574
Let me try it one more time.
I can do it.

26
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:56,310
I know you can,
but we don't have any sun anymore.

27
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:33,447
Can I have nuts with that
and a Manhattan?

28
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,956
- Yeah.
- And fries.

29
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:36,457
- Right.
- Rings.

30
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:40,122
- Anything to drink?
- Two large Cokes with ice.

31
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:43,291
Onions on everything.

32
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,461
- That to go?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,801
4.99.

34
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:49,306
Keep the change.

35
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,468
You too.
See you guys.

36
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:04,783
- Scully, how's that picture coming?
- Good. Fine.

37
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,950
- Great.
- I'll have a Jack Daniels, neat.

38
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:11,120
Are you serious?
You quit drinking. Remember?

39
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:13,129
Just get the drink, Doug.

40
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,296
What's the matter?

41
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,460
They cut your big scene?

42
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,546
Again.

43
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:44,596
Carol?

44
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,369
I thought you were a bartender,
not a priest.

45
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,566
That's right.
I'm a bartender.

46
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,041
Then keep the fucking glass filled.

47
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,015
Keep your own glass filled.

48
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:06,680
- I'm sorry.
- That's cool.

49
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:09,350
Just don't pay any attention to me.

50
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,859
l...

51
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,433
You need a place to stay?

52
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,372
Yeah, I guess I do.

53
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,570
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

54
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:59,577
I am. I got a week off.

55
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,977
I figured I'd go
to some interviews, stay busy.

56
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:06,144
- Great.
- Do you know about any sublets?

57
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,984
- I'II check around.
- Something available immediately.

58
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,149
- Not offhand.
- What... Ho!

59
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,990
The whole world's here.
You two know each other?

60
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,826
- Jake Scully, Sam Bouchard.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

61
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:20,333
- Right here.
- I'll see you in class later.

62
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,995
- We got class today?
- At 3:00.

63
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,540
- Right.
- Good luck.

64
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,838
What have you been doing lately?

65
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,676
I just started a low-budget,
independent horror film.

66
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,512
'Vampire's Kiss."
I play the vampire.

67
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,683
Sounds interesting.

68
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:41,849
Before that I did Petruchio
in 'Taming of the Shrew."

69
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:43,688
Anything else?

70
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,856
You mean anything good?

71
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:49,696
You are working.

72
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:54,260
- That's good now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:10,053
- Hi. Small town.
- Yeah.

74
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:12,886
- Jack Scully.
- Jake.

75
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,391
Give them hell.

76
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,563
Hello.

77
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,650
I remember that it was dark.

78
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:39,920
Really black.

79
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:43,583
I was just a little kid.

80
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:47,595
And the wall behind me was cold.

81
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,758
And damp.

82
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,597
I was hiding. I was...

83
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,432
Oh, yeah.

84
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,597
I was part of this game: Sardine.

85
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:59,268
I was it, and I was hiding.

86
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,937
Everybody was looking for me.

87
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,448
And there was humming.

88
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,780
I was behind the freezer
in the basement.

89
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:15,952
And I had jammed myself in
so hard behind the freezer...

90
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:18,859
that I couldn't move.

91
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,961
I'm afraid.

92
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,973
Uh-huh.
What are you afraid of?

93
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,744
They're not gonna find me.

94
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:36,282
But they're not supposed
to find you.

95
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,943
But I'm afraid
because I can't move.

96
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,649
Why don't you cry out?

97
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,986
I can't. I'm afraid.

98
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,495
Besides, I'm the sardine.
They're not supposed to find me.

99
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,332
Now particularize that.

100
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:56,837
Who can't find you?

101
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,931
My brothers.
They're bigger than me.

102
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,175
First time
they ever let me play.

103
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,510
If they're your brothers,
they'll want to help you, right?

104
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,517
No. They won't let me play again.

105
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:12,645
- They're bigger than you are.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,850
Will they hurt you?

107
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,358
Yes.

108
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,692
How?

109
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:22,027
They'll laugh at me for getting stuck
behind the freezer...

110
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,589
and for crying out for help.

111
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,700
The big baby.

112
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,204
That's right.

113
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:33,376
You are a baby.

114
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,213
I know.

115
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:40,218
Yeah, and you're afraid.

116
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:41,720
Yeah.

117
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,224
You must act.

118
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,234
I can't. I'm afraid.

119
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:57,498
- You'll never escape.
- I know.

120
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,406
You'll die.

121
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,076
Yeah.

122
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,577
Bullshit!

123
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:08,583
You've got to act!

124
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,286
Fuck the fear.

125
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,923
You've got to cry out for help!
Come on!

126
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,925
Use your body!
Cry for help!

127
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,795
You can do it.

128
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,701
I want you to cry out.

129
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:29,260
I can't. I'm a sardine.

130
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,330
Sardines in a can are dead.

131
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,603
They can't feel.
They can't be afraid.

132
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,306
But you're alive and afraid.

133
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,440
You're not a goddamn dead sardine!

134
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,452
- This is crap.
- Dig down deep!

135
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,188
Cry out!

136
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,995
- I can't.
- Come on.

137
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,863
Leave the guy alone.

138
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,904
Do not interrupt this exercise.

139
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,873
This looks like
a mind-fuck to me.

140
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:05,139
What is your name? You're not
a member of this class, are you?

141
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,380
That's right. I'm not.

142
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,144
I thought this was a class for acting,
not humiliation.

143
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:17,419
What gives you the right
to fuck around with this guy's head?

144
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,824
- I think you better leave.
- I think that's a good idea.

145
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,994
I want to act.
Come on.

146
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:31,061
Class is out.
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,573
I'm sorry, Will.

148
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:35,075
I can't do this today.

149
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,410
This is called an exit.

150
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:46,253
Shit.

151
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,753
What a fool I am.

152
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,923
You're too hard on yourself.

153
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:58,265
Some of these guys
can't get a job.

154
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,932
They put an ad in the trade.
They call themselves teachers.

155
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:05,603
What do they teach us?
How to be more fucked up than we are.

156
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,111
That's not it.

157
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:16,053
- Can we get another round?
- Coming up.

158
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,265
- Thanks.
- Check.

159
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,265
Are you married?

160
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:32,638
Separated.

161
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:36,575
Me too, as of yesterday.

162
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:41,640
We weren't married,
but it was almost the same thing.

163
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,148
What happened?

164
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,149
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

165
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,158
That's okay.
It's just...

166
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,323
Sounds so stupid.

167
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:57,495
These things usually do.

168
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:02,433
Caught her in bed
with another guy.

169
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,064
Can you believe that?

170
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,574
Man.

171
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,168
You had no idea?

172
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,484
None.

173
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,687
Christ, I keep seeing it.

174
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,357
Carol lying there.

175
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,362
Her face was glowing.

176
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:34,971
- Her face was glowing?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,977
How do you get
a girl's face to glow?

178
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,535
I got 16 years of good humping.

179
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:45,051
Not once did I get a glimmer,
let alone a fucking glow.

180
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,552
Glowing?

181
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:53,223
- I'm sorry. That's tough.
- No, you're right.

182
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:55,558
It's not that big a deal, really.

183
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,224
- You kicked the bitch out I hope.
- I didn't.

184
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,894
- Why not?
- It was her place.

185
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,071
You've been through the shitter.

186
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:16,420
- Where are you staying?
- I got a friend with a floor.

187
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,763
You ready for some good news?

188
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,925
Yeah.

189
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:31,094
I got this five-week gig coming up.

190
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,434
Seattle Rep's doing a revival
of 'Private Lives."

191
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,600
I've been house-sitting
for a friend.

192
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:39,268
- He gives me a good deal on the place...
- I've been looking for a sublet.

193
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:42,280
- Would this be available right away?
- Wait here.

194
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:45,112
Let me make a phone call.
Don't move.

195
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:51,449
- Do you like plants?
- Sure.

196
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:59,693
- I can't believe this.
- It's something, isn't it?

197
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,139
Be if ever so humble.

198
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,073
- This is unbelievable.
- I know if's nof much.

199
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:14,310
- Can you handle this?
- I've never seen anything like it.

200
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,319
- Your friend must really be loaded.
- He's filthy with the stuff.

201
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,825
Anyway, here they are.
Water them every day after 6:00.

202
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,984
- Right.
- You got it?

203
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,498
- That's it.
- Listen, this is really nice of you.

204
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,830
No thanks necessary.
One struggling actor helping another.

205
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,665
- That's what it's all about.
- Thank you.

206
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,672
- Just don't let the damn plants die.
- You got it.

207
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,504
- Where is he anyway?
- Alan?

208
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,841
- Yeah.
- He spends a lot of time in Europe.

209
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,347
I got a well-stocked bar.

210
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,507
- Rotating bed.
- "Rotating"?

211
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,520
Sauna and Jacuzzi in the back
just beyond the walk-in closets.

212
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,954
As soon as I pack up,
you can put your stuff away.

213
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:54,514
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah, l...

214
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,361
The hell with it.
I got time for one more drink.

215
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,197
I'll still be able
to catch the last flight.

216
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:07,372
What a setup.
This is great.

217
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,874
Isn't it?

218
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:14,548
Thank you.

219
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,049
- Sam, here's to a friendship...
- Wait.

220
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,721
Let's do this right.
Come here.

221
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:29,397
To Hollywood.

222
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,898
Yeah.

223
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,901
What a view.

224
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:41,237
That's just part of it.

225
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:46,249
There is one very special feature
to this house.

226
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,413
- What are you looking at?
- Where are you?

227
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,559
There she is.

228
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:00,930
Show time.

229
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,097
I'd like you to meet
my favorite neighbor.

230
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,680
- See her?
- Whoa.

231
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,785
It gets better.

232
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,792
- What's she doing?
- Just keep watching. You'II see.

233
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,659
- You want to get a little closer?
- You bet.

234
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,461
- Oh, my God.
- Focused?

235
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:37,063
- She's a little out of focus. Yes!
- Yes? Hang on.

236
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,142
Does she do this a lot?

237
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:43,303
Like clockwork, every night.

238
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,359
Jesus.

239
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,491
What do you think?

240
00:23:34,564 --> 00:23:36,692
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

241
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,826
Lady does the same gig every night.

242
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:41,498
Did you get a look at her face?

243
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,940
Too bad. She is gorgeous.
Shit.

244
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,172
- I gotta get going.
- Can I help you?

245
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,678
All right.

246
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:50,511
Don't forget your scarf.

247
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:54,010
Here's the key.

248
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,521
Try not to make too many
long-distance phone calls.

249
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,353
Thanks again.
This is good of you.

250
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:00,189
- You're doing me a favor too.
- Thank you.

251
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,195
- Take it easy.
- Knock 'em dead!

252
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,698
They're already dead in Seattle.

253
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,199
So long.

254
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,872
My, my

255
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,377
Uh-oh

256
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:22,212
The house is burning
buf fhere's no one home

257
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,589
Jesus!

258
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,803
Bastard.

259
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:46,640
Where fhe hell have you been?
I've been calling you all over fown.

260
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,972
I'm sorry, Frank. I've been having
some real problems with Carol.

261
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:52,536
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

262
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,481
You got a few more problems.
Rubin fired you.

263
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:58,712
- What?
- You don'f have a job anymore.

264
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,812
He gave me some bullshit
about artistic differences.

265
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,357
What the hell happened?

266
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:05,189
Nothing.
How can he do that?

267
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,889
They're doing it right now.

268
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:10,423
Can't we do something?
Maybe I should talk to Rubin.

269
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,833
You better forget it.
They've already hired another guy.

270
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:15,429
- How do you know?
- He's my client.

271
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,612
Now bring them up.

272
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,345
You're loving every minute of it,
sweetheart. It feels so good.

273
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:29,183
You're getting ready to take
a nice chunk out of the neck.

274
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,850
Hands down. Good.

275
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:33,859
All right, cut!

276
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:35,519
Kill the water and steam.

277
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,530
I thought you were gonna
give me another chance.

278
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:41,532
Look, I got a picture to make here.
I got 25 days to make it.

279
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,195
I got no time to fuck around
with a claustrophobic vampire...

280
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,536
who freezes every time
he lies down in the coffin.

281
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,701
- I'm not claustrophobic.
- Then what happened? Stage fright?

282
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:52,711
I don't know.
It never happened before.

283
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:56,715
It's never gonna happen again.
Good-bye. I gotta get back to work.

284
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,877
- You promised me another chance.
- I lied.

285
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:01,717
- Don't you yell at me!
- Big fucking deal.

286
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,552
- Get outta here! Beat it!
- Listen...

287
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:07,891
Joe, get him outta here! You don't come
in here yelling at me on my setl

288
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:10,056
- You don't have the right to lie to me.
- There's the door.

289
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,730
Go onl Get out!

290
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:16,237
Get out the door, you fruitcake.
What's wrong with you?

291
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:17,774
- He's the boss.
- It's not fair.

292
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:21,835
What's everybody standing around for?
Let's get back to work. Come on.

293
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,972
Just like clockwork.

294
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:22,476
There she goes.

295
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:05,479
Excuse me.
Could you move, please? Please!

296
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:07,284
I gotta go.
Thank you.

297
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,031
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

298
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,048
I have to see you.

299
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:07,885
What time did you call?

300
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,225
I'm never home till after 7:00.

301
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,388
Yes, he hit me again.

302
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:22,898
I've got to talk to someone.

303
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,740
Today.

304
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,902
The Beach Terrace Motel?

305
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:33,074
I'II wear something special.

306
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:34,583
You'II see.

307
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,516
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:43,026
Bye.

309
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,324
- Security, please.
- This is securify.

310
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:17,328
Please come over to Bellini's.
I think we have a problem.

311
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:08,542
Excuse me.

312
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,889
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

313
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:56,897
Did you see that guy?

314
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,222
- It's the cream Mercedes.
- Wait here, please.

315
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:11,948
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

316
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:15,951
- Can I have my car, please?
- Yes, sir.

317
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,649
Thank you.
Right away. As soon as possible.

318
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:22,791
Straight toward the beach,
down the stairs.

319
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:24,293
Thank you.

320
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:43,844
Hello?

321
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:50,085
Yes.

322
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:53,514
You've got to come.

323
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:58,321
I need to talk to you.

324
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:59,887
I've got to talk to someone.

325
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:06,029
I need you.

326
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,104
Excuse me.

327
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:12,569
Someone's following you.

328
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,583
I know.

329
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:23,947
No, it's not me.

330
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,195
Are you all right?

331
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:13,703
He got away.

332
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:16,871
You got the purse.

333
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:20,378
You better check it.
He took something.

334
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,715
What's the matter?

335
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:27,886
I'm just out of breath.

336
00:51:29,657 --> 00:51:33,218
Can you take me out of here?

337
00:51:33,294 --> 00:51:34,728
Sure.

338
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,425
- Here.
- Thank you.

339
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,927
All right. Thank you.

340
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:15,598
I feel much better now.
I'm fine.

341
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,609
I saw you back there
and at the hotel.

342
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:23,409
- You've been following me.
- Yeah.

343
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,048
Why?
Did my husband hire you?

344
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:36,962
I'm...

345
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:41,333
What?

346
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:53,045
Yes.

347
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:25,237
I can't.
I can't do this.

348
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:26,748
Not here.

349
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,004
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?

350
00:54:49,074 --> 00:54:51,941
Maybe you remember me.
This is Jake.

351
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,606
I'm the guy that almost fucked you
at the beach today.

352
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:58,446
No, that's terrible.

353
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:03,723
Hi, Gloria.

354
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,953

372
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:22,097
- There's a woman being killed.
- What?

373
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:23,932
Come on!

374
01:01:58,643 --> 01:02:02,475
L.A. Cify Emergency. This is 911.
Whaf are you reporfing?

375
01:02:03,546 --> 01:02:07,984

01:02:35,315 --> 01:02:37,340

381
01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:44,688

God!

383
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,622
I'm Detective McLean.

384
01:05:21,696 --> 01:05:23,891
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

385
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:28,368
I see you're an actor.

386
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:35,800
Yeah.

387
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:37,812
Ever been in anything?

388
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:42,717
'Emerald Point" and a "Hart To Hart"
that was pretty good.

389
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:45,550
Very interesting.

390
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:48,558
You make a living?

391
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:52,662
Yeah.

392
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:56,062
Good-Iooking boy.

393
01:05:56,135 --> 01:05:57,567
Talented.

394
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:01,036
I got a real problem with you.

395
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:04,399
What do you mean?

396
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:07,969
I mean, you're my only witness
to this murder...

397
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,983
and you're a peeper.

398
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,617
In my book, that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

399
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:17,522
- What do you mean "a sex offender"?
- Save it.

400
01:06:17,592 --> 01:06:20,152
I ask the questions.

401
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,489
What about this Indian? When he snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back.

402
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:26,159
- Is that right?
- That's right.

403
01:06:26,235 --> 01:06:28,201
Was anything missing?

404
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:30,202
I saw him take a credit card.

405
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:34,770
Not a credit card, a card key.

406
01:06:34,842 --> 01:06:36,867
He used it to get into her house.

407
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,648
Did Gloria know it was missing?

408
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:48,121
She didn't say anything to me.

409
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,060
You talked to her?

410
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:57,056
Come on,
you must have said something.

411
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:07,611
- It was just small talk, you know?
- No, I don't know.

412
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:09,614
Did you come on to her?

413
01:07:09,682 --> 01:07:11,707
Were you trying to do a number
on her head?

414
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:13,776
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her?

415
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:17,482
- You're wrong.
- Why were you following Gloria Revelle?

416
01:07:19,158 --> 01:07:23,254
Because I got concerned
when I saw that guy following her.

417
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,322
But you kept on her tail
after this other guy disappeared.

418
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,833
I know, because...

419
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,837
- I guess I wanted to...
- You wanted to what?

420
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:45,451
Nothing.

421
01:07:52,627 --> 01:07:54,060
What's this?

422
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,632
Some underpants.

423
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,136
Yours?

424
01:08:04,307 --> 01:08:05,831
Where did you get them?

425
01:08:11,982 --> 01:08:14,645
She dropped them in the trash.

426
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,813
- Who?
- Gloria.

427
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:18,879
And you just picked them up?

428
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,594
- Yeah.
- Why?

429
01:08:29,635 --> 01:08:32,468
- I don't know.
- Tell the truth.

430
01:08:32,538 --> 01:08:35,201
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

431
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:38,210
You didn't fuck her or you didn't
keep them as a souvenir?

432
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:41,768
- No to both of them.
- Are you just a harmless panty sniffer?

433
01:08:41,848 --> 01:08:44,179
- You got a dirty mind.
- That's a laugh.

434
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:48,210
You peep on her, follow her, fuck her
and keep her panties as a memento.

435
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:51,279
Then you sit on the 50-yard line
and watch her being slaughteredl

436
01:08:51,358 --> 01:08:53,849
That's not what happened!
I tried to save her!

437
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:02,759
Mm-hmm. Some save, Scully.

438
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,434
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

439
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,250
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

440
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:23,656
- What?
- Alexander Revelle, Gloria's husband.

441
01:09:23,728 --> 01:09:25,252
You knew him?

442
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:29,566
I never met him.

443
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:34,294
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

444
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,339
Was he around
when Gloria got nailed?

445
01:09:39,845 --> 01:09:41,836
Do you think he had something
to do with it?

446
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:47,517
Gloria Revelle was a very rich lady.

447
01:09:49,654 --> 01:09:54,024
When rich wives get dead,
I usually go after the husband.

448
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:59,489
The only problem is
you saw a thief.

449
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:02,034
An Indian killed Gloria Revelle.

450
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:11,138
I won't hold you, Scully.

451
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:14,147
We have witnesses
to back up your story.

452
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:18,683
But I want you
to think real hard about this.

453
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:21,221
As far as I'm concerned...

454
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:24,691
you're the real reason Gloria Revelle
got murdered.

455
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:30,827
If you hadn't been so busy getting off
by peeping on her...

456
01:10:30,901 --> 01:10:34,928
if you had called the police
about your blood brother, the Indian...

457
01:10:35,006 --> 01:10:37,872
Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

458
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:57,627
Oh, yeah.

459
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:15,747
Linda, we believe fhaf you have
your own producfion company now.

01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,095

Are you the company that distributes

- Yes.
- I'm not some fucking stunt cock.

505
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,937

01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:50,881
Pleasure to meet you.

01:16:21,984 --> 01:16:24,418
All right.
Take off your clothes.

527
01:16:24,486 --> 01:16:26,419
I want to take some pictures.

528
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:36,058
- What is it that we're watching?
- I don't know.

529
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:39,192

Makes you hot, doesn't it?

543
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:23,780
Yeah.

544
01:19:25,349 --> 01:19:26,941
Makes me hot too.

545
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,680
Come over here,
and I'II show you how hot.

546
01:21:51,642 --> 01:21:54,111
- Where's the come shot?
- Huh? Come?

547
01:21:54,178 --> 01:21:57,239
The come shot. I thought we were doing
'Body Talk" here, not 'Last Tango."

548
01:22:04,255 --> 01:22:07,384
You were great out there. Really.
Come on, I'II buy you a drink.

549
01:22:09,027 --> 01:22:11,519
A drink?
I don't even know you.

550
01:22:11,596 --> 01:22:14,623
I'm talking business.

551
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,132
Come on.

552
01:22:17,202 --> 01:22:19,637
You know the mirror out there?

553
01:22:19,705 --> 01:22:21,639
That was my idea.

554
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:26,011
So, you're a genius.

555
01:22:26,078 --> 01:22:30,880
No, but I can make a better film
than Corso, with my eyes closed.

556
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:33,978
Films cost money, you know.

557
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:35,488
I got money.

558
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,651
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

559
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:42,287
I wanted to meet you.

560
01:22:43,767 --> 01:22:45,667
Why?

561
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:49,670
Because I think you're sensational.
I think you're the best in the business.

562
01:22:49,738 --> 01:22:52,367
I'll pay you top dollar.
I'll give you points.

563
01:22:52,442 --> 01:22:54,410
Whatever it takes.

564
01:22:55,945 --> 01:22:59,506
- Really?
- I want you in my picture.

565
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:03,644
- You're really serious?
- Yeah, of course I am.

566
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:05,152
Okay, good.

567
01:23:06,923 --> 01:23:09,448
There are some things I like
to get straight up front...

568
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,893
so there are no misunderstandings
later on.

569
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:14,987
- I don't blame you.
- I do not do animal acts.

570
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:18,969
I do not do S and M or any variations
of that particular bent.

571
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,005
No water sports either.

572
01:23:21,073 --> 01:23:23,506
I will not shave my pussy,
no fist fucking...

573
01:23:23,574 --> 01:23:26,099
and absolutely no coming in my face.

574
01:23:26,178 --> 01:23:31,343
I get $2,000 a day,
and I do not work without a contract.

575
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:38,858
Fine.
I mean, that's no problem.

576
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:45,091
- I think we got a deal.
- Cheers.

577
01:23:46,967 --> 01:23:48,902
You ever do any specialty work?

578
01:23:50,839 --> 01:23:53,536
What kind of specialty work
are you looking for?

579
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:57,804
A woman alone,
getting herself off.

580
01:23:59,782 --> 01:24:01,306
It's got to be really hot.

581
01:24:04,854 --> 01:24:06,288
Is that all?

582
01:24:07,724 --> 01:24:11,525
I have a routine that is a sure ten
on the peter-meter.

583
01:24:12,595 --> 01:24:14,825
- I know. I've seen it.
- Yeah?

584
01:24:14,897 --> 01:24:16,832
A few times.

585
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:20,427
Yeah, I'm known far and wide...

586
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:22,870
for that little bit of business.

587
01:24:28,278 --> 01:24:30,712
I want you to know
I saw 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

588
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:35,014
and I think your acting
is top drawer.

589
01:24:38,589 --> 01:24:40,490
- My acting?
- Yep.

590
01:24:40,559 --> 01:24:44,792
You're fantastic.
Really. Sensational.

591
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:47,628
I'II tell you something else.

592
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,168
- You have got a terrific...
- Body.

593
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:53,171
Smile.

594
01:24:57,044 --> 01:24:58,478
Smile"?

595
01:25:07,255 --> 01:25:09,656
Look at you.

596
01:25:09,724 --> 01:25:12,523
- Kimberly, how are you?
- I'm fine, just lovely.

597
01:25:12,595 --> 01:25:16,999
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

598
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:20,967
- Kimberly Hess. Hello.
- Nice to know you.

599
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,066
So, Jake, you working?

600
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:26,802
Yeah, here and there.
We have to run.

601
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:28,572
- It's great to see you though.
- Right.

602
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,635
Jake and I worked together
in the past.

603
01:25:30,713 --> 01:25:32,146
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:35,617
I thought I knew everybody
in this business.

605
01:25:37,186 --> 01:25:38,653
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

606
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:41,350
I don't see how someone
could know everyone.

607
01:25:41,425 --> 01:25:43,326
It's a funny business.

608
01:25:45,497 --> 01:25:47,488
Anyway, I wanted to ask you...

609
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:51,160
have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...

610
01:25:51,236 --> 01:25:54,331
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have. I have a tip for you.

611
01:25:54,406 --> 01:25:57,240
- Really?
- Yes, Simon La Farge is casting.

612
01:25:57,309 --> 01:25:59,335
- You know him, right?
- No.

613
01:25:59,412 --> 01:26:02,347
No? Are you from outer space?

614
01:26:02,415 --> 01:26:06,351
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

615
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:10,186
You might want to firm up a bit
before you go and see him.

616
01:26:10,258 --> 01:26:13,853
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

617
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:19,024
- Acting is acting, right?
- That's right.

618
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,695
I think that's really admirable.

619
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,704
Me, myself, I can't get into it.

620
01:26:23,772 --> 01:26:27,207
But, anyway, good luck
and say hello to Simon for me.

621
01:26:27,275 --> 01:26:30,006
- Good seeing you.
- Sure. Thanks.

622
01:26:30,078 --> 01:26:31,510
By the way...

623
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,408
what's the film about?

624
01:26:35,484 --> 01:26:37,213
That's good.

625
01:26:37,286 --> 01:26:39,550
We need more comedians
in our business.

626
01:26:39,622 --> 01:26:41,112
Good luck.

627
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:47,562
Very nice.

628
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:51,399
What can I get you?
Jack Daniels?

629
01:26:52,636 --> 01:26:55,572
How about Jake Scully...

630
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:57,072
straight up?

631
01:26:58,643 --> 01:27:00,076
Very funny.

632
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:12,591
Hello.

633
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:21,759
Listen, Holly...

634
01:27:21,835 --> 01:27:23,769
I don't want to talk
any more business.

635
01:27:23,837 --> 01:27:25,271
Yeah, well...

636
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,772
Listen.

637
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,274
Lie down.

638
01:27:34,681 --> 01:27:37,275
We had one of these
in "Star Whores."

639
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,947
There's something I gotta tell you.

640
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,614
You're married.

641
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,625
- What then?
- I'm not a producer.

642
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:46,627
You're not a producer.

643
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:51,457
l... Hold up. I'm not...

644
01:27:53,035 --> 01:27:54,468
Just a second.

645
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:59,308
I'm not interested
in making a film with you.

646
01:28:01,544 --> 01:28:04,639
- What are you interested in then?
- You.

647
01:28:05,883 --> 01:28:09,819
I saw you in the house
those other nights.

648
01:28:09,887 --> 01:28:11,321
What house?

649
01:28:12,557 --> 01:28:15,492
You know,
that show that you put on...

650
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,324
with the masturbation routine
and all the diamonds and everything.

651
01:28:18,397 --> 01:28:20,332
I was watching you from here.

652
01:28:23,735 --> 01:28:27,935
You were the girl in the window.
That wasn't Gloria. That was you.

653
01:28:29,242 --> 01:28:30,709
What's it to you?

654
01:28:30,777 --> 01:28:34,680
Just tell me if I'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

655
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,182
Right?

656
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:41,182
I'm not saying that it was me,
and I'm not saying that it wasn't me.

657
01:28:41,254 --> 01:28:44,486
I'm saying,
why are you interested in knowing?

658
01:28:50,764 --> 01:28:56,362
I think that one of my crazy friends
has played a practical joke on me.

659
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:58,702
You know how it is
with the idle rich.

660
01:29:02,277 --> 01:29:07,376
Tell me, were you the girl
in the house?

661
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:09,042
- Yeah, that was me.
- I knew it.

662
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:12,053
How did this thing get set up?

663
01:29:12,122 --> 01:29:15,558
Tell me just to satisfy my curiosity.

664
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:19,722
One of my crazy friends set this up,
but I don't know who.

665
01:29:19,797 --> 01:29:21,230
Who hired you?

666
01:29:21,299 --> 01:29:24,565
- You were the one I was playing to?
- Yeah.

667
01:29:24,636 --> 01:29:28,072
- And there's no part for me.
- I'm sorry.

668
01:29:28,139 --> 01:29:30,403
- This whole thing was a joke.
- Yeah.

669
01:29:30,475 --> 01:29:32,410
It was a practical joke on me.

670
01:29:32,478 --> 01:29:35,572
Did Sam Bouchard
set this whole thing up?

671
01:29:35,647 --> 01:29:37,582
Did he hire you
to do your routine?

672
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:39,914
He didn't tell me his name.

673
01:29:39,986 --> 01:29:43,422
Whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

674
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:48,756
This guy called me up and said
he had seen my self-help routine...

675
01:29:48,827 --> 01:29:50,419
in 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

676
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:53,762
and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

677
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:58,270
He said that he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

678
01:29:58,339 --> 01:30:02,275
- He didn't tell you who he was?
- No. He didn't tell me his name.

679
01:30:02,342 --> 01:30:05,607
He just sent a messenger over
with money...

680
01:30:05,678 --> 01:30:08,615
and with a card key...

681
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:10,775
and a wig.

682
01:30:10,852 --> 01:30:12,284
Please don't leave.

683
01:30:12,354 --> 01:30:15,790
Just stay here for a second.

684
01:30:15,857 --> 01:30:17,291
Can you hold on?

685
01:30:20,196 --> 01:30:21,788
- Hello.
- Lf's Sam.

686
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:24,959
- How are you doing? Can you hold on?
- Sure.

687
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:26,468
Hold on.

688
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:29,634
Please, listen to this guy's voice.

689
01:30:29,706 --> 01:30:33,474
Tell me if he's the one
that hired you. Please.

690
01:30:33,545 --> 01:30:36,638
Hello. I'm sorry. You got me
in the shower. How are you doing?

691
01:30:36,713 --> 01:30:40,981
- I'm afraid I got some bad news, pal.
- What's that?

692
01:30:41,052 --> 01:30:43,316
Seaffle Rep and I
had some arfisfic differences.

693
01:30:43,388 --> 01:30:45,323
I'm gonna be heading back fo L.A.

694
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:48,986
So I guess you'll have fo find
anofher place fo crash.

695
01:30:49,061 --> 01:30:50,495
That's him.

696
01:30:50,564 --> 01:30:52,995
- You gof some company fhere?
- Actually, I do.

697
01:30:53,064 --> 01:30:56,660
It's kind of a bad time to talk.
You want to call back in 15 minutes?

698
01:30:56,735 --> 01:31:00,171
- Yeah...
- That was the guy who hired you?

699
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,002
- Yes, that was him.
- Are you sure?

700
01:31:02,074 --> 01:31:04,168
- Yes, I'm sure that was him.
- Listen.

701
01:31:04,244 --> 01:31:07,838
- God, you're really sick.
- Listen to me very carefully.

702
01:31:07,913 --> 01:31:11,509
I am not a film producer,
and I am not a rich kid.

703
01:31:11,585 --> 01:31:13,177
No, you're a jerk.

704
01:31:13,253 --> 01:31:15,687
Holly, please listen to me
for a second.

705
01:31:17,258 --> 01:31:22,195
You were hired to do two nights' work,
to do your routine and leave.

706
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:23,855
- Is that true?
- Yes.

707
01:31:23,931 --> 01:31:26,366
- Do you know why?
- You just told me why.

708
01:31:26,435 --> 01:31:29,371
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

709
01:31:29,438 --> 01:31:31,202
He wasn't playing a joke on you?

710
01:31:31,274 --> 01:31:34,209
- Do you want to tell me what it was?
- Yes.

711
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:36,712
The truth.

712
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,214
The truth is a woman was murdered.

713
01:31:41,118 --> 01:31:44,884
It's not funny. A woman was murdered.
You and I were set up by a murderer.

714
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:47,048
He wanted to be sure
I witnessed the murder.

715
01:31:47,124 --> 01:31:49,058
That's why he hired you
to do your routine.

716
01:31:49,126 --> 01:31:51,561
Meanwhile, he arranged it
so that I would be watching.

717
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:54,565
He wanted me to think that the girl
who lived there, Gloria Revelle...

718
01:31:54,633 --> 01:31:56,067
was the one getting off.

719
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:59,397
Meanwhile, he thought I would watch
and keep watching.

720
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:02,235
Holly, are you listening to me?

721
01:32:02,307 --> 01:32:04,741
Yes.
I don't understand what you've said.

722
01:32:04,808 --> 01:32:07,073
Listen, he's a murderer!

723
01:32:07,145 --> 01:32:09,740
The man who hired you is a murderer!
Come here.

724
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,708
Please, come here.

725
01:32:12,785 --> 01:32:14,685
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

726
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:17,279
- Yes.
- You see that house down there?

727
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:19,415
- That window is where you were, right?
- Yes.

728
01:32:27,768 --> 01:32:30,259
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

729
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:33,933
I understand you're sick and you're
a liar and you need professional help.

730
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:36,101
- I do not like being yelled at!
- I'm sorry.

731
01:32:36,177 --> 01:32:38,271
I should have known when you told me
I had a terrific smile.

732
01:32:38,347 --> 01:32:40,781
No real producer would tell me that
in a million years.

733
01:32:40,849 --> 01:32:42,714
Get out of my way.

734
01:32:42,785 --> 01:32:44,720
- What?
- Just come with me to the police.

735
01:32:44,787 --> 01:32:48,120
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen to me, you weirdo...

736
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,784
- A woman was murdered!
- I'm leaving! Don't follow me home!

737
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,691
I have friends
who will break your legsl

738
01:32:53,863 --> 01:32:56,263
Let go of me! God!

739
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:58,802
You weirdol
There are so many weird people.

740
01:33:11,549 --> 01:33:14,177
Can I have the Hollywood
Police Department, please?

741
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:16,185
Fucking freaky actors.

742
01:33:16,253 --> 01:33:17,983
That's what there is here.

743
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:20,820
Masochistic directors.

744
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:23,985
I should have known when he didn't
even know what a come shot was.

745
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:27,657
Yeah, Detective McLean, please.

746
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:37,006
Excuse me.
Stop, please.

747
01:33:38,244 --> 01:33:40,509
Thank you very much, ladyl

748
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:45,819
I was set up.

749
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:51,048
Yeah, Hollywood's busiest
sex offender.

750
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,061
Cut it out.
Just listen to me for a minute.

751
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:55,187
I got something important
to tell you.

752
01:33:56,265 --> 01:33:58,096
I know who killed Gloria Revelle.

753
01:33:58,167 --> 01:33:59,828
Is this a confession?

754
01:34:01,103 --> 01:34:02,537
Listen.

755
01:34:03,607 --> 01:34:05,541
Just pay attention.

756
01:34:05,609 --> 01:34:08,135
A few days ago I was looking
for an apartment.

757
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:11,542
Do you know any sublets
that would be available right away?

758
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,377

778
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:15,944
Please, just listen to me

01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:08,669
I've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along...

791
01:36:08,742 --> 01:36:10,677
but the reason
it hasn't panned out...

792
01:36:10,744 --> 01:36:14,648
is because of your testimony
that Gloria was killed by an Indian.

793
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:17,651
That's just it! Don't you see?
That's what he wanted!

794
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:19,516
It looks like a burglary,
but it's a murder...

795
01:36:19,588 --> 01:36:22,022
with me set up
to be the witnessl

796
01:36:22,091 --> 01:36:24,955
I'm Alexander Revelle's alibi.

797
01:36:28,196 --> 01:36:31,189
Listen. Stop, all right?

798
01:36:31,266 --> 01:36:36,136
Just stop! Right therel

799
01:36:37,207 --> 01:36:39,698
There has been an accident
up there.

800
01:36:39,776 --> 01:36:43,211
- Those people are probably very hurt.
- Slow down, lady.

801
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:45,509
- Nobody's bothered to stop.
- Get in the car.

802
01:36:45,582 --> 01:36:47,516
It sounds crazy to me.

803
01:36:48,618 --> 01:36:51,588
I know, but it's the truth.

804
01:36:54,626 --> 01:36:57,151
Maybe you better come down here.

805
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,982
Pull it up. That's it.
Pull your car right up there.

806
01:37:19,687 --> 01:37:22,986
Stay in your car, please.
There's nothing to look at.

807
01:37:23,057 --> 01:37:25,184
We'll have it cleaned up
in a couple minutes.

808
01:37:28,529 --> 01:37:30,689
Get back in your car, sir.

809
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:35,433
Officer, there's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco right there.

810
01:37:37,105 --> 01:37:39,801
He's killing her. He just hit her
in the back of the head.

811
01:37:39,874 --> 01:37:41,604
We gotta do something
to help her.

812
01:37:41,677 --> 01:37:45,545
- Get back in your car.
- He's killing her. He hit her.

813
01:37:47,215 --> 01:37:49,776
- I don't have time to run you in.
- Please!

814
01:37:49,852 --> 01:37:51,979
He's getting away.
Please call somebody on your radio.

815
01:37:52,055 --> 01:37:55,023
Don't you understand?
I saw him killing her!

816
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:57,559
- You fucking idiot!
- All right, that's it, buddy.

817
01:37:57,627 --> 01:38:00,061
- You're coming with me.
- Call Detective McLean.

818
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:01,893
- He knows all about this.
- All right.

819
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:05,298
Son of a...

820
01:38:05,369 --> 01:38:07,132
Come here, you son of a bitch!

821
01:42:27,755 --> 01:42:29,187
Are you okay?

822
01:43:47,343 --> 01:43:48,935
Look what you did.

823
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,773
You ruined my surprise ending!

824
01:43:53,848 --> 01:43:58,786
I gave you your part:
the witness.

825
01:43:58,855 --> 01:44:02,689
You were perfect.
You played it to a T.

826
01:44:02,759 --> 01:44:05,285
But that was it.

827
01:44:05,363 --> 01:44:06,796
End of part.

828
01:44:08,032 --> 01:44:09,964
Wrap Jake Scully.

829
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,968
You had to play the hero...

830
01:44:16,039 --> 01:44:19,805
improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

831
01:44:19,876 --> 01:44:22,471
and unmasking the Indian.

832
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:28,212
But you didn't think it through.

833
01:44:28,286 --> 01:44:32,951
Sometimes heroes
come to tragic ends.

834
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:37,988
What's the matter?
A little short of breath?

835
01:44:41,034 --> 01:44:42,729
What a terrible way to die.

836
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:46,196
Especially when you're
so claustrophobic.

837
01:44:47,307 --> 01:44:48,741
Wait a minute.

838
01:44:48,809 --> 01:44:51,642
I'll give you another take.

839
01:44:53,981 --> 01:44:57,509
The only problem is
you've got to act.

840
01:45:03,825 --> 01:45:05,258
Come on.

841
01:45:05,927 --> 01:45:07,896
Action.

842
01:45:13,169 --> 01:45:14,603
And action.

843
01:45:22,812 --> 01:45:24,871
Cut. Get him out of here.
Move the camera out.

844
01:45:24,948 --> 01:45:27,279
Joe, give me a hand.
Jake, take it easy.

845
01:45:27,351 --> 01:45:29,342
What's going on?

846
01:45:29,419 --> 01:45:31,353
We're getting you out.
That's all right.

847
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:33,354
We got you. Let go.
Don't worry about it.

848
01:45:33,422 --> 01:45:36,017
- Don't worry about nothing.
- It's all right. We're here.

849
01:45:36,093 --> 01:45:39,359
Give him some air.
Talk to me.

850
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:42,661
Say something.
Walk it off. Just go for a walk.

851
01:45:42,734 --> 01:45:45,100
Just relax. Just breathe in.

852
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:47,867
All right, that's good.
There you go.

853
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:49,874
What's the matter, babe?

854
01:45:49,942 --> 01:45:53,572
Boy, you had us scared there.
What's the problem?

855
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:55,581
Wait a minute.

856
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:03,215
- Get away from me.
- Babe, just relax.

857
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:05,384
- We're just trying to help you.
- I know.

858
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,292
I can help myself.

859
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:12,663
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

860
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:16,363
Go on home,
and we'll shoot this another time.

861
01:46:16,438 --> 01:46:17,872
All right?

862
01:46:19,908 --> 01:46:22,070
Don't lie to me.

863
01:46:22,145 --> 01:46:24,407
If I don't get this shot,
you'll fire me.

864
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:29,241
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I do a thing like that?

865
01:46:36,526 --> 01:46:41,259
Save the speech, Rubin. I know all about
your personal commitment to the actors.

866
01:46:41,331 --> 01:46:44,927
I'm a little claustrophobic.
You'II work around it, right?

867
01:46:45,002 --> 01:46:46,936
Yeah, that's right.

868
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,136
- I don't like your attitude.
- Yeah?

869
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:56,647
If I get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

870
01:47:09,363 --> 01:47:10,796
Let's do it!

871
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:22,098
You better get it right this time.

872
01:47:22,176 --> 01:47:24,839
You're one pain in the ass
I don't need.

873
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:29,811
- Okay, Joe.
- Roll sound. Quiet.

874
01:47:29,883 --> 01:47:32,148
And action I

875
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:41,496
You bastard!

876
01:47:41,563 --> 01:47:43,190
Don't be so melodramatic.

877
01:47:48,604 --> 01:47:50,162
Kill!

878
01:48:01,085 --> 01:48:03,247
What are you doing?

879
01:48:03,322 --> 01:48:05,949
- What am I doing? I'm saving you.
- From who?

880
01:48:06,023 --> 01:48:11,395
- From... The Indian was Sam Bouchard.
- Wait a minute.

881
01:48:11,464 --> 01:48:14,627
Am I missing something?
Is there somebody here that I don't see?

882
01:48:14,701 --> 01:48:16,862
Yes! The dog knocked him in.

883
01:48:16,936 --> 01:48:18,870
Come look. Come here.

884
01:48:20,073 --> 01:48:22,405
Look, he must have knocked him in.
He went...

885
01:48:22,475 --> 01:48:27,277
I thought it belonged to Gloria, but
it must have belonged to the husband.

886
01:48:27,348 --> 01:48:30,977
That's why he never barked at the Indian
when he tried to sneak in the house.

887
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:33,748
I think you're absolutely right.
We should go to the police.

888
01:48:33,822 --> 01:48:36,220
- Really? You believe me?
- Yes. I believe you.

889
01:48:36,289 --> 01:48:39,817
I believe you are a number one sicko
and should be put away for life!

890
01:48:39,893 --> 01:48:42,191
I know all about you guys.

891
01:48:42,262 --> 01:48:45,232
I've seen about you
on late-night television.

892
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,825
You're one of those necrophiliacs,
a corpse fucker!

893
01:48:47,901 --> 01:48:50,427
- I am not.
- Yesl I turn you on, all right.

894
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:52,496
The only problem is that
I'm still movingl

895
01:48:52,574 --> 01:48:55,134
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better, right?

896
01:48:57,345 --> 01:48:58,779
Are you all right?

897
01:48:59,848 --> 01:49:01,282
Here, take my hand.

898
01:49:02,251 --> 01:49:04,117
Do not touch me.

899
01:49:04,186 --> 01:49:06,587
I'm not dead yet.

900
01:49:09,593 --> 01:49:14,622
I know this all seems crazy,
but I'm trying to help you.

901
01:49:14,699 --> 01:49:17,634
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

902
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:04,017
Freeze.
Don't move your hand, Jake.

903
01:50:04,086 --> 01:50:05,678
- How does that look?
- It looks great.

904
01:50:05,753 --> 01:50:09,350
Good. Terrific. Hold that move.
Let's 86 the bat.

905
01:50:09,424 --> 01:50:12,690
That's a wrap on the bat.
Get the bat out.

906
01:50:12,762 --> 01:50:16,028
- I gotta hold the hand really still.
- Help him out.

907
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,536
- Turn the water off.
- Can I slip out?

908
01:50:19,602 --> 01:50:22,868
Wait till we get the bar in there.
Wait till we get the stand in here.

909
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:27,037
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Between the bottom two fingers.

910
01:50:31,449 --> 01:50:34,213
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

911
01:50:34,285 --> 01:50:36,549
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

912
01:50:36,621 --> 01:50:38,556
Makeup.
Let's get a touch-up for Jake.

913
01:50:38,624 --> 01:50:41,058
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

914
01:50:41,127 --> 01:50:42,720
Excuse me.

915
01:50:42,796 --> 01:50:44,729
Don't move the bar!

916
01:50:46,633 --> 01:50:48,396
- I'm sorry.
- Did the bar move?

917
01:50:48,468 --> 01:50:49,899
That's okay.

918
01:50:51,403 --> 01:50:54,236
- You're doing a great job.
- Did I flash the teeth long enough?

919
01:50:54,306 --> 01:50:57,743
Best teeth flashing I've ever seen.
It looked beautiful, babe.

920
01:50:57,811 --> 01:50:59,745
I'm so glad
I fired that other asshole.

921
01:50:59,813 --> 01:51:02,907
This part was made for you.
I mean it. You look sensational.

922
01:51:02,983 --> 01:51:06,077
- This bar is falling.
- That looks good.

923
01:51:06,153 --> 01:51:07,745
- You holding up?
- Yeah.

924
01:51:07,821 --> 01:51:10,416
Just a little longer.
Okay, girls, step out. Step back.

925
01:51:10,491 --> 01:51:12,424
Let's bring in the body double.

926
01:51:12,493 --> 01:51:15,087
- Thanks.
- The hair looks good.

927
01:51:15,164 --> 01:51:17,427
Is that as hot
as that water gets?

928
01:51:17,498 --> 01:51:19,433
Slide in there, sweetheart.

929
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:22,265
- Don't move the bar. It's important.
- I know.

930
01:51:22,337 --> 01:51:25,101
Hi. I'm Mindy.
Pleased to meet you.

931
01:51:25,174 --> 01:51:28,269
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen, be very, very careful.

932
01:51:28,344 --> 01:51:30,437
My breasts are very tender.

933
01:51:30,513 --> 01:51:32,277
I've got my period.

934
01:51:33,516 --> 01:51:34,950
We good here?

935
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:40,286
I'm gonna...
Just bring your body up like this.

936
01:51:40,357 --> 01:51:42,291
My hand is right here.
I can't move my hand.

937
01:51:42,359 --> 01:51:44,954
Keep your hand exactly still.
Let's shoot it.

938
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:47,294
Let's slide the bar out.

939
01:51:47,365 --> 01:51:49,629
Drop the camera.
Let's get the camera down.

940
01:51:51,036 --> 01:51:53,631
Wait till we're in position.

941
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:55,467
Can you bring your body
up to my hand?

942
01:52:00,045 --> 01:52:02,878
Quiet, please!
I'm trying to think.

943
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:19,999
