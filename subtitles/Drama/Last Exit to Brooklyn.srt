1
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,527
Hey.

2
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,251
Don't bullshit me, you bastard.
I know you scored,

3
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:36,371
now give me half a buck.

4
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,907
You know something.
You're worse than a leech.

5
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,761
A leech you can get rid of.
You don't go for nothing.

6
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,308
I don't even got
a pack of cigarettes.

7
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,079
Don't tell me, I ain't your father.
Hey, we're home...

8
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,049
You cheap motherfucker.
Look, go tell your troubles to Jesus

9
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,716
- and stop breaking my balls.
- I'll break your balls.

10
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,960
Go get her, little boy.

11
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,657
Hey. Don't y'all know you're not to fuck girls
on the street.

12
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:58,140
Hey! Go fuck your mother.
I hear she's a good hump.

13
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,241
Cotton picking doggies.

14
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,247
We'll cut your nigger-loving heart out.

15
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:04,996
Hey, why don't we just get
ourselves back to the base?

16
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,650
Let's get the bastards.

17
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,413
Go! Go!

18
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,266
Run motherfuckers!

19
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,904
Yeah, let's kick their asses.

20
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,388
No! No!

21
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:50,804
No!

22
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,557
Please, please, I don't wanna fight!

23
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,420
Hey, Al, hold him.
No!

24
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,749
Get up!

25
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:27,901
What are you looking at?

26
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,130
Cops.

27
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:44,573
Yeah, hold it right there.
Come on, up against the car.

28
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:50,493
Oh, my God!

29
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,828
- Don't look too good.
Everybody shut up!

30
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,795
Now, what's going on?

31
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,517
I asked you what's going on here.

32
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:01,691
Those goddamn yankees like
to kill our buddy here.

33
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,726
There's nothing wrong with him.
He's only fooling.

34
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,356
If he's fooling, he's one hell of an actor.

35
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,400
Shut up! Now what the hell is this all about?

36
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,023
They insulted my wife.

37
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,657
What wife?

38
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:17,857
Right over there.

39
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,633
Tralala, come here.

40
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,074
See, we were standing on the corner talking,

41
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:27,336
when these three army creeps
started making obscene remarks to my wife.

42
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,576
I told them to shut up, to defend her honor.

43
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,960
Then they attacked me. Ain't that right?

44
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:33,628
Yeah, they insulted me. God damn drunks.

45
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:36,019
You dirty whore! How could you be insulted?

46
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,460
Asshole.

47
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,978
Take it easy. And you better
watch your mouth, soldier.

48
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,589
All you goddamn yankees are the same.

49
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,979
Bunch a no-good nigger-loving bastards.
That's all you are.

50
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,840
If you don't shut up right now, I'll lock you up
and your friends along with you.

51
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:51,623
Anyone here see anything?

52
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,224
Yeah, yeah, I did.

53
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,969
I'm in charge of the strike office
right up the street.

54
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:57,504
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah, it's what he said.

55
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,315
They started it. They insulted his wife.

56
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:01,865
- They came over started up the fight.
- Okay, okay. Shut up!

57
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,451
Get back to the base and have someone
look after your friend.

58
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,025
And you beat it!

59
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:10,362
If I see any of you punks in a fight again,
I'll personally split your skulls!

60
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,967
- Get outta here.
- You're ugly, Tony.

61
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,375
Harry, why have you got all this beer here?

62
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,820
'Cause I ordered it, that's why.

63
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,564
Big shot, huh?

64
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:58,422
Hey! Whatever I want, I order it
and the union pays for it.

65
00:06:58,361 --> 00:06:59,819
We're a big union, you know what I mean.

66
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,800
Look at this, we're in the paper every day.

67
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,469
Hey, Harry, is the union planning on playing
a little baseball here, eh?

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,918
Hey, show Harry your clipping.

69
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,457
Oh, Christ, again?

70
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,023
I run the whole show around here.

71
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,205
I'm on the payroll
and I got an expense sheet, too...

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,782
Harry, take a look at this.

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,759
You know I'm making more now,
than when we was working.

74
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,138
And it's tax free
and the wife don't know nothing about it, eh?

75
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,540
Eh, the three guys that got shot
sticking up that store?

76
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,506
Vin did time with them up at the El.

77
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,938
This guy right here, the one the cops killed.

78
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,962
He was my boy.

79
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,793
We just got out together last week
and he already made the front page.

80
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,593
Hey, what about that half buck?

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,935
Hey, go fuck yourself.
I defended your honor, didn't I?

82
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,967
- I'll have one.
- Yeah, me too.

83
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,086
Hey, hey, don't fuck around here.

84
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,580
That's union property.

85
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,975
Think fast!

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,979
Come on, drink up, eh!
The brewery needs the barrels.

87
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,765
I'll have one.
Yeah, me too.

88
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,468
So, bring your glasses over here.

89
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,059
Excuse me.
Do you know where Vincent is?

90
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,129
What?

91
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:39,867
You were saying?

92
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:47,212
Vinnie and the other guys,
they left a little while ago.

93
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,553
If you see him, would you tell him,
Georgette is looking for him.

94
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,132
Thank you.

95
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,783
Anything new with the strike today?

96
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,682
Hey.

97
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,582
Why don't we go to bed Harry, huh?

98
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:06,098
No, you go on, I wanna watch this.

99
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,196
Hmm.

100
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,051
You asleep?

101
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,727
Donna!

102
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,253
Donna, open the door, right now.

103
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,401
Donna!

104
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,190
What are you yelling about?

105
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,445
I gotta piss so bad my teeth are floating!

106
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,725
Will you quit yelling?

107
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:41,421
Come on, come on, this is killing me.
Killing me!

108
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,728
Joe, stop yelling,
the neighbors are gonna complain, huh?

109
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:44,922
Donna!

110
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:47,635
Knock it off, Joe, come on.

111
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,955
Eddie, hey, hey, hey,
stop playing with that food.

112
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,078
Why? I like it.

113
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,531
Hey, you've got to eat that.

114
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:57,957
Put the meat down, Eddie. Put it down.

115
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,297
Oh!

116
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:03,564
Oh! That's good.

117
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,114
The pause that refreshes.

118
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,987
Momma. Momma, look what Daddy is doing.

119
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:10,370
Come on, you're giving me a headache.
Will you please now...

120
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:14,484
Come on, let's go. Go sit down.
Be quiet, all right.

121
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:17,070
What the hell's going on up there?

122
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,515
You see, you see!
I told you, they'd start complaining.

123
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,138
What's the idea of throwing water
out the window?

124
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,569
It splashed all over my kids!

125
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,302
What? What water?

126
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,772
You threw water down,
now my goddamn kids are soaked!

127
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,921
What are you talking about?
Nobody's throwing no water outta here!

128
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,497
You got a lot of goddamn...

129
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:33,097
Crazy neighbors.

130
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,790
Oh, what you doing in there all day, hey?

131
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,710
- Hey, hey! Don't you hit her in her condition.
- What condition?

132
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,868
What are you talking about condition?

133
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,498
- What the hell is going on here?
- There...

134
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:50,921
There! Now you know.

135
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,369
- Know what?
- What does it look like?

136
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,850
What, you think, she is just fat?

137
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:56,394
What are you saying here?
What are you saying?

138
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,516
What, are you stupid?

139
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:59,282
But she is fat!

140
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,946
- She is fat and she's a virgin.
- Not no more she ain't.

141
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:07,007
Oh, Jesus!

142
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:08,908
Oh, God!

143
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,317
O Mary, mother of God.
- Eddie, go to your room.

144
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,812
- I don't wanna.
- I said go to your room.

145
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,499
Come on, or I'll break your arm.

146
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:17,819
Come on, get in there.

147
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:22,389
Donna, Donna, who did this to you?

148
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,602
Leave her alone.
It happened, it happened.

149
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,400
Donna, I know you had nothing
to do with this, baby.

150
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,722
All we wanna know is who did it?

151
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:33,378
- Who did it? Who!
Stop it.

152
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,808
Stop it now!
Who?

153
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,446
Was it Tommy with the bike?

154
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,310
Now, who the hell is "Tommy with the bike"?

155
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,084
Hey, Tom.

156
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,520
Men, you have my word.
It won't be much longer now.

157
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,881
We don't believe you, city-boy.

158
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,455
We're sick of all this bullshit!

159
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,136
My family is starving!
God damn it! I had to sell my home!

160
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,003
You'll buy it back. I guarantee you.

161
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,866
Now look, we know for a fact

162
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,414
that they got a shipment due
that our picketing has cut off,

163
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,391
and it's killing them.

164
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,805
It's killing us, too!

165
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,310
Management can't hold out much longer.

166
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,728
You've been saying the same
thing for six goddamn months!

167
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,879
You wanna give in now?
Is that what you want?

168
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,454
No, we wanna work! That's what we want!

169
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,246
You wanna go back to your wife and kids

170
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,605
and tell them that this whole six
months has been for nothing?

171
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:41,836
No.

172
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,362
No way, never.

173
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:46,641
Because if you give in now,
you know what those bastards are gonna do?

174
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:48,590
They're gonna grind your faces in it.

175
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,361
Fucking right!

176
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,954
Now look, listen to me.

177
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,577
They're trying to break our backs.
But we can't cave in now.

178
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,344
We gotta be out there 24 hours a day,

179
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,768
seven days a week

180
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,333
and make sure that not one truck
goes in or out of that factory!

181
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,389
And if those bastards try to shove
some belly robbing contract down our throats

182
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,728
or try to push one of their trucks
past our lines,

183
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,333
there is only one thing we can do.

184
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,293
We stand up, look them in the eye

185
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,354
and we tell them right to their fat faces,

186
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,268
"Fuck you!"

187
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,625
All right.

188
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,209
Listen, that's enough for this week.

189
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:41,312
But there is a big bag of union groceries

190
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:44,268
waiting for each and every one of you
waiting in the back. All right.

191
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,590
Boyce, that was fuckin' powerful.

192
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,154
Tommy!

193
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,477
Hey, Spook. Get your bike yet?

194
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,605
My father's looking for you.

195
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah, I don't think I ever met your old man.

196
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,121
- You "Tommy with the bike"?
- Yeah.

197
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,564
I'm Donna's father.

198
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,504
Hey, it's good to meet you, sir.

199
00:17:30,907 --> 00:17:32,491
Come on, come on, come on.

200
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,907
- You raped my virgin daughter!
Dad!

201
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,826
Come on, Joe.
- Donna wasn't no virgin

202
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:38,954
and I didn't rape her.

203
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,524
She practically raped me.

204
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:43,172
I'll murder you, you old bum!

205
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,028
Jesus Christ.
What the hell is wrong with that guy?

206
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,774
Donna's gonna have a baby, Tommy.

207
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,573
Yeah, that's terrific.

208
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:02,171
What's everybody looking at me for?

209
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,106
I was only with Donna a couple of times.

210
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,336
I haven't even seen her in six, seven months.

211
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:13,771
- Exactly.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

212
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:17,535
I'm Paulie, see, I'm Joe's brother.
I'm Donna's uncle.

213
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,670
So what you're gonna do, kid?

214
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,915
I mean, Donna's not some slut, you know.

215
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,445
Yeah, I know. I know.

216
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,201
- She's a nice girl.
- That's right. She's a nice girl.

217
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,573
She comes from a good family.

218
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,879
So?

219
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,366
Hey!

220
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,297
You get your bike yet?

221
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,306
I'm still saving up for it.

222
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,599
Yeah, you've been saying that
as long as I known you.

223
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,746
I really do almost have the loot to get it.

224
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,367
Yeah, sure.

225
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,405
Get up you bum!

226
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:46,177
Can't you see he's sleeping?
Two, three, four, five,

227
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:51,317
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

228
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:56,563
Did I pick them, did I pick them?
Even called the round.

229
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:57,670
Pay up!

230
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:58,745
Hey, Willie.

231
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:01,932
- Ya.
- Count to ten...

232
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,598
- What's that?
- Like in the fight, count to ten.

233
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:07,030
One.

234
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:09,352
Two.

235
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,073
Three.

236
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:14,759
Four.

237
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,711
Five.

238
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:18,630
Six.

239
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:21,391
Seven.

240
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,313
Eight.

241
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,908
- Nine.
- How about a drink?

242
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:27,110
Ten.

243
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,802
Sure I'll have a drink. Why not?

244
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,001
Come on.

245
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:32,275
So, you really like bikes, huh?

246
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:35,073
When you gonna give me a ride?

247
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:37,436
Ah, as soon as I get it, you got the first ride.

248
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,737
I'm thinking about getting a Harley,

249
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,252
like Tommy has, or maybe an Indian.

250
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,347
Hey, slow down, will you?
I left half of my leg in Korea.

251
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,192
Where we going, anyway?

252
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,389
It's not far.

253
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,702
I don't feel like walking all over hell,
you know.

254
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:01,818
If you want people to watch,
we can stay right here on the street.

255
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,866
In here?

256
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,150
Behind the car.

257
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,404
Hey, don't do that!

258
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,210
You're gonna like this.

259
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,031
So am I.

260
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,547
Bingo!

261
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,267
Hey!

262
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,722
We're gonna bust their balls. I guarantee it.

263
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,408
Now, grab a beer, Frankie.
Come on, what do you say.

264
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,628
I gotta go home to the wife.

265
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,327
Hey, come on now, fuck the wife.
Ah, here is a beer.

266
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,845
BRICKOWSKl: Harry, Harry, stamp the books,
so we can go home, please.

267
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,181
What? Oh, yeah.

268
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,181
Alex, some fucking coffee down here?
Come on.

269
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,263
What do I gotta do, beg?

270
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,644
You fucking Greek punk!

271
00:23:58,418 --> 00:23:59,919
About fucking time.

272
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:07,495
Oh, Vin. I think the love of your life
just walked in

273
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,794
and sat at the counter.

274
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,152
Yeah!

275
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:15,207
Where?

276
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:19,988
Why, Vincent, what a surprise.

277
00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:22,527
When did you get out from
your incarceration?

278
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,248
Whoa, wait a minute, what's he saying?

279
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:26,890
Don't you worry, Sal.
If I should choose to address you,

280
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,149
you can be sure it will be in monosyllables.

281
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,987
May I join you over there, Vincent?

282
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:35,269
Sure, Georgie boy. Come on over here.

283
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:48,007
You getting comfortable there, Georgie?

284
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:51,277
Oh, Vincent, you've gotten so much bigger

285
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,633
and harder since I last saw you.

286
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,908
Yeah, it's too bad I didn't
have you upstate with me.

287
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:59,150
I had a couple of sweet kids up there
but they didn't have chips like this.

288
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:01,991
You gorgeous man!

289
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,310
- You got my libido twitching.
- Twitching, huh?

290
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:10,837
May I please have a cup of coffee, Alex,
you big Greek fairy?

291
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:13,856
- Would you like some coffee, Vincent?
- What are you kidding me?

292
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:16,484
The coffee here tastes worse
than the dishwater they had upstate.

293
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:19,834
Huh, what? Now, wait a minute,
what, no, no coffee for me, Georgie?

294
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,777
I'm sure you have your own money, Sal.

295
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,486
These bums never have any money.

296
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:26,123
Hey, who are you calling bums?

297
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:28,973
All the time fuck around.
Someday you boys gonna get in trouble.

298
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,688
Ah, jeez, you talk like that, Alex,
you make us feel bad.

299
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,698
Hey, Alex, you hurt our feelings.

300
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,933
Oh, you need a light there, Georgie?

301
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:47,848
What do you say
you and me go for a walk, huh, Vinnie?

302
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,681
Yeah, there's plenty of time for that,
sweetheart.

303
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:52,073
Maybe later.

304
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:55,851
Let me do you, Vinnie, please let me do you.

305
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:58,896
Costs loot to do me, sweetchips.

306
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:03,105
Vincent, be romantic.

307
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,371
Okay. Okay.

308
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:07,444
I'll tell you what, Georgie boy.

309
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:10,811
How about if I only charge you a fin.

310
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,549
I won't charge you nothing, Georgie.

311
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,341
Don't touch me, Sal, you big freak!

312
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:21,853
I'm not about to have sex with you.

313
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:24,121
Oh...

314
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:26,010
Oh, Come on, Georgie...

315
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:28,737
Let me make a real woman out of you, huh?

316
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:34,327
Come on, Georgie, huh?

317
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,205
You don't want that big sausage
getting in your way.

318
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,300
Let me cut it off.

319
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,586
It's not big, Miss Pinkie. Get away from me.

320
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,729
Yeah, think fast.

321
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,833
Come on, Georgie. Dance.

322
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:53,920
Hey, Georgie, catch.

323
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,033
Stop it. Cut it out.

324
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:02,571
Don't do it. Vince!

325
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,627
Yeah.
No!

326
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,469
Stay there, stay there!

327
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:30,004
That's Forbinate?

328
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,881
Don't worry about it, Georgie boy.
I'll fix it up for you.

329
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:47,421
Atta girl, Georgie boy.
You take it all.

330
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,025
This is gonna make it feel
much better.

331
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,428
You brought me down, you rotten freaks,

332
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:01,698
you brought me down!

333
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:06,362
- Can I have a handkerchief for my leg?
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

334
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:09,491
What are you crazy?
I don't want to get my handkerchief all dirty.

335
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,932
Give me that.

336
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:15,757
Hold on, there you go, Georgie boy.

337
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:18,608
Hey, Freddy, you wanna give Georgie
a ride home in your car.

338
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,660
Are you outta your mind?
There'll be blood all over my upholstery.

339
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,988
Oh!

340
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:25,305
Your upholstery's shit anyway.

341
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:30,074
Now, wait a minute.
Are you saying my upholstery is shit?

342
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,108
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,925
Now, my upholstery is shit?

344
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:40,307
I'm sorry, okay!

345
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:43,401
Hey, Georgie, give me some loot, would you?

346
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:44,704
- What, Vinnie?
- Give me some loot.

347
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:47,234
- So that I can get you a cab home.
- I can't go home, my brother's home.

348
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:48,337
So what?

349
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,014
Please, Vinnie, he can't see me like this.

350
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:53,889
I don't give a flying fuck about your brother.
Come on, give!

351
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,366
All right, be a good boy, and get in there!

352
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:04,666
Get inside!

353
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:07,308
Come on, go on!

354
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:11,773
Before Christmas, Georgie!

355
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:16,612
Bye!

356
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:32,335
Why does he have to be here?

357
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,258
Why couldn't he have been out?

358
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,503
Lie back, George.

359
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,019
The doctor will be here soon.

360
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:43,772
Everything will be all right.

361
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,084
Doctor said to take the pants off
and put something on it.

362
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,093
No! No!

363
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,291
No.

364
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:58,894
Go away, you rotten fairy.

365
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,932
You queer son of a bitch!

366
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:02,751
Stop. Mother, don't let him!

367
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,229
Be careful, Arthur.

368
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,586
In front of my mother...

369
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,570
In front of my mother you have the nerve
to lay here with this thing on?

370
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,030
Leave him alone, Arthur!

371
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,510
What do you hold him like this for?

372
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,851
He's nothing but a filthy degenerate!
Why don't you throw him out on the street!

373
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,103
- He's your brother!
- My brother!

374
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,197
That's a good one.

375
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,126
Look at what my brother has here!

376
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:31,172
- No! My silks.
- Look at this, Mother.

377
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,670
- Look at what my brother has.
- No!

378
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:36,776
Look at this, Mother.
Look what my brother has here.

379
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:38,440
- Look.
- Stop!

380
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,851
And this. Look at this.

381
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,503
Look at these disgusting pictures!
Look at them!

382
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,429
Look at them! Filth!

383
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,377
That's what they are. Filth!

384
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,830
- Please. Please!
- Shut up!

385
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,144
Shut up or I swear to God, I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!

386
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,216
Always crying, "Mommy this"
and "Mommy that. "

387
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,587
Why don't you just die, Georgie?
Why don't you go away and die!

388
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,906
- Why are you torturing me?
- Oh, God, Arthur, stop!

389
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:11,952
Why me?

390
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:18,263
I can't stand him, Momma,
I can't stand him. I can't stand him.

391
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:20,703
Baby, baby.

392
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,782
Jesus loves you.

393
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:46,766
- Hey, Spook, how is it going?
- Fine. Fine.

394
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:50,363
You're not bullshitting me
about that bike, are you?

395
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,494
No, no, no. I'm getting it.

396
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,208
Really.

397
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:58,238
'Cause I'm really lookin' forward
to getting a ride on It.

398
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:02,150
How come you know her?

399
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:04,294
She's around.
You know, from the neighborhood.

400
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,498
Yeah, well, I don't like
you knowing girls like that. Come on.

401
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,863
- Ow.
- Come on.

402
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,390
You understand?

403
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,312
For Christ's sake, Ella,
put some clothes on her.

404
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:23,246
Don't listen to your crazy father, Donna.
Stand still.

405
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,210
- Okay. You go to your room.
- I've seen her bush before.

406
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:29,274
I'm fixin' up my old dress,
so she can wear it for her wedding.

407
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,249
- It ain't gonna work.
- It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

408
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:33,123
I'm gonna add a little extra material
and it'll work.

409
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,694
It ain't gonna work. Not with a gut like that.

410
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:42,516
She's so big, Ringling Brothers
have been circling around.

411
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,194
Hey, Joe, shut up, will you shut up?

412
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,791
- Mamma.
- You see, you're upsettin' her and the baby.

413
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,268
How can I be upsettin' the baby
when the baby ain't even born yet?

414
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:52,207
Oh, yeah? How would you like to be up there,
listening to you yell?

415
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,543
I wouldn't be up there in the first place,

416
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,360
because I have nothin' to do
with that stinky Tommy.

417
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:56,658
- Mamma!
- What do you got against Tommy?

418
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:57,895
He's a nice boy.

419
00:32:57,926 --> 00:33:00,845
No kid that hits me over the goddamn head
with a chair is a nice boy.

420
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:02,807
He's marrying her, ain't he? He's a nice boy.

421
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,099
Mamma!

422
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:10,296
Look what you made her do.
- Oh, Jesus! What the hell is that?

423
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,143
What are you stupid or something?

424
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,917
She broke her water.
Now she's going to have the baby!

425
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:19,014
She can't have the baby yet. It is too soon.
She ain't even married yet!

426
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,907
Okay, come on.

427
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,025
Wait a minute.

428
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:53,281
Vin, this guy ain't gonna wait no minute
for his blow job.

429
00:33:58,685 --> 00:33:59,977
You fuck.

430
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:06,423
What are you waiting for?
What's the matter with you?

431
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,256
- I don't like guys pushing my head!
- Come on, goddamn it!

432
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,914
- Where the fuck were you?
- What are you talkin' about?

433
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:45,511
Oh, you knew I had him over there.
Why didn't you konk him?

434
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,903
What, that guy? Jeez, we thought
it was your new boyfriend.

435
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:55,038
- You thought it was funny, you bastards?
- "I don't like guys pushing my head!"

436
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:56,573
Fuck all of you.

437
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:59,147
- All right, come on, give.
- Fuck your mother.

438
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,127
- Give me the bread.
- You didn't do nothing. I keep the money.

439
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,168
Hey!

440
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:10,560
- Christ, you work cheap.
- Give me my money.

441
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:12,233
Fuck whose mother?

442
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:18,773
You cheap thieving bastards!

443
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,043
Give me a drink, Willie.

444
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:27,505
Oh, we're closer, give us one first.

445
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:31,096
- Yeah, give us one here.
- Give me mine first. You girls screw yourself.

446
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,629
Hey, you shouldn't talk to my girlfriend
like that.

447
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:37,815
- That douchebag?
- Douchebag? Who you calling a douchebag?

448
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:40,467
Soldier, you should be able to do
better than that.

449
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:43,236
Hey, now you keep
your shitty mouth shut, you hear me?

450
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,287
Shove it up your ass, you...

451
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:47,409
Quit squawking here. Who needs a drink?

452
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:51,281
You want a drink?
I'll buy you a drink.

453
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:54,080
- Sure, you can buy me a drink.
Nothing to do with her.

454
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:57,004
- But not in this crummy dump.
- She don't need nothing.

455
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,382
- See, he ain't going nowhere.
- Oh, yeah?

456
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:03,941
Hey, where are you going?

457
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:08,279
Hey, we could go to this bar
I heard about in Manhattan.

458
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:11,162
Look at that.
- A lot of officers go there.

459
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,840
- Manhattan, huh?
- Yeah.

460
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,321
Yeah, okay.

461
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,442
Hey, go that way first.

462
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:26,604
What's she doin'?
How we supposed to lump him in a cab?

463
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,395
Don't worry about it, she'll give us a signal.

464
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:32,872
Hey, Tralala, where are you going?

465
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,820
- What the hell kind of signal is that?
- Oh, that was cute.

466
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,170
Where are you going?
Hey, Tralala, where are you going?

467
00:36:41,442 --> 00:36:44,610
- Hey, what's bugging her?
- Who knows? Who cares?

468
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:48,327
Look, let's just get high, all right?
Who's springing for a cab?

469
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:49,741
Don't look at me.

470
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,720
- Tony?
- No fuckin' chance.

471
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:55,973
Hey. What about our boy Harry?

472
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,537
Harry.

473
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:02,370
Harry.

474
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,962
Come on, fellas.

475
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:24,140
- Here, keep the change. Give me a receipt.
- Okay.

476
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:25,665
No, no, I'll fill it in. Thanks.

477
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,432
Take it easy.
- Sure.

478
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,877
God, I'm dying for a drink.

479
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,780
Hey, somebody's coming down.

480
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:39,621
Hey, is this where the party's at?

481
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,747
You sure we got the right party here?

482
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,748
Sweetheart, I'm Vin, what's your name?

483
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,352
What's the matter with that broad,
don't she talk?

484
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,727
- Hey, sweetchips. How's the leg?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,058
Yeah? Well, you know Sal and Tony.

486
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,809
- And this is Harry from the union.
- Hi, Harry.

487
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,345
Everyone, this is Miss Camille.

488
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,285
And this is our hostess Miss Goldie.

489
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,158
Christ, that faggot looks like a showgirl.

490
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:20,570
And over here is Regina.

491
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Wow.

492
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,404
Hey, Vin, You didn't tell us
this was Georgie's party.

493
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,694
Everybody, sit down and relax.
- Give them the booze, Harry.

494
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,578
- Huh?
- The booze.

495
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,726
- What?
- Give them the booze.

496
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,963
- How marvelous, more libations.
- Hey, hey, watch your language.

497
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,366
Hey, you know, Harry buys
whatever he wants, booze, food,

498
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,778
anything he wants and the union pays for it.

499
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,336
You must be quite a big man
in the union, Harold.

500
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,347
Yeah, I'm in charge of the strike.

501
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,572
Are you on strike against sitting down?

502
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,545
Rosie, be a dear, and refill the ice bowl.

503
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,356
- Mmm-mmm.
- Do as I say at once,

504
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,445
or you'll be out on the street
with the other freaks, Miss Cocksucker.

505
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,356
Hey, don't worry, chippy.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

506
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,314
Maybe just fuck you a little.

507
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,934
- What a weirdie she is.
At least we got one real one here, huh?

508
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:26,504
You should have asked us
to show you how, Harold.

509
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:29,230
There's no sense in wasting good pot
on amateurs.

510
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:31,532
I didn't realize your friends were so square.

511
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:36,066
Let me show you how to do it, Harold.

512
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,988
It ain't that hard, Harry. All you gotta do
is put it in your mouth and suck.

513
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:05,548
You know somethin'?

514
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,815
You're good looking.

515
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:14,261
And I'm gonna show you a good time.

516
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:17,529
Yeah, sure, I'll show you the time of your life.

517
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:36,845
Light.

518
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:40,077
Please?

519
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:42,291
Yeah, sure.

520
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,431
Second Looey, huh?

521
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:52,759
Yeah.

522
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:57,081
- I just got out of OCS.
- And they're already shippin' you out?

523
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,715
I got my orders today.

524
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,565
So are you buying me a drink?

525
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,767
Yeah. What would you like?

526
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:17,441
This dump is dyin'. Maybe we ought to
go somewhere else to drink.

527
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:25,245
- It's okay with me.
- Wait here, I gotta tell my brother I'm leaving.

528
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:35,475
I thought you were gonna show me
a good time.

529
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:36,516
You bet.

530
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:40,995
The waiter's here. He wants to know
if you have any money.

531
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:44,916
- Show him your money so I don't have to pay.
- You bet.

532
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:55,254
There, you see, I told you he had money!

533
00:41:58,235 --> 00:42:00,986
- So, where are you from?
- Idaho.

534
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:02,925
Have you ever been there?

535
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,580
- To Idaho?
- Yeah.

536
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,165
I'm from Brooklyn, man.
I don't even know around here.

537
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:09,950
I don't understand. If you're from here...

538
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:13,415
This is Manhattan.
I don't go out of the neighborhood.

539
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,459
New York is a lot different
than I thought it'd be.

540
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:22,188
The whole time I've been here, it seems
like all I've done is walk around by myself.

541
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:25,160
I was startin' to think
I wasn't gonna meet a single soul here.

542
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:27,783
You got anything to drink at your hotel?

543
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,089
A sack of whiskey I brought from home.

544
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:32,743
I was saving it for my last night here,

545
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:35,508
but we could drink it if you like.

546
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,627
Is it far from here?

547
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:42,201
No, it's just a couple of blocks.
We could walk.

548
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:45,073
Okay.

549
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:53,276
Thank you, Rosie.
Be a good girl, scoop up the empties.

550
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:59,727
What's the matter, Rosie? Afraid of my lob?

551
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:06,197
Come here, Rosie.
I got a nice, fat stratnyanka for you.

552
00:43:08,473 --> 00:43:11,976
- Look at what that bitch did to me.
- What's the matter, Sal, you got a boo-boo?

553
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:13,330
Don't worry, I won't let him hurt you.

554
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,669
You're not to touch her,
do you understand me?

555
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:19,216
- Where is that crazy bitch?
- You leave her alone, she's just a girl.

556
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,445
Stop, stop! Vinnie, do something.

557
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,850
Sal's mad now.

558
00:43:22,872 --> 00:43:23,914
Stop!

559
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,218
This is getting rather sordid.

560
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,819
Why don't we go?

561
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:39,419
I'll show you who's a fairy.

562
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,517
Motherfucker!

563
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:42,989
You wanna look like a broad, huh?

564
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:44,701
You gonna get fucked like one.

565
00:43:44,712 --> 00:43:46,254
Hey, Vin, you want a piece of this?

566
00:43:56,672 --> 00:44:00,008
One for Vinnie, one for me,

567
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:04,427
one for Vinnie, one for me,

568
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:06,513
one for Vinnie.

569
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:21,968
Tral!

570
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:25,647
How come you're dressed?

571
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:27,130
I was gonna go out for cigarettes.

572
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:30,827
- There are some left there on the dresser.
- Oh.

573
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,681
You know, I only have
a couple of days left before I ship out.

574
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,312
I was thinking that maybe
we could spend them together.

575
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:45,185
What do you mean, "Spend them together"?

576
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:50,654
We could go to the movies, shopping,

577
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:52,838
I'll buy you a dress.

578
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:55,902
Do things that couples do.

579
00:44:55,911 --> 00:44:57,662
Man, you must've really liked it, huh?

580
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:00,407
Come here.

581
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:10,017
Not too small for you?

582
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,336
I think they're the best
in the Western world, Tral.

583
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,897
But that's not what I'm talking about.

584
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,258
I'm not gonna have the chance to be
like this with someone again for a long time.

585
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,957
Maybe never!

586
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,451
- You understand?
- Yeah!

587
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:36,328
I like that. The best tits in the Western world.

588
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,366
Vinnie, Vinnie?

589
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,196
Vinnie!

590
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,360
Where are you?

591
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,183
I was having the most delightful dream.

592
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,985
- Vinnie!
- Vinnie's gone, dear.

593
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,950
Gone?

594
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:02,782
You seemed to be having such a lovely sleep.

595
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:05,124
He didn't want to wake you to say "Goodbye. "

596
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:06,860
Goodbye?

597
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,040
Vinnie!

598
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:26,131
Vinnie!

599
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:28,767
Where are you?

600
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:37,677
Oh God, did you see that?

601
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:41,044
Oh, my God.

602
00:47:06,468 --> 00:47:07,802
What do they think they're doing?

603
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,923
What the hell is going on here?

604
00:47:21,907 --> 00:47:24,868
Hey, hey. No truck here!

605
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,119
No trucks here!

606
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:09,793
Oh!

607
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:24,129
Hey, hey!

608
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:26,426
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Shut up.

609
00:48:43,026 --> 00:48:44,026
Oh, Christ.

610
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:46,626
Oh, fuck.

611
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:55,295
Let me through, let me through.

612
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,490
Where the hell you been, Harry?

613
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,506
You on the gate, that's factory property.
Get off there.

614
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,968
- Fuck you, goon!
- Tell them, Harry!

615
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:16,988
I'm warning you, fellow,
you better get the hell off there!

616
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:18,444
Yeah, or what?

617
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:20,598
Eat shit, goon!

618
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,217
Yeah, stay back there where you belong.

619
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:32,687
That's right, you too, Wilson,
you four-eyed fuck!

620
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:36,777
Yeah, you too, you scabs, you punks.

621
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:39,288
Maybe you came in here,
but you sure as fuck ain't gonna get out!

622
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,395
No truck's gonna get out of here,
you hear me?

623
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:46,722
No trucks out! No trucks out! No trucks out!

624
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:11,484
This thing's gonna get out of hand here.
We're gonna need some back up.

625
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:14,426
And I don't mean just a few men.
Send everything you've got.

626
00:50:14,384 --> 00:50:17,386
Send men, send gas, send horses.

627
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,413
Hey baby, how would you
like a little spanking?

628
00:50:41,384 --> 00:50:42,759
Tral! Over here at ringside.

629
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:48,147
Hey, Tralala!

630
00:50:50,943 --> 00:50:52,861
- Come here.
We don't want any trouble.

631
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:55,657
Everybody stay calm and let the horses in.

632
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:57,207
Just move back. Stay calm, move back.

633
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:58,182
Where you been?

634
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:00,891
Yeah, we was real worried about you, Tral.

635
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:03,531
You look pretty sharp there. New rags, huh?

636
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:06,255
Yeah, you bet your sweet ass I look sharp.

637
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:10,101
I got me an officer in Manhattan.

638
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:15,319
He's loaded!
Takes me out places, he buys me things.

639
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,518
And when he ships out,
he's gonna drop a bundle on me.

640
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:18,753
Yeah, sure.

641
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,247
Scabby whores like her can have
the bums and the two-bit doggies.

642
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:25,433
From now on, it's gonna be
only officers for me.

643
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:27,464
Yeah, right, here comes your officer now.

644
00:51:30,582 --> 00:51:32,166
Go and get him, Sal.

645
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:39,815
Give it to me, give it to me.

646
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:43,618
Jesus Christ, you ought to
wash that thing once in a while.

647
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,320
Don't mind them bastards.

648
00:51:47,342 --> 00:51:49,385
Guys, the kid's got fleas.

649
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:50,382
Thanks.

650
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,535
Hey, who the fuck you think you are?

651
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:46,942
Ham and cheese?

652
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:52,778
Hey, Joe. Joe, Tommy's here.

653
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:55,538
I hate that goddamn kid.

654
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,000
C'mon, what are you talking about?
He's gonna be family now, huh?

655
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:00,607
You don't understand, Paulie?
He took my daughter.

656
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,128
Joe, Donna had the baby.
She had a boy, Joe.

657
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,521
- That's wonderful, congratulations.
- Congratulations, kid.

658
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,004
Jesus, Joe, that makes you a grandfather.

659
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,440
Here, have one of mine.

660
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,260
First, I want the kid baptized,

661
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,089
and then I want...
I want to have a big party for him.

662
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,071
Paulie, I want you and Theresa to be
godfather and godmother to him.

663
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,564
- We'd be honored, Joe. But uh, you know...
- But, but what?

664
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,626
Don't you think
that's up to Donna and Tommy, huh?

665
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,163
Hey, Paulie, it's okay with me.

666
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,568
What's the matter with you?
You didn't hear what I said?

667
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,007
I want you to be godparents.

668
00:53:54,379 --> 00:53:55,545
They're coming out.

669
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:56,913
Those sons of bitches are coming out.

670
00:53:56,939 --> 00:53:59,357
Those sons of bitches are coming out!

671
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:46,286
We need help here. Let's go!

672
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:50,522
Get back! Get off there! Get back!

673
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,431
Okay, let them have it!

674
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:27,555
Tear gas ready?
Yes, sir.

675
00:55:56,257 --> 00:56:00,969
Fire!

676
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:45,670
We gotta stop them.
Come on!

677
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,175
Paulie!

678
00:57:10,216 --> 00:57:11,508
Stay back!

679
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:30,732
Hey, listen, if you're all tapped out,
I just got paid,

680
00:58:30,694 --> 00:58:33,112
and I can lend you a five until Friday.

681
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,260
Hold on.

682
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:39,571
- What is it?
- Wait.

683
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:43,215
I like that. That's nice.
In case you want to give me something else...

684
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:44,173
I like it too.

685
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:45,378
You're the one from the other night.

686
00:58:46,252 --> 00:58:48,170
You got the wrong girl, pal.

687
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,049
What's your name?

688
00:58:50,053 --> 00:58:51,345
Dolores! Now get lost.

689
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:52,540
You stole my money.

690
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,031
Excuse me.

691
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:57,430
Look, I got no beef with you.
All I want is my money back from the whore.

692
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,412
Now, if she says you have the wrong girl,
then you have the wrong girl.

693
00:59:02,813 --> 00:59:04,355
Now, you apologize to her.

694
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:09,497
Sorry.

695
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:14,264
I thought you were someone else.

696
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:22,493
Thanks.

697
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:25,538
- You okay?
- Yeah.

698
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:26,866
Let's go then.

699
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:36,674
Don't worry. I'll put Dowland on it.
He'll make a full report.

700
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:39,821
Harry, I need a new set of picket signs
down here by 8:00 tomorrow.

701
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:41,230
Don't worry about it, Boyce.
I'll take care of it.

702
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:43,337
He's right here. Okay.

703
00:59:43,332 --> 00:59:44,332
You all right?

704
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,455
What do you say, Harry?

705
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:47,373
I heard about your little rumble.

706
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:51,684
Yeah, Harry, you're not gonna
let them get away with that shit, are you?

707
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:55,321
Hey! There ain't nobody
gonna get away with nothing!

708
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,794
Yeah? So, what are you planning on
doing about it, Harry?

709
00:59:57,771 --> 00:59:58,896
Who're they?

710
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:01,016
They're friends of mine
from the neighborhood.

711
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:02,679
This is Boyce, one of my best friends.

712
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:04,942
And he happens to be the head of this local.

713
01:00:04,932 --> 01:00:07,683
What do you say, Boyce.
Heard about your little problem.

714
01:00:07,652 --> 01:00:09,778
Oh yeah? What problem's that?

715
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:11,939
We happen to know
who the scab trucks belong to.

716
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,599
Yeah, the Bulaggi Brothers. So what?

717
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:18,034
We also happen to know
where they park the rest of their trucks.

718
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,230
You boys got something on your minds?

719
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:30,748
Is it worth 200 bucks to you
to teach them a lesson they'll never forget?

720
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,135
Keep an eye on things.
I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

721
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,256
Yeah sure, Boyce. Hey, take your time.

722
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,544
And take care of yourself, too.
We need you around here.

723
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,990
What do you mean? This?
Boyce, this is nothing.

724
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,865
I don't wanna know anything.

725
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,248
- And don't spend it all in one place.
- Okay.

726
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,185
And get the fuck off my car.

727
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:12,177
Hey, 200 fucking clams.

728
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:14,880
Hey, give that back, you...

729
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,016
Give it back.

730
01:01:21,569 --> 01:01:25,155
Paulie, I can't ride with you
in the ambulance, okay.

731
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:27,090
You think I need somebody to hold my hand?

732
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,380
I'll see you later.

733
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,393
Come here, Theresa.

734
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:35,078
Joe... Joe, how's he doing?

735
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:37,698
Is he gonna be alright?

736
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:58,739
- Looks good.
- Yeah, there's nothing out there.

737
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:01,357
Man, this is gonna be a fucking slope out.
Let's go.

738
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,021
It's open.

739
01:02:57,008 --> 01:02:58,008
Ah!

740
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:14,485
My, aren't we looking handsome tonight?

741
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:20,584
I got you some of that
champagne that you liked. Huh?

742
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:23,531
You're so sweet.

743
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:26,806
What happened to your hand?

744
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:29,057
I'll tell you all about it.
Let's crack that champagne.

745
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:30,422
You won't believe this story.

746
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:25,051
Hey! Tough luck,
Bulaggi!

747
01:04:35,486 --> 01:04:37,278
What is that, darling?

748
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:41,302
That's teaching people
not to fuck with Harry Black.

749
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:55,290
Hey, what the fuck are you doing here
this early?

750
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:58,747
- You know Secretary Dowland?
- Yeah, sure, Jack, how are you, eh?

751
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,607
What do you say, beer?
A little hair of the dog, huh?

752
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:07,367
Dowland's in charge of investigating
what happened at the riot.

753
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:09,159
Where were you in the morning
when the trucks came in?

754
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:13,825
'Cause nobody got to me
for almost two hours.

755
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:17,557
And, by that time, company security was there
and the cops were there

756
01:05:17,485 --> 01:05:19,235
and where the fuck were you?

757
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:20,645
Uh...

758
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:25,490
But nothing, nothing happened
till later that night.

759
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:27,821
Now, people have been asking me,
how come I wasn't there.

760
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:30,055
Now, you think I'm gonna take the heat
because you fucked up.

761
01:05:30,044 --> 01:05:33,797
Hold on, Boyce. For Christ sake,
I mean, what about my hand, huh?

762
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:36,559
Na, that's it.
We can't let you run the office anymore,

763
01:05:36,524 --> 01:05:38,775
and you're stepping down as shop steward.

764
01:05:41,244 --> 01:05:43,245
I was late one fucking time.

765
01:05:43,244 --> 01:05:46,454
Dowland also found out about the
other shit that's been going on here.

766
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:48,613
What're you talking about?

767
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:50,271
Your expenses!

768
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:53,119
No, no, no.
You told me, Boyce. You said that as long...

769
01:05:53,084 --> 01:05:56,920
I could buy anything if I got receipts and look,
I got them, I got receipts here.

770
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,579
What are you giving me this shit for?

771
01:06:00,764 --> 01:06:04,058
Champagne from "Bernie's Liquors,"

772
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,213
cab rides all over hell,

773
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:07,871
a new... A new tie?

774
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:10,301
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Frank Sinatra?

775
01:06:11,163 --> 01:06:12,580
Boyce, you can't do this to me.

776
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,985
- Take out your wallet.
- What?

777
01:06:15,963 --> 01:06:17,505
Your wallet. Take it out!

778
01:06:29,683 --> 01:06:30,892
That's all the money I got.

779
01:06:33,843 --> 01:06:36,469
You're gonna put back every dime
you took out of here, you hear me?

780
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,871
I don't have the money, Boyce.

781
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:43,836
Boyce, please.

782
01:06:45,962 --> 01:06:47,046
Don't beg, Harry.

783
01:06:48,562 --> 01:06:50,188
And don't slam the door.

784
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:09,444
Hey, Harry.

785
01:07:11,562 --> 01:07:13,479
Harry, Harry, how's the hand?

786
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:16,108
That was something the way you
busted up that scab yesterday.

787
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:18,389
Let's go. We got another load coming.

788
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:31,173
You know, you've awaken me
from a simply delightful sleep?

789
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:34,332
- I don't know why you had to call so early.
- I got to talk to you, Regina.

790
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:37,785
Since I'm up I suppose
I'll wash up and put a face on,

791
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:39,556
we can go out for a nice brunch somewhere,

792
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:42,896
and after that you can take me to the cinema
if I should happen to be in the mood.

793
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:45,676
- I just came from the strike office.
- Oh, you and that strike.

794
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:49,519
- I'm not in charge of the office no more.
- I can't hear a word you're saying.

795
01:07:50,802 --> 01:07:54,137
I know what, you can take me
to this adorable little new place

796
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:55,998
that has the most divine champagne brunch.

797
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,878
I don't... I don't know if I can.
Regina, I don't have enough money.

798
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,593
What do you mean, you don't have
enough money? Go and get some.

799
01:08:01,561 --> 01:08:05,105
No, I can't get anymore.
I don't get expenses now.

800
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:07,334
Don't be silly, Harry.
Of course you can get some more.

801
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,905
Don't be such a bore.

802
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:13,828
Look, can't we stay here?

803
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,299
I'll go out. I'll get some beer.

804
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:16,362
What are you talking about?

805
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,944
We don't have to go anywhere,
we could stay here.

806
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:20,338
Oh, Harry, sometimes you are just too much.

807
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,279
I have no intention of staying here
like some fishwife.

808
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,407
Now, will you please leave me alone?

809
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,900
I don't, I don't have enough money to go out.

810
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,256
I'd like to stay here.

811
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,866
See, we have a few beers
and nobody's gonna bother us.

812
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:35,387
I ain't even hungry.
Or else, we could get some sandwiches.

813
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,739
Oh, for God's sake.
Will you please stop babbling like a baby?

814
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,681
I am not staying home.

815
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,848
Now, if you have any money,
you can meet me later at Stewart's,

816
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,008
and if not, please do not
annoy me any further.

817
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,167
But...

818
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:47,618
Really, Harry, you are getting hysterical.

819
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,057
We don't have to go.

820
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:00,799
As if I care.

821
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:25,820
- Regina!
- Oh, are you still here?

822
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,523
Tell me, Harry, how long you gonna
sit there jerking that glass off?

823
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:32,773
It's really a terrible habit.

824
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:34,093
Regina.

825
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:39,303
I'll see you downtown later? I love your hat.

826
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:16,410
Hope I didn't leave anything.

827
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:28,468
No. Just your jacket.

828
01:11:28,437 --> 01:11:29,854
It's okay, I'm gonna wear that.

829
01:11:37,316 --> 01:11:39,317
I'm having trouble getting this thing closed.

830
01:11:39,316 --> 01:11:40,984
Here, this will help you.

831
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:45,400
Is that enough?

832
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:53,616
God, I wish I didn't have to leave.

833
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:14,444
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

834
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:18,047
I'm gonna miss New York.

835
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:21,204
I'm really, really glad that I met you, Tral.

836
01:12:21,155 --> 01:12:23,490
Come on, move it, soldier!

837
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:24,976
- Bye, Tral.
- Come on, move it!

838
01:12:26,995 --> 01:12:28,161
Yeah, so long.

839
01:12:30,675 --> 01:12:32,509
Tral, Tral.

840
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:36,405
I almost forgot.

841
01:12:40,275 --> 01:12:42,276
Wait till I'm gone before you open it, okay?

842
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:58,657
Dear Tral,

843
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,384
I wish there was some way for you to know

844
01:13:00,394 --> 01:13:03,688
how much the time we spent together
has meant to me.

845
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:06,011
I know that nothing in this world is sure,

846
01:13:05,994 --> 01:13:08,704
but I hope and pray that
I will live through this war

847
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:10,925
and that someday you and I
will see each other again.

848
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:16,781
Give me a whiskey!

849
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:22,917
- Hey, doll, have a drink with us.
- Oh, yeah, both of us.

850
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:25,253
Those stupid punks couldn't kiss my ass.

851
01:13:28,995 --> 01:13:30,870
Count to ten.

852
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,124
What?

853
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:34,404
Watch this...

854
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:39,798
One, two, three

855
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:45,254
four, five, six

856
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,572
seven, eight, nine, ten. So what?

857
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:50,451
Who's paying for the drink?

858
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:53,058
- C'mon, doll, have a drink with us.
- Yeah, come on.

859
01:13:55,113 --> 01:13:57,823
Yeah, give me a double.

860
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:08,284
Please don't hang up the phone, Regina.
I got to talk to you.

861
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:10,484
Harold, stop being so ridiculous.

862
01:14:10,472 --> 01:14:13,307
You see, Regina, you don't understand. I...

863
01:14:47,152 --> 01:14:51,822
Hey, motherfucker!

864
01:15:44,192 --> 01:15:45,776
You're drunk, Mr. Black.

865
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:56,531
It's me, Bobby, you know.
My dad owns the grocery store.

866
01:16:05,871 --> 01:16:07,955
Jeez, you're really drunk, ain't you?

867
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,561
Where are you going?

868
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:21,664
Hey, you're hurting my neck.

869
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,047
Hey, where are you going?

870
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:35,278
What's back here?

871
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,146
What are you doing?

872
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:40,025
Hey, cut it out!
- Stop.

873
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,699
- Let me go!
- Please, please, please.

874
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:58,809
Please!

875
01:17:05,869 --> 01:17:07,119
Where?
Over there.

876
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:09,609
In the back? Where, Bobby, where?

877
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:10,672
There he is.

878
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:16,488
You tried to blow a little kid,
you fucking freak!

879
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:17,594
Freak. Freak.

880
01:17:24,628 --> 01:17:27,088
Bobby, come here, take a shot.

881
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:29,028
- Go on, Bobby, take a shot.
Get him, Bobby.

882
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:33,112
Atta boy, Bobby.

883
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,494
Okay. Get him up. Get him up.

884
01:17:46,909 --> 01:17:48,743
Lift him up, put his arms around me.

885
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,081
Here, like this.

886
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,191
Let me give you a hand.

887
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:54,709
Here we go.

888
01:17:56,268 --> 01:17:58,477
Oh, shit!
Here, my turn.

889
01:17:58,468 --> 01:17:59,468
Get out of here, wait.

890
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:09,073
Yeah, me too! I can go
for somethin' to drink.

891
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:11,652
How about you, Bobby, you thirsty?
- Yeah.

892
01:18:12,547 --> 01:18:15,507
Hey, that was the first real kick
we had in a while.

893
01:18:15,468 --> 01:18:16,760
Get out of here.

894
01:18:18,188 --> 01:18:19,939
Fuck you, you're just jealous.

895
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:05,917
Oh God.

896
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:39,084
Joseph, I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

897
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:44,747
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

898
01:19:47,346 --> 01:19:50,139
May almighty God, Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

899
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:53,817
who has given you a new birth
through the water and the Holy Spirit

900
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:55,454
and forgiven all your sins,

901
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:59,886
anoint you with the chrism of salvation
in the name of Christ Jesus our Lord,

902
01:19:59,785 --> 01:20:01,661
- for life everlasting.
- Amen.

903
01:20:01,665 --> 01:20:04,876
Amen.

904
01:20:04,824 --> 01:20:09,453
Receive this burning light
and keep the grace of your baptism

905
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:12,135
throughout your blameless life.

906
01:20:13,345 --> 01:20:16,013
Observe the commandments of God.

907
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:19,029
Then, when the Lord comes
to the heavenly wedding feast,

908
01:20:18,985 --> 01:20:22,821
you will be able to meet him
with all the saints in the halls of heaven

909
01:20:22,745 --> 01:20:25,413
and live forever and ever.

910
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:29,429
Joseph, go in peace,
and the Lord be with you.

911
01:20:29,344 --> 01:20:30,344
Amen.

912
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:24,636
Hey, Willie, give me a drink here.

913
01:21:25,743 --> 01:21:27,536
I haven't seen you around here in a while.

914
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:29,742
You got any money?

915
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:32,035
That's none of your goddamn business.

916
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:33,524
My friend here is gonna pay for it.

917
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:37,251
- Won't you, honey?
- Hey, he's with me!

918
01:21:38,983 --> 01:21:42,277
If you try cutting my throat,
I'll dump your guts on the floor.

919
01:21:42,223 --> 01:21:43,473
Hey, here drink up.

920
01:21:44,423 --> 01:21:46,132
Chugalug!

921
01:21:46,143 --> 01:21:49,020
Hey, don't bother with her,
we'll get him out of here soon enough.

922
01:21:48,983 --> 01:21:52,443
I hope you burn like hell
when he leaves here with me.

923
01:21:52,383 --> 01:21:53,508
How about another one?

924
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:54,876
This one's on me, huh?

925
01:21:56,223 --> 01:21:59,267
Hey, how do you like my tits?

926
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:01,524
I guess they're real.

927
01:22:04,143 --> 01:22:06,102
C'mon, Jack, let's get out of here.

928
01:22:06,102 --> 01:22:08,562
Norma, let's stay a while.
We're having fun here.

929
01:22:15,142 --> 01:22:18,061
Hey Willie, give me another drink here.

930
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:29,894
Have you been taking dancing lessons, Joe?

931
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:34,495
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

932
01:22:34,461 --> 01:22:35,920
One, two, three.

933
01:22:36,902 --> 01:22:39,404
Tommy, you should've seen Donna
when she was born,

934
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:42,008
she was such a beautiful little baby.

935
01:22:41,981 --> 01:22:47,486
Look at her now all grown up
and married and with a baby of her own.

936
01:23:10,022 --> 01:23:12,690
- What are you showing us here?
- C'mon, c'mon.

937
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:14,745
It's a little beat up now, but just you wait.

938
01:23:15,781 --> 01:23:17,198
That's it?

939
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:18,972
Eh, shut up.

940
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,858
I'll fix it up a little. It will be as sharp
as any bike on the road, right, Tommy?

941
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,281
Oh, absolutely.

942
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:26,177
Besides, watch this.

943
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,678
- I get the first ride.
- Not you.

944
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:48,223
What the hell are you doing out there?

945
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,429
The party's in here.

946
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:12,107
The best tits in the Western world.

947
01:25:57,818 --> 01:26:00,528
What is this? All tits and no cunt?

948
01:26:00,497 --> 01:26:03,624
C'mon. I'll show you. All of you.

949
01:26:17,577 --> 01:26:19,703
Hey, I was first. Get out of here.

950
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:23,881
C'mon.

951
01:26:32,296 --> 01:26:36,424
Spook, you're missing my party.
Come back up here.

952
01:26:37,096 --> 01:26:39,180
I'll fix that for you tomorrow.

953
01:26:50,017 --> 01:26:51,517
It's a nice party, Joe.

954
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:59,042
All I can say is that without that chair,
you would have been in trouble that day.

955
01:26:59,936 --> 01:27:01,020
What's that?

956
01:27:01,056 --> 01:27:03,349
The goddamn chair you hit me with.

957
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:05,045
Without that, I would've kicked your ass.

958
01:27:05,056 --> 01:27:07,641
- Oh, you mean at the union hall?
- Yeah.

959
01:27:07,615 --> 01:27:09,116
That was really something, wasn't it?

960
01:27:19,616 --> 01:27:21,533
C'mon, this is supposed to be a party, huh?

961
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:38,242
My baby! My baby!

962
01:27:38,976 --> 01:27:40,184
Something happened to the baby.

963
01:27:40,215 --> 01:27:42,216
What? What happened to the baby?

964
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:49,997
Oh, Jesus, what the hell is he
doing on the floor?

965
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:54,888
Donna, Donna, he's just a baby.

966
01:27:54,814 --> 01:27:57,232
You got to keep an eye on him all the time.

967
01:28:08,135 --> 01:28:10,762
C'mon you bastards, I'll fuck you blind.

968
01:28:13,694 --> 01:28:14,694
Let's get some beer!

969
01:28:16,574 --> 01:28:18,117
Make a fucking line.

970
01:28:27,494 --> 01:28:34,333
Oh, and we'd like to thank
my brother Paulie and his wife Theresa

971
01:28:34,293 --> 01:28:36,878
for the wonderful, delicious sandwiches.

972
01:28:43,094 --> 01:28:47,890
Oh, oh, oh, I see the head
of our union coming in, Boyce,

973
01:28:47,774 --> 01:28:49,942
and we'd like to thank him

974
01:28:49,934 --> 01:28:54,313
for helping us with a union loan,
especially for the party.

975
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:05,952
First I wanna congratulate Joe and his family.

976
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:09,271
Tommy and Donna are good kids
and I wish them the very best,

977
01:29:09,214 --> 01:29:11,048
and may they have many little ones.

978
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:15,727
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

979
01:29:15,733 --> 01:29:16,691
Thanks, Boyce.

980
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:19,402
And now, I see a lot of union men
here tonight,

981
01:29:19,373 --> 01:29:22,166
and I want you guys to be the first to know.

982
01:29:22,132 --> 01:29:26,219
At tonight's meeting with management
those SOB's finally gave in.

983
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:29,969
You hear me? We beat them.
We're going back to work Monday morning!

984
01:29:29,893 --> 01:29:31,560
The strike is over!

985
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:13,572
Hey! What's the matter with you,
riding your bike in here?

986
01:30:13,532 --> 01:30:15,783
- You seen Tral around?
- Get that thing out of here!

987
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:18,274
Go on! Get it out! Get it out of here! Go on!

988
01:30:32,651 --> 01:30:36,321
- Is anyone keepin' score here?
- Who the fuck can count that far?

989
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:50,933
Dear Tral,

990
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:52,682
I wish there was some way for you to know

991
01:30:52,691 --> 01:30:55,109
how much the time we spent together
has meant to me.

992
01:30:56,171 --> 01:30:58,589
I hope and pray that I will live
through this war

993
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,752
and that someday you and I
will see each other again.

994
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:07,104
Until then, I'll dream about the day
when I come back and see your face

995
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:11,550
and we can once again be together
like we were these last few days.

996
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,716
Love, Steve.

997
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:31,854
Good, now I'm not last in line.

998
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,508
Get away from her.

999
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,410
Get away!

1000
01:31:42,969 --> 01:31:44,095
Get away from her!

1001
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:47,228
- Get away, leave her alone.
- What's wrong with you? Take it easy.

1002
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,138
All of you, leave her alone.

1003
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:52,975
Leave her alone!

1004
01:33:34,487 --> 01:33:35,529
Don't.

1005
01:33:40,288 --> 01:33:47,836
Don't cry.

1006
01:34:27,166 --> 01:34:31,419
Listen, any problems with Donna,
problems with the marriage...

1007
01:34:31,326 --> 01:34:33,869
What do you say, Joe?
Tommy!

1008
01:34:33,846 --> 01:34:35,764
You come to me, understand?

1009
01:34:35,766 --> 01:34:39,769
I've been with Ella 26 years,
never had a single problem.

1010
01:34:39,686 --> 01:34:41,186
So I know what I'm talking about here.

1011
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,041
How's the baby doing?

1012
01:34:43,045 --> 01:34:47,132
Cries all day, shits all over the place.

1013
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:50,846
He's real good.
