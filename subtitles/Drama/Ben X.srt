00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,152
<i> I can not explain. </ I>

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,391
<i> I cannot explain myself. </ I>

<i> Everything I say is true, </ i>
<i> Even if I dont speak. </ I>

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,156
There should always be a first death.
Otherwise, nothing happens.

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,710
Otherwise it's never a problem.
Otherwise, everything is always on.

7
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,555
No.
There must always be someone dying first.

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,955
Based on true events

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,192
And then everyone suddenly reacts.

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,112
But too late.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,389
So there were deaths.

12
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,954
Every morning I <i> game </ i>

Ben X says:
Hero must go, my princess

20
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,676
Scarlite says: do not forget
Princess can also be a man

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,633
Ben X says:
You are you

22
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,240
Ben X says:

Did you sleep well, boy?

43
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,635
'Very good sleep, mama.
Fine glad you asked. Thank you. '

44
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,477
Have you already seen my troll, Ben?

Quiet, yes.

We can not allow it to your heart.

51
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,190
'Yes, mama. "
- Yes, mama. Do not let my heart.

52
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,230
In your heart, boy. Sure
You may leave things in your heart.

53
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,196
Just think carefully
And quiet.

54
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,989

<i> All is strategy. </ I>

60
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,391
I can not say
I was totally surprised ...

61
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,279
But it proved just ...

62
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,956
That everything had happened so far,
That really could not.

63
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,399
Before you do something,
Must surely al ..

64
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,030
To me that was just 't proof that ...

65
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,749
Now it's just too much.
It is too much.

66
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,512
<i> People are strange. </ I>
<i> They just talk and talk and talk</ i>.

67
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,672
<i> And they drink saliva from each other. </ I>

70
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,038
<i> Because there was always something with me. </ I>

71
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,193
<i> Something with me and my hand. </ I>

72
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,679
Pass.

73
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,400

We will never know, eh.

74
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,717

Hi, queers.

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,872
Pat has a new girlfriend.
A good thing.

80
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,077
Go and sit, dear.

81
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,671
Not wrong, eh? From a old barn
Which is on fire, jumping off sparks.

82
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,718
You know how to feel your hand if you
put it in her trousers?

83
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,433
I usually will not know.

84
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,115
Once it's a horse
A sugarcube?

Hi, there is Benny. Our best friend.
- From Pluto.

89
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,993
The living proof that man
descends from the clam.

90
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,434
The clam?

91
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,871
Hi, Benny Boy.
The Marsman. Hello.

92
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,031
Whitney Houston for Benny Boy.
Come in, Benny Boy. Over.

93
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,914
Over, Benny Boy.
Do you read me?

94
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,599
Hi, Benny Boy.

95
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,436
Youve become deaf from masturbation.
- What is it all for you?

96
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,279
<i> Extinguish ...</ i>
<i> Why are they doing this? </ I>

97
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,749
If I <i> calmly played on a Saturday, they thought </ i>
<i> That my ears could not hear. </ I>

98
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,592

<i> but I could not listen. </ I>

99
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,115
He does not listen.

100
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,795
<i> When they said that perhaps something </ i>
<i> is shielding my eyes</ i>.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,833
Do you see any letters there?
- Yes.

102
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,596
Can you tell me what letters?
- Yes.

103
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,114
It is the intention that you will tell me
which letters there.

104
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,039
C-H-O-Z-T-S-Z-N-D-C-K-V-C ...

105
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,719
When he was a baby he was always
looking away ...

106
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,355
He never looked at me.
He always looked through me.

107
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,799
You have to see if a computer
Which is configured completely different.

108
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,598
They see it all.

109
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,196
They see each sheet very sharp,
But see the tree.

110
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,437
They see the trees literally
But not the forest.

111

<i> Overview </ i>.
<i> That is the point. </ I>

<i> You have to try to see </ i>.

113
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,274
<i> And make sure they do not see you. </ I>

115
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,275
View 's out of your caps.
- Debiel.

116
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,873
'Whitney Houston for Benny Boy.
We have a problem. "

117
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,952
For Benny Boy. The Marsman.

118
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,991
Every year you have a few.
Always alone in the school playground.

119
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,119
It is heartbreaking to see.
But yes, what do you then?

120
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,272
You can hold their hand hard.

121
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,198
And certainly no longer.

122
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,676
I wanted my son
To go to a normal school.

123
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,312
My wife, my ex-wife and I
had a quarrel.

124
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,230
But he was much smarter
than some of those other kids.

125
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
Three, five, ten times smarter.

126
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,394
An understandable question:
Where is God?

127
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,393
Where is this man
With its large, gray beard?

128
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,912
With all these wars and poverty
and injustice ... Where is God?

129
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,790
The interesting thing is that people who question
in the time of Jesus also questioned.

130
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,753
Because Jesus hung there 't cross
And she said:

131
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,195
'Jesus, why do you do nothing?

132
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,592
If your boss is creator of the universe. 
If you can rise anyone from the dead?

133
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,594
Then this is child's play.
Click, clack and you are free. "

134
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,032
Jesus also suggests that question.
What's in the New Testament?

135
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,749
On the ninth hour Jesus cried
with loud voice:

136
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,828
"My God, my God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "

137
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,549
Jesus himself takes the time
Also that question.

138
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,078
He was humiliated and beaten.
They have destroyed him.

139
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,471
Jesus himself doubts God.

140
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,237
He can go in death.
Actually Jesus committed suicide.

141
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,710
So he rises.
Until the resurrection.

142
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,632
And that means that God ...

143
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,316
Goddammit, Bogaert!
Leave Ben alone!

144
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,672
I dont think this is the first time
I have daid that.

145
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,110
You get problems with me.

146
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,400
Ben is a bit different than you,
Than the deplorable average here.

147
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,028
And if your ask me, boft he says.

148
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,910
Apparently it's difficult to accept
that someone is a bit different.

149
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,514
Or do you want to tell us something,
Mr. Bogaert?

150
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,993
Something about a text that you last night
have been studied extensively?

151
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,430
Yes.
- I know something.

152
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,672
We are burning of curiosity,
Mr. Bogaert.

153
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,198
Does anyone know what Jesus said
When he was crusified?

154
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,636
'Hey, first my feet. "

155
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,393
That is very cute. 'My God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "

156
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,997
One question that I, believe me,
ask myself several times every day.

157
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,789
Hi quietly.

158
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,678
Calm, please.

159
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,908
Ben, do not opnaaien
By those guests. Stay just quiet.

160
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,194
That kind of lazy birds for the cat.
They have no chance.

161
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,273
They have forever a patch
stuck on his foot.

162
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,238
The fact that the director had said
That it had.

163
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,756
He has run around all day
with that patch.

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,958
He always had sandwiches with them.

165
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,999
But he has never been able to eat.

166
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,516
But yes, what can you do?
What we always do. Too little. Nothing.

167
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,552
That is our darling.

168
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,836
Hi, Benny Boy?
- Baby Jesus.

169
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,151
Leave him alone.

170
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,918
It will not be easy,
Eh, Benny Boy, why so different?

171
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,669
Quietly.
- Better than the average.

172
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,549
You are really our great example,
Eh, Ben? You are it.

173
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,910
<i> Quietly, quietly. </ I>
<i> Just stay quiet. </ I>

174
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,754
<i> Plain, ordinary, ordinary. </ I>

175
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,552
<i> Smiles </ i>.

176
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,553
<i> 'Like a laugh', they said. </ I>

177
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,833
Then <i> it would 't stop. </ I>
<i> Then they would have to stop. </ I>

178
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,278
Filming.

179
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,835
Action.

180
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,388
Queer.

181
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,119
Loser.

182
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,192
Dirty queer.
- Loser.

183
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,514
Look at me, boy.

184
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,789
If you 't tell me,
I can 't not recommended, Vertriest.

185
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,318
Look. My favorite customers.

186
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,393
The tenth time is free, eh.
- And why is that, do you think?

187
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,757
I do not know.
- You have really no idea?

188
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,990
Is it a quiz?

189
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,077
Do you find it funny, Desmet?

190
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,557
I honestly think this is not
at all funny.

191
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,590
You have apparently Vertriest ...
How will I 't say ... Bullied.

192
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,594
A little plagued. Not bullied.
- We do this together.

193
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,231
The difference is that a normal man
understands the joke, sir.

194
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,717
We still try to be normal
to him. We still talk with him.

195
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,031
But normally it is quite bad.

196
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,512
We are not those who throw chairs
throught the window, sir.

197
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,750
It is also not easy.

198
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,469
Let but, save that theatre 
for the school.

199
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,038
And you ...

200
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
Now it's time to talk, my friend.

201
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,039
Say it. Say it.

202
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,472
Tell me what those two clowns
did wrong again.

203
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,877
But yes ...
With hindsight is easy talk, eh.

204
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,555
Well, easy ...
I mean ...

205
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,794
You feel like a former combatant
After a war that you have lost.

206
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,355
I almost no longer know how often I
have been in all these schools.

207
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,034
And always the same story.

208
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,872
At this school ...

209
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,795
We try pupils
to prepare for this hard world.

210
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,919
And they are.
And sometimes not.

211
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,115
About that glass you need . ..

212
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,955
The director said <i> </ i>
<i> That they be allowed </ i>.

213
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,953
<i> If I am still 's would be inspected. </ I>

214
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,194
Hopefully we can see each other more often.
- I hope so too.

215
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,955
And you let us know
What the doctor finally decided?

216
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,079
Or he further at this school ...
- Yes.

217
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,758
Come on, Ben, walk.

218
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,072
Ben, your camera. You have to look forward.
Really, look forward.

219
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,309
Ben, come.

220
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,352
Ben, this cant go on.
This cant go on no longer.

221
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,837
Questing <i> </ i> in Silancium
Waiting for you!  XXX Scarlite

222
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,551
Wow  o_O
You are a star on the Internet!!

223
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,075
Hi, my son.
Is it a bit?

224
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,838
Is there something?

225
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,594
Do you want to tell me something?
- No.

226
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,637
You have one message.

227
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,749
From that girl, Scarlite.

228
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,388
When will we see her
in real life?

229
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,154
Or is it not now?

230
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,828
I will let you ... Chat.
Or what you call it.

231
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,757
Sleep tight.

232
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,118
<i> Why tell people that anyway. </ I>
<i> Sleep tight. "</ I>

233
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,918
<i> If you do not rest. </ I>

234
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,679
<i> But they, they waited. </ I>

235
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,588
For <i> me. </ I>
<i> For Me, Ben X. Ben nothing </ i>.

236
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,035
They waited <i> </ i>.

237
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,519
For <i> me. </ I>

238
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,510
Scarlite says:
Too late

239
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,513
Never leave a lady waiting

240
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,749
Ben X says: low health
That is not good

241
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,715
Scarlite says: Keep your socks on
Im going <i> healing </ i>

242
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,991
Ben says:
Too late for <i> healing </ i>

243
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,198
It's nice weather. Let us got to the 
hospital again, eh, Ben.

244
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,952
Back to the doctor.

245
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,439
<i> Weather tell my story. </ I>

246
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,319
Dr. Meyvaert will be very glad
to see us.

247
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,833
<i> What is my story? </ I>

248
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,711
<i> I was not normal, I was ... Special. </ I>
Thats what <i> everyone. </ I> said

249
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,358
Your child is just hypersensitive.
Just sensitive.

250
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,308
A few emotionally dysfunctional.
- A mild form of psychosis.

251
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,513
Just a little tense.
Like the mother?

252
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,358
I will give you this.

253
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,557
We can always do
further investigations.

254
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,950
<i> In-vestigate. Vestigate in what?</ I>

255
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,675
<i> And there is always a camera. </ I>

256
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,273
<i> They see it. </ I>

257
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,470
<i> Who's crazy and who's not. </ I>

258
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,870
It is a waste of time.
Pure waste of time.

259
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,237
You have to face it.
This cant go on no longer.

260
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,279
We need someone to help us.
- That child has nothing wrong.

261
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,237
Nothing, nothing.

262
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,278
I would not lose my mind.
- You will lose nothing but.

263
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,597
<i> You have to let go, they said. </ I>
<i> But they dont allow me to go. </ I>

264
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,871
Just follow the new rule.

265
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,032
<i> And when they suddenly </ i>
<i> What 't able to be </ i>.

266
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,191
<i> I simply have a  faulty brain </ i>.

267
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,636
It would be 't Asperger syndrome
Can be.

268
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,109
The <i> Asperger syndrome, </ i>
<i> They said. </ I>

269
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,872
A form of autism.

270
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,873
<i> Autism. This is what she discovered. </ I>
<i> I have autism. </ I>

271
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,112
Of <i> autism has given me. </ I>

272
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,519
Twelve years <i> they have studied a man</ i>.

273
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,955
But not <i> tought him  </ i>
<i> to not pick his nose </ i>.

274
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,434
Madam, it  is not easy.
And it will not be easy.

275
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,673
But you should not forget:
Ben is not stupid.

276
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,198
On the contrary, he is very strong.
He is almost genious.

277
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,319
He <i> talk and talk and talk. </ I>
<i> The man who helped me far State. </ I>

278
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,550
He is strong in his senses.

279
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,238
We actually have to deal
with an extraordinary boy.

280
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,676
Those fights every day ...

281
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,950
As a normal boy
By the life.

282
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,793
And now the question:
Should we thereof help him?

283
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,317
Of those illusion that he as a habitual
Boy by the life could be.

284
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,600
I have heard that his schoolresults
is good. Very good indeed.

285
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,797
So why should we want
There now address?

286
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,990
Because he is bullied to death,
for example.

287
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,396
Yes well, that happens. That happens.

288
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,835
It would not, but could happen.

289
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,353
At a given moment
You get a stamp.

290
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,873
Autism.

291
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,633
Snap?
But that word ...

292
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,078
For me that was a child
Just that child.

293
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,753
For me it was Ben Ben.

294
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,436
Yes, these are volcanoes.

295
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,479
They are walking volcanoes
You do not know the strength.

296
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,553
Timebombs actually,
They live undercover in our world.

297
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,998
Because the reaction is often
much later than the cause.

298
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,631
We will continue.
Thats the best we can do.

299
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,268
We surely do not let us know.

300
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,069
And when <i> my fingers has </ i>
<i> told her everything. </ I>

301
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,512
Ben X says: game over
Time for endgame

302
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,713
Come on.

303
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,877
They <i>, the princess of the letters, </ i>
<i> On the other side of the country. </ I>

304
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,355
<i> That always stands beside me </ i>
<i> As' will last no longer. </ I>

305
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,793
<i> Those who know me, </ i>without them
<i> no one would know my name </ i>.

306
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,872
<i> Those who could meet me rapen </ i>.

307
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,913
They <i> I could do 'sleep. "</ I>

308
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,471
<i> The plan of one word. </ I>

309
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,915
<i> 'Let me help you,' she said. </ I>

310
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,590
<i> 'In order to increase ...</ i>

311
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,352
<i> to rise above yourself. '</ I>

312
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,792
Quietly, Ben. Quietly.

313
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,557
What do you have today?

314
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,799
Got your cell phone?
Call if you need something?

315
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,313
<i> It is not your heart. </ I>

316
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,838
Give me a kiss.

317
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,718
<i> Just stay quiet. </ I>

318
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,634
What exactly happened that day?

319
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,191
Who will say it?

320
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,912
I knew only that he ...

321
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,353
Look, I knew
How is my son felt ...

322
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,593
To the way in which he
slammed the door early morning.

323
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,914
It was not even such a bad door.
That, at least I thought.

324
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,398
I <i>, Marsman </ i>.
<i> I had to ... It </ i>.

325
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,357
<i> Ob. </ I>

326
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,430
<i> But which? </ I>
<i> Because I was always there. </ I>

327
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,629
Always <i> al </ i>

328
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,034
I's normal.

329
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,158
Freak.
- Mietje.

330
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,478
Have you seen what I shot?
Did you view?

331
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
I did not know that you believed.

332
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,038
Is it a little, boy?

333
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,436
You know that you can always tell me
if there is something. Right?

334
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,154
There is nothing.
- Ok.

335
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,674
Goddammit, what is it now?

336
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,475
Do you think its funny?

337
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,916
I thought its funny.
- And do you see me laughing?

338
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,673
Perhaps you have no sense
of humor, sir.

339
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,557
Since you do not start, eh Bogaert.

340
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,074
You guys do a game with me, eh.
And you play with ...

341
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,196
Fire.
- With fire, yes.

342
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
And you play with ...
- Fire.

343
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,795
Cant you take a joke?

344
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,792
You have to defend yourself, boy.
You have to guard yourself. Weapons.

345
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,798
<i> My arms. A death cross. </ I>

346
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,157
In <i> Archlord pay you </ i>
<i> 350 gold. </ I>

347
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,319
If we just knew,
Them. Did we 't but conscience.

348
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,993
But what had they done?

349
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,716
You see it arrive each year.
You see it arrive every time.

350
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,159
Every evening you sit on your bare knees
And you prays that it may well just pass.

351
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,596
And that is usually the case.
But yes ...

352
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,393
This time, we certainly
skipped a prayer .

353
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,670
You know the outcome.
And we know it now.

354
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,310
I know only that the school
never again will be the same.

355
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,630
Hi. Eh ... Ben X.

356
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,676
I know you are not real,
But I know you very well.

357
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,752
I would only say:

358
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,469
What counts in a game, also counts here.

359
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,158
You can not <i> endgame </ i> play
Without your <i> healer </ i>, and that's me. Right?

360
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,198
I am worried about you.

361
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,957
I take the train tomorrow
Arriving at 10.22.

362
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,557
And I know that you will be there.
You have never missed an appointment.

363
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,517
So, until tomorrow.

364
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,474
Hi, Marsman.
- Hi, Benny Boy.

365
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,430
How are you? You are so tense.

366
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,793
We go a on them.
- If you have that in that crazy head.

367
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,150
The <i> bus. My bus. </ I>
<i> My bus - all of which drive away. </ I>

368
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,037
Small is beautiful among the trees.
Here we are on the bench.

369
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,872
Friends among themselves.

370
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,630
You have to relax, said Beard.
And Beard is right.

371
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,076
Hey. What's that?
- What a watch.

372
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,118
You are spoiled.

373
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,714
Not so aggressive.
Not like last time.

374
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,917
You know what it is.
- We are friends.

375
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,640
You know what happens then.
- Quiet, Desmet.

376
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,677
We are friends among each other.

377
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,833
Jesus, you are really mad.

378
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,515
Relax.

379
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,956
<i> Got your cell phone? Call if there is something</ i>.
<i> Yes, mama. </ I>

380
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,157
Benny, we are friends, eh.
True or not?

381
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,873
Hey, what is that?

382
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,189
ET, phone home.
- A Nokia 3250. Damn.

383
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,793
What do you mean?

384
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,713
You cannot talk,
How can you phone?

385
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,748
What would he do with it?
- SMS  to his mother.

386
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,353
SMS? Look.
Here, you must look.

387
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,910
An MMS ...
Who's that?

388
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,556
Frankenstein has a baby.
- Scarlite.

389
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,518
Shes called Scarlite.
- Let's see.

390
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,715
He has a girlfriend.

391
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,475
Hey, which looks not bad.
- Definitely not.

392
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,918
What counts in a game, also counts here.

393
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,554
You can not <i> endgame </ i> play
Without your <i> healer ...</ i>

394
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,633
Your <i> healer? </ I> ls it your <i> healer? </ I>

395
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,828
Dealer.
- Incredibly.

396
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,391
I take the train tomorrow
Arriving 10.22.

397
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,997
Tomorrow at 10.22 hours,
At the station on the platform.

398
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,630
We will also, Desmet eh?
We have to see this.

399
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,236
Our best friend has a date.
We must see this.

400
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,197
True or not?

401
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,789
Telephone, phone, Benny.

402
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,159
They call him too. It's Mommy.
Mommy. Hi, Mommy.

403
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,150
I am in the park with my friends.
Speak your message after the beep.

404
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,153
Hey, Mommy. Oops, voicemail.

405
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,992
Ben, lets hear everything.

406
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,352
If you do not suffer from that gestalk?
Do you not boring, Benny Boy?

407
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,239
Is that not annoying,
Always that gezeik your ma?

408
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,188
Will I keep your phone but,
Benny Boy? What do you think?

409
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,397
Ho, ho. With a crucifix stillet.
- You are really crazy.

410
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,796
Hè, Benny and telephone. It's Mommy.
Please do not rely on?

411
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,155
It is Mommy, you will recall.
Well?

412
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,595
Come on, Ben. Call back.

413
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,599
Benny Boy.
You are a damn marsman.

414
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,716
We can no longer take this.

415
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,111
And then to remember that we
Had a gift for you.

416
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,635
That we just
Our best friends.

417
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,031
It is a small pill,
But 't have a big impact.

418
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,875
That is why they call Superman.
Open your mouth.

419
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,555
There is a smiley for people
like you who can not laugh. Pull?

420
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,433
A little water to flush.

421
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,716
And then you feel just Superman.

422
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,990
So. And swallow.

423
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,596
The first one is free
Because you are our friend.

424
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,399
Next time you pay.
It will be good for you. Really.

425
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,393
Not so aggressive next time.
Here.

426
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,552
Then you know what time 't as you again
Going to click against that thick.

427
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,913
This is not true.

428
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,230
Godammit.

429
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,514
This is not true.
Please, please.

430
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,671
Mama, what is that?

431
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,238
Nothing, son. Nothing.

432
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,999
Come on, we are going to find your brother.

433
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,758
Goddammit.

434
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,075
Damn.

435
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,552
Goddammit.

436
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,079
Goddam ...

437
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,676
...mit.

438
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,552
Where are you?

439
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,033
Ben ...

440
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,473
Feel it.

441
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,398
Feel it, Ben.

442
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,757
You must learn to feel good
You learn to feel good.

443
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,517
What is it, boy? What happened?
Is it?

444
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,557
Do you see yourself.

445
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,713
Is it?
What has happened to you?

446
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,958
It is a good boy, but come.

447
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,956
It is nothing, mama. People say
That always: It's nothing.

448
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,274
I am healed. Really, cured.
Completely healed.

449
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,151
It is good, boy.
- Your big brother is Superman.

450
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,189
Calm, Ben. We go home.
Thats enough.

451
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,318
There is water out of your eyes, mama.

452
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,190
There is really water from your eyes,
But I know that is salt and wet.

453
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,635
Salt and wet.

454
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,233
People say that I do not get
feelings because I do not get it ...

455
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,472
But I could.
I know ...

456
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,155
Do you remember when I was little
I always ...

457
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,472
Back the tears trying to stop.

458
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,155
This was simply because I did not want
you sad.

459
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,308
It is, mama. People say
Always thats it, and then ask them:

460
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,190
Is it?
And then they say: Yes, yes.

461
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:59,549
Yes, it's good. It is good.
Its going forward. Its going forward.

462
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,757
It is good, you say.
Really, it does.

463
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,879
But I am not crazy.
- No.

464
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,278
I am just a bit difficult.
Yes, difficult, which I am.

465
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,639
But I am used to train, mama.
Really, I am training.

466
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:24,790
I am broken. But I am reborn,
As in a video game.

467
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,873
There will also give a new life.
- Come on, son. We'll go home. Come on.

468
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,117
<i> And now it is worked out ...</ i>
<i> I was. </ I>

469
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,794
<i> Eyes open again. </ I>
Head <i> closed again. </ I>

470
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,039
What's that, Ben?

471
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,800
Why did you not tell me that?

472
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,230
<i> Then came the truth. </ I>
The <i> zwaarheid. The raarheid </ i>.

473
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,277
Who has done this?

474
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,432
Say, Ben.

475
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,593
<i> Everything can be destroyed so soon really. </ I>

476
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,315
<i> Everything can be destroyed so soon </ i>.

477
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,515
<i> Why could I not also destroy? </ I>

478
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,633
Stop, Ben. Stop.

479
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,558
Jonas, go.

480
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,277
Here. Jonas ...

481
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,712
<i> And when I saw that dick, that zero </ i>
<i> There again. </ I>

482
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,314
<i> And I went to tackle him. </ I>

483
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,077
<i> I had a lot of thought. </ I>
<i> The fall of the night. </ I>

484
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,754
<i> Go to the end of the pain. </ I>

485
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,433
What  <i> blood can be nice </ i>.

486
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,949
<i> And even later ... Was my father. </ I>

487
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,917
Ben, Ben, son.

488
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,274
<i> My Dad </ i>.

489
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,518
<i> He never know what he should say. </ I>

490
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,355
So i usually know how he feels.

491
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,474
<i> She was also coming </ i>.

492
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,430
<i> Sabine, his girlfriend, </ i>
<i> As he said </ i>.

493
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,353
<i> They always asked whether with me ...</ i>
<i> Went </ i>.

494
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,158
Is it?

495
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,632
For example, which is no more.
- No, Sabine. For example, that no longer exists, no.

496
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,997
Yet it will be.
It will still need, Sabine.

497
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,197
It is not the first time
And 't will not be the last.

498
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,989
Come, Sabine. It is good.
It is good.

499
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,548
Care for him.

500
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,190
<i> The endgame </ i>.

501
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,478
The <i> end, the end, the end, the end. </ I>

502
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,912
<i> The endgame </ i>.

503

00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,194
<i> Then you will be there. Then you are ready. </ I>

Even <i> 42 down. </ I>

<i> And death is life. </ I>

<i> I have to go to the station. </ I>

512
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,392
I have to go to the station.

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,195
<i> Quietly, quietly, Ben. </ I>

514
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,155
On the road
No worries

515
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,514
Will I <i> take your phone, Benny Boy? </ I>

516
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,115
<i> The station ... The station. </ I>

517
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,675
<i> 10.22 hours at the station. </ I>
<i> So here we go, eh, Desmet? </ I>

518
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,359
<i> We must see </ i>.

519
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,556
<i> They can not. Too late. </ I>

520
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,191
<i> And those who might be there. Those who do not know </ i>
<i> How I look, who I am. </ I>

521
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,631
<i> That I am not. And they did. </ I>

522
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,469
<i> But I knew ...</ i>
<i> I would find it </ i>.

523
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,359
<i> I would smell her. </ I>
<i> If I was the dog. </ I>

524
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,469
<i> There ... She was </ i>.

525
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,079
She was <i>. </ I>

526
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,951
<i> Genuine </ i>.

527
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,031
<i> In real life </ i>.

528
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,155
She waited <i> </ i>.

529
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,158
For <i> me. </ I>

530
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,516
And they <i> sms'ed </ i>.
Probably <i> to me. </ I>

531
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,159
<i> And then everything went very quickly, </ i>
<i> As they say. </ I>

532
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,518
<i> But everything always goes too fast for me. </ I>
<i> She went away. </ I>

533
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,793
<i> Because I was not there. </ I>
<i> The man who they do not see </ i>.

534
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,598
<i> But what my head could not, </ i>
<i> My legs could do. </ I>

535
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,198
<i> That is the train. </ I>

536
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,478
<i> A spacecraft that is that our </ i>
<i> pick up on a barren planet. </ I>

537
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,671
Everything is <i> dare </ i>.

538
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,992
To <i> do what you can not do. </ I>

539
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,273
<i> Her smell was enough. </ I>

540
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,996
<i> The scent of a spice </ i>
<i> that still had to be invented. </ I>

541
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,834
A continent <i> </ i>
<i> Still to be discovered ...</ i>

542
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,118
<i> But I could smell already  </ i>
<i> kilometers of outside the coast  </ i>.

543
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,911
<i> With her perfect neck to me </ i>
<i> Saturday they 'n landscape dreams. </ I>

544
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,153
<i> And I ... I suggested to me how I </ i>
<i> would plant my lips...</ i>

545
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,474
<i> As a flag. </ I>
<i> The flag of my liberation. </ I>

546
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,039
<i> So just sit here </ i>
<i> In the warmth of her body. </ I>

547
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,191
<i> Very even, suddenly perfect. </ I>

548
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,318
The next station is Brussels.
We arrive within ...

549
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,189
Hey, how are you?

550
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,431
Now <i> time for something. </ I>
<i> Just say something. </ I>

551
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,353
<i> But nothing is all I am saying. </ I>

552
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,830
<i> I only know the lonley way </ i>.

553
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,119
<i> And she went away. </ I>

554
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,278
Just <i> gone. </ I>

555
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,992
<i> And I had also just gone. </ I>

556
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,513
I was really scared.
A mother feels something.

557
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,390
Well hundred times per second, I
Thought: Please Do not stoms.

558
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,597
If he now please
But nothing doms.

559
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,637
I remember well that he 'n once asked:

560
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,958
How many reasons does a man need
to commit suicide?

561
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,350
I said: What?
Yes, that what he said.

562
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,592
Are those two, five, ten?

563
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,153
Since he was doing.
To know whether he is tired.

564
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,230
<i> The endgame. My plan </ i>.
<i> The plan of a word. </ I>

565
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,190
<i> Murder. The murder of myself. </ I>
The train <i>. </ I>

566
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,239
To <i> nowhere more. </ I>

567
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,754
<i> There is an advantage to suicide. </ I>

568
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,310
You dont have to seek the 
<i> victim </ i> very far..

569
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,189
<i> You do not even attempt to do it. </ I>
<i> The train had it arranged. </ I>

570
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,999
<i> What was his motive? </ I>
<i> A locomotive </ i>.

571
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,437
If you think that it goes quickly ...
That is really not the case.

572
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,389
Even if you have the good fortune
that you are immediately beheaded ...

573
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,315
Then it still that your head have
13 to 15 seconds of consciousness.

574
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,513
You can imagine that youre
not really have nice thoughts.

575
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,433
If you look at the rest of your limbs
flying around.

576
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,590
They say
You just before you die ...

577
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,070
The movie of your life
passes before your eyes.

578
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,310
And? Did it?

579
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,631
But who has ...
- Who has been pushed?

580
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,878
I of course. Who else?
Sufferd.

581
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,073
You?

582
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,553
And he has no notable scars
Or a birthmark or something?

583
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,472
Scars?

584
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,836
That was already destroyed sure?

585
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,115
And did you notice something odd out?

586
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,996
I dont get it, Ben.

587
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,199
Really.

588
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,355
Are you the man from the dungeon <i> </ i>
Silancium of escaped?

589
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,348
That alone with me the desert
Of Windrill is extended?

590
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,032
Those who fought with Bailor.

591
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,839
With me by the marshes
Of Ondekon is drawn.

592
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,831
Zerdin has reports.

593
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,949
You are 80 level, damn.

594
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,790
And so is your <i> endgame? </ I>

595
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,430
Stomweg simply
For the train jump.

596
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,672
Was that your plan?

597
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,916
Even a <i> exit. </ I> A <i> log out. </ I>

598
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:34,593
'On the road. No worries. '
Well, it is surely good news?

599
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,991
That is to say that he is just a road
And you do not have to be worried.

600
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,470
My son does not do that,
Just go away on Saturday morning.

601
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,710
Hes not even allowed to leave.

602
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,391
And indeed, look,
I have found this.

603
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,433
It is a perfect day to throw back your head
and kiss it all goodbye

604
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,636
101 ways
to kill yourself

605
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,080
I do not know if you know, Ben ...

606
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:16,630
In real life ...
Dying is quite final.

607
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,909
You can not imagine.

608
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,355
You may be dying.

609
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,992
But not in real life.

610
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,359
So we should not play, Ben.
You, level 80.

611
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,153
Do you want away from this world, Ben?
Now go away.

612
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,675
But if you want to take revenge, Ben,
Wreek you then.

613
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,917
Because otherwise you just
What they can say. A loser.

614
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,878
Play to win, Ben.

615
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,751
Everything is planning.
Everything is strategy.

616
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,431
Keep your true of Fanta?

617
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,316
I am so happy.

618
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,433
That you you are you.

619
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:42,957
Well, we shall him nationwide
As missing.

620
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,913
And this?
What are you going to do?

621
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,277
I will contact
With social workers.

622
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,637
They know that only too well.
Too bad.

623
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,834
"I wanted the only way," he said.

624
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,828
'But I dared not as good death
Because I did not know what that was. "

625
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,354
Was that your big plan?

626
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,473
How do we do it?

627
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,157
Are we poison?

628
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,995
No. Imagine that youve taken your
poison and and it in your body.

629
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,913
Then you call 911, poison department.
"Hello?"  "Baaaarf!"

630
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:35,149
The people there
always get that kind of calls.

631
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,233
That is really something for stomkoppen.

632
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,150
You can also hang yourself.

633
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,353
That is really tough. Then your appearance
is like to obtain an enormous erection.

634
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,713
But you yourself has shitted yourself.

635
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,031
That's not so cool
to be found this way, eh.

636
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,233
You know, Ben, furthermore ...

637
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,316
What they found under the fingernails
someone who has hung?

638
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,996
All small bits of rope and sheet.

639
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,270
And do you know why that is?

640
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,991
That's because they desperately try
to get that rope of their neck

641
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,995
And that succeeds or not. Because the seat
Is too far and they can not.

642
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,955
Ben, you find it exciting, eh?

643
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,031
Dying.

644
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,997
Dying.

645
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,312
Everything is in one time.
Ben is in one time.

646
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,958
Would you do not have to look one time
See if there is a different solution?

647
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,429
Not even one time around.

648
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,792
You should damn it
be a little more creative, Ben.

649
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,393
Obligation and beauty.

650
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,954
You are so beautiful.

651
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,279
<i> A guild together, she said. </ I>
<i> As Archlord </ i>.

652
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,190
<i> It was her idea. There are quests </ i>
<i> Which are too large for two. </ I>

653
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,156
'You must help me,' he said.

654
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,471
And we have helped him.

655
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,873
We knew that everybody would say:
There is nothing you can do.

656
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,510
But that is more or less
what i have done.

657
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,354
You may not smoke, Sabrina.
- It is' Sabine '.

658
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,716
You should be thankful
That you should not smoke.

659
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,432
Yes, I am incredibly grateful.
Another half-day to live longer.

660
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,196
That does not really believe you.
That does not really go?

661
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,239
You see it yourself that this is not possible.
I cannot.

662
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,152
Sabine, you have absolutely nothing.

663
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:12,519
You wanted the necessarily account.
I made no difference.

664
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,879
But if you think that its us
Easy, you have it wrong.

665
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,439
Watch.

666
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,313
The sea.

667
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,918
The end of the world.

668
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,550
And you know what they say, eh Ben?

669
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,790
Each end is a beginning.

670
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,428
Does someone want something to eat? Ben?

671
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,909
Sabine?
- No, please do not.

672
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,470
Dont you feel good, Sabine?
- Not really, no.

673
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,515
Ben, are you sure?
Is this what you want?

674
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,999
Good.

675
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,674
Ben ... I would ...

676
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,073
<i> I have me ... Committed </ i>.

677
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:46,235
<i> Everything is thought </ i>.
<i> And for thinking </ i>.

678
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,756
<i> Everything is willpower. </ I>

679
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,471
Everything is <i> dare </ i>.

680
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:20,952
Eventually <i> still do </ i>
<i> What you cannot do. </ I>

681
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:49,511
<i> If you die in a game, </ i>
<i> You are just gone. </ I>

682
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,150
<i> And you have to give your own body </ i>
<i> Back to searching. </ I>

683
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,716
<i> The only thing they took from me, </ i>
<i> Was a tape. </ I>

684
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,794
<i> And I ... I was gone. </ I>

685
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,555
<i> These are particularly poignant images </ i>
<i> Who remind us ...</ i>

686
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,110
<i> That every week a young Flemish </ i>
<i> takes his life </ i>.

687
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:32,229
<i> According to recent studies, 10 percent </ i>
<i> of all Flemish youth ...</ i>

688
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,870
<i> Ever indicate a suicide thought. </ i>


689
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,396
<i> A very frightening figure. </ I>

690
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,030
<i> Sport then.  At the tournament ...</ i>

691
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,555
Dear attendees.

692
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,193
Dear family ...

693
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,031
Ladies and gentlemen ...

694
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,556
Ladies and gentlemen,
Girls and boys.

695
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,838
We are meeting here this afternoon
To say farewell to ...

696
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,596
Of a very special young man.

697
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:10,677
Who we miss
And very tragically ...

698
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,558
..has died.

699
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,871
Ben has never been easy.

700
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:23,310
With the condition that he had - 
It has made his life difficult.

701
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,712
Perhaps we realize now,
Too late then ...

702
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:39,355
that he struggled with this disability,
We will say.

703
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,990
And that this was worse
than we can think.

704
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,119
Because there is never
a real contact.

705
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,755
And now even more will be.

706
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,232
We can today only
Accept ...

707
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:59,794
That some things simply
too heavy to bear.

708
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,916
Therefore family ...

709
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,709
Hello.

710
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,194
Thank you for coming.

711
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:15,879
I also died,
As they say.

712
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,550
dead to myself.

713
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,951
Best to-people and fellows ...

714
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,873
My fight has stopped.

715
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:38,798
At the end of your life you see the movie
of your life as well, they say.

716
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,988
Here are a few scenes
Which you may find interesting.

717
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,189
Ben, come on. Now. <i> The endgame </ i>.

718
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,550
<i> Creative death, they called it. </ I>

719
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,996
Suicide <i> without the murder. </ I>

720
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:36,759
Dying without <i> a way to go </ i>
<i> Or leave without death. </ I>

721
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,471
<i> I have everything to learn. </ I>

722
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,189
But the main <i> </ i>
<i> I was forgotten. </ I>

723
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,477
<i> Learning lie </ i>.

724
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,312
<i> Faking </ i>.

725
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,071
There was a death first.

726
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,915
Otherwise you were probably not show up.

727
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,436
For a boy
Simply bullied.

728
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,592
And at a certain point, you can not
Continue to cry out and ask ...

729
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,988
Mama, as evil.

730
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:28,914
And even 's questions whether now please
Anything can happen.

731
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,594
That finally would stop.

732
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,710
That they would finally stop
bullying my son.

733
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,714
And his life as ...

734
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,873
Sorry, but it was really true.
His life as impossible.

735
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:50,033
His autism is his problem,
But for him it's no problem.

736
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,158
They are the others.
That is the problem. Others.

737
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,718
They have to learn my small
Alone casting.

738
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,077
Ben simply wanted to go.
Now he's gone.

739
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,551
And fortunately he was still alive.

740
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,512
He lives.

741
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,152
In his own world, perhaps,
But he still lives. He still lives.

742
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,357
His life.

743
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,475
Let it happen, Ben.

744
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,158
Do not be afraid.

745
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,235
If you want to feel good,
You have to learn to feel good.

746
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,799
Caress him.

747
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,075
<i> I have never been happy. </ I>

748
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:11,360
<i> But I have never been so</ i>
<i> Happy. </ I>

749
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,710
Nice, eh.
Animals do not have to talk.

750
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,118
Are you not allowed to mount?
Held on socks.

751
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:33,389
There is always something ... People see
A horse and want out.

752
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,519
But these animals have
There is not asked?

753
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,994
Do you not?

754
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:45,716
Because if you can choose to only ...

755
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,116
Oh yes ...
