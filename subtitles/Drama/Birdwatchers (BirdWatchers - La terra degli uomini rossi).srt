1
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,275
Janek!

2
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,998
Here I am, Baron von Essenbeck.

3
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,475
Get to it.

4
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,711
Come on, rub hard.

5
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,869
Have they all arrived?

6
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,076
Not all of them, sir.

7
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,473
Who's missing?

8
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,232
Mr. Bruckmann and Lieut. Aschenbach
who are coming from Oberhausen.

9
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,719
And the old man? Baron Joachim?

10
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,068
Come on! Speak!

11
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,800
The baron is in his apartment.

12
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,550
He's getting ready for dinner,
Iike everyone eIse.

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,394
What about my son?

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,994
Can't you hear him?

15
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,434
Gunther? Gunther?

16
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,872
What do you want, Thilde?

17
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,995
Come!

18
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,791
Come and see.

19
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,472
What?

20
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,595
Look!

21
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,839
It's the same as Iast year, ThiIde.

22
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,272
Yes, but then I was a spectator,
this year it's different.

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,074
I hope I don't forget my Iines.

24
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,393
It'II be a great debut. Tomorrow,
your name wiII be in the papers.

25
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,794
That's fine. Thank you.

26
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,790
With all these compromises
we'll lose even our chairs.

27
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,555
Yes, dear.

28
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,957
I'm nearIy ready.

29
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,077
You know Uncle Joachim insists on
punctuality, especially tonight.

30
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,639
Will you give me a hand?

31
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,152
Darling, if you won't stay still...

32
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,674
Thanks. One can't always say yes.
They're not reasonable people.

33
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,876
They're never satisfied.

34
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,553
Uncle Joachim's been at the helm
over 40 years...ensuring balance.

35
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,997
Balance is the right word.

36
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,718
A courtesy to the Liberals,
another to the National Socialists.

37
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,996
A favour to me, one to Konstantin.

38
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,234
You're unfair. Uncle's never had
any time for that fellow.

39
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,833
Because he's a snob. If HitIer were
not the son of a maid...

40
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,359
...he would have sided with him.

41
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,274
But he's always listened to you and
has never financed the Nazis.

42
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,396
Only because he's too mean.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,708
What about the girls?

44
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,431
They're going to surprise everyone.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,795
They must be very nervous.

46
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,515
Let's go.

47
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,795
Thank you.

48
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,232
Come on, Herbert.

49
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,953
...a blessing too that will make
this birthday happy

50
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,794
and the year just right for you.

51
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,075
On this speciaI night I'II sing
these words to Iet you see...

52
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,469
...having you for a grandfather
is a joy and blessing for me.

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,513
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

54
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,069
Thank you. Come here.

55
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,559
Very best wishes for your birthday.

56
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,068
Let me give you a kiss. Thank you.

57
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,515
And thank you, Sweetheart.
My IittIe Erika.

58
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,435
Happy birthday, sir.

59
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,595
Janek!

60
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,918
Do you hear the two of them?

61
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,995
Yes.

62
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,313
Since birth, she's been told she's
the most intelligent, the richest,

63
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,631
the most enviable.
She's Baroness Von Essenbeck.

64
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,599
Can I ask her to become
pIain Mrs Bruckmann?

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,153
The wife of an executive of the
factories that carry her name?

66
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,319
You're too hard on yourself. Uncle
Joachim trusts you.. No-one makes

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,994
decisions without your approvaI.

68
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,591
Isn't that aIready something?

69
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,116
Yes, but not enough for Sophie.

70
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,318
It's true I've gone up the Iadder,
but I'm stiII an empIoyee of hers.

71
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,634
If we decided to marry, I'd Iose
the baron's trust and friendship.

72
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,596
He wants Sophie to stay
the inconsolable widow of his son.

73
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,916
Idiot!

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,799
He'd probably fire me.

75
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:28,392
You're wrong. Today, not even he
with his slaves, his millions...

76
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,474
...his castles is powerful enough to
exclude you. Power's in our hands.

77
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,879
And we want you where you are.

78
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,789
Or higher up the Iadder.

79
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,075
Am I to steaI Herbert's job?

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,637
The fact Herbert has to go is
an open secret.

81
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,958
His hostility towards Nazism
is extremely evident.

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,391
But Konstantin...

83
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,390
Do you think he's so important?

84
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,956
He's in the SA.

85
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,319
He's very close to Röhm.

86
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,393
Our industry needs
men Iike you.

87
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,955
And our chancellor has a soft spot
for large industries.

88
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,072
Anyhow, I wasn't
taIking about Konstantin.

89
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,798
...having you for a grandfather
is a joy and blessing for me..

90
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,636
Do you think they'II do an encore?

91
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,399
More than one. But don't
dare ask them!

92
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,438
Well, I'll have to do without.

93
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,313
You were very good, Thilde.
Sit here with me. Again, thank you.

94
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,189
The governess was good too. Thanks!

95
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,474
Very good.

96
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,795
You're setting yourself limits.

97
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,308
You're not ambitious, just a sociaI
cIimber. Sophie wouIdn't approve.

98
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,909
You worry about Herbert and
Konstantin, but there's someone...

99
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,793
...more important: Joachim.

100
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,238
Today, in Germany, anything can
happen and we've barely started.

101
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,395
Private morality is dead. We the
elect can do as we please.

102
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,391
They're Hitler's words.
You too should think them over.

103
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,837
Tonight, for example.

104
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,952
Well done, Gunther.
You played splendidly. Thank you.

105
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,155
I know you couIdn't care Iess but
your son has a taIent for music.

106
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,789
Good evening.

107
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,792
- Good evening - - Good evening -

108
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,716
Excuse me. I'm wanted on the phone.

109
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,631
Spring arrives, the sparrow sings,
I'm in Iove, but with whom?

110
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,469
I don't care whether he's rich
because Iove is enough for me.

111
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,915
Guys, this evening I'm going to
choose myseIf a reaI man.

112
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,950
Guys, I'm fed up with boys.
I want a reaI man.

113
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,711
A man with a burning heart
and fire Iighting up his eyes.

114
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,635
A man who can and still wants
to kiss. A real man.

115
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,070
There are men who are thin, fat,
big, small and stout.

116
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,556
Handsome, elegant, shy or bold.

117
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,469
His face is not important,
I'II choose one anyway.

118
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,875
Guys, this evening I'm going to
choose myseIf a reaI man.

119
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,319
Guys, I'm fed up with boys,
I want a reaI man.

120
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,597
Quiet, please!.

121
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,994
The Reichstag is on fire.

122
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:33,550
A man with a burning heart
and fire Iighting up his eyes.

123
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,070
Quiet, please! I said, quiet!

124
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,874
The fire started half an hour ago.

125
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,393
It's a conspiracy, but the person
responsibIe has been arrested.

126
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,189
A Dutchman enrolled
in the Communist party.

127
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,912
A Communist, of course.

128
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,238
Another Communist crime
against the new government.

129
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,398
Shit!

130
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,716
Couldn't they choose another day
to burn down the Reichstag?

131
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,792
They spoiled your birthday.

132
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,799
It was my headquarters
in BerIin.

133
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,789
They haven't put out the fire yet.

134
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,709
And the Berliners are enjoying
the show from their balconies.

135
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,471
I can't stay here. Maybe the SA
have been caIIed back to barracks.

136
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,111
Calm down, Konstantin,
the coup d'état has failed.

137
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,400
Up till now, your battle station
has never been Berlin.

138
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,077
If they've aIready found the
conspirators, it means...

139
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,158
The conspiracy's only a pretext.

140
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,397
That's an arbitrary statement.

141
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,439
Herbert's statements are
always arbitrary.

142
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,436
It's a provocation that can come
onIy from anti-government sources.

143
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,633
Your chancellor has no use
for government.

144
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,718
Herbert, please!

145
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,989
Everyone knows about
the proscription Iists.

146
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,557
They're used to crush opponents
while Europe looks on.

147
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,110
Europe isn't interested in
Iaw and order inside Germany.

148
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,910
Law and order that allows the
killing of people in their homes?

149
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,151
Herbert, please!

150
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,517
Goering has sworn revenge against
the enemies of the Third Reich.

151
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,234
You're Iosing your head, Herbert.

152
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,274
Goering was referring to
Communists. Are you one of them?

153
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,796
Today, it's their turn. Tomorrow?

154
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,957
Don't worry about tomorrow. Someone
in Berlin is taking care of things.

155
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,479
Well said, cousin Sophie.

156
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,993
Our only worry should be
celebrating Uncle's birthday.

157
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,998
Even if this is an evening
out of the ordinary.

158
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,793
No, no, Martin, no.

159
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:46,631
I've been wanting to make the
foIIowing speech for a Iong time.

160
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,791
The dramatic events that have taken
place in the last few hours...

161
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,716
...force me to overcome
any hesitation and uncertainty..

162
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,471
...and speak to you clearly.

163
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,871
In aII these years,
I've had one aim onIy.

164
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,151
To uphold the unity and prestige
of our firm.

165
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,879
That's why I have acted so that
our work and our structures...

166
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,999
...could adapt each time
to changing circumstances.

167
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:40,717
In war time, in peace time
and in the foIIowing crisis.

168
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,153
Now, in the Iight of recent
dramatic events...

169
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,149
...I feeI it more necessary than ever
to protect our steeIworks...

170
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,989
...from any possible
political pressure.

171
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,476
Or even more serious risks.

172
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,955
You must acknowledge that I have
never backed the present regime.

173
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,393
And as you all know,
I have never had...

174
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,154
...nor wish to have any contact
with a certain gentleman.

175
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,954
Despite this, in the interests of
the firm, we must...

176
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,313
...keep up daily contact
with those people.

177
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,629
That's why I feeI it's essentiaI
to have at my side a man...

178
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,909
...accepted by the regime...
who can guarantee for us...

179
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,795
I'm ready to give notice,
if that's what you want.

180
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:07,072
I'm forced to do this, Herbert
with regret and without conviction.

181
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,510
But the steelworks...

182
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,957
Come first, right or wrong.
That's your creed.

183
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,277
You even sent your son to his death
to be able to say that the...

184
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,318
...Essenbecks bring into the world
and bury cannons and offspring...

185
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,271
...with the same feeling.

186
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,155
Excuse me..

187
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,394
Congratulations, Konstantin. You'll
be the vice-chairman we deserve.

188
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,235
Let's go, Herbert, please.

189
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,149
I hope I don't foIIow in the
footsteps of my predecessor.

190
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,555
Right, Friedrich?

191
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,230
Guys, this evening I'm going to
choose myseIf a reaI man.

192
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,950
Guys, I'm fed up with boys,
I want a reaI man.

193
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,229
Aschenbach would stab me in the
back if he stood to gain from it.

194
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,475
But not this time. He's on
our side, Sophie.

195
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,431
Herbert's right. It was they who
burned down the Reichstag.

196
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm sure Aschenbach aIready knew
what was going to happen.

197
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,078
He talked of us two, of
Joachim, the steelworks.

198
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,996
But in actuaI fact, he was teIIing
me something quite different.

199
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,952
That tonight, I'd be given an
extraordinary opportunity...

200
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,759
...I couId either take or Ieave.

201
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,314
To side with them or oppose them.

202
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,433
Don't you see, Sophie?

203
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,592
They can't have put Joachim
on the proscription Iists.

204
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,998
Herbert, perhaps.
Probably, Herbert.

205
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,959
Tonight, great things will happen.

206
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,112
The Iosers wiII be those who stay
on the sideIines. It's as if...

207
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,719
...they'd offered me a position of
trust and if I accept, I seize...

208
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,316
...the opportunity, I'II have
their heIp in exchange.

209
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,597
And there'II be no more Herberts.

210
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,595
Or Konstantins, or Joachims.

211
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,316
I'II be the onIy one in charge.

212
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,956
I'II make aII the decisions...

213
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,317
...with you at my side, Sophie.

214
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,953
So, what have you decided to do?

215
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,870
It'd be the first time I made
a decision without consuIting you.

216
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,629
I'II heIp you, even though I can
never push you hard enough.

217
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,152
Stay the course to the bitter end!

218
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,630
None of them is worth half of you.

219
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,232
You were right to always say yes,
but now you have to make them pay.

220
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,275
Herbert has always pushed
you aside and Joachim...

221
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,072
...has humiliated you, but Konstantin
is the worst of the lot.

222
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,510
Don't be afraid, Friedrich.

223
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,239
I'm not afraid.

224
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,716
There's just one thing.

225
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,231
Keep your son happy...

226
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,948
...so I can do what I must.

227
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,390
I'II take care of Martin.

228
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,317
I know exactIy what he Iikes.

229
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
He has no sense of value.

230
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,959
The steelworks or a new Rolls
are worth the same to him.

231
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,477
We'II throw him the bait.
Leave it up to me.

232
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,156
Boo!

233
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,639
I won!

234
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,676
Where's Erika?

235
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,513
Come out, Erika! We've won.

236
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,591
Erika where are you?

237
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,269
Here I am.

238
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,952
There you are, you IittIe sIyboots!
Come! Now it's your turn.

239
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,196
Put you hands over your eyes and
count to 100 out Ioud.

240
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,635
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14...

241
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,951
Erika, come!

242
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,591
Pour yourself a drink. This
discussion's over. Go on!

243
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,879
I don't want to Ieave schooI.

244
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,632
You'II Ieave that fiIthy den.
I'II drag you out if necessary.

245
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,996
And I'II puII you with me into the
steeIworks. I guarantee...

246
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,152
...that in ten years, you'II take
over and throw me out.

247
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,797
I'II smash your ceIIo over your
head if you don't understand this.

248
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,790
You're just Iike your mother,
with the same deIicate stomach.

249
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,153
She's never wanted to
set foot in the factory.

250
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,071
The heat from the furnaces
makes her dizzy.

251
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,758
Listen, Father, I've decided...

252
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,308
Only I can decide for you.

253
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,798
I know you can't stand me.

254
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,148
But I'm not asking you to
Iove me. On the contrary.

255
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,594
It's just that I don't intend to
keep the seat warm for Friedrich...

256
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,390
...and much Iess for Martin.

257
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,074
I'd rather naiI you to that seat
when the time comes.

258
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,913
Those bastards have poisoned your
brain, but as for your schooI...

259
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,956
...we'II smash it to pieces
with aII your damned books inside.

260
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,393
Gunther!

261
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,953
Erika!

262
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,956
Don't Iet her hear you. Do you want
her to find us straight away?

263
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,393
Come in.

264
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,388
Gunther?

265
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,070
Come in.

266
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,838
Yes? Very well.

267
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,072
As I thought, before daybreak
Herbert wiII be arrested.

268
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,708
Poor Herbert! To think we're
so near the border.

269
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,799
Is there a specific accusation?
So, he'II be tried.

270
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,997
I don't think such
formaIities are necessary.

271
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,228
We're concerned only with substance.

272
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,390
And the substance here is this.

273
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,472
Before the flames consuming
the Reichstag are put out...

274
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,950
...the champions of the old Germany
will be reduced to ashes.

275
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,630
However, a semblance of
legality may be useful...

276
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,955
...at times.

277
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,951
I'm tired and wouId Iike to retire.

278
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,235
Sophie...

279
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,195
Friedrich...

280
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,390
If you need me...

281
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,993
But sneaking away Iike thieves...

282
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,555
We're not the only ones, Elisabeth.

283
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,639
Every day people have to leave
home all over Europe.

284
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,795
We're Iucky. At Ieast we have
a pIace to go to.

285
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,399
We have friends.

286
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,999
How soon will we have to leave?

287
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,632
As soon as we've packed and handed
over to others in the factory.

288
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,791
It's aII over, Gunther.

289
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,310
And it's the fault of all of us,
mine too.

290
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,798
There's no point in raising your
voice when it's too Iate.

291
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,398
We've given Germany
a sick democracy.

292
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,956
The fear of a revolution that
would have put us in the hands...

293
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,157
...of the Left was too strong.
Now it's too Iate to do anything.

294
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,996
Nazism was created by us,
it started in our factories.

295
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,315
It was fed with our money.

296
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,638
You think I shouIdn't escape.

297
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,591
Maybe you feeI contempt for me.

298
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,719
No, Uncle Herbert. I...

299
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,955
We'II keep in touch, aII right?

300
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,996
Yes.

301
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,834
Still up, Erika? What's going on?

302
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,956
- Where's Thilde? - - I don't know.

303
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,391
Thilde? Where's she gone?

304
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:30,958
- Do you know? - - No.

305
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,511
You must go to bed straight away.
It's very Iate. ThiIde?

306
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,473
Herbert, they've come for you.
There's no time to Iose.

307
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,795
Elizabeth!

308
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,389
No, no!

309
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,236
You must escape, hurry!

310
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,148
You'd be crazy to take it with you.
I'II get rid of it. Now, go!

311
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,193
Please, Herbert, hurry!

312
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,873
Look after the girls.

313
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,315
Hurry, my Iove! Go, go!

314
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,159
Herbert, no, no, this way!

315
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,313
Open up! Open up!

316
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,517
Do you too recognise this gun?

317
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,389
Yes.

318
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,399
The weapon is recognised as
belonging to Herbert Thallman.

319
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,155
Are we to continue the inquiry?

320
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,794
The magistrate will take over.

321
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,398
Mr. Thallman took compromising
documents away with him.

322
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:08,073
Paperwork regarding the activities
of the steelworks that he can use.

323
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,194
Not in any concrete way.

324
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,229
Write: "To the Public Prosecutor...

325
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,399
...18th February, 1933.

326
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,190
Re: accusation of Herbert Thallman
fugitive from justice...

327
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,476
...for the 2nd degree murder of
Baron Joachim Von Essenbeck."

328
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,111
I know what you're feeIing, Martin.

329
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,996
But one can't take on
from one day to the next...

330
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,155
...a rôle of such
huge responsibility...

331
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,999
...without feeling a sense of ...

332
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,552
...consternation. But Friedrich and I
won't Ieave you on your own.

333
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,949
We were just saying you'II have
time to compIete your studies.

334
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,398
And to familiarise yourself with
problems concerning the firm.

335
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,597
They aren't simple, believe me.

336
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,151
Meanwhile, Friedrich and I
will keep the place going...

337
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,194
...as always in the past.

338
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,159
I never expected to become
chairman of the steeIworks...

339
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,954
...in such tragic circumstances.

340
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:28,236
But unfortunately, I'm
forced to do what...

341
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,676
Grandfather was right.

342
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,832
Nowadays, our firm...

343
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,791
I mean either we have government
approvaI or our business...

344
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,957
...our profits...

345
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,994
I know nothing of business or
poIitics, but one thing I do know.

346
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,116
That ours is a speciaI
kind of production.

347
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,915
That there are technicaI probIems.

348
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,993
Bravo! Well done!

349
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,955
A fine speech from the Throne!

350
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,399
But now, let's not overdo it.

351
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,312
Let's give this meeting
more of a family tone.

352
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,798
Joachim's intentions...

353
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,632
Please, Konstantin.

354
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,029
Martin hasn't finished.
He has something else to say.

355
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,196
Well, let's hear it.

356
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,278
I want to respect Grandfather's
wishes in every way.

357
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,989
He named you vice-chairman
and was right to do so.

358
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,870
But at a time Iike this...

359
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,399
...the chairman should be
.above all a technician.

360
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,994
What kind of a joke is this?

361
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,478
It's no joke; enormous sums
are invoIved here:

362
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,199
And Martin thinks...

363
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,715
It's the first time Martin has
thought with his own head.

364
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,233
I inherit the majority of the
shares so the decision is mine.

365
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,672
I name Friedrich Bruckmann
chairman of the board...

366
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,878
...and managing director
of the Essenbeck Steelworks

367
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,957
And of every other company
in partnership with the firm.

368
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,951
Friedrich Bruckmann I made you what
you are from the nobody you were.

369
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,630
Herbert's pistol,
Aschenbach's testimony...

370
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,796
...the arrivaI of the SS.

371
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,109
Perfect.

372
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,160
You have too much imagination.

373
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,992
You, come with me.

374
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,993
Today you've Iearned something
they don't teach at schooI.

375
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,389
Come on.

376
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,549
Don't get your hopes up.
This war has just started.

377
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,994
Gunther, get a move on!

378
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,679
To the first modeI.

379
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,270
Hoping to hear
its music soon.

380
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,394
Will this reception last long?

381
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,070
Your place is here, Martin,
you can't leave.

382
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,271
Fine, as you wish.

383
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,237
Mr. Bruckmann, you
are certainly aware...

384
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,909
I met your father on the
French front in 1916.

385
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,478
A true Essenbeck and
a heroic officer.

386
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,557
I know.

387
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,559
The Chiefs of Staff are adamant.
Either Röhm goes or we do.

388
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,397
It's bIackmaiI. The SA
represent a reaI threat.

389
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,960
Therefore we must prevent heavy
artillery ending up in their hands.

390
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,389
Is this your personaI opinion?

391
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,716
It's that of the Chiefs of Staff..

392
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,797
And especially of the Chancellor,
if you don't mind my saying so.

393
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,072
The army is the army,
the SA are the SA.

394
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,359
We're not involved in law
and order but don't want to share...

395
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,396
...our institutionaI duties.

396
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,596
InstitutionaI duties?

397
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:43,235
Where were the Prussian generals
while we were cleaning up Germany?

398
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,109
This country will never be clean
enough until...

399
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,956
No doubt about the SA's merits.

400
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,231
We wouldn't be here if it weren't
for the work of the SA.

401
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,794
Anyhow, heavy artillery isn't need
to maintain law and order.

402
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,396
Just Iook around you.

403
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,316
Germany is the most orderly country
in the world; American and English

404
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,960
...tourists Iove coming here.

405
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,717
What more do we want?

406
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,436
So we all agree.

407
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,997
Not one piece of heavy artillery
will leave this factory...

408
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,390
...unless requested
by the Chiefs of Staff.

409
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,752
Elections are coming up and
we must win them...

410
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,717
...if we want them to be the Iast.

411
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,315
But it will take a lot of money.

412
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,796
The Essenbeck steelworks is behind.

413
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,791
Joachim, with his stubbornness,
brought about this situation.

414
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,992
AII the other industriaIists have
paid their quota, whiIe you...

415
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,469
You can't allocate such large sums
without cooking the books.

416
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,156
This is a joint stock company.

417
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,954
And Konstantin could, in time,
become a problem

418
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,958
What I say is probIems
must aIways be soIved.

419
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,792
Don't you agree?

420
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,311
The state must crush even an
innocent flower if it's in the way.

421
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,192
I'm not the state.

422
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,439
I did what I was asked, but don't
want to be invoIved any more.

423
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:45,558
Don't always take me literally.
They're Hegel's words, not mine.

424
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,713
He'd turn in his grave if he
knew we were comparing...

425
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,553
...Konstantin to an innocent flower.

426
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,475
Do you mind if I...?
It's getting Iate.

427
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,791
Yes, do go Martin.

428
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,474
Thank you. Goodbye.

429
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,317
You'II have to answer for whatever
happens here, and don't forget it.

430
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,550
Hermannstrasse. Hurry!

431
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,910
The young Iady has gone out.

432
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,956
Yes, I know. Thank you.

433
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,870
...Germany, followed by hundreds
of Berlin party flags.

434
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,950
One after the other, the flags are
taken out of the sports complex...

435
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:52,998
...and are carried around
the town all night.

436
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:03,474
People all around, at the front and
the sides, great maxims for Germany.

437
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,951
Thomas and Heinrich Mann...

438
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,397
Walter Rathenau...

439
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,949
Erich Maria Remarque...

440
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,592
Arnold and Stefan Zweig...

441
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,231
André Gide...

442
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,719
Helen Keller...

443
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,318
Margaret Sanger...

444
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,719
Jack London...

445
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,597
George Bernard Shaw...

446
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,997
Emile Zola...

447
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,913
MarceI Proust.

448
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,950
Come on in.

449
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,953
I had to read it. I'm sorry.

450
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,072
I'm forced to do these things.

451
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,953
This comes from abroad.

452
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,796
Herbert Thallman is my uncle.

453
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,638
It's absurd that I can't receive...

454
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,840
If your uncIe had any common sense,
he wouIdn't write to you here.

455
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,468
Where's he supposed to write to me?

456
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,910
It's a pIea for heIp. That's cIear.

457
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,318
I don't want to know anything about
it, nor do I wish to discuss it.

458
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,958
I onIy want to avoid your dragging
my schooI into this affair.

459
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,150
In any case, I refuse to beIieve
what your uncIe has written.

460
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,119
May I go, sir?

461
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,952
You may, and get your hair
cut Von Essenbeck.

462
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,593
Yes, sir.

463
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,276
Yes, it's all here: application for
renewal, fee, revenue stamp.

464
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,638
Reason for the trip?

465
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,075
A vacation.

466
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,032
Are you going alone, Mrs Thallman?

467
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,998
With my daughters.

468
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,629
Thilde who's eleven.
Erika who's eight, is that correct?

469
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,076
Yes.

470
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,953
Do you plan to join your husband?

471
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,116
No.

472
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,549
No? You don't know where he is?

473
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,677
Would you like us to tell you?

474
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,957
I don't see what the difficuIty is.
I just want to Ieave.

475
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,471
Has someone caused you difficulty?

476
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,716
No, not really.

477
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,190
Are you aware your husband
is accused of murder?

478
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,998
It's absurd. It's sIander.

479
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,715
Then convince him to come back
so he can prove his innocence.

480
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,790
I don't know where he is. Why invoIve
me and the girIs? Are we suspects?

481
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,955
We just want to Ieave.

482
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,870
Are you being forced to Ieave?

483
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,195
No, they're preventing me from...

484
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,191
Who's preventing you, Mrs...?

485
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,390
Elisabeth Thallman.

486
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,954
Are you trying to imply something?

487
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,955
Answer, don't be afraid.

488
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,636
Good morning.

489
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,118
Your girlfriend isn't in.
She said she'd be back very late.

490
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,599
I heard you.

491
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,794
...wearing a purple cloak.

492
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:53,795
Who's the IittIe man
aII aIone in the wood?

493
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,399
With the purple cloak?

494
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,398
The IittIe man is standing in
the wood on one Ieg.

495
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,071
On his head, he has
a IittIe red hat.

496
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,391
Lisa, Iook what I've brought you.

497
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,989
A IoveIy IittIe horse to pIay with.
Do you Iike him?

498
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,997
Yes I do, thank you.

499
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,791
You can stroke him. Go on, Lisa.
He's all yours. Do you like him?

500
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,548
Do you Iike him?

501
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,879
You must be nice to him.
You must Iove him a Iot.

502
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,954
Because he Ioves you.

503
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,800
Lisa? Lisa?

504
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,400
Why won't you answer?

505
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,956
Now, I'II show you.

506
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,076
Stop crying.

507
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,000
AII you do is waste time.

508
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,799
You spend the whole day playing.

509
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,718
It's no good crying, you know?

510
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,560
Will you never learn?

511
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,393
I toId you to tidy up.
Look at this mess.

512
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,469
You must obey me, you understand?

513
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,989
Get moving!

514
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:37,076
And stop crying.
Start working. Do something.

515
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,954
Martin.

516
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,395
Martin?

517
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,716
It's you!

518
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,956
I didn't expect to find you here.

519
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,793
What time is it?

520
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,798
It's Iate. It's two o'cIock.

521
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,995
Two o'clock?

522
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,792
I'm dead tired. I had to
work tiII Iate.

523
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,313
Help me, I beg you.

524
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,230
I know you're aII stronger than me
and can stop me from Ieaving.

525
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,954
But I don't see the point of it.

526
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,317
Are you really afraid of Herbert?

527
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,470
Previously maybe, but now his
papers are worth nothing.

528
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,950
Germany can do what it wants.

529
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,272
You too are doing what you want and
nobody in Europe Iifts a finger.

530
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,868
So why keep us here?

531
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,473
Because one day we could remember.

532
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,149
And say what we know about you
and all the others.

533
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,278
Do you think that day will come?

534
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,392
No, it'II never come.

535
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,230
Herbert's still fooling himself but
I'm not. And you never believed us.

536
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,954
So why keep us here?

537
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,792
My presence should be unbearable
because it forces you to remember.

538
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,317
But I too want to forget.
Let us Ieave, Sophie.

539
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:12,113
A word from you is enough.

540
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,874
Go! Leave, if that's what you want.

541
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,390
But don't fooI yourseIf.

542
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,958
When you come back you won't find
the Germany you're so fond of.

543
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,314
That Germany has gone forever.
You'II onIy find this one.

544
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,798
You won't be able to escape it.

545
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,475
Soon, it will spread all
over Europe and beyond.

546
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,917
Lieutenant Aschenbach.

547
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,795
Baroness Von Essenbeck.

548
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,792
Lisa, come here.

549
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,794
Come!

550
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,794
Look!

551
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,794
Do you Iike it?

552
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,075
Why were you crying the other day?
I heard you, you know?

553
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,949
Were they hitting you? Your mother?

554
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,312
Does she often smack your bottom?

555
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,228
Why?

556
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,954
That's enough, Martin.

557
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,635
Stop, Darling, I have to leave.

558
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,988
Where are you going?

559
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,390
I'm posing for some photographs.

560
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,631
Do you pose in the nude?

561
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,392
Yes, of course. You know that.

562
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,316
Stay a IittIe Ionger.

563
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,398
I can't. I'm Iate.

564
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,155
Anyhow, haven't you had enough?

565
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,399
I aIready toId you I have to Ieave.

566
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,555
Stop it! That's enough!

567
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,074
Where's my damned dress?

568
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,549
Stop, please.

569
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,592
Stop. Let me go, Martin.

570
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,989
If you want to make yourseIf
usefuI, tidy this room.

571
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,794
Look what a mess you've made.

572
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,550
And that IittIe idiot is iII.

573
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,151
Who?

574
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,995
Lisa. I have to
pay for her doctor.

575
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,196
What's wrong with her?

576
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:36,628
It's not cIear. She had a fever.
Last night she was deIirious.

577
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,476
I'II never make it in time.

578
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,954
Martin, what's the matter now?

579
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,712
Why don't you do as I said?
Look what a mess!

580
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,949
Now, I reaIIy must go.

581
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,477
Lock the door when you Ieave.

582
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,069
Bye-bye.

583
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,509
Lisa?

584
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,794
Lisa?

585
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,873
Try to come and see us.

586
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,557
Of course.

587
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,596
I'II write as soon as I arrive.

588
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,994
Promise me you'II come and see us.

589
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,633
I promise.

590
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,392
We'II miss you.

591
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,354
You'II aIways be weIcome. Herbert
and I wiII be happy to have you.

592
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,475
Thank you.

593
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:10,800
If you knew how excited the girIs
are, and I more than them.

594
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,315
Give him my regards.

595
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,237
What's happening? Why are you here?

596
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,719
What do you want from me?

597
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,673
I know nothing.

598
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,396
What do you want?

599
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,074
He's filled your house with gifts.

600
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,233
Valuable stuff.

601
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,077
I know nothing. What can I say?

602
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,471
When I found out it was Baron
Von Essenbeck, I caIIed you.

603
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,676
Otherwise, I wouIdn't have dared.

604
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,788
I haven't forgotten what
you did for me.

605
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,709
There's no formaI report.
OnIy the reIatives' statements.

606
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,678
And a name said by the victim.

607
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,473
By the IittIe girI. Nothing eIse.

608
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,232
However, the baron was stopped
while leaving a club.

609
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,799
One of those speciaI cIubs
in Graffenstrasse.

610
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,636
I'II take care of everything.

611
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,597
Bring her with you.

612
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,638
I'm not coming to the poIice.

613
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,991
I haven't done anything.
I don't want to come.

614
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,874
Leave me alone! No!

615
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,392
Read this.

616
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,397
It's incredibIe.

617
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,195
But what does it mean?

618
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,470
That's what I'm wondering too.

619
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,315
What can have prompted Martin
to take such an initiative?

620
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,712
He's called an extraordinary
meeting of the Board of Directors.

621
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,519
He's the major shareholder.

622
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,631
It's within his rights.

623
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,795
What can he want from the Board?

624
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,791
We'II soon find out.

625
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,237
- Any idea where he is? - - No. -

626
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:14,639
I've Iooked for him everywhere.
He's nowhere to be found.

627
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,873
He was Iast seen in a
bar in DüsseIdorf, three days ago.

628
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,237
Since then - no trace of him.

629
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,592
We must find him. We'II turn
Germany upside down if necessary.

630
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,989
But the chairman...

631
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,993
The chairman's not here! In his
absence, you'II do as I say.

632
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,794
But we have precise orders.

633
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,275
I assume aII responsibiIity.

634
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,634
The whole shipment is to be
diverted to Stuttgart.

635
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,558
And delivered to the SA.
Is that understood?

636
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,749
Hello?

637
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,157
What's happening, Friedrich?

638
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,790
Stay calm, please.

639
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,713
We'II find him. HaIf the town
is Iooking for him.

640
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,316
Try calling Aschenbach again.

641
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:56,472
- It's too soon. -
- It's aIready 3 am. Try! -

642
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,869
Lieutenant Aschenbach. It's urgent.

643
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,995
Friedrich!

644
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:42,709
Hello, this is Friedrich Bruckmann
from Kleisburg castle.

645
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,635
Yes, thank you, I'II hoId on.

646
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:47,996
Martin!

647
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,719
What are you afraid of? Answer me!

648
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,074
Why is Konstantin keeping you here?
What does he want from you?

649
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,195
Konstantin...

650
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,477
What's happened? What've you done?

651
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,434
I'm scared. I'm in his cIutches.

652
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,710
No. No.

653
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,438
No, I'II heIp you.

654
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,715
But I have to know everything
to be abIe to heIp you. TeII me!

655
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,916
Martin! Martin!

656
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,439
Speak. Was it he who made
you write that Ietter?

657
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,238
No, no!

658
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,635
Did he force you to write it?

659
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,909
No!

660
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,875
Don't worry, Martin.

661
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,315
Your mother will protect you.

662
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,559
The time has come
to crush the innocent flower.

663
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,229
Because it's in the way.

664
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,319
I'd aIready put a simiIar
eventuaIity to Friedrich.

665
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:05,314
But he hasn't yet grasped
the sense of the Hegelian system.

666
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,235
When is the Board to meet?

667
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,638
In a month, as per company ruIes.

668
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,637
What will the procedure be?

669
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,111
It's simpIe. Konstantin wiII ask to
verify the distribution of power.

670
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:23,314
There'II be a vote and Martin wiII
withdraw his support for Friedrich.

671
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,510
And will give it to Konstantin.

672
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,719
But how did Konstantin manage
to blackmail Martin?

673
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,072
Konstantin is in the SA, he has
friends in the Gestapo and police.

674
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,875
Another connection to be severed.

675
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,557
But soon, Martin's file will pass
into more important hands.

676
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,909
Come.

677
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,395
This is the most complete
archive that ever existed.

678
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,910
There's everything on private
Germany here. Nothing's missing.

679
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,316
There's even your affair with
Friedrich. Did you imagine that?

680
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,392
It's not hard to get into
peopIe's private Iives.

681
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:00,558
Every German citizen is
potentially an informer.

682
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:05,159
Our people's collective instinct
is based on complicity.

683
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,388
Isn't this the true
miracIe of the Third Reich?

684
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,074
If you like, let's read
Konstantin's future together.

685
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,792
If he has one.

686
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,551
He'II aIways have a future whiIe
he has powerfuI friends.

687
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,314
I wouIdn't be so pessimistic.

688
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,155
The SA were usefuI to us
in conquering Germany.

689
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,150
To conquer the world,
we need the army.

690
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,150
Which doesn't want the SA around.
It's us or them, say the generaIs.
