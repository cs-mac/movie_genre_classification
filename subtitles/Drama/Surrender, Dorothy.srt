1
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,857
Thank you both for coming.

2
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,943
Emerald City needs all the heart
and courage it can get right now.

3
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,446
Got your back, straw man.
You can count on us.

4
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,364
Oh? You can count now, can you?

5
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,826
Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody
needs an oil change.

6
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,745
What'd you do?
Forget to prime your pump?

7
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,165
Oh, very brave. I think that
crown has gone to your head.

8
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,125
- Can it, rust bucket!
- Oh, how dare you!

9
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,586
I'll show you how! Come on,
funnel-head! Let's go!

10
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,921
Clank, clank, clank! Anybody in here?

11
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,506
Oh, yeah. That just happened.

12
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,634
Break it up, you two knuckleheads.
We're in a grave situation here!

13
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,470
- Ah, sorry.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,098
- I-I guess we're all a little on edge, huh?
- Copy that.

15
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,185
But with all of Oz at risk,
I need you two to stand guard...

16
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,020
while I try to contact Dorothy.

17
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Contact Dorothy"? How?

18
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,566
I'm a genius, remember?

19
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,694
But she's probably forgotten
all about us by now.

20
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,947
Whoa, yeah. It's been a long time.

21
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,035
For us my friends, yes. But time in Oz
passes differently than in her world.

22
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,662
It's been years since she
destroyed the Wicked Witches,

23
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,957
but to her it's going to
seem like only yesterday.

24
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,251
Well, let's hope she got
a good night's sleep.

25
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,713
Now, you two keep an eye
on that broomstick while I...

26
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,675
- Oh, too late!
- Secure the chamber!

27
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,095
We've got to
get through to Dorothy.

28
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,808
Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.

29
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,268
Come in, Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy.

30
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,268
Dorothy!

31
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,660
Toto.

32
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,245
We're home.

33
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,463
Em, over here. Look at this.

34
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,674
That twister took out everything in its path.

35
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,843
Knocked the house
right off its foundation.

36
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,136
- Do you think we can fix it?
- I don't know.

37
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,339
That's an awful lot of damage.

38
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,475
Uncle Henry!

39
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,179
Auntie Em?

40
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,033
Dorothy?

41
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,578
- Oh.
- Dorothy.

42
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,039
It's not fair!

43
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,084
Oh, I know, sweetie.

44
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,129
It's not fair. But
it's just a house.

45
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,465
If we have to find another
one, we'll find another one.

46
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,885
- No. We can't just leave.
- Dorothy,

47
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,761
we gotta face facts.

48
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,014
Look at the barn.
Look at the house.

49
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,684
We'll have to have it all appraised,
but we shouldn't get our hopes up.

50
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,201
Move back. Move back.

51
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,830
We need to create a halo of
safety around this disaster area.

52
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,457
Thank you.

53
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,167
Excuse me. This is our home.

54
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,336
Your home.

55
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,006
A home is where you live.
This is a disaster area.

56
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,675
Oh. Can this not be adjusted?

57
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,677
Then do it. Thanks so much.

58
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,256
- And who are you?
- I'm the Appraiser.

59
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,642
Are you with the government?
I didn't see a badge.

60
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,976
Don't be rude, Dorothy.

61
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,850
Oh, outspoken.

62
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,941
We're... government adjacent.

63
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,196
Hmm. Broken support beams,
cracked concr...

64
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,114
Are you writing this down? Thank you.

65
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,241
Cracked concrete footing.

66
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,910
- Ah!
- Hey!

67
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,872
- What do you think you're doing?
- That thing was about to fall.

68
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,708
I probably just saved your life.
But I don't need any recognition.

69
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,752
Just doing my job.

70
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,338
Now, I've made
a thorough assessment,

71
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,918
and I'm afraid you'll
have to vacate immediately.

72
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,386
- What?
- Read this.

73
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,846
There's no reason to kick
us out. We can fix it.

74
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,016
- Dorothy, hold on.
- I'll fix it myself if I have to.

75
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,144
So sorry, but according
to the state of Kansas,

76
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,147
the fate of this property
is decided by me,

77
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,192
not some little girl.

78
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,446
Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

79
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,740
You, do something useful.

80
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,328
You've got until...

81
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,330
sunset to vacate the premises.

82
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,710
Meet me at the shelter in town to sign the
paperwork, or we'll be back to throw you out!

83
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,128
- Oh, oh...
- Good seeing ya.

84
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, that's that.

85
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,678
- Better start packing.
- What? No!

86
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,263
You heard what the man said.

87
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,016
If he says the house is unsafe,
I won't have you in it.

88
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,934
Who is he to decide that?

89
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,936
It's totally... it's-it's fixable.

90
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,938
These are
grown-up decisions, Dorothy.

91
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,190
Sorry, but you're gonna
have to leave this to us.

92
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,485
Well, I'm not leaving.
This is our home.

93
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,279
Dorothy!

94
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,407
Let's give her a little time, Em.

95
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,610
She's been through a lot.

96
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,126
Anybody home?

97
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,846
Look, Toto, we can fix this.

98
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,601
Shh. You'll scare them.

99
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,557
Hmm.

100
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,362
<i> When the world
turns upside down <i>

101
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,816
<i> Nothing is for sure <i>

102

thought were real <i>

103
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,660
<i> You can't find anymore <i>

104

how the pieces fly <i>

105
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,802

106

<i> What do I hold?

122

00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,595

131
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh. Oh, how pretty.

132
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,115
Huh.

133
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,702
It must be some kind
of optical illusion.

134
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,160
That's no illusion, Toto.

135
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,088
Run!

136
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,147
Help, Toto!

137
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:59,195
Help!

138
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,973
Dorothy!

139
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,891
- Hi, kiddo!
- Scarecrow?

140
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,852
What is this? What's happening?

141
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:37,399
We're flying you back to Oz in a
rainbow mover. I invented it.

142
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,942
- Show-off.
- Cowardly Lion?

143
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,904
It's just Lion now.

144
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,073
- See? Oh, my.
- Dorothy.

145
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,325
Hi, Tin Man.

146
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,119
I am so overjoyed to see you.

147
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,915
You guys, dragging me into a
giant rainbow really scared me.

148
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,876
I can only imagine
how you must feel.

149
00:13:55,877 --> 00:14:00,756
Trapped alone in a giant rainbow.
Surrounded by colors.

150
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,968
It must be just horrible! Oh!

151
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,929
Ever since he got his heart,
he's been all over the place.

152
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,015
I never had emotions before.

153
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,851
I just want to try them all out.

154
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,936
Dorothy, we don't have much time.

155
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,148
There's trouble in Oz, and only
you... threatening the land...

156
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,484
and you are the only one
who can stop...

157
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,235
What's that noise?

158
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,779
Hold that door!

159
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,031
- What's going on?
- Hang on, Dorothy.

160
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,742
- We'll explain everything when you get here.
- Where?

161
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,578
Emerald City!
I-In the Wizard's chamber.

162
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,623
I smell flyin' monkeys!

163
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,958
- Oh, no.
- Monkeys!

164
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,503
Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.
Come in, Dorothy.

165
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,630
- The door...
- Scarecrow to Dorothy.

166
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,882
Is starting to give!

167
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,259
I've lost contact with Dorothy.
I can't get her back!

168
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,055
I can't hold it!

169
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,973
Time's up!

170
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,801
Aaah!

171
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,353
Hurry!

172
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,272
Come on!

173
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,995
Oof!

174
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,006
I can't believe it, Toto.

175
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,209
We're really back in Oz.

176
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,724
Wait. Scarecrow?

177
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,393
Scarecrow!

178
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,476
Oh, great.

179
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,156
Come on, Toto. We've got
to get to Emerald City.

180
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,735
It sounds like the guys
are in trouble.

181
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,747
If only Glinda were here.
She'd know what to do.

182
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,625
Now, now. Oops.

183
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,962
No, don't push.
I'm coming right along.

184
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,884
Please, if...

185
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:13,013
If you would just
give me my wand back.

186
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,263
Oh, now, you don't want to do that.

187
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,896
Don't say I didn't warn you.

188
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,858
Magic in the wrong hands can
be a very dangerous thing.

189
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,319
Oh, Glinda.

190
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,120
Sweet Glinda.

191
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,081
Ah, the Jester.

192
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,335
I am so thrilled to have
you as my guest.

193
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,837
I'm captivated.

194
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,422
Isn't it wonderful...

195
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,050
when two great powers
as you and I...

196
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,968
meet face-to-face,

197
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,222
Peer-to-peer, toe-to-toe?

198
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,476
My, but you're... silly.

199
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,979
"Silly"? By "silly,"
surely you mean diabolical.

200
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,106
No?

201
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,275
You're laughing.

202
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,152
It's the costume, isn't it?

203
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,155
I know, I know.
Hard to take me seriously.

204
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,282
It's my curse. Literally.

205
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:19,788
I can't take this off... ever.

206
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,251
My wicked sister did this to me with
one of her funny little spells.

207
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,796
I knew your sister all too well.

208
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,632
I never knew she had
a sense of humor.

209
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,463
It's not funny to me!

210
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,146
But now I'm ready to embrace a
whole new role as ruler of Oz.

211
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,067
And you're gonna give me your
Good Ozkeeping seal of approval.

212
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,236
But I don't approve.

213
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:55,740
The Land of Oz is already falling
into ruin because of you.

214
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,536
No good can come
from the reign of a fool.

215
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,999
Agh, Glinda.

216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,542
Glinda, Glinda, Glinda.

217
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:11,548
You are such a disappointment,
just like all the others.

218
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,051
What have you done to them?

219
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,222
Even a fool has a few tricks
up his sleeve.

220
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,853
The magic of that broomstick
belongs to someone else.

221
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,521
Uh-uh-uh.

222
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,940
But with this little baby,

223
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:34,523
the magic is magnified
and becomes all mine.

224
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,536
Dorothy Gale will stop you.

225
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:47,167
She will find a way back to Oz,
and she will stop you!

226
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:51,129
Ooh. "Dorothy Gale will stop you."

227
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,507
Aren't I quivering?

228
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,221
Where once your
living soul did dwell,

229
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,767
now is nothing but an empty shell!

230
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,358
Now do you approve?

231
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,029
You rule, O generous Jester.

232
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,447
Attagirl.

233
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,625
Aw, come on! What is that?

234
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,624
To my tower. Fly!

235
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,966
Now just around this corner,

236
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,844
- I'm sure there's a buttress we can slide down.
- Wait!

237
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,263
That's the window we escaped from.

238
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,391
We're just going around in circles!

239
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,644
- Hmm.
- Some genius you turned out to be.

240
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,073
Listen to that racket.

241
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,076
- Sounds like they're wreckin' the place.
- I think that's me.

242
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,123
How ironic to get a heart,
only to have it attack me.

243
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,750
Oh, the pain! The pain!

244
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,795
Gadzooks! I just realized
something horrible.

245
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,841
Dorothy could be here any minute and
walk right into a flyin' monkey ambush.

246
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,260
Oh, that is horrible. Empathy!

247
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,220
Horror! Fear!

248
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:27,642
How about I jump in there
and tear 'em all apart?

249
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,562
Just rip 'em limb from limb!

250
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,016
Let's use brains, not brawn.

251
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,438
Wait a minute.

252
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,989
I have a brilliant plan.

253
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,824
- Ah, relief.
- Is it a...

254
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,826
tear them all limb from limb plan?

255
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,954
Nope. It's the tear him
limb from limb plan.

256
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,414
Wha...

257
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,249
Show me the girl.

258
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,338
Not a toy! No touchies!
No touchies!

259
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,301
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

260
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,011
Show me the girl.

261
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,385
Show her to me, please.

262
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,225
Aaah! The only person
who could threaten my plan...

263
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,519
is here in Oz,
and I don't know where.

264
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,981
Do you know how annoying that is?

265
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,942
I can't let her beat me.
My plan is almost complete.

266
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,195
And you better figure
out a way to help me,

267
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:24,365
or you'll be grounded, and you
can kiss your wings good-bye.

268
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,659
- Oh.
- Ah!

269
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,536
Haven't we been though this before?

270
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,164
I don't speak monkey.

271
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,875
Come on, Toto. Let's go
find the yellow brick road.

272
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,879
That's her? That's Dorothy Gale,
the witch slayer from Kansas?

273
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,048
Why she's just a little girl.

274
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,801
And she's headed for Candy County.

275
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,553
Oh! Well, I'll just let her
taste their treats.

276
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,557
Then their justice.

277
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,135
You!

278
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,230
Ready your minions. We're
going to double our efforts.

279
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,773
Go to the Emerald City.

280
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,399
Join the others.

281
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,195
And don't come back without that
scarecrow, that lion and that tin can!

282
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,533
I'll take care of the girl.

283
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,873
Fly! Fly! Fly, my babies!

284
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,623
Now for a little insurance.

285
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,798
Moon and Earth and stars align.

286
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,469
Show the wayward girl a sign.

287
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:40,105
Oh, Toto. This doesn't look
like the Oz I remember.

288
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,947
Emerald City must be
in that direction.

289
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,740
- I think.
- Correct!

290
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,369
Though I'm not sure I would advise you to go.

291
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,039
Lately, many are going,
but few are returning.

292
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,419
Whoa. You are a really fa...

293
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,755
fabulous... owl.

294
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,174
Oh. You're very kind.
I usually hear "fat."

295
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,553
But, of course, my theory is that I'm
just not quite the right height.

296
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,014
If I were twice as tall,
for instance... Ooh!

297
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,932
Aaah! Ow! Whoo!

298
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,642
Ow! Oh!

299
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,603
Oh! Oh, Oh! Ow!

300
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,480
- Aaah!
- Uh, are you okay?

301
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,566
Physically? Yes.

302
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,485
But I do have a large piece of
bark lodged in my hindquarters...

303
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,447
Oh! Sorry. I'm giving you
too much information, aren't I?

304
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,240
I do that. My name is Wiser.

305
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,993
Nice to meet you, Wiser.
I'm Dorothy Gale.

306
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,953
The famous Dorothy Gale.

307
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,455
And Toto.

308
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,041
I'm a really big fan of your work.

309
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,751
Timber!

310
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,336
- Wow, you really...
- Know everything?

311
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,671
- And...
- Finish other people's sentences? Oh, no, I'm doing it again!

312
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,049
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

313
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,509
I'll just go. Farewell,
Dorothy and Toto.

314
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,178
No, w-wait.

315
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,431
I need to get to Emerald City, and I
can't seem to find the yellow brick...

316
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,892
- House? Wall? Fireplace?
- Road.

317
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,896
Oh, of course. Why would you be
looking for a yellow brick wall?

318
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,981
That's silly, at the very least.

319
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,361
There's the high road, and then there's the
low road. I know every square acre of Oz.

320
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,906
But why would you want me to come with
you? I'm a miserable traveling companion.

321
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,866
- I talk incessantly.
- Yes, I...

322
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,995
I require frequent rest stops at which, I
should warn you, I will also talk incessantly.

323
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,498
It's a terrible habit, I know.
But habits are hard to break.

324
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,291
If we could break them,
they wouldn't be habits.

325
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,212
That's okay. I was hoping maybe
you could... fly me there.

326
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,964
In what?

327
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,924
Oh. Oh, you mean me?

328
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,552
I suppose I could do that.
Only... I can't fly.

329
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,389
I mean, I could in the past, but...

330
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,474
There's no need to be embarrassed.

331
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,685
Maybe you could just point the way.

332
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,896
Ah. Actually,
it's in this direction.

333
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,649
I know a shortcut
through Candy County.

334
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,237
But I must warn you, if we're to travel
through Candy County, there's one rule.

335
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,906
- What is that?
- You must obey the signs.

336
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,485
Which will be difficult
since I'm quite hungry!

337
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,671
Whoa.

338
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:11,300
Y-You did say obey
the signs, right?

339
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,970
Right.

340
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,345
They must have changed
the rules. Follow me!

341
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,600
Whoo!

342
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,819
<i> It's gonna be
fine Just read the signs <i>

343
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,398
<i> Eat anything you want <i>

344
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,617
<i> Stick around and gulp it down <i>

345
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,454
<i> Till every last bite is gone <i>

346
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:44,000
<i> You know you want it
You know you need it <i>

347
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,128
<i> Don't stop
Go ahead and eat it <i>

348
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,756
<i> Candy, candy <i>

349
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,506
<i> Lots for everyone <i>

350
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,596
- <i> Candy, candy <i>
- Come on.

351
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,220
<i> You've only just begun <i>

352
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,062
<i> Help yourself 'cause
there's nothing else <i>

353
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,607
<i> You're gonna wanna do today <i>

354
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:11,152
<i> Get your thrills
till you've had your fill <i>

355
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,197
<i> I wanna see you feed your face <i>

356
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,909
<i> There's gum balls, chocolate,
jelly rolls and lollipops <i>

357
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,454
<i> Licorice, caramel,
peppermint, butterscotch <i>

358
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,707
<i> Cherry sour, shortcake,
candy canes, ice cream <i>

359
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,294
<i> Gummy bears, butter tarts,
bubble gum and jelly beans <i>

360
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,129
Whoo!

361
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,591
- <i> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <i>
- <i> Oh, it's the sweetest thing <i>

362
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,218
<i> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <i>

363
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,012
- <i> Candy, candy <i>
- Mmm.

364
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,386
<i> Makes me wanna sing <i>

365
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,810
<i> Candy, candy <i>

366
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,854
Toto!

367
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,484
Halt! You are under arrest.

368
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,195
You are all under arrest.

369
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,863
- Under arrest?
- Yes.

370
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,324
Sorry to say,
you have broken the law.

371
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:02,245
I'm being arrested
by a giant marshmallow?

372
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:06,332
Marshal Mallow. Second in command
of the garrison at Candy County.

373
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,753
- What did we do?
- Violation of section eight, paragraph 12 of...

374
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,006
- penal code 16165.
- Penal code 16165.

375
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,009
- Eating candy.
- But we didn't know.

376
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,931
I'm so very sorry, but
there is thorough signage.

377
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,061
They didn't say that before.

378
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,021
Cuff 'em.

379
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,066
Mmm, licorice.

380
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,945
Don't even think about eating
the restraints.

381
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,197
And no licking!

382
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,074
What are you gonna do with us?

383
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,410
We're taking you to the
Candy Courthouse,

384
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,079
where you will be tried
by Judge Jawbreaker...

385
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,790
- The Hanging Judge?
- The Hanging...

386
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,918
- I was going to say that.
- Sorry. I do that.

387
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,621
He really does.

388
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,548
Forward, march!

389
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,466
- <i> Fudge pops, lemon drops <i>
- Ouch.

390
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:02,138
<i>Fudge pops, lemon drops<i>

391
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,571
Are you sure this is gonna work?

392
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,781
Trust me. I've got
it all figured out.

393
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,450
Easy for you to say.

394
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,114
Ready, set...

395
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,658
Run!

396
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,710
"Run"? That's the plan?

397
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,040
Mm-hmm. Engaging neural
synaptic simulation sequence.

398
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,843
Holy smokes! They must
have called for reinforcements.

399
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,471
- What do we do now?
- Abort! Abort! Abort!

400
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,181
Jump!

401
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,391
Flyin' lion comin' through.

402
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,310
Ow.

403
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,105
Yikes!

404
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,059
Ouch!

405
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,992
- Look out!
- Oh!

406
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,495
Don't lose my head!

407
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,625
Whoa-oh-oh!

408
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,252
Tin Man, watch
where you're grabbin'!

409
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,587
Slow.

410
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,008
Left.

411
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,383
Ah! No, no, no!

412
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,399
Oh!

413
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,526
Sudden severe disappointment.

414
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,615
Perfect!

415
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,992
Perfect?

416
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,994
They're leaving
Emerald City, aren't they?

417
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,329
- Dorothy can now safely retrieve our message.
- Oh.

418
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,123
Actually, that is perfect.

419
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,828
Yeah, apart from
being trapped in a sack.

420
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,180
Order in the court!

421
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,928
Order! Order!

422
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,476
What's the charge?

423
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:17,106
Violation of penal code 16165.

424
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,568
- Eating candy, milord.
- Eating candy?

425
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:25,072
That's the worst
offense on the Glycemic Index!

426
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,492
Quiet in the peanut gallery.

427
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,703
What do the defendants plead?

428
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,080
- Guilty as charged.
- Who are you?

429
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,334
- I'm your legal defense team.
- Why did you plead guilty?

430
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,337
- Because this is his 499th arrest.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:43,716
Well then, it's
time to set an example.

432
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:47,303
But the sign said,
"Eat all the candy you want."

433
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:51,807
Your Honor, they are entitled to a
verdict from a jury of their Peeps.

434
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,185
Oh, all right. What say ye, Peeps?

435
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,647
- What are they saying?
- Peep, peep, peep a-cheep.

436
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,191
Can't you hear that?

437
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,484
Guilty!

438
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,402
Let the punishment fit the crime.

439
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,822
I hereby sentence you to death!

440
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,828
I knew they'd go nuts for that.

441
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,206
Death? For eating candy?

442
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,084
- Marshal Mallow?
- Milord?

443
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:22,046
I hereby order you to execute
uh, uh, the execution.

444
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,798
- Me?
- Yes, you.

445
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,467
But as an officer in the
Candy County Army,

446
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,553
I can only follow orders
from General Candy Apple.

447
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,514
- Bosh.
- Excuse me, Your Judgeship.

448
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,182
- Names, please?
- What for?

449
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,934
Your death certificates.

450
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,061
- Wiser.
- Wiser with a "Z"?

451
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,188
- Wiser with an "S."
- And your name is?

452
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,148
Dorothy. Dorothy Gale.

453
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,696
Dorothy Gale?

454
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,032
The... The witch slaying
girl from Kansas?

455
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,659
Well, sort of.

456
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,577
Mallow, approach the bench!

457
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,705
What the devil's food
is going on here?

458
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,875
- Are you trying to make me look like a fool?
- Of course not, milord.

459
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,505
This girl is one of the greatest
heroes Oz has ever known!

460
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,590
She's well above reproach!

461
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,844
You should know that!
Everyone knows that!

462
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,013
What do they teach you
in the academy anyway?

463
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,434
As Lord High Judge of this court,

464
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,478
I hereby commute
the death sentence.

465
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,398
Free the prisoners!

466
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,571
Yes, milord,

467
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:33,826
but the charges must stand until
General Candy Apple can be found.

468
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,787
Well, where in confection is he?

469
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,541
He was called to Emerald City days ago
but should have been back by now.

470
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:45,748
Then I suggest, Marshal Mallow,
you go find him.

471
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,634
Whew! Well, I don't know
about anyone else,

472
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,338
but I could really go
for-for a little snack.

473
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,224
- Too soon?
- Yes, I think so.

474
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,019
Inappropriate.

475
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,651
I'm terribly, terribly sorry
for all this, milady.

476
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,238
It's just that I am duty bound
to follow the general's orders.

477
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,282
- It's okay.
- Yes, we understand.

478
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,410
I can't fathom what's taking
him so long to return.

479
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,705
- Well, we're going to Emerald City.
- You're welcome to join us.

480
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,416
I-Is that an order?

481
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,211
No, no, it's an invitation.

482
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:29,590
Well, in that case, I...
I believe I can.

483
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,439
Wow, what a great wall.

484
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,107
It's made of china.

485
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,319
What a great wall of china.

486
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,904
Halt!

487
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,483
State your name and business.

488
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,742
My name is Dorothy,

489
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,953
and this is Marshal Mallow and Wiser.

490
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,996
We're trying to get through
to the yellow brick road.

491
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,666
In order to cross the wall,
you'll need permission...

492
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:08,295
from Her Royal Highness, the
princess of Dainty China Country.

493
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:12,126
Ooh, ooh. Oh, so pretty.

494
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,512
That was a warning shot.

495
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:20,558
Oh, we should, um, respect
their national borders.

496
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,354
Good comrade, sir,

497
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,399
may we request an audience
with the Dainty China princess?

498
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,110
No. She's otherwise engaged.

499
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,779
I mean, she's busy getting engaged.

500
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,031
She's welcoming suitors today.

501
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:40,286
Suitors. Hmm. H-He-He's a suitor.

502
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,206
Which one?

503
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,667
Marshal Mallow is the suitor,

504
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,629
and he would like to ask for the
hand of the Dainty China princess.

505
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,676
- Oh.
- The princess? Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?

506
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,221
Escort the giants in!

507
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,762
Open the gates!

508
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:17,197
But I don't want to be a suitor.
I don't want to get married.

509
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,199
What if she's cute?

510
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,370
Appearance isn't everything. The
name's Mallow, not "Shallow."

511
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,743
Touche.

512
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,858
Now get in there. You'll do great.

513
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,820
Figures and figurines,

514
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,907
may I present the Royal Highness,

515
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:04,238
the princess
of Dainty China Country.

516
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,129
<i> Rays of light surround
our China princess <i>

517
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,299
Wow! She's beautiful.

518

<i> Roses bow and tulips
sing her name <i>

519

- Yes!
- <i> Diamonds shy away <i>

<i> Suns have lost their way <i>

<i> All when they are near

522
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,363

<i> She has only one
heart to convince <i>

529
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,434
<i> A heart that seeks a gentle
beating like its own <i>

530
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,811
- Wow.
- <i> From my unique point of view <i>

531
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,439
<i> I was meant to marry you <i>

532

<i> Opposites' attraction
clearly shown <i>

<i> You're a freak
with freakish height <i>

535
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,490
<i> I'd rather be alone <i>

536
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,617
<i> Atop my throne <i>

537
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,991
Oh!

538
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,039
<i> La-la, la, la, la, la <i>

<i> The next suitor

541
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,758
<i> Oh, Your Shininess <i>

542

- Yawn.

546
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,560
<i> Are you asleep or in a trance? <i>

547

<i> Snowballs thrown in fire

Daddy!

550
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,237
Suitor three.

- Oh!
- So I suppose that's a "no" then, is it?

559
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,354
Fine.

560
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:39,024
Menders, over here.
Get some glue, and lots of it.

561
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,193
- Well, you can't win them all, eh?
- Ow!

562
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,362
- Oh!
- No! Oh, dear!

563
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:47,613
- Oh, careful!
- Excuse me. I'm still talking to the lady!

564
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,036
- Put me down!
- Next.

565

<i> Next <i>

566
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,468
Your-Your Hi-Hineyness.

567
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,178
I mean, Your Shininess. Uh...

568
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,639
Go on. Keep going.

569
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,724
Um, uh...

570
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,643
Uh, I-I mean, Your, um...

571
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,981
It seems the man made of
marshmallow is all mushy-mouthed.

572

<i> When a princess seeks a prince <i>

574
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:41,920

<i> Or pursue a man unknown <i>

577

<i> Companionship

<i> Earthquake! <i>

Where once was calm soon will quake!

581
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,408
No!

582
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,048
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

583
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,550
Tell me the truth. How bad is it?

584
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,552
You're still without flaw.

585
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,179
Oh! Thank goodness.

586
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,598
- Milady.
- How is the city?

587
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,226
- How many broken?
- No one broken, but many cracked and chipped.

588
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,145
And the city is severely damaged.

589
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,689
That was a very heroic
thing you did back there.

590
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,274
Just doing my duty.

591
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,944
We have a mission
of the utmost importance.

592
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,404
Menders, take that man
to the hospital. Quickly!

593
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,864
Excuse me? Your Highness.

594
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,909
May we please pass through your
country on the yellow brick road?

595
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,371
No. You'll have to go around.

596
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,958
But that could take weeks,
and my friends are in danger.

597
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,793
Who do you think you are,

598
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,088
interrupting royal business
with your petty travel plans?

599
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,174
Can't you see we're in
a state of emergency?

600
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,678
Yes, I do see. My home
is in trouble too.

601
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,099
Perhaps you can make an exception
for Miss Dorothy Gale?

602
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,850
- Oh!
- Oh.

603
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,431
So this is the famous girl who
vanquishes wicked witches.

604
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,317
- I thought you'd be taller.
- Milady,

605
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,736
she is a very resourceful
young woman.

606
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,031
Ah. Perhaps you'd rather
be a suitor to her.

607
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,616
- That's not what I meant.
- Silence!

608
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,943
Oh.

609
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,621
These are troubled times in Oz.

610
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,582
Behind our great wall, we are safe.

611
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,461
Now and again the Jester sends an
earthquake or two just to rattle us.

612
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,922
But never one so big.

613
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,553
He must really be angry
about something...

614
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,055
or someone.

615
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,184
This is your fault.

616
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,352
- What?
- Now just a min...

617
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,854
Don't deny it.

618
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,605
You wanted a little shortcut,

619
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,026
so you forced your way in and brought
the Jester's anger with you!

620
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,111
I don't know any Jester.

621
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,906
I'm just trying to get to Emerald
City to see the Scarecrow.

622
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,950
Maybe I can help
your people somehow.

623
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,245
You're just a little girl from Kansas.
What could you possibly do?

624
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,831
- But I...
- She doesn't even have a title.

625
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,647
I'm going with you.

626
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,232
What?

627
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,027
- I'm going with you.
- No, milady.

628
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,489
You mustn't go. You could be fractured
before you reach the river.

629
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,075
If I don't go,
we could all be broken.

630
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,410
Then I will send
the royal guard with you.

631
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,496
No, that won't be necessary.

632
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,200
Marshal Mallow will keep me safe.

633
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,495
You have my word, milady.

634
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,463
My dear people,

635
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:15,926
Miss Dorothy Gale, the witch slaying
giant from Kansas, and her friends,

636
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,512
will accompany me as my servants...

637
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,972
on a mission
to Emerald City to meet...

638
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,557
with the Scarecrow.

639
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,351
With his eminent wisdom,

640
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,728
we will surely find a way to end
the Jester's reign of tyranny.

641
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,025
Bow to me.

642
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,524
- Huh?
- Bow to me.

643
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,775
Lower.

644
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,619
Not to worry, my dear people.

645
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,993
<i> I'll be back soon! <i>

646
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,876
What in the Land of Oz
is taking so long?

647
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,048
Ha-ha! They're here!

648
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,052
Oh, I do so love
having important guests.

649
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,145
Distinguished company, welcome.

650
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,438
You always tie your company up?

651
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,984
As a matter of fact... yes.

652
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,534
Are those real... people?

653
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,870
They were real people.

654
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,122
But now they're better than real.

655
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,541
As puppets, they still act
like people...

656
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,043
when I want them to.

657
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,420
Dance!

658
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,717
You can't make someone do
that against their will.

659
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,468
Dancing is very personal.

660
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,013
Yeah, dancing is a very
per... very personal thing.

661
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,682
I can make them do whatever I want.

662
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,477
I pull the strings! Literally!

663
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,354
<i> I would rejoice <i>

664
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,149
<i> At the top of my voice <i>

665
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,693
<i> I'd be a true warlock <i>

666
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,530
<i> But I had no choice <i>

667
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,366
<i> My sister was frightful <i>

668
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:08,949
<i> And spitefully made me a clown <i>

669
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:16,213
<i> I shall possess <i>

670
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:21,509
<i> My one happiness <i>

671
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,845
<i> The power I covet <i>

672
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,640
<i> And who wouldn't love it <i>

673
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,600
<i> Would you? <i>

674
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,856
<i> Now would you dare try me? <i>

675
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:41,986
<i> And would you deny
me what's mine? <i>

676
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:48,703
<i> Well, now that's a punch line! <i>

677
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,998
<i> I guess you'd have guessed <i>

678
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,459
<i> A jester must jest <i>

679
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,087
<i> When I laugh alone <i>

680
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,882
<i> It is I who laughs best <i>

681
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,300
Hotfoot!

682
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:20,193
Stop bouncing.

683
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,945
You're going to scuff my finish.

684
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,614
- I'm just walking.
- You're bouncing.

685
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,741
This is very uncomfortable.

686
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,785
I hope you're not gonna be
like this the whole trip.

687
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,663
I am a princess! Remember?

688
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,916
Yuck.

689
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,800
More destruction.

690
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,760
Where are we?

691
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,973
This is the Munchkin River, Your
Highness. It leads to Emerald City.

692
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,684
It looks like the yellow
brick road ends here.

693
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,769
Oh, great. What do we do now?

694
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,522
Make camp and wait for orders?

695
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,982
We'll build a boat.

696
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,568
And what, pray tell, will we,

697
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,738
or rather, you,
build this boat out of?

698
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,324
- The owl?
- Uh, no.

699
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,951
We'll figure it out.
How hard can it be?

700
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,655
There are trees everywhere.

701
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,166
Ow! Hey!

702
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,586
Sorry. So sorry. I...

703
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,756
How would you like it if I just walked
up to you and broke your arm off?

704
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,425
Ow! I didn't mean any harm.

705
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,218
We're trying to get
to Emerald City.

706
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,180
And to do it we need wood...
to build a boat.

707
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,931
- A boat!
- A boat?

708
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,851
- You want to build a boat?
- You've got a lot of nerve.

709
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,603
Not my idea.

710
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,271
Hey, I know her.

711
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,107
Isn't she the one that stole
the apples off Uncle Manny?

712
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,776
- What?
- That's her.

713
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:48,114
Ow, ouch, ow! Boy, those
trees really hold a grudge.

714
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,825
At least we're out of range.

715
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,704
- Ow.
- And stay out!

716
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,205
Take me.

717
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,087
Take me.

718
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:06,800
I would like to volunteer these old
timbers as material for your boat.

719
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:11,304
Oh, no. We could never
hurl a talking tree.

720
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,931
At least not on purpose.

721
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:16,101
I'm 978 years old.

722
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:19,854
And honestly, I don't have
many rings left.

723
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:24,067
I can stay here and rot,
taking up someone else's sun,

724
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:30,073
or I can come with you and be part of
something important, something great.

725
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,243
I don't know what to say.
Except thank you.

726
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,698
Oh, this is a very brave
sacrifice you're making.

727
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,374
No sap off my brow.

728
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,550
<i> Gonna get things rollin'
I know I can <i>

729
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,512
<i> Let's get things goin'
'cause I've got a plan <i>

730
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:56,516
<i> Put it all together
till the job is done <i>

731
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,769
<i> This should be easy
It should be fun <i>

732
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,020
<i> Work with me <i>

733
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,570
Whoa!

734
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:12,490
<i> Can't get across
It's sink or swim <i>

735
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,786
<i> I'll build a boat
It's the next best thing <i>

736
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,498
<i> We're better together
all as one <i>

737
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,461
<i> With a little help, we can
get this done, work with me <i>

738
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:28,006
<i> Work with me
I will work with you <i>

739
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:32,010
<i> Maybe we will see
just what we can do <i>

740
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,387
<i> It's true, it's true,
it's true, it's true, it's true <i>

741
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,138
<i> Work with me I'll work with you <i>

742
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,637
We need to truss that up there.

743
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,651
<i> We're gonna get there
Need a little time <i>

744
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,447
- <i> You give me yours <i>
- <i> I'll give you mine <i>

745
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,575
<i> Heads together till the end <i>

746
00:49:55,576 --> 00:50:00,747
- Huh?
- <i> All I need is some help from my friends <i>

747
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,000
<i> Work with me
I will work with you <i>

748
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,296
<i> Maybe we will see just what we can do <i>

749
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,882
<i> It's true, it's true,
it's true, it's true, it's true <i>

750
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,842
<i> Work with me I'll work with you <i>

751
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,440
Come on, you guys.
Lift it up there.

752
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,988
What the heck?

753
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,783
Anchors aweigh!

754
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,034
Good job!

755
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:42,247
<i> Work with me, work with me <i>

756
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,793
There, all finished.

757
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,962
I think we should call it Tugg.

758
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,465
Hey, I like that.
Climb aboard, everybody.

759
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,969
<i> Work with me
I will work with you <i>

760
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,806
<i> Maybe we will see
just what we can do <i>

761
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,391
- <i> It's true <i>
- <i> It's true <i>

762
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,101
<i> It's true <i>

763
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,562
<i> Work with me, I'll work with you <i>

764
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,515
Catch you later!

765
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,399
Here we go!

766
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,485
Tugg, you do
make a wonderful boat.

767
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,530
Well, thank you, Princess.

768
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,753
Land ho!

769
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,056
Oh, my.

770
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,101
What happened to this place?

771
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,522
It used to be... so beautiful.

772
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,112
Hello?

773
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,109
Lion? Scarecrow?

774
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,368
Tin Man?

775
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,496
It's totally abandoned.

776
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,199
Scary, huh?

777
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,463
What a mess.

778
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,549
General?

779
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,630
- Scarecrow?
- General Candy Apple, sir?

780
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,889
They've all gone.

781
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,975
P-Perhaps they're having lunch.

782
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,271
The courteous thing to do
would be to come back later.

783
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,192
M-Much later. Hoo.

784
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,361
This is where the
broomstick should be.

785
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:40,406
No wonder things are going wrong.

786
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:45,161
Oh, look. It's a prismatic tubular
inter-dimensional transporter device.

787
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,245
- What?
- Huh?

788
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,120
In simpler terms,
it's a rainbow mover.

789
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,210
This is the machine
that brought me here.

790
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:57,048
Technically the rainbow brought you here.
The machine created the rainbow.

791
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,925
It's sort of
a chicken-and-the-egg thing.

792
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,299
- Ahem.
- Ooh, sorry.

793
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,352
Oh, my gosh. Dorothy,
that might be for you.

794
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,813
What are the odds of that?
65 to 2? I mean...

795
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,109
Dorothy, we don't have much time.

796
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,945
There's trouble in Oz,
and only you can help us.

797
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,322
An evil Jester is
threatening the land.

798
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:25,494
His power comes from a magic scepter he
has at his castle. The scepter is...

799
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:35,503
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the famous Dorothy Gale.

800
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,171
You stay away from her!

801
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,048
I'm not talking to you, puff ball.

802
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,341
Hoo-hoo.

803
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,011
- I, the princess of Dainty...
- Silence!

804
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,973
All right, Jester, what have
you done with my friends?

805
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,975
Your friends?

806
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:53,146
What a coincidence. Why,
I've got them right here.

807
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,731
See?

808
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,984
- They have all the comforts of home.
- Yikes!

809
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,944
Central heating.

810
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,489
- Running water.
- No!

811
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:09,078
- And the coziest accommodations imaginable.
- Save yourself Dorothy!

812
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,038
You let them go!

813
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,332
I give the orders around here now.

814
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,168
So if you know what's good for you,

815
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:18,963
you'll hop in your little rainbow mover
and go back to Kansas where you belong!

816
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:23,593
- No.
- Either do as I say or die!

817
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,767
Mallow, grab her!

818
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,596
Right, milady.

819
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,563
Owl my!

820
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,947
Oh, why don't you
sing me a song, eh?

821
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,571
Tugg! Tugg, let's move it!

822
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,453
What's the rush?

823
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,414
- Flying monkeys!
- Flying monkeys?

824
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,118
Dorothy, take cover.
I'll fight them off.

825
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,549
Here they come.

826
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:11,095
- Goodness me!
- Oh!

827
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,102
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

828
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,521
Stop! Stop!

829
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,397
Can't this old barge
move any faster?

830
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,941
Hang on!

831
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:29,159
Just try and keep up.

832
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,831
Take that!

833
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:39,043
Tugg, stay to the right!
Head for that cave!

834
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,417
Aye, aye, Your Highness.

835
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,967
They're on us!

836
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,389
No! No, no, no,
no, no! You cowards!

837
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,184
You're letting her get away!

838
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,934
Why do I have to do everything myself?

839
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,903
They're not
coming in. They've left us.

840
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,949
They must be afraid
of the dark! Ha! Nyctophobia!

841
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,826
Ha! They act so tough.

842
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,120
But I bet they sleep
with a night-light on.

843
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,498
Silly, scaredy...

844
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,418
I can't see a thing.

845
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:23,004
Me neither! I'm terrified!

846
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,630
You're nocturnal. Get a grip.

847
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,044
Hey, I think I see a way out.

848
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,223
What?

849
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,142
Fireflies!

850
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,770
I haven't seen you guys in ages.
Where have you been?

851
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,357
Oh, they're... They're beautiful!

852
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,158
That's the prettiest
thing I've ever seen.

853
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,169
Milady.

854
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,173
Oh, how romantic.

855
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,679
Where do you think we're headed?

856
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,267
Whoa.

857
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:22,146
By that compass,
we are heading northwest,

858
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:26,567
which means this little tributary
will take us to the Jester's castle.

859
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,487
- Yes!
- Perfect! That's great.

860
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,823
Under cover of darkness, we can
belly crawl past the guards...

861
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,659
Then we can sneak in
and free my friends.

862
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,036
Ah! We have a plan.

863
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:43,334
Oh, there's a fork up ahead.

864
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,583
Which way should we go?

865
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,799
Let's follow
the fireflies. They seem to know.

866
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,094
Looks like right... is right.

867
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,594
Thank you, fireflies.

868
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,226
Aha! It's the least I could do.

869
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,813
Have a nice ride!

870
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:08,190
See you next fall!

871
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,072
Oh, no. It's a trap.

872
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,157
Tugg, turn back!

873
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,111
I can't! The current is too strong!

874
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,339
Oh!

875
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,930
Whoa!

876
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,771
Everyone, hold on tight!

877
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:10,755
Good-bye, Dorothy Gale.

878
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,257
Good-bye.

879
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,384
Say good-bye to Dorothy
Gale, everyone.

880
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,095
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

881
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,973
Don't... mess... with the Jester!

882
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,678
What have you done?

883
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,441
Mmm.

884
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,236
Oh.

885
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,326
Is everyone okay?

886
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:43,037
You all right?

887
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,165
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wiser?

888
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,084
Hmm? Affirmative.

889
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,127
Toto?

890
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,751
- Tugg?
- Oh. A few splinters.

891
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,591
China Princess?

892
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,176
China Princess?

893
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,220
Princess!

894
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,888
China Princess!

895
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,810
Oh, no.

896
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:15,104
Oh. I should have protected her.

897
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,733
I neglected my duty.

898
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,695
Mmm.

899
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,571
Where are you going?

900
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,949
I'm going to confront
the Jester myself.

901
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,951
I can't let anyone else get hurt.

902
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:06,704
- We won't let you go alone.
- Don't follow me.

903
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,828
- But we've come this far.
- That's an order.

904
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,605
How? How is it
possible she survived?

905
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,607
Foiling those stupid
monkeys is one thing,

906
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,358
but surviving my waterfall trick?

907
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,986
I mean, that's a good trick!

908
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:42,441
Positively... humiliating.

909
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,953
Idiot! This is all your fault!

910
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,123
Dorothy would be dead by now if it
weren't for this abysmal failure.

911
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,834
Your abysmal failure, pal.

912
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:57,463
How dare you ruin my perfect
record of jesterly awfulness?

913
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,669
Well, don't say I didn't warn you,
you fuzzy evolutionary reject.

914
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,014
You're grounded!

915
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:10,935
Ready the castle! Roll out the
welcome mat for Miss Dorothy Gale.

916
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:14,813
She's going to get the kind of
reception that's to die for.

917
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,561
Ow!

918
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,786
Is there anything I can do?

919
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,882
Yes. Get some help.

920
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,967
How?

921
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:47,048
Oh, I don't know,
smart guy! Figure it out.

922
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,560
Forgive me.

923
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,009
Ah!

924
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,055
- Ooh! Ooh!
- You're flying.

925
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,185
You're flying!

926
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,063
I am? I am!

927
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,233
Ouch!

928
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,986
I mean, I mean,
it's been a long time.

929
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:53,203
I will find help, but I don't
know how long I can stay up.

930
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,080
Believe in yourself, soldier.

931
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,041
Dorothy's life depends on it!

932
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,834
Sir. Yes, sir.

933
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,958
Ooh, ooh.

934
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,718
Ow.

935
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,800
Ooh!

936
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:28,113
<i> Never told you

937
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:32,534

<i> Even then <i>

953
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:43,106
<i> I'll keep on even then <i>

954
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:48,232
<i> I loved you even then <i>

955
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:56,111
<i> Even if it's uphill now <i>

956
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:00,957
<i> Even when
there are no words how <i>

957
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:07,296
<i> When my heart pounds this loud
Even then <i>

958
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:12,009
<i> If I left you I never meant to <i>

959
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,596
<i> And I won't pretend <i>

960

<i> Even then <i>

961
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,686
<i> I loved you even then <i>

963
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,611

965
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,536

01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:44,785
<i> Even then <i>

967
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:52,167
<i> Even then <i>

968
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:01,141
Well, this is it, Toto.

969
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,814
Hmm.

970
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,782
Glinda!

971
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,201
Oh, Glinda! I'm so glad to see you.

972
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:05,956
Hello, Dorothy and Toto.

973
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:10,294
Welcome to the Jester's
wonderful palace.

974
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,548
Glinda, what's wrong?

975
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,301
Nothing is wrong.

976
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,679
Everything is simply delightful.

977
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,805
Oh, no!

978
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,057
What has that horrible
Jester done to you?

979
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,686
The Jester isn't horrible.

980
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:32,399
He's the most generous
Jester who ever lived.

981
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,903
All hail the Jester!

982
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:41,234
All hail the Jester!
The generous Jester of Oz!

983
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,759
Scarecrow! Tin Man!

984
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,388
Lion!

985
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,016
Glinda. Somebody, help!

986
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:09,269
All hail the Jester!
The generous Jester of Oz!

987
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,564
What's wrong with all of you?
Why won't you help me?

988
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,267
Because I...

989
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,776
don't want them to!

990
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,495
Thanks, everybody!

991
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,622
Job well done.
Back to your cubbies.

992
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:29,998
Thank you.

993
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,210
All hail! All hail!

994
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:37,005
Aren't they just marvelous?

995
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,800
And so obedient.

996
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,014
What have you done to them?

997
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,393
Don't worry. I won't let
them kick the bucket.

998
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:53,980
Besides, buckets are your
weapon of choice, aren't they?

999
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,809
Like the one full of water
you threw on my sister.

1000
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,279
Your sister?

1001
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,492
The Wicked Witch?
But I didn't mean to kill her.

1002
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,411
Oh, don't apologize.

1003
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:10,288
After all, she was wicked.

1004
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,168
And if it wasn't for your meddling,

1005
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,380
this little baby might never
have found its rightful master.

1006
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,382
The witch's broomstick!

1007
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:23,677
I gave that to the Wizard
for the protection of Oz.

1008
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:27,055
You stole it! It belongs to me!

1009
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,517
And no little girl from Kansas
is going to take it away!

1010
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,019
Where once your living
soul did dwell...

1011
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,690
Ah!

1012
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:46,283
Get me
outta here! I can't see a thing!

1013
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,368
Good work, Toto! Great job.

1014
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,830
Dorothy.

1015
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,373
Is that you?

1016
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,625
Oh, I was so worried about you.

1017
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,627
I'm so glad you guys are all right.

1018
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,630
Aw, I think things are better by
the minute now that you're here.

1019
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,049
We were worried about you too.

1020
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,802
You are very brave
to come and rescue us.

1021
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,846
That's
not good! Get me outta here!

1022
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:12,058
Your heart is stronger than
the Jester's magic any day.

1023
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,019
Ah!

1024
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,978
It's beyond belief.

1025
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:18,774
Come back here,
you fuzzy freak of nature!

1026
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,737
- Come on!
- Right behind you, kiddo.

1027
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,565
Let me at 'em!

1028
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,242
You!

1029
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,959
Oh, I see.

1030
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,629
Someone is feeling pouty.

1031
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,967
I think I've let you hold
that scepter long enough.

1032
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,761
Now give it back!

1033
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,139
You!

1034
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,600
Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

1035
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,811
Not you.

1036
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,438
This you. Just throw it to me!

1037
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,357
No! Throw it to me!

1038
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:03,944
Hey, back off,
or I drop the little dog.

1039
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,529
Toto!

1040
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,825
62 degrees north,
with a radial arc of 2.5...

1041
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,452
Please, tell me you're
calculating how I can eat 'im!

1042
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,038
Tin Man, present arm.

1043
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,459
Loading concentric
projectile trajectory schematic.

1044
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,379
No!

1045
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,173
Toto!

1046
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,752
Whoa!

1047
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,818
Wiser, you're flying!

1048
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,987
I know! I-I am!

1049
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:50,866
- Isn't it fantastic?
- Oh, thank goodness.

1050
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:51,950
Yeah.

1051
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,536
It's a simple matter
of wind speed...

1052
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,913
thrust and...

1053
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,291
Aah! Ow! Oh! Ooh!

1054
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,376
- Oh! Ooh!
- Bravery.

1055
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,336
I was going to say weight.

1056
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,168
Aha!

1057
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,306
No!

1058
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,185
Tugg! Look at you!

1059
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,313
Call me Tank now.

1060
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,273
- Dorothy Gale!
- Dorothy!

1061
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,942
Princess, you're okay!

1062
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,396
Fractured, but not broken.

1063
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,200
Why are people always
helping Dorothy Gale?

1064
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:34,618
Ouch!

1065
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,992
Troops deploy!

1066
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,169
The cavalry has arrived! Hooray!

1067
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:03,355
- Oh! This is all your fault!
- Oh!

1068
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,858
Get the troops and destroy
those trespassers!

1069
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,027
Go!

1070
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,115
Brains, Heart and Courage Brigade
reporting for duty, sir.

1071
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,202
Fall in, recruits. Glad
to have you on board.

1072
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:22,123
Forward!

1073
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,375
Battle stations!

1074
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,043
Shotgun. I called shotgun!

1075
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,872
Let's give these
monkeys what for!

1076
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:34,094
- Ready the candypult!
- Gum balls loaded, sir.

1077
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:37,595
- Here they come!
- Let fly!

1078
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,938
Fire!

1079
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,119
Fire!

1080
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,788
Ahh!

1081
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,339
Stop it!

1082
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,542
Let 'em have it!

1083
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,478
Soldiers, cake formation!

1084
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,152
Charge!

1085
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,331
Gotcha!

1086
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,709
Knock yourself out! It's all straw!

1087
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,061
How about this, you flyin' monkey?

1088
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,855
Want some of this?

1089
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,496
Where you going?
You fools! Come back!

1090
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:32,296
Ah, who needs 'em?

1091
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:37,592
Winds of fortune, winds of fate,

1092
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,595
winds come forth and eliminate...

1093
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,514
Dorothy!

1094
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,851
Oh, no.

1095
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,439
Dorothy, run!

1096
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,609
In a twister, you
fell from the sky.

1097
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,779
And in a twister, you shall die!

1098
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,733
Everyone, run for cover. Now!

1099
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,246
Take shelter in the alcoves!

1100
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,999
Dorothy, wait.

1101
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,292
Attack!

1102
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,621
- Oh!
- Stop!

1103
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:52,622
Well, aren't you a
persistent little Munchkin.

1104
01:17:55,171 --> 01:18:00,008
The scepter's power
is mine to wield.

1105
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,137
Dorothy Gale, your fate is sealed!

1106
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,514
No!

1107
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,479
Give... me... that.

1108
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,220
Grab on!

1109
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,180
Pull!

1110
01:18:56,315 --> 01:19:00,861
Oh, Dorothy, I'm
forever in your debt.

1111
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,155
The least I could do is,

1112
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:08,660
oh, I don't know, perhaps
help you rule Oz?

1113
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:13,583
Oz has its leaders, and they
don't need this to rule.

1114
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,046
No!

1115
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,251
My baby!

1116
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:41,735
Fly, fly. Don't ever leave me!

1117
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,382
Oh!

1118
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,558
Oh, Glinda. It's you.

1119
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,393
- It's really you.
- Yes.

1120
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,104
The Jester's spell is broken,

1121
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,815
and we couldn't have
done it without you.

1122
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,483
Oh, it wasn't just me.

1123
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,945
I couldn't have done it without all of you.

1124
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:28,948
But Kansas must be
missing you by now.

1125
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:33,578
I'd love to stay, but I do
think I'm ready to go home.

1126
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,414
Whatever will we do without you?

1127
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,293
There will always be a rainbow
when you need one most.

1128
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,878
Good-bye, Dorothy.

1129
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,755
Good-bye, my friends.

1130
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,506
Good-bye, Dorothy.

1131
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,594
Dorothy.

1132
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:54,640
For the first time
ever, I'm at a loss for words.

1133
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,310
Hoo.

1134
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:00,139
Which reminds me, there's actually
a very funny story about...

1135
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,439
- Good-bye, Wiser.
- Hoo.

1136
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,494
Good-bye, Dorothy.

1137
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,697
And thank you.

1138
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,132
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Dorothy!

1139
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,635
Good-bye, Dorothy. Good-bye.

1140
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,429
- Say good-bye Toto.
- Good-bye!

1141
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,307
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
- Good-bye, everybody.

1142
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,181
Good-bye.

1143
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,670
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

1144
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:09,006
- Henry! She's over here!
- Yeah, there she is.

1145
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,710
Oh! Where on earth have you been?

1146
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,014
I see you're almost packed.

1147
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,934
Dorothy, we've been
through this already.

1148
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,979
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
there's something we can do.

1149
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,522
- What? There's what?
- Follow me!

1150
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,566
- Dorothy, wait!
- Come on!

1151
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,157
Hey! Where are you going?

1152
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,368
Sign this. Can you
write? 'Cause an "X" will do.

1153
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,912
Next!

1154
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:40,872
Wait!

1155
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,749
Oh, goody gumdrops, look who it is.

1156
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,294
Everyone, please.
Don't listen to him.

1157
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,546
These are our homes!

1158
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,840
And nobody has the right
to take them away from us.

1159
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:53,301
Au contraire, my puppet.

1160
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:57,013
This document gives me full
authority to do exactly that.

1161
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,848
- Next!
- Has anybody even looked at this?

1162
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:00,224
- Gimme...
- No.

1163
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,560
- Give... me... that.
- Yep, that's her.

1164
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:03,603
Dorothy!

1165
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,603
Watch it.

1166
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,448
Someone get
me out of here. Would you stop it?

1167
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,409
Look, look. Who is this guy?

1168
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,703
- Hmm.
- Which one is he really?

1169
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,123
Well, let's just see.

1170
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,541
- Get me out of here.
- Huh?

1171
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:29,253
- Get me out of here!
- I'll get you outta here and right to jail.

1172
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:34,967
- Let's go, joker.
- Please, you're making a horrible mistake.

1173
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,386
- Good riddance!
- You can tell that to the judge.

1174
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,430
Hey, what about him?

1175
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:42,183
Where is he going? Get
him. Stop him! He's getting away!

1176
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,727
This is all his fault.
He made me do this!

1177
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,812
I was coerced.
I didn't want to!

1178
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,329
I'm so proud of you.

1179
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,158
That's our girl.

1180
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,335
<i> One day, there'll be laughter <i>

1181
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,129
<i> Blue skies ever after <i>

1182
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:16,380
<i> One day, it's gonna be fine <i>

1183
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:24,016
<i> In my world, dreams
have come and gone <i>

1184
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:27,228
<i> In my life <i>

1185
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:30,273
<i> I know I must be strong <i>

1186
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,401
<i> I knew we'd get through this <i>

1187
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:36,153
<i> Look how much we've grown <i>

1188
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,573
<i> I knew we could do this <i>

1189
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:43,828
<i> Who says you can't go home? <i>

1190
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,998
<i> One day, there'll be laughter <i>

1191
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:50,001
<i> Blue skies ever after <i>

1192

<i> One day, it's gonna be fine <i>

1193
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,843
<i> I know, come tomorrow <i>

1194
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,887
<i> Someway, beg or borrow <i>

1195
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:05,933
<i> I believe dreams
really can come true <i>

1196
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,182
<i> Yes, they do <i>

1197
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:14,859
<i> Somehow, everything has changed <i>

1198
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:21,198
<i> Together, we can
build it up again <i>

1199
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:26,871
<i> We'll pick up the pieces
It isn't done alone <i>

1200
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:30,207
<i> We've been waiting to do this <i>

1201
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:35,004
<i> To find our way back home <i>

1202
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:40,006
<i> Oh, when it all
comes falling down <i>

1203
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:46,471
<i> Oh, you've got to
turn it all around <i>

1204
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:52,647
<i> Yes, I will, yes I will <i>

1205
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,900
<i> One day, there'll be laughter <i>

01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,464
<i> Yes, they do <i>

1212
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:23,922
<i> One day, one day <i>

1213
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:29,476
<i> One day <i>

1214
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,249
<i> When the world
turns upside down <i>

1215
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,873
<i> There's just one thing to do <i>

1216
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:04,128
<i> Shake it off and get back up <i>

1217
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,677
<i> And night in front of you <i>

1218
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,101
<i> There is work to
do and miles to go <i>

1219
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:16,899
<i> No need to stick it out alone <i>

1220
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,234
<i> You're not alone <i>

1221
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:24,363
<i> There's something I know <i>

1222
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:28,200
<i> How to change the bad to good <i>

1223
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:31,996
<i> Our hearts together <i>

1224
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:35,958
<i> Go further than just
one heart could <i>

1225
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:39,670
<i> If you feel so small <i>

1226

 <i>We can see just what we can do <i>

1229
01:27:51,641 --> 01:28:00,602
<i> Oh, no, we don't know
where the world is gonna fly <i>

1230
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:08,451
<i> But we still gotta
give it a try <i>

1231
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:12,366
<i> When the world
turns upside down <i>

1232
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,949
<i> It takes your breath away <i>

1233
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:21,086
<i> Think of all the
wondrous things <i>

1234

<i> No matter how you add it up <i>
