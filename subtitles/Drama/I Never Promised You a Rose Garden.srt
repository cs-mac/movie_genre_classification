00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,229
Thank you.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

3
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,728
Can I get either of you
gentlemen anything else?

4
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,979
You want another drink?

5
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,189
No, I'm fine, thanks.

6
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,107
We'll take another bottle
of the ChÃ¢teau Margaux.

7
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,860
You'll be fine.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,029
Listen, I'm sorry
Michael isn't here yet.

9
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,281
His plane got delayed
getting into Teterboro.

10
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,449
Oh, that's fine.
It's fine.

11
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,284
He likes to meet all
the executive candidates.

12
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,037
It's kind of a tradition
or a neurosis.

13
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,289
(CHUCKLES)
It's nice of him, though.

14
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,958
It is actually. Until
he does his one joke.

15
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,002
"I thought you said
he wasn't handsome."

16
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,296
That's an oldie
but a goodie, I guess.

17
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,258
So what time you
heading out tomorrow?

18
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,635
Well, actually,
Sue's up there now.

19
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,303
I was gonna get
the last bus tonight

20
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,888
and get an early start
tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:18,723
You know, when we called
the office out west,

22
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,391
you were the only
name they gave us.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,851
That's nice of 'em.

24
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:25,146
Listen, Steve, we're a nine
billion dollar company. Yeah.

25
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,483
Someone's recommending you,
it's not nice, it's numbers.

26
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,609
I appreciate that.

27
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,903
Now let me
ask you something.

28
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,322
You guys have
closed more towns

29
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,491
than the team behind you
by almost triple digits.

30
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,578
But the price point that
we pay out on your leases

31
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:43,540
is half of everyone else's.
How do you do that?

32
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,167
(CHUCKLES) Well, I'm
from Eldridge, Iowa.

33
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,418
Meaning?

34
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,589
It might as well be
Rifle, Colorado,

35
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,800
Dish, Texas
or Lafayette, Louisiana.

36
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,385
Any of these
towns we've sold.

37
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,178
I know them,
they know me.

38
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,223
Well, unfortunately, the rest of our
road teams don't find it quite so easy.

39
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,476
I grew up in a large
farming community.

40
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:08,106
Football Fridays, tractor
pulls, cow tipping, all of it.

41
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,610
I mean, I'm one of two guys in my
graduating class who went to college

42
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,696
and studied something
other than agriculture.

43
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,531
It's the biggest fight my
grandfather and I ever had.

44
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,074
Just the pride, I guess.

45
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:22,912
No. It's delusional self mythology.
It's bullshit.

46
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,126
We had a Caterpillar plant down
in Davenport a few miles away.

47
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,878
They closed that down
my junior year.

48
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,421
I didn't think
anything of it.

49
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,631
By the time my senior
prom rolled around

50
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,467
I got to see, first hand, just how
little legs we had to stand on.

51
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:40,179
I mean, the whole farming town
fantasy was just shattered.

52
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,266
The truth was,
without the plant,

53
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,810
without the industry,
we had nothing.

54
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,147
And my whole town was...

55
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,569
I'm not selling them
natural gas.

56
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,571
I'm selling them the only
way they have to get back.

57
00:03:58,698 --> 00:03:59,741
Best of luck, Steve.

58
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,496
Is this the guy? I thought
you said he wasn't handsome!

60
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,667
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,795
Had to stop at home
on my way down.

62
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,256
My daughter,
it's her birthday today.

63
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,051
She's turning 13 already.
I can't believe it.

64
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,253
Thank you.

Oh, stop it.

00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,968
Am I supposed to
call you "boss" now?

69
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,513
They'll let me know.

70
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,015
That's the best
you could do?

71
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,060
No. But I wasn't looking
for the best, was I?

72
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,895
You know what I mean.

over this with you again.

00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,516
Reading this mornin' about all the
gas drillin' in Pennsylvania.

160
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,059
"Stanton Gas."
That you guys?

161
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:09,605
Oh, no, I'm representing Global Crosspower Solutions.
But there's a bunch of us.

162
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,649
Well, you're
probably the best.

163
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,984
Hey, you wanna
come work for us?

164
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:18,072
Even before the drilling, the
initial phase of development

165
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,990
will boost your
town's tax revenue.

166
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,161
That means that money will be
injected into your town immediately.

167
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,872
Here's what
it means to me.

168
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,750
One of the only reasons
I live where I live

169
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,336
is because of the school
my son goes to.

170
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,797
I want everything for him.

171
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,842
And everything, to me,
starts with an education.

172
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,594
STEVE: So our leases
start at $2,000.

173
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,388
DREW: That's it?

174
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,806
STEVE: That's right.

175
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,268
DREW: Well, that's not necessarily
life-changing money, is it?

176
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,019
Well, it's per acre.
Uh-huh.

177
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,105
You have 20. So...

178
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,440
I think there are a lot
of people around here

179
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,942
who would say $40,000, well,
that's pretty good money.

180
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,277
Especially for
doing nothing.

181
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,237
But the real reason
I'm here at this early stage

182
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,532
is because our research shows
that your particular plot of land

183
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,492
has a potentially
high yield.

184
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:07,538
Now what that means is that not
only the size of the deposit,

185
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,083
but actually, the quality of
the shale is in the top tier.

186
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,418
Yeah.

187
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,713
SUE: Carson's chances of going
to college are too low.

188
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,756
And without
a college education,

189
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,217
in this job market,
that means manual labor.

190
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,886
And those jobs are gone.

191
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,221
Technology is
our sons' future.

192
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,473
There's no reason
your town

193
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,141
shouldn't have a
state-of-the-art high school.

194
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,978
Get an education that allows him
to compete at the highest level.

195
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,149
And that's why we offer an 8%
share in any and all profits

196
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,484
that we see
from your well.

197
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,486
So with this
top tier level shit,

198
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,279
what kinda money
are you talkin' about?

199
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh, I can't say yet... At
least ballpark it for me.

200
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,117
I mean, other people
in similar situations.

201
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,244
Millions.

202
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:52,124
(STUTTERING) I mean, you mean per...
You know, you guys or...

203
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,919
You...

204
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,297
Could be a millionaire.

205
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,514
I'll show you what a standard
lease agreement looks like.

206
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,308
That's it right there.

208
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,814
Nice job today.

209
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,820
Kind of anticlimactic. I
thought it would be harder.

210
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,197
It's too easy.

213
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,669
I got it.

(CHUCKLING)

217
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,888
Well, that's great!

218
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,974
I'm proud of ya.

219
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,310
(SOFTLY) Holy shit.

Danny, I don't know
what to say.

221
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,858
A no-hitter.

222
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,569
<i>It was only two innings.</i>

223
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,487
Did anybody get on base?

224
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,364
<i>No.</i>

225
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,992
Well, then that makes it
almost a perfect game!

226
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,327
That is amazing!

227
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,288
<i>It's not the whole
game, Mom.</i>

228
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,291
Okay, well, you should... Still,
you should be celebrating.

229
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,667
You shouldn't be sitting
here talking to me.

230
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,460
<i>Hey, MS. T!</i>

231
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,005
Hi, Colin.

232
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,173
So where are
you guys headed?

233
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,342
<i>I don't know. Sarah Dayton's
having a party, I think.</i>

234
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,387

Okay.

235
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,348
I love you so much.

00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,520
Go.

00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,166
Hey!

239
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,960
Mr. Richards.
Hi, Steve Butler.

240
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,587
Steve, it's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

241
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,964
And call me Gerry, for God's sake.
Oh? Great.

242
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,468
Anything to drink?
Steve?

243
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,178
Uh... A cup of coffee.

244
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,513
For you, Gerry? Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks,Lynn.

245
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,976
Well, listen, I appreciate you
sitting down with me here.

246
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,145
I know you're busy, but I...
Oh, yeah, yeah.

247
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,271
I just thought
it'd be a good idea

248
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,398
for you and I to get together
before the town hall tomorrow

249
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,359
so that we can
get to know each other.

250
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,819
Of course! No, no.
Look, as the senior member

251
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,988
of the supervisors board, thank
you for sitting down with me.

252
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,823
I appreciate it.
(CHUCKLING) Well...

253
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,159
Pretty exciting,
all this natural gas stuff.

254
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,535
It is very exciting.

255
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,829
Whole lot of money down there.
That is also true.

256
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,707
How much, you think? How much money
you think we got down there?

257
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,710
Well, you know,
Global's research team

258
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,337
hasn't finished
their analysis yet.

259
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,007
But I think it could be as much
as 15 to 20 million dollars.

260
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,593
Is that right?

261
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,428
I mean, it could be, yeah.
(CHUCKLING)

262
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,266
Thank you.

263
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,520
Well, listen, I've...

264
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,439
I've been doing a little research
about all this. Oh, good.

265
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,775
Gone online
a little bit, and...

266
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,194
Well, I've read all these
rumblings how natural gas

267
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,571
possibly contaminates water sources?
(SIGHING)

268
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,281
You know, killing
crops and whatnot.

269
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,741
Yeah, you know, I've read
all that stuff too.

270
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,953
There's stories of people
lighting their water on fire.

271
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,873
People getting sick. (CHUCKLING)
Now, Steve, that sounds nasty.

272
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,377
Well, well, there are a lot of
scare tactics at play here, and...

273
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,962
Oh, look, I...

274
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,298
I have a responsibility
to protect these people.

275
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,342
To ensure their safety.
Yes.

276
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,844
And to be honest...

277
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,265
Well, I'm just not so sure
I'm too comfortable

278
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,601
telling my constituents to allow
you folks to come into our town.

279
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,645
No matter how much
money you have.

280
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,772
Okay. Well, Mr. Richards,
because there's...

281
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,399
NOW... (CLEARING THROAT)

282
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,820
I know that you folks have quite
the operation in the works here.

283
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,990
With plans to set up
throughout the state. Hmm?

284
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,408
Yeah.

285
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,786
Well, I'd hate to be the guy
to jeopardize all that for ya.

286
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,958
To lead this one little podunk
town to reject your company.

287
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,210
To reject natural gas.

288
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:09,506
Well, I can't even imagine what
that would do to you guys.

289
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,635
(WHISPERING) Especially if word of
this got out, you know, in the papers,

290
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,053
on the news. Hmm?

291
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,682
It's 30,000.

292
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,769
What's that?

293
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,771
I can offer you
$30,000.

294
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,317
Can I get you
anything else?

295
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,735
You know what, Lynn,
I think we're done here.

296
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,528
Just the check, please.

Now, you wanna rethink that joke of a
number you mentioned earlier? Hmm?

302
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,054
Mr. Richards, I'm just
being straight with you.

303
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,514
It's simple math.

00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,975
Best case scenario, there's
$30 million under your town.

305
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,311
0.1% of that
is $30,000.

That's what I'm authorized
to offer you.

307
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,776
I'm also telling you
it's a one-time offer.

308
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,361
Don't get up.

309

Don't do that.

(SOFTLY) I've been at this table
before and it does not end well.

311
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,084
Look, I don't fault you for
trying, but I'm telling you.

312
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,670
Don't do this.

00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,755
Because we will walk away.
We always do.

314
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,051
And after every single town
within three states

315
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,596
has signed up for this, and the blows
of this economy are almost unbearable,

316
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,181
we're gonna come back.

317
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,516
And we're gonna
offer you nothing.

318
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,434
We will offer
this town nothing.

319

piece of the pie we've offered,

320
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,189
it all goes away.

321
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,275
And we buy this place
for nothing.

Now, please.

Let some other guy
be last

324
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,454
I got it.

325
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,540
(SIGHING)

326
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,916
Thank you.

327
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,506
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

328
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,385
I'll see you tomorrow.

329

(PEOPLE TALKING LOUDLY)

330

Geez! You want me
to leave the whole bottle?

331

They allow you to do that?
(WOMEN WHOOPING)

Hey, Jesse,
three more, please.

JESSE: Jesus Christ!
The two of you.

334
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,826
I don't know what your problem is.
It's my birthday.

335
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,787
I... I have no excuse.

336
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,789
Hmm. Let me guess.

337
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,586
40, married,
marketing, two kids.

338

38, stripper/waitress,
but born to be a singer.

339
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,802
Fuck you!
I'm a teacher!

340
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,429
No, no, I was
talking about me.

341
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,641
You wanna see a dance?
It's 100 bucks.

342
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,892
They wouldn't
give you 30.

343
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,685
No, you haven't seen my moves.
Okay, all right,

344
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,062
now you're
creeping me out.

345
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,563
I'm Steve.
Alice.

346
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,942
Wow, you're going pretty big
for a school night, Alice.

347
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,276
It's my birthday.

348
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,403
Oh, right, right.
Well, actually tomorrow.

349
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,323
So they just give you your day off?
You know, for your birthday?

350
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,533
Or do you have to, like, tell the
kids you have a stomach bug?

351
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,453
Okay, first off, I resent the implication
that I can't hold my liquor.

352
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,205
(CHUCKLES)
And secondly,

353
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,124
we watch videos sometimes
for the first two periods.

354
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,669
Just sometimes, right?
Smart.

355
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,963
So... What's your story?

356
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,840
What brings you to our
booming metropolis?

357
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,343
Oh, I'm actually from
a small town myself,

358
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,761
so this kinda
feels like home.

359
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,888
Oh, yeah? Where's that?
Eldridge, Iowa.

360

Ah! You're a Buckeye!

361
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,518
That's Ohio.
Mmm.

362
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,854
It's the same thing.
Okay, no offense taken.

363
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,148
Alice? Let's go.

Hey, what are we doing?
We drinking or not?

365
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,572
Nice to meet you, Alice.

366
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,160
Um... So you're not gonna even buy
a birthday girl a birthday drink?

367
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,205
No, I think that would
communicate the wrong thing.

368
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,833
(EXAGGERATED GASPING)
You're an asshole!

369
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,002
(CHUCKLING) No, no, I'm... Of
course I'll buy you a drink.

370
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,837
No, forget it. You blew it.
You missed your chance.

371
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,380
STEVE: Wait now.
That's it?

372
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,465
Alice, come on.

373
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,300
So how long you
gonna be in town?

374
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,928
Uh... Yeah, a bit.

375
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:28,473
"A bit"? Oh, my God,
you are a horrible liar!

376
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,267
I'm not lying.

377
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,520
You wanna give a girl
a real birthday present?

378
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,731
Sure, yeah.

379

Wait a minute.
What now?

382
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,032
What's Absolut Madness?

383
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,700
It's pretty much
what it sounds like.

384
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,578
You and Jesse drink
four shots in four minutes,

385
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,123
and if you can get closer to the
bull's-eye on that dartboard,

386
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,209
then we drink for free and you
get your Polaroid on the wall.

387
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,255
That's not at all what it sounds like.
All right, I'm in.

388
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,258
No, I'll tell you what.
Okay, hang on.

389
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,634
What if we double it,
all right?

390
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,386
I'll do eight shots
in eight minutes,

391
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,598
and if I win, everybody at this
bar gets to drink for free.

a really great time.

Did you?

00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,378
Huh? Yeah.
You know, I mean...

414
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,922
Nothing happened, Steve.

which one was yours.

I didn't drive.

didn't let you sleep in your car.

take your number or...

be around for a bit, right?

00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,102
There are these rock
deposits underground,

469
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,646
deep under...
Miles underground.

470
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,900
And they create these drills
that go down two or three miles

471
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,320
and the breaking
of that shale

472
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,488
is what actually
releases the gas.

473
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,614
FRANK: It's called fracking.

474
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,033
GERRY: Excuse me?

475
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,160
FRANK: The process
is calling fracking.

476
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,078
That's right.
That's right, Frank.

477
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,331
Now if you'd let me finish,
please, we have a basket...

478
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:47,167
FRANK: I would encourage all
of you, when you go home,

479
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,086
to Google that word
and see what you find.

480
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,964
Unfortunately, it's not
nearly as simple

481
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,759
as what Supervisor Richards
has just laid out.

482
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,346
Frank? Frank, I'm sure we all appreciate
the point you're trying to make,

483
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,349
but there's no decision to be made here.
We need this.

484
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,476
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

485
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,936
But this thing here,

486
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,939
it may not be
the saving grace

487
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,442
that you all
want it to be.

488
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,861
Now Gerry started
this thing off

489
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:18,615
by saying, "Natural gas coming
in here is lifesaving."

490
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:19,949
And it is.

491
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,619
It's a clean and
efficient resource.

492
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,664
But the way we go about getting
it is some dirty business.

493
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,833
Frank, with all clue respect, I
think you're out of your league.

494
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,378
And the potential for
error is just too high.

495
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,462
GERRY: Thank you, Frank.

496
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,756
FRANK: And there are
people all over the country

497
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,257
whose water is being contaminated...
I got it.

498
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:37,759
Hey! Hey, hey!
GERRY: Okay.

499
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,719
Frank, I have absolutely
had enough of this.

500
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,888
We don't have the time to
have this conversation here.

501
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,056
If you wanna
come down to...

502
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,394
I'm late here.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

503
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,145
I don't mean to
interrupt you, Mr...

504
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,439
Yates.

505
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,858
My name is Frank Yates.

506
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,404
Mr. Yates, are you with
an environmental group?

507
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,114
(CHUCKLING)No

508
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,907
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

509
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,244
No? Well, what line of
work are you in, sir?

510
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,579
I'm a teacher
at the high school.

511
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,289
A teacher?

512
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:11,376
I teach science.
What about you, Mr...

513
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,837
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

514
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,005
Okay, yeah,
I deserved that.

515
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,091
Steve Butler is my name.

516
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,677
I'm a consultant
here with Global.

517
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,096
I only caught the tail end
of what you were saying,

518
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,558
but you seem like someone
who's done his homework.

519
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,687
Could I ask you, though, where'd
you get your information?

520
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:35,692
Mr. Butler, you and I both know the
information I've been talking about

521
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,570
is vast and detailed.

522
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,323
You're probably right. I'm certainly...
I'm not the guy with all the answers.

523
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,951
Oh! Well, then you'd
be the perfect guy

524
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,787
for them to send here
to deny everything.

525
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,958
Well, look, I'm not gonna
deny that this issue

526
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,377
has been made
pretty complicated

527
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:58,214
by a few companies who've
had their share of incidents.

528
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:03,136
But, we've been fracking in
this country for over 50 years.

529
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:07,056
This is not a new issue,
this is not a new technology.

530
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,143
But Global is being sued,
isn't that true, Steve?

531
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,562
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.

532
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,732
Just like any other company our
size, in any other industry.

533
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,943
And the way we handle those
lawsuits is we stand up to 'em.

534
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,863
Because we're not in the business
of handing out free money to people

535
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,740
who make false claims
against us.

536
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,951
And the thing to take away here
is, how many times we've lost.

537
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,079
And that's none. We've never,
ever lost one of these cases.

538
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,458
Well, you can't lose a game that's
still being played. (CHUCKLES)

539
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,002
Look, Steve,

540
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,962
I'm sure that
even you can admit

541
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,299
that fracking is far
from a perfect process.

542
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,552
Perfect?

543
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,971
Of course not.

544
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:52,101
But given the government regulations
that we have to adhere to,

545
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,979
and all the hoops we've jumped
through, it's pretty close to perfect.

546
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,272
(SOFTLY) Steve.

547
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,566
The only reason that natural
gas is so big right now is

548
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,195
because it finally
is the clean alternative

549
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,906
to these dangerous industries
like coal and oil.

550
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,200
If it's such
an incredible alternative,

551
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,662
why did they have to have a man
standing off to the side of the room

552
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,205
to make sure
we all go for it?

553
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,667
Seems to me it should
be able to sell itself.

554
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,420
But you're not the man
with the answers. So, who is?

555
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,548
Because I still
have questions.

556
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,717
Well, I'd like to answer
all of those questions.

557
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,010
But...

558
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,598
I'd just like everybody to
keep something in mind here.

559
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,978
There's no such thing
as a neutral position here.

560
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,854
If you're against this,

561
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,982
you're for coal and oil.

562
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,692
Period.

563
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,152
I mean, unless we talk about
cutting consumption.

564
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,780
And so far that's a conversation
none of us wanna have.

565
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:49,492
Steve, I just came here to
point out that this issue

566
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,161
is a bit more complicated
than it seems.

567
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,664
Well, yeah. I mean,
you've certainly done that.

568
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,625
Great, I think
we should take a vote.

569
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,713
Well...

570
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,506
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

571
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,174
In a couple of weeks,

572
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,677
when we've all had time to think
this whole thing through,

573
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,346
I think we should
put it to a vote.

574
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,015
With all due respect,

575
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,601
the people in this town
really need this.

576
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,269
They need this.

577
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:22,108
And quite frankly, I don't
think that anybody here

578
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,652
is gonna be swayed
by one man.

579
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,279
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,115
You're right.

581
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,456
FRANK: These people
and I came here

582
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:41,628
to say we strongly believe this is not
in the best interest of this town.

583
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,380
STAN: Hey, Gerry.

584
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,424
Gerry, I'm sorry. These kids
have regionals coming up.

585
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Stan,
sure thing. Go ahead.

586
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,471
Well... Look, Frank,
this isn't everybody.

587
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,848
I mean, not even
half the town is here today.

588
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,058
Exactly!

589
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:59,187
And I think all those people would hate to
be left out of such an important decision.

590
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,564
Frank... Gerry,
Gerry, let's face it.

591
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:06,903
We both know that money can lead
very often to bad decisions.

592
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,656
You've seen the
same numbers I have,

593
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:12,450
and with the recent figures
on deposits in this area

594
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,994
at 150 million dollars.

595
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,582
Let's all take some time
to think it through.

596
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,418
150 million dollars?

597
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,089
FRANK: Those are the latest
numbers out of the university.

598
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,341
Well...

599
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,261
150 million dollars
is a lot of money.

600
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,098
Let's have a vote!

601
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,184
GERRY: Say, three weeks time.
We're adjourned!

602
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,186
Asshole.

603
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,573
Holy shit.
Okay, calm down.

604
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,158
Don't tell me
to calm down!

605
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,161
"Natural gas isn't perfect."

606
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,955
What were you thinking?

607
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,875
And that politician.
Why was he so pissed off?

608
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,962
Because I told them that the real
number was 30 million dollars.

609
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,089
Jesus Christ.
I mean...

610
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,717
Well, once again, you came
in below the price point.

611
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,884
Was it worth it?

612
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,177
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,848
You know what, Steven?
Listen to me.

614
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,727
I don't give a shit about your
numbers or your promotion.

615
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:24,480
My kid is in fucking Houston
with his stupid fucking dad.

616
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,899
This is a job,
and then I go home.

617
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,735
I'm sorry, Sue.

618
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,487
Do not say, "I'm sorry,
Sue" one more time.

619
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,827
All right.
The plan's the same.

620
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,371
Nothing's changed.

621
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,166

00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,392
Whoo!

784
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:09,773
No.

785
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:13,027
Jesus.Thought
that would go better.

786
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,446
Really?
I thought it was great.

787
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:19,658
Hey, everybody!
Check, check.

788
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,702
Nope. That's not
a good joke.

789
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,037
Uh...

790
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,663
It just felt like
a much better idea

791
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,165
when I was standing alone
in the back.

792
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,291
MAN: Sing something, man!

793
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:29,335
Oh, God! Definitely...
Definitely you don't want that.

794
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:30,669
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

795
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,087
I'm new in town,
I just came in.

796
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,464
My name is Dustin Noble,

797
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:35,841
I work for a small environmental
company called Athena.

798
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,593
And I...
(CROWD BOOING)

799
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,136
Yeah. I know. I know.

800
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,347
The reason why
I wanted to talk to you is

801
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,683
'cause I'm actually from a small
farming community myself in Nebraska.

802
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:48,437
My family's 5th generation
dairy. And, uh...

803
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:53,650
Well, the farm is gone.
Everything we had is gone.

804
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,030
What happened was, in 2008
my dad found 12 dead cows

805
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,783
out by a creek about a half
a mile from our house.

806
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:05,579
And then, in April about 70% of those
cows were either sick or dead.

807
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,123
And by Christmas he had
defaulted on his payments

808
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,417
and the bank took his house.

809
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,836
Um... The land just died.

810
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:15,255
It just... It just
turned brown and died.

811
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,966
And it made it really easy to see
the only things left standing,

812
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,052
which were these
giant green wells

813
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,221
that said Global on them.

814
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:24,807
Now, these guys at Global,
they're real clever.

815
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:28,018
They have this fine print in
the leases they make you sign

816
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:30,854
that says you can't talk about
it in a court of law, but...

817
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,731
Hell, I'm pretty sure
they don't say anything about

818
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:34,817
telling a couple of friends
at a bar.

819
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:38,612
We had the farm in our family
for 150 years,

820
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,322
but it only took
nine months to lose it.

821
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,491
So, I heard you were
taking a vote.

822
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,201
And, uh, I had to
come down here

823
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:47,329
because you have no idea
how important this is.

824
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,999
And I promise you this is not
an environmental conspiracy.

825
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,918
This is our lives.

826
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,170
Now it's happened and...

827
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:57,464
Hell! It's happened
to one of us,

828
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,216
it can happen to all of us.

829
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,426
So, I guess
I'm just here to say,

830
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,386
my name is Dustin Noble,
and I'm here for you.

831
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,304
So take one of these pamphlets
on the way out... MAN: Bruce!

832
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:05,514
Okay. Thanks a lot.

833
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,391
Come on, Springsteen, baby.
Sing it!

834
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,810
Oh, yikes! No.

835
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,103
(CROWD CHEERING)

836
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,229
No. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

837
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,106
You have no idea
how hard that song is.

838
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,733
It's way higher
than you think, no!

839
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,485
Really?

840
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:20,737
Wow. Okay. Uh...

841
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,532
(SINGING KARAOKE)

842
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:25,159
Ooh.

843
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,836
I've got a big
day tomorrow.

844
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,012
Come on, I need it.

845
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:51,727
This is gross.

846
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,480
That's him. That's the guy.

847
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:00,402
I'll tell you what. If I'm
gonna do this I need the help.

848
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:01,987
So, let's do it for real.

849
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,530
Everybody up! Let's go.

850
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,656
Let's go...

851
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,074
I can handle it.

852
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,164
(CONTINUES SINGING)

853
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,254
Hey, none of what
that guy just said is true.

854
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,215
I'm not a bad guy.

855
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:25,552
(ALL SINGING)

856
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,900
"Global go home."
What a crock of shit.

857
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:42,194
God! Can we go
inside at least?

858
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,612
It's fucking
freezing out here.

859
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:46,114
I mean, how do we know
the guy's even staying here?

860
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,283
Where else
would he stay, Steven?

861
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,244
I mean, none of this shit
can be true, right?

862
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,495
No. Of course, not.

863
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,039
We would've heard about it. They're
not going to send us in blind.

864
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,958
I should have just
confronted him at the bar.

865
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,795
SUE: In front of the whole town?
On open mic night?

866
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,130
STEVE: Okay.

867
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:03,966
Hello!

00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:06,760

I got it. I got it.

Hey, man!
What's going on?

871
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:18,105
Hey! How's it going? Good, good.
What are you doing here?

872
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:19,648
What's that?

873
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,943
What are you doing here?

874
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,446
I mean, Athena? I've never
even heard of that company.

875
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,739
What kind of name is that?

876
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:29,825
Uh, it's Greek originally.

877
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:30,993
Athena's the
goddess of wisdom.

878
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,286
Dude, I fucking
know who Athena is.

879
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,037
Oh, okay.

880
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,998
'Cause you just
said that you didn't.

881
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,125
I'm sorry,
who are you?

882
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:40,252
Are you joking?

I'm Steve.
Hi, Steve.

00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:45,173
Yeah, I'm the guy you were just
talking shit about at open mic night!

Oh, wow! You're from Global.

Yeah, yeah.

887
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,137
Do you know
who you're dealing with here?

888
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,972
I mean, is this
like a joke to you?

889
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,516
I mean, is this some game for
you and your stoner buddies?

890
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,227
Yeah. Oh, I know exactly
who I'm dealing with.

about your company.

I know how to beat it.

in way over his head on this one.

We've already signed more than enough
leases to start development in this town.

Oh, man.
It's too late.

902

I really wouldn't
underestimate these people.

I don't.

904

what you're doing is right,

00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,515
and I really admire
that commitment.

00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:13,757
Well, I'm just telling
these people the truth.

942
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,884
We had an agreement, man.

943
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,177
Did we?

944
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,221
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
we sure as shit did.

945
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:22,641
Listen, Steve.
I came here for a reason.

946
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,643
Oh, my God. What?

947
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,061
I gotta do
what I came here to do.

948
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,395
Okay.

949
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:30,816
You took our money.

950
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:31,983
Yeah.

951
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,361
Oh, but I did put that donation to good use!
So thank you!

952
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:35,570
Hey, Sue!

953
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,697
STEVE: Okay,
if it's all a joke, great.

954
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:39,574
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with here?

955
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,743
We're a nine billion
dollar company.

956
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,453
Okay? Do you know
what we're capable of?

957
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,664
Do you?

958
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,834
Because all I see here
is you and me, Steve.

959
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,545
And one of us is a lot more
confident than the other one.

960
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,838
(LAUGHS)

961
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:55,924
One of us is about to get
punched in the fucking face.

962
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:58,176
Steve, look, I know

963
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,429
this must be really frustrating
for you, and I'm sorry.

964
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:03,014
You're doing all the things
you've done in the past,

965
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,391
it's just not
working this time.

966
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:07,894
It's not working? I have 60% of
this land bought and paid for.

967
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,229
It's over.

968
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,523
Steve, you can have
80% of this land bought.

969
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,692
That's only 40% of the vote.

970
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,318
We're not fighting
for land, Steve.

971
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,070
We're fighting for people.

972
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,572
You're a fucking...

973
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:19,990
These people need help.
Okay? SUE: Steven.

974
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:21,908
I'm here to give it to 'em.
What are you doing?

975
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:23,910
Steve, you're wrong.
All right?

976
00:53:23,994 --> 00:53:25,871
These people have changed.

977
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:27,330
It's not just about
the money anymore.

978
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:28,665
SUE: Get in the car, Steven.

979
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,625
Listen, none of this
is your fault, okay?

980
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,794
It's just...
It's just time.

981
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:34,713
It's just time for what?

982
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,882
For what, man?
What are you selling?

983
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,633
Look at you.
I'll see ya around, Steve.

984
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,930
Yeah, let's just run everything
on rainbows and happy thoughts.

985
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,557
Dipshit.

986
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,309
(ENGINE STARTING)

987
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,440
God damn.

988
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:57,360
(EXHALES) I mean, like, what is
his truck running on, right?

989
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,321
Bio-fuel.
You kidding?

990
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:00,822
It is really?

991
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:02,490
Yes! Like
French fry grease.

992
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,259
Asshole.

993
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,872
Well, hello!
My name's Dustin.

994
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,707
CHILDREN: Hi, Dustin!

995
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:54,376
So well behaved.

996
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:55,794
How many of you guys
live on a farm?

997
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:58,505
Whoa! All right!

998
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:00,048
Me too. And guess what?

999
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,175
This is my farm.

1000
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,885
BOY: That's not a real farm.
What?

1001
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:08,431
There's, uh, Henley. There's a ton of them there.
We should just start there.

1002
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:10,058
Fine. Wherever.

1003
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,567
(LAUGHS)
God damn it!

1004
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:31,871
Pretend that this is the dirt
underneath my farm. All right?

1005
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,541
And this is all the water
that we had.

1006
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,751
All the water
we had to drink,

1007
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:39,129
all the water
the cows had to drink,

1008
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:40,922
all the water the puppies
and kittens had to drink.

1009
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:44,134
All the water
for the fish in the rivers.

1010
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,182
Hey, there, sir.
Good afternoon.

1011
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,685
Can I have a moment
of your time?

1012
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,354
I know why you're here
and we don't need it.

1013
00:55:57,105 --> 00:56:00,066
When they do start drilling,
they go right into the ground.

1014
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,693
Like this. Right?

1015
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,361
Seems pretty simple?

1016
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,238
Well, they don't have
really cool drills,

1017
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:07,198
like some of your dads do
in the garage.

1018
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:10,535
They have huge
big ones like this.

1019
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:13,455
PAUL: There he is!

1020
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:15,623
Hey!

1021
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,209
Hey! I've been waitin'
all day for you folks!

1022
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,004
STEVE: Uh...

1023
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,298
Sorry, I don't think, uh...

1024
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:25,175
Yeah, Paul Geary.

1025
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,801
442 Henley.

1026
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,307
Yeah, come on in, man. Come on up here.
I got some coffee brewing.

1027
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,976
Yup! There you are.
I got you. Okay.

1028
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:38,563
In order to use a drill this
big, it needs a little help.

1029
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:43,318
So, they shoot all this water and all
this sand into the ground with the drill.

1030
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:46,321
And with all that
they also shoot

1031
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,323
chemicals.

1032
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,367
No. Doesn't look scary?

1033
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,162
Okay, great. So what I'm gonna do
is I'll just leave that with you

1034
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,705
and just read that over...

1035
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,040
I'm here.
I'll sign it right now.

1036
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:00,418
Uh,no,no. You should read it over,
um, and I'm gonna come back.

1037
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:02,003
I'm gonna be in town
for a couple of days.

1038
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:04,798
DUSTIN: But they don't
use just one chemical.

1039
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,675
They use all of 'em.

1040
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:11,638
All at the same time. And some chemicals
they don't even tell us about.

1041
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:14,891
So, when they go
to do that drilling...

1042
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,060
Let me show you what happens.

1043
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:19,187
CHILDREN: Ew!

1044
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:20,730
BOY: Disgusting.

1045
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:23,233
Ugh! Gross!
What is that?

1046
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,777
Hey, let me
ask you something.

1047
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:27,570
What do you think?

1048
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,822
What do you mean?

1049
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,116
What? I mean the well,
that's what I mean.

1050
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:33,910
So when they finally start
drilling, there's no way to tell

1051
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,371
where all those chemicals
are gonna go.

1052
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,290
So they start mixing with the
dirt and the sand and the water.

1053
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,459
You think it's going
to be a gusher?

1054
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:43,086
Is that what you call it?
A gusher?

1055
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:45,296
Well, we're gonna
have to do some tests and...

1056
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:47,465
No! Come on, man. There's a whole
process we have to go through.

1057
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:48,716
I'm not talking about test.

1058
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,511
Between me and you.
We're gonna be partners.

1059
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:54,305
Come on, you could tell me.
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

1060
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,432
What's your gut feeling?
Uh...

1061
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,394
You know, you seem
like a lucky guy.

1062
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:00,562
Yeah!

1063
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,813
(LAUGHS)

1064
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,356
Whoo! Yeah!

1065
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,525
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.

1066
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,694
We appreciate you guys coming
by, all right. Thank you.

1067
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:11,239
You want me to show you how bad it
is to have all that dirty water

1068
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:14,242
come back up to the land
in a pretty farm like mine?

1069
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,661
CHILDREN: Yeah. Let's take a look.
All right, lemme show you.

1070
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:18,830
Oh, no. I don't think...
Don't worry about it, I got it.

1071
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,039
Um...
Trust me.

1072
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:21,249
All right. Ready?

1073
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,335
ALL: Whoa!
BOY: That's so cool.

1074
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,254
DUSTIN: Wait, wait, wait.
Why do you think it's cool?

1075
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,381
Come on, guys. We had all
these beautiful animals

1076
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,301
like cows and horses
and chickens.

1077
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,927
We even had turtles.

1078
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:34,429
What's this guy's name?

1079
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,722
ALL: Trigger!

1080
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,140
This is Trigger.

1081
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:38,474
Hey, Trigger.

1082
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,103
Now, do you think Trigger
could survive in my farm?

1083
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,813
ALL: No!
You don't think so?

1084
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,773
ALL: No.
All right, let's try it.

1085
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:47,233
ALL; No!

1086
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:52,572
Gosh, doll! We struck
it big right here. Huh?

1087
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,449
This little two acre lot.

1088
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:55,867
DUSTIN: All right,
there you go. Take one.

1089
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,660
Stick 'em anywhere you can.
Get in trouble!

1090
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:58,953
ALICE: No.
Don't get in trouble.

1091
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,289
All right, so I will...
I will see you around.

1092
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:02,749
Great.

1093
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,335
All right. Bye.
See ya.

1094
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,755
God damn it! It's your

STEVE: 1.8 acres.

How much?

1098
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:17,805
Five thousand.

1099
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,557
And I told him 15%.

anyway, you've never been there.

So I wake up, 6:00 a.m.,
on the ground.

Just on the ground, I didn't
know I'd fallen out of the tree.

so I'm the bad guy.

the fact that we use it.

Here, I got it.

1124
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,031
You know, we spend
a billion dollars a day

1125
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:19,492
to fight for that stuff
overseas?

a nice enough man

so I'm gonna be straight with you
so as to not waste your time.

That little boy right there,

01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:42,557
he lost his father, my brother,
six years ago in Fallujah.

But, let me ask you
a question, Steve.

1137
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:53,067
If I do this,
what am I telling that boy?

1138
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,488
What do I tell him about this
farm that my daddy gave me

1139
01:00:57,572 --> 01:00:59,449
and his daddy gave him?

1140
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:04,329
What am I telling him about what his
daddy went to the desert to fight for?

1141
01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:05,705
See, Steve,

1142
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:09,125
you and I both know the only
reason that you're here

1143
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,002
is 'cause we're poor.

1144
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,088
How many wells you got
up there in Manhattan?

1145
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,673
Or Pittsburgh?

1146
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,093
How about Philadelphia?
Huh?

1147
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,805
It's okay, I get it.

1148

That's what us folks
are here for, right?

You ain't never gonna get what
you came here to take from me.

1152
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:42,575
And to be honest with you, I don't even
like the fact that you're here trying.

1153
01:01:45,203 --> 01:01:47,121
Two minutes, Blake.

"Fuck you, loans."

payments, "Fuck you, payments."

foreclose on your farm,

"Fuck you" money
is the ultimate liberator,

and underneath your town,
there's "fuck you" money.

1243
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:55,299
So think long and hard about
all those brutal days working.

And the goddamn
checks you get from

Think about how much you
made on your best day

1247
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:04,975
and then think real hard about
how much you made on your worst,

01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:52,098
Yeah, what would you
have done then, Steven?

1408
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,893
I'd move so fuckin' fast.

1409
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:59,356
Just take the money
and leave.

1410
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:01,733
Just leave.

1411
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:08,073
And where would we all go?

1412
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:14,704
Excuse me.

1413
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,665
Miniature horses.

1414
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,500
Oh, my God.

1415
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:03,628
Thought we were
losing our minds.

1416
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:07,173
A lot of us
breed them up here.

1417
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,302
Some people consider
them an abomination.

1418
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,930
Big industry here.

1419
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:15,849
What do you get for it?

1420
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:19,603
Not enough, Steve.

1421
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:26,359
You're a good man, Steve.

1422
01:22:28,612 --> 01:22:32,407
You have so many of the qualities
we need more of these days.

1423
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,076
I just wish...

1424
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:38,663
I just wish you
weren't doing this.

1425
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:48,048
You came here and offered us money,
figuring you were helping us.

1426
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:53,386
All we had to do to get it was
be willing to scorch the earth

1427
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:55,096
under our feet.

1428
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,225
We have nothing left to sell.

1429
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,229
We can't afford
to buy anything.

1430
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:07,400
Don't get me wrong,

1431
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:10,570
I'm no better
than my neighbors.

1432
01:23:11,363 --> 01:23:13,490
Hell, I need the money, too.

1433
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:15,825
I guess I'm lucky...

1434
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:23,875
Lucky to be old enough to have a
shot at dying with my dignity.

1435
01:23:28,088 --> 01:23:30,465
I'm worried for us, Steve.

1436
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:39,349
Let me know when
you're ready to head back.

1437
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:54,030
Excuse me, sir? Steve? There's
a package here for you.

1438
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:33,528
Holy shit.

1439
01:24:42,829 --> 01:24:43,830
Sue.

1440
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,001
(KNOCKING)

1441
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,795
We got him. We win! We win.
We win. We win.

1442
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:53,757
The guy's whole sob story
is fucking bullshit.

1443
01:24:53,882 --> 01:24:54,883
What are you
talking about?

1444
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:56,593
Research did
a whole check. Look.

1445
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:57,927
This guy is
fucking lying. Okay.

1446
01:24:58,011 --> 01:24:59,012
What'd they say?

1447
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,555
What is that a picture of?

1448
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,848
Uh, a picture of
his family's farm.

1449
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,057
Okay. And where's
the farm located?

1450
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:04,142
What?
Where's the farm?

1451
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:05,518
Nebraska.
Great. What's that?

1452
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:07,687
A silo.
Look again.

1453
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:13,526
Holy shit.
It's a fucking lighthouse!

1454
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:15,779
Holy shit.

1455
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:18,239
Now geography was
never really my strong suit,

1456
01:25:18,323 --> 01:25:20,950
but I'm pretty sure there
are no oceans in Nebraska.

1457
01:25:21,075 --> 01:25:22,285
He made the whole thing up.

1458
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:23,995
He made the whole thing up.

1459
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:26,748
And when the town finds out
that he lied to them...

1460
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:29,542
That he was manipulating them
in order to get their vote.

1461
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:32,045
Oh, they're gonna have a fucking
field day with this guy.

1462
01:25:33,713 --> 01:25:34,714
We win.

1463
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:38,426
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1464
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:44,516
Gerry Richards.

1465
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:47,894
Yeah, Steve.

1466
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,191
What?

1467
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:58,196
Jesus.

1468
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,534
I've already been
to see Richards.

1469
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,787
Everyone in town's
gonna know by morning.

1470
01:26:06,996 --> 01:26:08,540
I just... I wanted
you to hear from me.

1471
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,253
You deserve someone
who tells you the truth.

1472
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:20,009
What're you doing here, Steve?

1473
01:26:20,844 --> 01:26:22,262
I'm not a bad guy.

1474
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:26,766
Good night.

1475
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:33,773
Alice...

1476
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:41,030
If I had asked you out?

1477
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,074
I would have said yes.

1478
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:46,494
(LAUGHS)

1479
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,038
Good night.

1480
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:07,515
DUSTIN: Thank you.

1481
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:18,443
You know, what you did is going
to hurt a lot of people.

1482
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:24,824
What were you thinking, man?

1483
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:27,410
How does somebody
even do that?

1484
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:31,623
You came in here and based your
entire case against us on a lie?

1485
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:32,707
All right, Steve.

1486
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:35,043
I already talked to
Richards. Just...

1487
01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:37,253
Let me go.

1488
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:39,589
I mean, did you think
we wouldn't find out?

1489
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:43,885
You just
guaranteed we win.

1490
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,018
You know,
you're gonna lose.

1491
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:53,728
Huh?

1492
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:58,566
Yeah, it might not be Athena that does it,
but one of these days, you're gonna lose.

1493
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:01,527
I just hope I'm there
to see it!

1494
01:28:01,653 --> 01:28:03,863
I guarantee it's not gonna
be Athena that does it.

1495
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,366
I mean, do you even know
how bad this is for you?

1496
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:11,037
Athena's done. Done.
It's over for you.

1497
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:17,543
What else was I
supposed to do?

1498
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:19,879
I mean, it's not
a fair fight, Steve.

1499
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:23,675
I'm out there doing what?
Handing out flyers and posters?

1500
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,553
This vote meant everything
and I had to do it.

1501
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,598
No, you didn't. You didn't.
You fucked up.

1502
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:34,394
You tell me, Steve.
What do I do?

1503
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:37,647
In a world where
no one cares.

1504
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:40,775
Where a company like yours can
just go into Lafayette, Louisiana

1505
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,360
and do something like that.

1506
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:45,029
Or McKinley.
Or the next place.

1507
01:28:45,113 --> 01:28:48,616
Because let's be honest, it's just gonna
happen again and again and again.

1508
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:53,329
So you tell me, what
am I supposed to do?

1509
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,918
I never told you this farm was
in Lafayette, Louisiana...

1510
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:04,215
What? What are you
talking about?

1511
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:08,428
I never told you this happened in Lafayette, Louisiana.
How could you know that?

1512
01:29:11,014 --> 01:29:12,765
Steve, these people
needed my help.

1513
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:14,767
Okay? They called me.

1514
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:16,102
No. No.

1515
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:19,022
No, you said yourself,
we're too clever for that.

1516
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:22,191
These deals we have with these
people and the fine print,

1517
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:23,735
they don't call anybody.

1518
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:25,903
Certainly not
an environmentalist.

1519
01:29:26,112 --> 01:29:27,572
Okay, Steve.

1520
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:28,781
Dustin?

1521
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,617
How'd you know
where this farm was?

1522
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:36,956
Dustin?

1523
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,877
Fuck.
That was stupid.

1524
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:43,463
I should've just
got in my car.

1525
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:45,506
What?

1526
01:29:47,467 --> 01:29:49,594
We were never gonna
let them vote, Steve.

1527
01:29:58,519 --> 01:29:59,854
You're with Global.

1528
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:03,357
Jesus Christ.

1529
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,193
You're with Global.

1530
01:30:05,318 --> 01:30:08,279
Did you really think they were going to
leave something like this in your hands?

1531
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:10,656
After you let them
bring it to a vote?

1532
01:30:11,074 --> 01:30:13,701
Steve, companies like Global,
they don't rely on anyone.

1533
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:15,036
That's how they win.

1534
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:18,122
They win by controlling
every outcome.

1535
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:21,084
And they do that by
playing both sides.

1536
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,421
But, no.
I was...

1537
01:30:25,505 --> 01:30:26,506
What?

1538
01:30:27,548 --> 01:30:28,549
What did you do?

1539
01:30:30,218 --> 01:30:32,011
What is it you think you did?

1540
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:35,598
I did everything.

1541
01:30:36,808 --> 01:30:38,976
Athena is me.

1542
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:44,482
This story is me. Getting you that package
to give to the politician, that's me.

1543
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,026
You only did
what I let you do.

1544
01:30:48,736 --> 01:30:52,240
But you did a good job.
Now it's over. We win.

1545
01:30:56,536 --> 01:30:57,537
And this farm...

1546
01:30:57,829 --> 01:31:01,332
Stay with me. All right? This
farm, that doesn't matter.

1547
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,501
They've already dealt
with this. This is done.

1548
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,379
They said this
was a false claim.

1549
01:31:08,506 --> 01:31:09,507
Did they?

1550
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:13,511
You're gonna want to stop
asking questions now, Steve.

1551
01:31:14,387 --> 01:31:16,055
You're at the big kids table.

1552
01:31:18,516 --> 01:31:21,144
But listen,
it has been fun.

1553
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:24,939
I think you're really a good choice for this.
You'll do a good job.

1554
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:29,902
Good luck in New York.

1555
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:40,955
(ENGINE STARTS)

1556
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:05,229
Funny.

1557
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:07,565
Smart.

1558
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,858
GERRY: We've got about an hour before this
game gets started to get the vote in.

1559
01:32:51,651 --> 01:32:53,694
Go Pioneers, yeah!

1560
01:32:54,237 --> 01:32:56,405
Listen up, here's the way
this thing is gonna work.

1561
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,201
If your last name starts
with the letter A...

1562
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:01,619
Lemonade?

1563
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:10,878
Is it good?

1564
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:12,004
Really good.

1565
01:33:21,806 --> 01:33:23,266
You got a real
good spot here.

1566
01:33:23,683 --> 01:33:24,725
I know.

1567
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:35,569
Wow.

1568
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:37,822
I know.

1569
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:51,419
Uh, mister?

1570
01:33:53,254 --> 01:33:54,547
You forgot your change.

1571
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:56,841
Just go ahead and keep it.

1572
01:33:57,133 --> 01:33:59,135
The sign says
it's only 25 cents.

1573
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:02,888
So...
It's only 25 cents.

1574
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:25,786
Oh, oh, one more thing.
Before we get to the vote,

1575
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:27,997
Steve Butler just wanted
to say a few words.

1576
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:43,804
I'll be very brief.

1577
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:50,436
I know there's been a lot of
talk about this... This picture.

1578
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:56,233
So I brought it
to show everybody.

1579
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:01,697
That's the lighthouse
and the ocean.

1580
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:06,327
I was looking
at this picture...

1581
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:10,748
Looking at it
for a while last night.

1582
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:14,043
For a long while.

1583
01:35:15,002 --> 01:35:17,546
And found myself staring
at this barn.

1584
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:22,301
The Wood's chipping away and
the paint's flaking off there.

1585
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:24,428
Probably from all
the salt water in the air.

1586
01:35:24,678 --> 01:35:28,474
But it reminded me
of my grandfather's barn.

1587
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:33,270
That barn was the bane
of my existence.

1588
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:34,480
(CROWD CHUCKLES)

1589
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:38,818
It was immaculate. We painted
it every other summer.

1590
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:41,278
Just him and me.

1591
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:45,866
I'd ask him, "Why?
Why do we have to do this?"

1592
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:48,828
And he'd look at me and say,

1593
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:52,748
"This is our barn. Who else
is going to do it?"

1594
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:56,502
I used to think
the guy was crazy.

1595
01:35:58,838 --> 01:36:01,173
And stubborn. Proud.

1596
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:07,096
But, see. I think...

1597
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:13,686
He was just trying to teach me what
it meant to take care of something.

1598
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,279
Okay.

1599
01:36:23,737 --> 01:36:27,533
Well, you all know
that Dustin lied.

1600
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,121
Tried to get you to vote the
way he wanted you to vote.

1601
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:35,458
See ya.

1602
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:39,295
STEVE: And that's exactly what he
did because you are about to vote

1603
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:41,213
exactly as he
wants you to vote.

1604
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:46,886
Because Dustin is not
an environmentalist.

1605
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,514
Dustin works for Global.

1606
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,266
(CROWD GASPS)

1607
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:58,731
They couldn't afford an
environmental presence here so

1608
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:00,649
they created their own.

1609
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,988
They're trying to make
this decision for you.

1610
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:09,575
And they're betting that
you'll let them.

1611
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:11,827
This is a real farm.

1612
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:15,414
And they told these people
exactly what

1613
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:18,584
I've told a lot of you.
In fact,

1614
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,962
I've looked a lot of you
right in the eye

1615
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:27,343
and told you there's a bunch of money
under your feet and we can get it out

1616
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,428
risk free,
guaranteed.

1617
01:37:31,889 --> 01:37:33,766
Clearly, that's not true.

1618
01:37:39,313 --> 01:37:40,898
I'm sorry.

1619
01:37:50,157 --> 01:37:51,784
Look, is this
gonna happen here?

1620
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:55,329
I honestly don't
believe that it will.

1621
01:37:58,332 --> 01:38:00,584
But they know the only reason
we're all gathered here

1622
01:38:00,668 --> 01:38:03,504
is to ask the question,
"What if it did?"

1623
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:06,215
And I don't know
what to tell you.

1624
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:09,843
I don't know
what to say anymore.

1625
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:14,807
But where we are now,

1626
01:38:18,602 --> 01:38:19,979
where we're headed,

1627
01:38:25,818 --> 01:38:27,987
we might be betting
more than we think.

1628
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:33,284
Everything that we have
is on the table now.

1629
01:38:34,326 --> 01:38:36,537
And that's just
not ours to lose.

1630
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:43,419
But this is still our barn.

1631
01:38:51,677 --> 01:38:53,178
Go Pioneers.

1632
01:38:59,727 --> 01:39:00,728
Mmm-hmm.

1633
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:03,230
Yup.

1634
01:39:06,233 --> 01:39:08,152
Okay. Yeah.
I understand.

1635
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:12,948
Was that them?

1636
01:39:13,157 --> 01:39:14,241
Yes.

1637
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:16,035
You are definitely fired.

1638
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:18,787
And...

1639
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:21,749
They want me
in the city tomorrow.

1640
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:27,212
Well, that's...
That's great.

1641
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:42,728
You want a lift somewhere?

1642
01:39:42,895 --> 01:39:44,897
What, are you
kidding me?

1643
01:39:46,106 --> 01:39:47,232
It's open mic night.

1644
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:49,234
(LAUGHS)

1645
01:39:53,947 --> 01:39:55,449
It's just a job.

1646
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,836
Oh, for God's sakes.
Just get some new boots.

1647
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,713
Not a chance.

1648
01:40:47,918 --> 01:40:49,294
Hey-
Hey-

1649
01:40:53,507 --> 01:40:54,883
That's it?
Yeah, that's it.

1650
01:40:57,928 --> 01:40:59,221
Sorry I can't make the vote.

1651
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:00,889
Oh, I think we'll be okay.

1652
01:41:06,687 --> 01:41:07,688
That's that.

1653
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:12,985
That's that.

1654
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,652
Are you the owner
of this place?
