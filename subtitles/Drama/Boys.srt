(man over radio) Ten-four. I'll notify PD
with a description of the vehicle.

<i>J' Well, no one told me about her</i>

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,238

12

<i>J' Well, no one told me about her</i>

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,310
J‘ What could! do?

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>J' Well, no one told me about her</i>

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,753
<i>J' And they all knew</i>

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,594
<i>J' Well, it's too late to say you're sorry</i>

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,592
Mrs Patty Va re?

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,560
Sorry to bother you, but we're trying to
speak with everyone who was at a party

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,435
at a William Ryan's house last night.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,075
- You were at a party at the Ryan house?
- ls something wrong?

34
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,434
Well, to start with, somebody stole a car
belonging to Mr and Mrs Rune Carter

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,836
from the parking lot
of the Landmark Tavern.

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,669
- Were you at the Landmark Tavern?
- I was at Billy Ryan's.

37
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,514
That's only 100 yards
from the Landmark.

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,836
I didn't see the Carters.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,157
How did you get home last night, ma'am?

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,832
I got a ride with some girls from Blakely.
Look, if that's all, I got toast in the toaster.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,439
(cop) ls anyone here with you?
In the house?

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,517
Like who?

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,472
Like anyone.

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,035
Not right now.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,912
OK.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,400
That's legal.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,831
I'm just wondering now
if you think you'll be here later.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,998
- What for?
- In case we need to come back.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,792
Well, I won't be. I'm going out for a ride
and I'm not gonna be here. I'm sorry.

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,116
A ride in that Porsche?

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,470
I'm going for a ride on a horse.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,116
- Gotta warn you, it's supposed to rain.
- Thank you.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,552
OK.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,956
<i>J' Well, it's too late to say you're sorry</i>

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,153
<i>J' How would I know, why should I care?</i>

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,750
<i>J' Please don't bother trying to find her</i>

<i>J' She's not there</i>

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
<i>J' Well, let me tell you 'bout
the way she looks</i>

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,589
<i>J' The way she acts, the colour of her hair</i>

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,472
<i>J' Her voice is soft and cool</i>

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,511
<i>J' Her eyes are clear and bright</i>

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,597
<i>J' But she's not there</i>

63
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,834
(horse whinnies)

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,192
"| sat at the table then with bloody hands."

65
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,314
"| sat waiting for the sun to rise with
my wife - at least, the biggest part of her -

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,397
still sitting beside me."

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,318
"Her head was chopped off

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,594
and, having rolled to wedge beneath
the dishwasher, no longer fazed me."

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,916
"All I could see was that plastic barrette

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,991
clipped onto the back of her hair
and the trail of her blood leading to me."

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,279
That's it.

72
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,751
You're messed up, man.

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,952
- (teacher) You call that writing?
- Pardon me?

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,276
You call that writing?

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,191
- What d'you mean? What's wrong with it?
- It's not writing.

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,793
That's chocolate syrup
on chocolate ice cream. Now get rid of it.

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,235
- You asked for a scene of domestic...
- Rancour. In the style of John Cheever.

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,034
- That's what it is.
- I don't think so.

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
Well, I do.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,911
What you have written
is not in the style of John Cheever.

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,069
Therefore you will rewrite it
before we see each other again.

82
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,155
All right, sir.

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,159
That's what you should
have said in the first place.

84
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,036
In the meantime, I've also
given you a zero for being late.

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,072
- I'm cutting that class tomorrow.
- Why? Because he didn't like your story?

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,395
No.

87
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,878
Because he gave me another zero
for being, like, three minutes late.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,311
He gives the same zero
for being late as for being out.

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,795
Better off just cutting.

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,117
He starts off five minutes early
and acts "Where were you?"

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,311
Yeah, I know it, dude.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,159
He leaves me no choice.
It's designed to make you cut.

93
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,715
It's fine with me. I'm glad to do it.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,309

100

102

103

<i>J' You just don't understand</i>

106
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,911
Hey, Heinz. Fucked again, huh?

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,556
- I'm going to go get something to eat.
- Have fun in class?

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,152
- Frances. Hey.
- Don't bother me.

109
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,749
Gimme some potato chips, all right?

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,598
- 2.50.
- What?

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,429
That's for five of ‘em, doll.
50 cents apiece. Four on credit's the limit.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,551
- Frances.
- That's my name.

113
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,552
- I don't have it on me.
- Oh, please.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,355
Please what? I'm on a scholarship.
The Elks lodge in Elliston pays my way.

115
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,917
I see. Well, maybe you'd better tell your
Grand Pooh-Bah to set up a snack fund.

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,714
- Milkshake or egg cream?
- Baker, I gotta talk to you.

117
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,480
- Fucking bitch'd let me starve.
- I heard that.

118
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,510
Frances.

119
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,313
- Watch it.
- (boy) Baker.

120
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,670
- Yeah, what?
- I gotta talk to you privately.

121
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,714
- Privately? You got dirt on your face.
- You gotta get the car.

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,276
- What?
- I left a lady out there with Murphy.

123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,711
- What do you mean, "a lady"?
- What do I mean? A lady!

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,830
What lady?

125
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,272
Well, I don't know what lady, Baker, but
we need to go get her. We have to drive.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,950
- Baker, gimme some money, I'm hungry.
- Hey, guys, want a chip?

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,072
- Hey, where'd you get those?
- Found them.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
Baker, please.

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,195
- All right, let's go.
- You'll go with me?

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,073
Yeah, I just said "let's go".

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,510
Where you going? Gimme those.

132
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,713
- What's with them?
- I don't know.

133
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,593
- Cooke, try to take it easy. We'll find her.
- I know.

134
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,034
What were you guys doing out here?

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,719
We were cutting IFS.

136
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,073
We were coming across the field and saw
a horse. All saddled up but no one around.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,909
Murphy wanted to take off.
I thought maybe the horse was lost or...

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,395
All right, there's Murphy.

139
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,875
(faintly) Over here!

140
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,877
Come on!

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,157
(Murphy) Hurry up!

142
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,077
(Cooke) Let's go.

143
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,838
Look at her.

144
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,073
Look at this.

145
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,275
(Cooke) I told you.

146
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,550
She moved while you were gone.

147
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,559
What do you mean? What did you do?

148
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,115
I didn't do anything. I didn't touch her.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,673
What happened to her?

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,915
(moans)

151
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,917
He") me!

152
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,554
- Whoa.
- See?

153
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,194
Man, I say we get the hell outta here.

154
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,598
- That's brilliant, Murphy.
- (Murphy) Well, what do you suggest?

155
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,439
I don't know. I'm thinking.

156
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,555
Miss?

157
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,395
Ma'am, are you in there?

158
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,833
HEY-

159
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,230
Where's my horse?

160
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,111
- We're taking you to a doctor.
- No. No.

161
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,153
- Why not?
- I'm fine.

162
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
- I don't think you're fine.
- I don't want to go to a... a doctor.

163
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,876
(Cooke) What if something's broken?

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,517
- Do you want us to drive you home?
- Where do you live?

165
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,393
(Baker) Do you live around here?

166
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,160
- Ma'am?
- (Cooke) Uh-oh.

167
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,990
Oh, fuck this.

168
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,794
- Murphy, shut up.
- Well, now what? Now what?

169
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,880
We'll take her with us.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,196
We're not gonna take her to school.

171
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,358
Why not? She said not to take her home.

172
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,711
So take her to a gas station, Baker.
Call the freaking cops!

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,629
- Murphy, did you hear what she just said?
-Yes, I heard her!

174
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,559
What if she's on the run?
I can't just turn her in.

175
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,197
Tum her in for what, Baker?
For falling off a horse?

176
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,789
Well... I don't know for what.

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,072
Hey, dude.

192
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,874
- What are you guys doing here? It's 6.30.
- We needed a lighter.

193
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,519
-You don't have a lighter?
- They're all in here, thief. Ready?

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,036
Ready.

195
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,794
- (Baker) Aren't you guys going to dinner?
- Oops.

196
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,355
All right. There we go.

- Oh, dude, your dad called again.

198
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,151
You want to know something? I think
he likes talking to me more than you.

199
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,237
I'm really glad, but it's, like, 6.30.

200
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,159
I think he said you forgot
your mom's birthday again.

201
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,319
- (puts on deep voice) Sonny, goddammit!
- Don't call me that.

202
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,152
Maybe if you ran a humorous anecdote
by him now and again, he'd like you more.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,634
Hey, it's Jimmy Cooke.

- What?

205

- My name isn't Jimmy. It's John.
- Oh.

John. Johnny. Jimbo.

How's it going, Bill?

208
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,270
- Get the hell out of here. All of you.
- What'd you say?

209
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,798
Hey, man, that was my shit.

210
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,150
This is my room.

211
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,877
- What's wrong with you, dude?
- Nothing. I just want some privacy.

212

Do you guys understand that?

213

- No, asshole.

I can't bring her up until I get rid of you.

Yeah, in your dreams.

218
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,398
Thanks, guys!

219
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,318
We're coming.

220
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,432
- Jeez. What did you do, stop for a Coke?
- ls she all right?

221
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,518
How do I know?
I can't tell if she's dead or alive.

222
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,314
What do you want with her?
She's an accident victim.

223
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,192
(Baker) I know that.

224
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,038
- Come on. Let's get her inside.
- (Murphy) Not me.

225
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,997
Forget it. I'm going to dinner. You can do
whatever you're trying to do without me.

226
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,275
I'm trying to help her.

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,877
Come on.

229
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,395

230
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,477
It's a 20.

231

"Eyes ha..."

233
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,390
- Hazel.
- Right.

234
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,354
- "Birth date: two, nine..."
- She's 25.

235
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,274
- She's saying something again.
- ls she up?

236
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,835
She might be. I don't know.

238
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,391
You're up.

239
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,238
(Cooke) Hi.

240
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,636
How are you feeling?

241
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,837
(Baker) Nothing's broken, is it?

242
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,078
- (Cooke) We took your boots off.
- So you could sleep.

243
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,518
Are you all right?

244
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,280
- (Cooke) Want us to call the infirmary?
- No.

245
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,471
She speaks.

246
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,796
We should take her to the infirmary.

247
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,560
- She just said no.
- Where am I?

248
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,832
You're in my room. It's my room.

249
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,395
- I'll call the infirmary.
- Cooke, Jesus, she just said no.

250
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,751
- I think I'd like to sit down.
- Sure.

251
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,029
Where's my horse?

252
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,719
We're not sure.

253
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,038
Cooke, why don't you go get her
something to eat? Get her a sandwich.

254
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,310
(Cooke) Now?

255
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,671
ls that what you want? Are you hungry?

256
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,552
Not really.

257
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,358
- Get her some soup.
- Why don't we flip to see who goes?

258
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,910
All right, I'm going. If they don't
have soup, are doughnuts OK?

259
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,395
Doughnuts are fine. Go.

260
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,514
So.

261
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,516
- What'd you do?
- I fell off my horse.

262
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,598
Why didn't you want to go to a doctor?

263
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,080
ls that what I said? I don't remember that.

264
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,159
- I'm not surprised.
- Why? What else did I say?

265
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,233
(knocking)

266
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,032
You said... you didn't want to go home.

267
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,073
Did I?

268
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,750
Yeah. You know, it sounded like
you must have done something.

269
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,120
Mrs Patty Va re?

270
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
- Did you steal something?
- What?

271
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,560
Did you kill someone?

272
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,910
What are you talking about?

273
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,270
The perfect crime.

274
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,472
But then it started to heat up
so you had to get out.

275
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,511
What are you saying?

276
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,472
I don't know.

277
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,637
It was just an idea.

278
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,675
I guess I was just hoping... Someone like
you in the middle of a field, all alone.

279
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,269
I get to rescue a fugitive or something.

280
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,956
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

281
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,960
Don't apologise.
You're not a disappointment.

282
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,120
What's your name?

283
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,799
Louise.

284
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,674
Louise?

285
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
(knock at door)

286
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,194
Can you hang on a minute?

287
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,157
- Who is it?
- Murphy. Open up!

288
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,398
- I can't right now.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

289
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,878
- It means you can't come in.
- Baker, open the door or I'm getting Hunt.

290
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
Whoa. She's up.

291
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,515
- (Baker) What do you want?
- ls she all right?

292
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,712
- She's fine.
- It's a good thing she woke up.

293
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,796
Murphy-

294
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,878
She could've died on you, bud.

295
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,599
What's your name?

296
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,555
- Louise.
- (Baker) Get the hell outta here.

297
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,479
- Are you hungry?
- She's not hungry.

298
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,399
- Do you live around here?
- Leave her alone!

299
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,353
You leave her alone, dude.

300
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,630
How about a cigarette?

301
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,233
Hey! Ow! Stop it!

302
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,510
(Baker) Excuse us for just a second.

303
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,957
(Murphy) Let go of me!

304
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,116
- Visiting hours are over. You hear me?
- Look like yours are just getting started.

305
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,153
You have a very big mouth
for an eighth grader, Murphy.

306
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,955
My mouth is nothing
compared to that boner in your pants.

307
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,117
- What did you say?
-You heard me.

308
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,153
(Baker) You'd better hope
I misunderstood you.

309
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,315
Hi.

310
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
- What do you want, Marco?
- Nothing.

311
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,831
- Marco, go get Mr Hunt for me. Now!
- Marco, don't you dare.

312
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,917
Marco, go!

313
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,830
You're gonna get so booted for this.

314
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,396
- You think so?
- I know it, man. You're outta here.

315
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,630
Murphy, you're gonna make somebody
a great cop someday. You know that?

(horse whinnies)

317
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,876
Still not back?

318
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,957
Still not back.

319
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,439
Figure she went somewhere
with the ballplayer?

320
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,712
Hard not to think it. I don't know.

321
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,117
I don't like feeling like I'm being avoided.

322
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,996
Well, it's not like this one
hasn't gone on binges before.

323
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,711
- You know her?
-Yeah, I know her.

324
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,629
So, where'd she be goin‘ in such a hurry
that she'd leave her horse on Route 9?

325
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,515
No idea. She could be anywhere. Horse
could've walked down there himself.

326
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,270
One time she left him tied to
Fenton's back porch. You know Fenton?

327
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,873
-Yeah, I know him.
- She left that horse for three days.

328
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,230
Well, where was she?

329
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,273
I don't know. She and Fenton
went somewhere or other.

330
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,711
One thing lead to another, I guess.
I don't know. Fenton won't say.

331
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,358
- She's kind of a firecracker.
- Yeah? That's what I hear about Bud.

332
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,677
He may have met his match with this one.

333
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,355
Right.

334
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,077
- Come out with your hands up!
- Jeez! You nearly made me drop this.

335
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,669
-You spilled some, dude.
- Shit.

336
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,872
-You working room service now?
- No, asshole.

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,915
-You treat him like he's Elvis.
- I do not. This is for me.

338
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,475
- I don't think so.
- What do you know?

339
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,796
- We know he's trying to hide it.
- Hide what?

340
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,197
You're gonna get nailed
just for knowing about it.

341
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,393
- So illegal, dude.
- No, he's just making sure she's all right.

342
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,034
- She?
- I mean...

343
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,719
- Oh, man.
- I don't believe it.

344
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,354
- It's a girl.
- I knew it. I knew it.

345
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,711
- That snake!
- Wait. What are you talking about?

346
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,151
- Come on.
- What girl? I didn't say anything.

347
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,749
We'll catch you later, mouth.

348
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,958
Thanks.

349
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,710
I'll keep an eye on the door,
if you need me.

350

Hey. Patty.

- Come here. Meet someone.

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,557
Come on.

362

Bud, this is Patty. Patty, Bud Valentine.

Bud Valentine?

364
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,194
You know, there's a pitcher named
Bud Valentine. He pitches for Pittsburgh.

- Yes, ma'am.

How nice for you.
I'm dating a guy who's a big baseball fan.

That's how I know your name.

370
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,274
If he's dating you, he's a lucky guy.

Aren't you sweet?

373

No, he isn't.

She left.

- You're lying.
- Maybe she's in the bathroom.

- Why's that?

466
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,910
-You've still got her in your room.
- Yeah? How do you know?

467
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,032
The whole school knows, Baker.
Even Marco saw her.

468
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,313
- Marco didn't see her.
- How long is she staying here?

469
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,990
Why do you ask? It's not your problem.

470
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,715
- I'll tell you something my mom said.
- What?

471
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,674
Give a stray kitten too much milk, you'll
have a permanent cat on your hands.

472
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,918
- She sounds like a genius.
- Shut up.

473
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,716
Murphy, you don't get it.
It's not what you think at all.

474
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,797

(thunder)

476
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,032
- What are you reading?
-Your homework, I guess.

477
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,596
It's pretty gory-.

478
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,194
It's just a story.

479
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,870
I like the part with
the three prostitutes in the tub.

480
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,595
- Can I have that back?
- What class is this for? Creative writing?

481
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,075
- Yeah.
- There's no grade on it.

482
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,555
- It's an elective.
- A what?

483
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,273
It's pass-fail.

484
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,592
Oh.

485
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,996
So, how you doin‘ so far?
Are you passing or failing?

486

50-50.

487
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,511
Can I have that back?

488
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,550
It's not bad. A little flowery.

489
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,149
Yeah, that's what my teacher says.

490
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,715
- Really?
- Sort of.

491
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,273
- ls your head all right?
- Oh.

492
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,710
I have a cut.

493
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,079
How'd you get a cut there
if you fell on your back?

494
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,118
Look, my name's not really Louise.

495
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,438
I know.

496
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,312
It's Patty.

497
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,479
Patty.

498
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,876
Yeah.

499
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,510
I knew this would happen.

500
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,836
What would happen?

501
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,798
- That I'd get thrown out.
- You got thrown outta school?

502
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,435
Not yet, but I look at you
and I know that I will be.

503
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,199
Would it help if we left?

504
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,199
If you left? Yeah, it'd probably help.

505
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,996
You wanna come with me?

506
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,271
I'm in high school.

507
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,440
You could help me find my horse.

508
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,111
If you want.

509
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,114
What's wrong? What are we doing?

510
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,955
We're not gonna find
your horse out here, Patty.

511
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,752
Maybe someone found him
and took him back to your house.

512
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,030
Maybe we should check at your house.

513
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,356
You don't look like you like that idea.

514
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,756
I don't. I guess.

515
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,791
- What are you lookin‘ at?
- Those lights up there.

516
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,638
It's the fair.

517
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,717
You wanna go?

518
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,274
- Now?
- Yeah.

519
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,597
Are you kidding?
I have to get back to school.

520

- I'm sure it is, but...

00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,797
- Patty.
- What?

522
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,956
I feel like I woke up with the dial
on the wrong channel or something.

523
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,640
I feel like that every day.

- You told me this one five minutes ago.

and one of them sees their husband...

Boyfriend, with a bunch of roses.

- Where you been at?

549
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,920
I've been here tonight.
Where've you been?

550
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,829
- Having a couple of brewskis, huh?
- Yeah.

-You met Jilly?
- We met, I think.

Well, his name's Lars,

- Hey.

557

You ride as good as your sister?

558
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,434
- What?
- He means horses, Larry.

559
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,075
- No, I don't like horses.
- Larry's into cars.

No kidding?

561
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,713
There's that fathead cop again.

562

He was down at the Landmark today.
What did he want there, Fenton?

How do I know?

564
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,639

of me first. What do I know about it?

567

- There's somethin‘ up that guy's butt.
- Will you excuse me? Be right back.

568
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,994
- (Jilly) ls she all right?
- I'm sure she's fine. I'll just...

569
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,913
I just miss something?

570

I said "Fine with me,
at least I get some privacy."

621
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,150
Get me outta there, Patty.
I'm begging you.

622
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,557
Let me be your butler or something.

623
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,593
I don't need a butler.

624
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,758
Well, could I just come live with you?

625
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,351
-You wouldn't like it.
- Yes, I would.

626
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,437
Not for long.

627
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,433
You make everything look
so different to me, Patty.

628
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,997
- Oh, yeah, like what?
- Like everything.

629
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,193
Everything else just seems pointless
compared to being with you.

630
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,029
Like, what am I doing in school?
I don't know.

631
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,232
I'm afraid I might never see you again.

632
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,234
Will I?

633
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,431
Well, yeah.

634
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,678
You'll see me. I'm right here.

635
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,514
You want, like, a beer?

636
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,597
Yeah, OK.

637
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,514
(Bud) What was your name again?

638
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,153
Patty.

639
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,990
You're drunk, Bud.

640
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,918
Get in the car.

641
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,951
- Whose car is this, anyway?
- It's a rental.

642
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,478
I would think a guy like you
would have his own car, Bud.

643
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,557
Yeah, I do.

644
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,910
So why are we taking this one?

645
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,396
I like it. It'll always remind me of you.

646
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,396
(engine starts)

647
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,230
Bud Valentine, car thief.
Whaddaya know?

648
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,149
Am I gonna need lipstick for this?

649
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,797
(Feﬂlbn) Farney!

650
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,877
(Patty) Shit.

651
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,114
Well, hi-de-ho, Patty.

652
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,478
What are you doin‘ here?

653
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,999
(Jilly) Farney!

654
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,760
Fucking Grand Central Station.

655
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,756
I found your dog, Jilly.

656
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,599
Well, God, where the hell was he?
Farney!

657
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,554
- Come here!
- Where was Dennis the Menace off to?

658
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,432
Just shut up, all right?

659
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,955
What you looking at me like that for? He
only got three days to live or something?

660
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,550
Jeez, Patty. ls this serious or what?

661
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,195
I don't know. No, no. I don't know.

662
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,876
Look, Fenton, I'm in some trouble.

663
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,713
- With that kid?
- No.

664
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,512
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yeah.

665
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,519
Will you get me outta here
before that cop comes back?

666
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,870
And makes a scene
in front of your brother?

667
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,354
Yeah.

668
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,834
The last thing he needs is...

669
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,076
(Fenton) ls you?

670
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,998
Yeah, is me.

671
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,597
(phone rings)

672
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,596
- Hello?
- Yeah, who's this?

673
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,159
- <i>Jonathan Marco. Who's</i> this?
- <i>It's Baker.</i> Go <i>get Cooke. Hurry up.</i>

674
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,510
- Hello?
- Cooke, it's me.

675
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,917
- Baker, where are you?
- I'm at the county fair.

676
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,316
What? You're in big trouble.

677
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,716
- No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

678
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,118
Everybody knows you're gone.
You're missing. You disappeared!

679
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,709
- I know what I did.
- They called your parents.

680
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,992
- Who did?
- Hunt. Murphy must've told him about...

681
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,513
Cooke. Hey, Cooke, are you there?

682
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,678
Yes, Dad?

683
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,916
Oh, Jesus. Did someone come in?

684
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,474
Yes, Dad.

685
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,558
- Not Hunt again?
- Yes, Dad.

686
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,754
Oh, man.

687
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,554
- I'll call you back.
- That's not all.

688
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,751
Can I talk to Mom?

689
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,874
- What are you talking about?
- To both of you.

690
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,116
Dad... yours.

691
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,040
What?

692
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,117
To see you.

693
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,913
Oh, shit. My parents are there.

694
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,998
Way to go, Dad. I knew you could do it.

695
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,353
- Put my father on.
- That's so funny.

696
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,758
- I mean it, Cooke. Put him on.
- Dad, come on.

697
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,111
Put him on. Tell him it's me.
You won't get in trouble.

698
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,597
Uh, Mr Baker?

699
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,477
It's for you.

700
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,114
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad. It's...

701
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,834
Sonny, goddammit.

702
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,510
Where the hell are you?
Your mother's a goddamn nervous wreck.

703
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,596
It's him.

704
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,758
Dad, listen. I'm living my life.

705
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,599
- Boy, I don't believe this.
- What?

706
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,199
You don't wanna know.

707
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,440
Dad, it's nothing bad. It's a good thing.

708
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,836
Where the hell are you callin’ from?

709
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,237
I'm with a friend,
but that's not what I had to tell you.

710
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,478
I'm out in the world
and I'm doing fine. I'm great.

711
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,911
Sonny, that's got to be the dumbest thing
I ever heard outta you.

712
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,510
Now, you listen to me.
I'm here at your dorm with Steve Hunt.

713
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,029
And we worked it all out. You hear me?

714
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,596
Now you can go back to class
in the morning with a clean slate.

715
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,237
Steve's a good friend of mine
and he's willing to forget...

716
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,317
But I'm not. I don't wanna go back.

717
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,397
Sonny, goddammit! Look.

718
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,594
- We know you got mixed up with a girl.
- Dad.

719
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,599
- We don't know how...
- And we don't want to know.

720
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,429
- We don't want to know.
- Well, why not? I can tell you.

721
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,634
An angel fell in my lap and brought me
up to heaven and that's where I am.

722
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,751
You hear the music? That's where I am.

723
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,838
Sonny... please.

724
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,191
What? I'm throwing oﬁ’ the shackles, Dad.
I'm not coming back.

725
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,789
Congratulate me.

726
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,510
- He's hung up.
- (sighs)

727
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,752
(phone rings)

728
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,396
- Hello.
- I forgot to tell Mom happy birthday.

729
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,273
Tell her I said happy birthday.

730
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,757
He called to say happy birthday.

731
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,717
State police, son.
Who were you just on the phone with?

732
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,277
Just a friend, sir. Why?
I'm sorry, am I doing something wrong?

733
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,550
Where's your girlfriend?

734
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,035
What do you mean?

735
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,037
All right.

736
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,075
- You know this man?
- No.

737
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,239
I mean, it looks like Bud Valentine.
He's a pitcher for the...

738
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,194
- Yeah, that's who it is.
- Why are you showing me this?

739
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,870
Why does she disappear
whenever I show up?

740
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,674
- Who?
- Ms Fatty Vare.

741
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,955
- What do you mean, disappear?
- How do you know her?

742
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,639
Well...

743
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,758
I just... know her.

744
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,589
- How long have you known her?
- Just today, really.

745
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,394
So you don't know anything
about a stolen vehicle?

746
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,479
Black Jetta. Licence plate RB567K.

747
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,513
- Wait a minute. I don't know...
- That car's missing.

748
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,075
And so is Mr Francis "Bud" Valentine.

749
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,760
I believe your friend
knows the whereabouts of both.

750
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,670
For some reason she's being very evasive
today. And I'm hoping you'll tell me why.

751
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,112
- Look, I was just having a couple beers.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see that.

752
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,709
You got some ID?

753
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,798
I got... school ID.

754
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,790
Drinking underage, I guess?

755
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,957
Yes, sir.

Graduating soon?

759
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,399
June. I mean, if I graduate.

760
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,112
If?

761
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,670
Hate hearing that.

762
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,120
Yes, sir.

763
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,790
I tell you what I'm gonna do,
John Baker Junior.

764
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,474
I want you to call this number
when she contacts you again.

765
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,879
What do you mean, when she contacts...?

766
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,560
Don't tempt me not to trust you.

767
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,990
John.

768
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,797
Patty?

769
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,799
Patty?

Well, sir, not really.

848
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,631
It involves my father.
He's had a long battle with alcohol.

849
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,718
And my mother can't help
because she's unstable as well.

Yes, sir. I think I'm not well.

You are asking me to excuse you
from the quiz that I scheduled for today?

poor, someone's in there looking for you.

- In where?
- The snack bar. She says she's your aunt.

She doesn't look like your aunt.
She looks like Barbara Stanwyck.

He... he gave me a ride out to his house.

You went to his house? You went home
with the convict, or whoever that was?

I wanna go anywhere right now.

Wayland. W-a-y-l-a-n-d.

931
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,797
OK. Thanks.

932
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,317
- Mr Baker?
- Yes, sir.

933
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,319
- All right, I think we're about done here.
- Good.

934
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,355
If we need to get in touch
with your son again, we'll contact you.

935
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,040
I appreciate your help, Lieutenant.

936
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,472
Sonny.

937
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,870
Hey, Patty. How are you?

938
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,913
I'm good.

939
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,234
Larry, this is my sister Ellen
and my brother Tom.

940
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,591
All right, Sonny. Let's get going.

941
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,149
I got fingerprinted.

942
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,078
Why?

943
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,079
Contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.

944
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,639
. Hey, Patty.
. Hey, Billy.

945
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,318
Let's go.

946
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,832
- What have you been saying, Fatty?
- Nothing.

947
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,430
- Sonny, goddammit!
- Goddammit what?

948
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,475
- Don't use that tone with me.
- John, he's just trying to help the girl.

949
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,639
That girl has plenty of people
to sort this out for her, all right?

950
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,879
- We said we'd keep this short.
- You'd better get outta here.

951
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,552
Don't push your dad any further, Sonny.
Please.

952
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,591
Better be a big elevator.

953
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,394
We'll just wait for the next one.

954

- Hi, officer.
-You can't leave a car here, son.

961
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,679
My therapist told me to wait right here.
She'll kill me if I move.

962
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,078
I don't know who your therapist is,
but she can't leave her car here.

- This your car, sir?
- Yeah.

967
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,310
- This is an illegal parking place.
- Sorry.
