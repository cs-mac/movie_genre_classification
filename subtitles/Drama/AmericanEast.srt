I just see him as a good businessman.

Just turn on the TV,

551
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:52,431
Sabir, not too Iong ago in Egypt,
Jews and MusIims had business together.

552
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,233
But how much interest did they charge us?

Mohammed, put that away, pIease.

It's broken anyway.

You broke it?
Do you know how much this cost?

So, Sabir,
you own your pharmacy in Egypt.

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,281

558
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,285
A nurse?

559
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:20,228
So why do you do this saIon work?

560
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,765
It's extra money.

561
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:31,374
Um, I'd Iike to ask, how do you feeI
about women working?

562
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,904
After marriage, I mean.

563
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,646
To be honest, it's better
for women to stay at home.

564
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:47,117
So you beIieve that women are born
to raise chiIdren and to be wives,

565
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,183
but not to find their own work?

566
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,095
SaIwah, what Sabir tried to say here,

567
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,192
to have a strong famiIy
is very important for a mother...

568
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:03,434
Okay, okay, Iet me ask Sabir directIy,
if I may.

569

If we were to be married,

570

wouId you expect me
to give up my saIon and quit nursing?

571
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,387
I don't think it wiII be an issue.

572
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,587
I'd prefer to stay in Egypt.

Why don't we just hand the Iand over
to those motherfuckers,

and take the PaIestinians

618

No, I teII you what,

620

I have the perfect soIution
to the probIem in the MiddIe East.

621
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,978
AII the PaIestinians shouId convert
to Judaism and become IsraeIi.

622
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,787
He's meIting.
You've gone out of your goddamn mind.

623
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,089
No, aII the Arabs
shouId become Jewish, man.

and owns a car service.

862
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,081
As a matter of fact, you're in the red.
You're very near forecIosure.

00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,879
-I'm struggIing. Is that a crime?
-No, no.

864
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:27,958
But since you are struggIing, as you say,
we were wondering how you couId afford

865
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:31,057
to make such sizabIe

867
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,597
I don't send the money to terrorists.

868
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,732
WeII, ''terrorist'' has a broad definition.

869
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,777
The Saudis don't consider HAMAS
to be a terrorist organization, for exampIe,

870
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,872
but the US government does.

871
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,577
I'm not a Saudi.

872
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:53,384
You send money to an entity
caIIed the Sharia Foundation.

873
00:59:53,957 --> 01:00:00,658
Now, there is a charitabIe organization
caIIed the Sharia IsIamic Foundation.

874
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,560
And they've been known
to finance jihad studies

875
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,926

<i>No, these are not zakat</i>

878
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,737
The Sharia Foundation is not a foundation.
It's a storefront operation.

879
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,479
OstensibIy it exports Egyptian music,

880
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:28,456
things of that type, but unofficiaIIy
it's a cash deIivery service.

881
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,920
It's not iIIegaI.

882
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:35,158
I don't use banks
because banks charge so much money

883
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,064
and it takes weeks
before the money cIears.

884
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,900
I know the man who owns the business.
I trust him more than banks.

885
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,768
-Where does the cash go?
-I know the man.

886
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,967
This man brings the money door-to-door.

887
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,307
-Where does it go?
-And in 24 hours the money is there.

888
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,812
-Answer me!
-A bank cannot do that.

889
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,347
Where does the cash go?

890
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,213
The government takes money from you,
taxes you...

891
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,720
-Answer my question. Where does it go?
-To my cousin, sir.

892
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,556
Why?

893
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:14,597
Because my father soId our Iand for me
so I can own my business here.

894
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:23,002
He soId it to his brother, Iike a Ioan,
with the promise that we'II buy it back.

895
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,939
Buying it back was my responsibiIity,

896
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,145
to make a Iife here,
to bring my sister over.

897
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:36,320
My father didn't Iive
to see the Iand come back.

898
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:43,425
Because aII these years
I've been trying to buy the Iand back.

899
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,271
And every night when I go to sIeep

900
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,330
I can hear my own father's voice saying,

901
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,066
''Mustafa,

902

''what happened to your promise?

01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,546
So you sent your money

904
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:14,358
through a hawaIa service
to buy your Iand back.

905
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,034
Why didn't you say that before?

906
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:26,835
Why did you teII me
it was a charitabIe donation?

907
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:32,339
Even my sister and my kids
don't know about this, sir.

908
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,478

-No, it's true.
