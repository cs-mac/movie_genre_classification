1
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:28,600
I don't know, feels like a grave.

2
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:32,745
Their queen is here.

3
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,587
And we have our orders.

4
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:01,085
It's a trap.

5
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:38,333
This is what is known.

6
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:42,710
There has always been man.

7
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:49,162
And there have always been vampires.

8
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:02,910
Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.

9
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:06,902
The vampire's were quicker, stronger.

10
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,243
But man had the sun.

11
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,722
It was not enough.

12
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:40,137
And so it went like this
over many years.

13
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:44,150
The two races destroying
not only each other ...

14
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,378
but the world itself.

15
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:52,366
Facing extinction, mankind
withdrew behind walled cities

16
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,671
under the protection of the Church.

17
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:02,124
And then the ultimate weapon
was found, the priests.

18
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:15,371
Warriors with extraordinary powers, trained
by the Church in the art of vampire combat.

19
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:20,095
They alone turned the tide to man.

20
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:24,471
The remaining vampires
were placed on reservations.

21
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,741
And fearing the power of the
weapon they created ...

22
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,965
the ruling clergy ordered
the priests disbanded.

23
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:38,143
The former warriors to be integrated
back into a society that no longer needed them.

24
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:44,173
And as the years passed,
the few surviving priests

25
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:48,092
faded into obscurity...

26
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,353
...like the vampire menace before them.

27
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,153
Residual radiation is still spotty,

28
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:24,189
but the soil contamination
is close to zero.

29
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:28,062
With a little luck, we can
finally start planting.

30
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm proud of you, Owen.

31
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,281
Great, stew again.

32
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:40,735
- Atoning for your sins?
- No, why?

33
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:45,036
Wearing the nicest dress, where else
would you have been all day, but church?

34
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,881
I was in town.

35
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:51,068
I figure someone here needs
a life outside this outpost.

36
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:54,026
I thought I said I didn't want you to
spending so much time out there.

37
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:59,935
- I'm old enough to go where I want.
- You're 18. That's not old enough, not out here.

38
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:04,428
I know it's hard, but we all
have to make sacrifices.

39
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,314
Sacrifices?!

40
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,353
You mean living out
here like a prisoner?!

41
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:10,653
- Lucy?
- No friends, no fun?!

42
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,529
Just that someday you might be able to grow
something in these godforsaken lands?

43
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,218
Enough!

44
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:23,359
Bow your heads and say grace.

45
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:35,916
Dear Lord, we thank you for
what we are about to receive...

46
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:41,292
- Daddy?
- Shush!

47
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:49,085
- Owen?
- Tear down below!

48
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,085
What's going on?!

49
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,761
Hurry child!

50
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,601
Hurry!

51
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:14,585
- Mama.
- Whatever you hear... don't scream.

52
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,585
Oh, my god!

53
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,801
Get behind me!

54
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,061
Shannon!

55
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:33,152
God protects you, the
Church protects you.

56
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:37,228
The city protects you.

57
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:41,984
Absolution is the only way.

58
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:55,579
Absolution is the only way.

59
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:09,710
Remember, to against the Church,
means to go against God.

60
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:18,349
Confession room 5 is free.

61
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:24,993
Move forward.

62
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:30,447
Initiate confessional sequence.

63
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,438
Please speak at the tone.

64
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,896
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.

65
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:50,106
- Yes, my son?
- I had the dream again

66
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,292
- about the war.
- Tell me more.

67
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,712
We were in the hives, like always.

68
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:04,161
Each fell, and I wasn't strong enough.

69
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:07,617
Tell me more.

70
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:15,299
I have questions, doubts.

71
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:18,221
The Devil comes in many shapes.

72
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,826
The best way to combat him,
is through personnel sacrifice...

73
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,898
and a long day's labor.

74
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,553
Yes, Father.

75
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:31,468
Now say three Hail Mary's
and four Our Father's.

76
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:37,072
And remember, to go against the
Church, is to go against God.

77
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:47,132
- Don't point.
- Mom, what's on that man's face?

78
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,241
It's a tattoo.

79
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,502
Did it hurt?

80
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:02,224
- Why can't I talk to him?
- You don't talk to priests.

81
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:19,049
- Who are you?
- Name's Hicks, on the Sheriff from Augustine.

82
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,975
- What do you want?
- There was a vamp attack.

83
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:26,619
They took Lucy. Your brother is hurt bad.
He told me where to find you.

84
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:29,984
- And Shannon?
- No.

85
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:55,243
Lucy talked about you.
Said you were a hero during the war.

86
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:59,278
Said that when it came to
killing vampires, you were the best.

87
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:04,658
I'm going after her,
I'm gonna get her back.

88
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:09,345
Just thought I should let you know
in case you wanted to come along.

89
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,111
Figure I could use someone
like you by my side.

90
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:21,101
Okay.

91
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:42,618
Thank you for meeting me in
such short notice, Monsignors.

92
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,538
Monsignor Chamberlain
has informed us of the situation.

93
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,689
- Your family is in our prayers.
- Thank you.

94
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:54,030
I come before you because I need
my authority reinstated.

95
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,836
On what grounds?

96
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:02,676
- This was a vampire attack.
- Vampires?

97
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:09,015
Nonsense, we've had no reports of
any escapes from the reservations.

98
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:12,055
This is obviously the
work of wasteland bandits.

99
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:16,474
- Monsignor, the boy was clear.
- "The boy" was mistaken.

100
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:22,578
There is no vampire menace, the wastelands
are heavens for the lawless and the immoral...

101
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:26,497
To send a priest out there after
such a lot would be both ridiculous and futile.

102
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:30,415
This is best left to
the local authority.

103
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:36,564
Monsignor Orelas, this man
has been of great service to the Church.

104
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,719
If it weren't for the priest
we would have been overrun by the...

105
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:42,941
We are well aware of his
accomplishments, Monsignor Chamberlain.

106
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:46,553
Thank you, you may sit.

107
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,011
I am begging you.

108
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:55,314
- Allow me to find her.
- You must understand something priest.

109
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:59,617
The sanctity of these walls is absolute.

110
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:04,727
And the citizens from the cities have complete faith
in the Church's ability to keep them safe.

111
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,608
- You will not shake that faith.
- How good is that faith, when it's a lie?

112
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,969
Questioning the authority of the
clergy is absolutely forbidden.

113
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,837
If you take any action
to leave the cities...

114
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,641
it will be seem as an act of
aggression against the Church.

115
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:24,206
You will be stripped from the order and
excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?

116
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:29,895
I said, do I make
myself clear, father?

117
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:33,275
Yes, Monsignor.

118
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:41,805
Try to remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

119
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:01,400
Come on now. Don't be shy.

120
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:05,051
Give us a kiss.

121
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:10,545
That's no way to treat a friend.

122
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,968
Please, let me go...

123
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,354
You're in here for your own protection.

124
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:20,805
If I let you out, you'll be
torn apart, piece by piece.

125
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:25,146
My uncle's a priest, he'll come after me.

126
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,495
Really?

127
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:31,294
- What makes you so sure?
- He'll come after me.

128
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,834
He'll come after you!

129
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:40,015
Well that's something
I'm absolutely counting on.

130
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:48,968
The judgment is final. I'm sorry.

131
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,654
I sacrificed everything to serve them.

132
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,264
- And they won't listen to me.
- The war is long over.

133
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,492
You and the other
priests did your jobs.

134
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,840
It's not over, not for me.

135
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,223
You can't break your
covenant on a small ...

136
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,638
group of savages, it would be sacrilege.

137
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,828
I have to.

138
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:20,937
- That's what I was afraid of.
- Move!

139
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:30,080
If you go out there right now, you risk
stirring things up again.

140
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:35,209
You have to look at the bigger picture,
it's for the greater good.

141
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:39,302
- Is this the world I fought for?
- No.

142
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,990
But it's the only world we have left.

143
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:48,104
I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish.

144
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:54,362
Remember your vow. To go against
the Church, is to go against God.

145
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:57,630
Then I go against God.

146
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:26,061
God help us.

147
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:31,172
Dear Father, forgive me.

148
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,251
It was never my intention
to offend you.

149
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:40,085
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace...

150
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:46,157
to sin no more, and to
avoid the near occasions of sin.

151
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:49,614
But I can't.

152
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,639
Looting's not such a good idea mister.

153
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,288
Well, I'll be damned.

154
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,242
Vampires are a vicious lie!

155
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:15,236
I have seen a vampire
bite a man clean in half.

156
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,044
Salvation is right
here in my very hands.

157
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,228
Authenticated by the clergy themselves...

158
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:24,228
- Purchase this holy water and...
- Excuse me in a minute.

159
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:28,684
Keep your loved ones safe tonight...

160
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:36,446
I'm tired of you comin' around here,
scaring people, selling your superstition.

161
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,441
The show is over, and
it's time for you to go.

162
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:42,977
Give me one good reason why I should.

163
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:47,204
That's one... two...

164
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,860
Alright. Alright, alright!

165
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:53,235
Goddamn son of a bitch!

166
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,078
You all listen up!

167
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:00,075
This stuff is good for nothin'...

168
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,539
but lining for that man's pockets
for your hard earned cash!

169
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:06,800
You don't know that. You're just a kid.
We gotta do somethin' to keep us safe.

170
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,220
Move out of the way!

171
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:13,490
I don't blame any
of you for being scared,

172
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:17,749
but the vampires are gone and
they're not coming back.

173
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:29,392
You have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't to common out here.

174
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,541
Is it true what they say about priests?

175
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,960
You wield the hand of God?

176
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,607
How is he?

177
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,069
He's awake.

178
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,479
Your clergy took away a boy...

179
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,318
and returned an old man.

180
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,780
After the war was over...

181
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:10,503
Shannon figured you'd come back.

182
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,578
I wanted to.

183
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,495
Didn't seem right any more.

184
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,766
I couldn't save her.

185
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,178
I tried, but I've never had your gift.

186
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:30,868
You gave her a life
I no longer could.

187
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,367
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

188
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:39,205
You know there ain't one day that
went by, where I wished she'd forget about you.

189
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:54,460
You find Lucy,
you bring her home safe.

190
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:57,916
And you promise me something brother.

191
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,606
Kill 'em all.

192
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,560
Most people out there know that the clergy
thinks of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

193
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:14,439
And that's how we like it. It means that
they tend to keep their noses out of our business.

194
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:19,550
So you can imagine how surprised I was when
they contacted me asking if I'd seen you.

195
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:24,275
Saying that anyone going after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.

196
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,200
Said she's in God's hands now.

197
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:31,114
Problem is, we both now outside
a week Lucy will be dead...

198
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:35,033
or worse, infected.

199
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,262
So with all due respect to god...

200
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,102
You're wasting your time.

201
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:54,013
No, no! You're not cutting me out of this!
I'm the one that came and got you!

202
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:57,473
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.

203
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:01,814
What makes you think you'll
do any good out there?

204
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:19,296
- You any good with a gun?
- Better than I am with a knife.

205
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:23,061
We leave at dawn.

206
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:28,825
What's with all the bullets anyway?
I thought priests didn't use firearms.

207
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,531
We don't.

208
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,205
They're for you.

209
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,491
You have been called
to serve once more.

210
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:59,659
One of your own has
broken his sacred vow.

211
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:03,789
His actions are a threat
to the entire order.

212
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,322
You will find him
and bring him back to me.

213
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:13,166
Dead or alive.

214
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,566
Then I will teach transgressed your ways
and return them back to you.

215
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:28,566
Save me from blood guilt...
and god who saves me and my tongue...

216
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,966
will sing of your righteousness...
in my mouth declare your prays...

217
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,886
- What is it?
- Vampire tracks are random...

218
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,344
in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time,
but these are two by two.

219
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:11,948
Must have been some of the familiars.

220
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,948
Vampires don't bring familiars
in the hunt, they slow them down.

221
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:18,407
All this...

222
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,672
this was something else.

223
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:24,443
Tracks head north.

224
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:28,320
- There's a reservation up that way.
- Well, then. That's where we start.

225
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:45,110
Mangshane Reservation.
Nothing but red-outs and rejects.

226
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,497
They're a fallen tribe.

227
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:50,681
Either way, we don't have
much time to get in and out.

228
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,926
No guards.

229
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:31,223
I thought familiars were illegal.

230
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,098
Nobody really enforces it, as long
as it's voluntary.

231
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:37,227
- Voluntary?
- Yeah, they come from the fringes.

232
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,323
Drifters that want to get infected.

233
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:44,742
I mean becoming a vampire
so they may live among them.

234
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:48,393
These people get all sorts of strange ideas.
As long as they keep to themselves...

235
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:51,004
it makes no difference to me.

236
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:11,368
You're not welcome here, Priest.

237
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:13,865
These lands are protected.

238
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,824
No! I got this.

239
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,435
I'm looking for a local girl, kidnapped
about four nights ago by a vamp-pack.

240
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:25,277
- They came through this way.
- Nobody comes through Nightshade.

241
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:28,275
It's the way we like it. Nice...

242
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,891
and quiet.

243
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:35,383
Good, we're sure we
won't have any trouble.

244
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,069
They excrete it, use
it to build the hives.

245
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:44,658
I guess now we know what
happened to the guards.

246
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,263
No. No, no, you must not...

247
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:58,643
The Master will be angry...

248
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:03,452
Where's the girl?

249
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:06,328
I don't know what you're
talking about. Please! Please!

250
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:09,518
The Master doesn't
feed humans anymore.

251
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:12,091
Yeah, tell that to the guards.

252
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,934
- Where is she?
- Please don't, don't...

253
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:18,355
Where is she?

254
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:22,355
Shit!

255
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:30,458
Priest! Priest!

256
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:53,434
Save your bullets.

257
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,175
Now, we can do this the easy way or...

258
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,400
God. I always preferred the hard way.

259
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,318
- Tell me where they took the girl.
- Haven't you done enough already, priest?

260
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,853
- Tell me!
- Look around you. Look what you've done to them.

261
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:39,446
They once ruled this land, they were
warriors, they were Gods.

262
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:43,000
- They were murderers.
- They were what nature made them to be.

263
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:47,611
- Just like you.
- You got 10 seconds to start talking.

264
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:55,373
Then 10 seconds is all I need.
You're too late, Priest.

265
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:59,292
It is their time now.

266
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:06,322
- Did you get your gun on?
- Why?

267
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:09,128
You're gonna need it.

268
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,784
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

269
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,703
- I will fear no evil,
- Your words mean nothing to them, Priest.

270
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,892
For thou art with me.

271
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,205
Focus!

272
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:50,640
- Should we go after them?
- No need, they'll die at first light.

273
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:55,558
No more masters, just you and me.

274
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,520
Tell me where they took the girl.

275
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:04,471
- West. They took her west.
- Why?

276
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:06,777
You have no idea
what's coming, Priest.

277
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:42,126
The familiar said they
travel west from here.

278
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:48,355
- Solar mirror.
- A hive?

279
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,307
One of the largest.

280
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,807
But I thought all of the hives
were liquidated after the war.

281
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,771
They were.

282
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:57,001
That's why we need to go look.

283
00:33:57,034 --> 00:34:00,722
There are more than 50
creeps in this reservation.

284
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:04,411
But only 6 vampires left. The weak.

285
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:09,021
They left behind.
We find the missing one, we find Lucy.

286
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:17,936
I may not have seen the war...

287
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:22,279
but I know the look a man gets
when he likes killing.

288
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,236
It comes easy to you.

289
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,154
It just comes.

290
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:33,613
Easy's got nothing to do with it.

291
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,107
Give me your gun.

292
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:42,065
- What?
- Give me your gun.

293
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:49,751
Vampires don't move like humans.

294
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,707
Their body weight pulls them
in concentric patterns.

295
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:59,932
You need to anticipate their
trajectory to get a kill shot.

296
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:04,043
- Are you teaching me to shoot?
- I'm teaching you how to kill vampires.

297
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:08,000
There are always two points.
A and B.

298
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,342
Know them both, you'll kill a vampire.

299
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:27,711
A man came aboard.
Says he got something for you.

300
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:36,432
You told me to come.

301
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:39,858
I have information, but I...

302
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:43,157
before I tell you, I
hate to bring this up.

303
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,746
But there is this small little
matter of compensation.

304
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,268
Now, you've been really
good for business.

305
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:56,143
So I am more than
willing to cut you a deal.

306
00:35:56,874 --> 00:36:00,447
I can smell the blood
running through you veins?

307
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,598
Smells like dinner.

308
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:07,056
Okay. Alright.

309
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:12,359
After you snatched the girl, a couple
of nights later, a priest showed up.

310
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:16,474
- Priest?
- And he was with this Sheriff,

311
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:21,772
real hard case. He run me out of town
before I could make a single sell.

312
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,806
- You've done well.
- Thank you.

313
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,942
There's your compensation.

314
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:47,400
Put him to work.

315
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:33,161
I used to ride out a lot
here when I was little.

316
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:36,008
Stared at all this stuff.

317
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,810
Wondered what it used to be.

318
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:44,113
After a while,
it just made my eyes ache.

319
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:51,104
Did Owen know about you and Lucy?

320
00:37:56,098 --> 00:37:58,482
No, no.

321
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:04,245
She wanted to tell him, but...

322
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,554
Owen wasn't the easiest man to talk to.

323
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:14,542
Besides, he was so focused on his work
there wasn't much room for anything else.

324
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:17,540
Do you love her?

325
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:31,834
You know if she's infected...

326
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:35,674
I'll kill her.

327
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:41,516
You'll try...

328
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,512
but you won't be able to.

329
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:48,931
I wasn't there to protect her once,
I won't make that same mistake again.

330
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,825
- Feels like a grave.
- It's a trap.

331
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:07,197
This is a waste of time,
there's nothing here.

332
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:12,385
Stay here, if anything comes up
that isn't me, shoot it.

333
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,299
Great.

334
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:46,442
- What are you doing here?
- The Clergy sent me. Ordered me to bring you back.

335
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,054
They sent four of us to track you.
We split up at Nightshade.

336
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:54,702
I rode out here and
hoped they didn't have you.

337
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:57,777
The others went up to Jericho.

338
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:00,850
I didn't believe it when they
told me you broke your vow.

339
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:04,233
They left me no choice.
Hicks!

340
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:08,228
What the hell is that thing?

341
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:11,191
- A hive guardian.
- Who the hell are you?!

342
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:14,376
It's too big to get down here.
Which is the only reason you're still alive.

343
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:16,566
Who the hell is that?

344
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,717
Are you ready?

345
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,717
Hey!

346
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:02,075
Not bad.

347
00:44:07,338 --> 00:44:11,181
Point A, meet point fucking B.

348
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:15,023
The hive's been abandoned for years.
Why would something be protecting it?

349
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,259
Does the lawman know what
you'll do if she's infected?

350
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:21,669
He knows.

351
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:26,282
- He'll try to stop you.
- He won't be able to.

352
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,779
It's been hard all these years...

353
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:36,463
not seeing the others, not talking.

354
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:39,921
Sector 7 was the only
place I could find work.

355
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:42,115
Waste management.

356
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:46,374
No one would hire me.
"No applicable skills."

357
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:49,142
I heard that, too.

358
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,752
I didn't come here to bring you back.

359
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:56,825
I came here to warn you.

360
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:05,439
There are nights when I wake up...

361
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:08,738
I think I'm back on the red mines.

362
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:15,846
I'm sweating. My muscles are clenched
like, like I'm ready for something.

363
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,340
Nights like that,
I don't go back to sleep.

364
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:23,337
I have bad dreams.

365
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:25,643
Me, too.

366
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:34,672
There are other nights, the good nights...

367
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:38,783
I dream about other things.

368
00:45:54,061 --> 00:46:00,686
- Why doesn't it look like the rest of the hive?
- This sections new. They must have rebuilt it.

369
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,552
My God.

370
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,663
They bread a new army.

371
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:25,274
Where did they all go?

372
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:33,575
Only one way to find out.

373
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,762
Are priests allowed to have relations?

374
00:46:42,797 --> 00:46:46,331
- We take a vow of celibacy.
- So, you mean you've never...

375
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:49,865
I was a young girl when
the Clergy found me.

376
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:52,287
What about him?

377
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:54,050
His talents developed later.

378
00:46:54,162 --> 00:46:58,050
He was nearly you're age
when the Clergy came for him.

379
00:46:58,434 --> 00:47:01,893
That made his sacrifice
greater than most.

380
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:05,542
The air is changing.

381
00:47:06,295 --> 00:47:07,694
Well, there's your answer.

382
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,926
They dug right
through the mountain and...

383
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,226
made a hole big enough to fit
an army through.

384
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:16,877
What town is that?

385
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,649
It's Jericho.

386
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:23,294
Where'd you say the others went?

387
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,814
What the hell?

388
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:27,959
Hello?!

389
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,764
Hello!

390
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:46,017
Is anybody there?

391
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,496
Let's begin.

392
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,618
I don't see anything.

393
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:48,665
Brothers, you have a choice.

394
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,155
You can follow in my footsteps
or you can follow in his.

395
00:51:12,675 --> 00:51:14,795
We're too late.

396
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:19,131
We separate. Go through
each building, and see what we find.

397
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:43,200
There's nobody left. Not a soul.

398
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:46,349
Too many mouths to feed.

399
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:20,352
Killing three priests? What kind of
vampire could do something like that?

400
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,695
Nothing we've ever seen before.

401
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:28,154
How could they take an entire town
over night, and vanish by sunrise?

402
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:32,533
There are no other hives around
here, no reservations.

403
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:44,791
- Where does this rail line go?
- It's an old mining line.

404
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:47,985
It starts in the Dunkirk
mine above Augustine.

405
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:51,361
- Jericho's the last stop before it reaches...
- The cities.

406
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,358
Heading back to the cities
would be suicide, right?

407
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:58,662
- The sun will kill them.
- There is no sun in the cities.

408
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:01,351
Not anymore.

409
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:04,656
Without us, they're defenseless.

410
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:08,958
- I'm responsible.
- No, this was systematic.

411
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:11,956
Whoever took Lucy knew
that you'd come for her...

412
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,496
and that we'd come for you.
They were drawing us out.

413
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,010
They must have been
picking up different factions

414
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:19,410
along the way, moving during
the day and feeding at night.

415
00:54:19,448 --> 00:54:23,271
- It's going to be a massacre.
- It's going to be a war.

416
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:27,095
Train carrying an army of vampires?

417
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:30,399
What chance do we have
stopping something like that?

418
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:35,278
I'll overtake the train and blow the rail-line.
You two get aboard and find Lucy.

419
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:38,357
I'll start charging the bikes.
It's gonna take everything we have

420
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:41,542
to stop that train before
it reaches the cities.

421
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:52,683
You must be starving.
You haven't eaten in days.

422
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:59,101
Have you ever had a real roast duck?

423
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:03,710
It's very rare, very exotic.

424
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:11,665
- Of course not.
- Try it, you'll never have better.

425
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:19,929
- What do you want?
- I want the same things that you want.

426
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:24,344
I want to be free from a life
of suffering and sacrifice.

427
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:29,453
To no longer be told that your
every desire is a sin.

428
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:36,178
And after all, if you're not
committing sin, you're no longer having fun.

429
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:48,055
What are you?

430
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:52,973
The Church teaches us that the eyes
are the window to the soul...

431
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:59,155
and since the vampire evolved
without eyes, it is a soulless creature...

432
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,463
to be eradicated.

433
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:06,474
And I have seen the soul of the vampire.
And let me tell you...

434
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:10,452
it is far more pure
than that of any man.

435
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:14,139
Now you ask me what I am?

436
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:18,409
I am the bringer of the tide...

437
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:22,745
I am the wave to wash clean
this unclean world.

438
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:27,030
And you and your priest...

439
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:30,815
will help me do it.

440
00:56:33,735 --> 00:56:39,113
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?
If she's infected?

441
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:48,605
She talked about him.
Said she never got to known him.

442
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:51,376
She wanted to.

443
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:54,911
What kind of man would kill
his own flesh and blood?

444
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:58,479
If she becomes a familiar,
she's no ones flesh and blood.

445
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:02,244
Not anymore.

446
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:44,049
I've held on to it all these years...

447
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:48,658
to remind me of everything they've
stripped away from us.

448
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:52,577
Our honor, our abilities, our faith...

449
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:55,150
Today when we ride,
I want you to remember

450
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:58,150
our power doesn't
come from the Church...

451
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,723
it comes from God.

452
00:58:10,715 --> 00:58:15,247
With or without the Clergy,
we're still priests.

453
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:38,686
I can't.

454
00:58:47,905 --> 00:58:51,173
When I heard what
happened to Shannon...

455
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:54,745
I prayed for her salvation.

456
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,896
And then I prayed for mine.

457
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,320
Because in the
darkness of my heart...

458
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:06,425
I hoped her death
would free you at last.

459
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:53,226
- Tell me you won't kill her.
- Hicks, don't do this.

460
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,264
Tell me, or I will
shoot you where you stand.

461
00:59:56,298 --> 00:59:59,372
It would be easier to face you bullet here
than face what may lie up ahead.

462
00:59:59,405 --> 01:00:03,601
Why do you even care?
She is nothing but a stranger to you.

463
01:00:08,516 --> 01:00:11,634
She's his daughter.

464
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:16,087
- She was just a baby when the Clergy took me.
- You're lying. I knew Owen.

465
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:19,045
The child needed a father.

466
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:22,619
We all made sacrifices.

467
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:29,035
Hicks.

468
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:35,106
If you do this,
it won't matter if you find Lucy.

469
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:40,408
It won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.

470
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:44,710
You won't save her.

471
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:58,158
We ride out and meet this together.

472
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:17,754
When the time comes, you blow the tracks
and then you get out of there!

473
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:21,021
What if you're still on the train?

474
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,741
Good-luck.

475
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,108
Focus!

476
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,514
Holy shit.

477
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,628
Hello, my friend.

478
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:45,105
- You fell!
- You let go!

479
01:03:47,295 --> 01:03:52,904
In the depths of that hive, I crossed
the threshold between life and death.

480
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:55,748
And do you know what I found?

481
01:03:57,285 --> 01:04:02,280
The queen we had come to kill,
my angel of mercy.

482
01:04:02,895 --> 01:04:06,890
She turned me into something that
had never existed in this world.

483
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,808
A human vampire.

484
01:04:13,038 --> 01:04:16,496
Join me.
Accept the blood of the queen.

485
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:20,338
And together we can return to the cities...

486
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:22,456
as brothers.

487
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:27,639
- Where's my daughter?
- Waiting for your decision.

488
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:50,693
You can't win.
I'm stronger now than you ever were.

489
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:16,620
This is your last chance, Priest.

490
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:19,200
The queens hands have not been idle.

491
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:22,461
Mankind will find no
quarter from what's coming.

492
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:27,456
Join me, and your life of
sacrifice will be over.

493
01:07:27,493 --> 01:07:29,569
Never.

494
01:08:26,742 --> 01:08:29,047
Hicks!

495
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:31,354
Lucy!

496
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:45,267
- Fuck.
- Did you find her?

497
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:48,836
I couldn't get close.
They took her to the front.

498
01:09:07,548 --> 01:09:11,966
- You would have made a good priest.
- Thanks.

499
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:14,002
Don't let it go to your head.

500
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:24,502
- Hicks!
- Lucy!

501
01:09:29,505 --> 01:09:31,002
No!

502
01:09:49,543 --> 01:09:52,425
Stop it!

503
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:02,111
No, Lucy!

504
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:04,221
Very good!
Fast.

505
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:07,025
Just like your father.

506
01:10:09,907 --> 01:10:13,058
He never told you?

507
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:24,658
Oh, god!

508
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,485
Burn.

509
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:57,935
At this time of need,
strengthen me.

510
01:11:00,816 --> 01:11:04,333
You are my refuge and strength...

511
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:07,849
I do not fear, for you are with me.

512
01:12:21,773 --> 01:12:24,463
I won't let you go!

513
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,377
Your faith has failed you!

514
01:12:45,596 --> 01:12:47,747
No!

515
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:57,000
For the life of the
flesh is in the blood.

516
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,573
And I have given it
to you upon the altar...

517
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:04,877
to make atonement for your souls.

518
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:21,974
How dare you come back
to this holy place?

519
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:28,239
A man who would defy the Church,
for his own selfish crusade!

520
01:15:41,033 --> 01:15:44,251
Look inside the burning train just
behind these cities walls...

521
01:15:45,528 --> 01:15:48,761
you'll find hundreds more like it.

522
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:52,366
- And their queen was not among them.
- Lies!

523
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,939
This man is a charlatan.
A risk to the security of the cities.

524
01:15:58,975 --> 01:16:02,017
There is no vampire menace!

525
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:06,009
- The war is over, Priest!
- No.

526
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:08,689
It's just beginning.

527
01:16:19,802 --> 01:16:24,528
I've notified the others. We'll meet you
at the rendezvous at City 7.

528
01:16:26,255 --> 01:16:28,945
Godspeed!
