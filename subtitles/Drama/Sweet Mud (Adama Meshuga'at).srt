1
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,378
l'm going out
for a patrol.

2
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:48,060
Hush, hush...
There, there. Little fellow.

3
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:50,618
What is it? Hungry,
were you?

4
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,940
Good morning,
Peaches! Everybody up!

5
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:58,694
Ronen, would you
like that in writing? Uzi, get up!

6
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:01,940
How many times have you been told
not to sleep with your clothes on?

7
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,421
Dvir, get up.

8
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,017
Where's Dvir?

9
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:37,931
Good morning, Batya.

10
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,853
Good morning,
precious.

11
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:47,974
The Egyptian President threatens...
-Good morning.

12
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,776
Avram is bringing you chocolate.
Come here, my darling.

13
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:57,381
Good morning,
pretty girl.

14
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,452
Eat some.
Good morning.

15
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:06,857
Come here, pretty girl.
Come here.

16
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,373
Come here, Batya honey.

17
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,297
Come here, sweetie.

18
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:23,212
Good girl, Batya.

19
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,052
Come to Avram.

20
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:31,935
Yes, Batya.

21
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:34,534
Yes, Batya.

22
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,853
Avram loves you.

23
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,692
Avram loves you,
baby girl...

24
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,214
Summer 1 97 4

25
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,857
Good morning,
Peach troopers.

26
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,338
Your Bar Mitzvah
year begins today.

27
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:06,854
This year is the
most important of your lives.

28
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,851
During this year you
will turn from children to adults.

29
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:15,978
From a burden on society
to a crucial and essential factor.

30
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:20,176
This year, you will
receive 1 3 Bar Mitzvah assignments.

31
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:26,894
The assignments will prepare you
for life as adults on the kibbutz.

32
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:29,650
You will be informed in advance
about some of the assignments

33
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:33,411
and some will come as a surprise.
Uzi, wake him up.

34
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:37,537
l expect you to work hard
and get through them together

35
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,177
while cooperating
with each other.

36
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:42,374
Prove to the
kibbutz and to the movement

37
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,777
that you are worthy
of continuing our tradition.

38
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,941
To be a source of pride
for your parents.

39
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:51,215
To become the
kibbutz's future generation.

40
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:58,821
Come in, darling.
Peaches, this is Maya Perlman,

41
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,060
a foreign pupil from France.
Today she'll be joining our class.

42
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,857
Please take off
your watch.

43
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,137
lt's from my dad.

44
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,537
Ronen!

45
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:14,338
You'll all receive
watches at the end of the year.

46
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:18,661
You can keep the watch but don't
wear it because no one else has one.

47
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:21,741
Peaches, who would
like their parents

48
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:23,092
to adopt Maya?

49
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:29,057
Ronen, you. -Why not me?
-Because you don't have a father.

50
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:31,493
Ronen! Get out!

51
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:33,534
l wish you'd die
already! -Die yourself!

52
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:36,017
Son of a bitch!

53
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,293
Fight! Fight!

54
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:45,300
What are you doing?!
You're all going to be punished!

55
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,778
Open wide.

56
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,057
Your mouth's much
cleaner now. Spit.

57
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:54,651
Wipe yourself.

58
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:59,055
You can go to your
parents. Dvir, come here.

59
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,015
Dvir, over here!

60
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,980
Next time, think
before you put filth in your mouth.

61
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,411
Spit!

62
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:12,617
Rinse and wipe.

63
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:16,732
You can go to your
parents. Uzi, get over here.

64
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:20,140
What do you want
from him? He can't speak. -Butt out.

65
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:23,815
Open wide.

66
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:27,213
Spit. Rinse.

67
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,177
Wipe. You may leave.

68
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:37,092
Dvir, wait, sweetie. Your mother
got a letter from the Swiss guy.

69
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,261
l just finished
translating it for you.

70
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,500
Hey Smiley,
good boy.

71
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:01,175
Dvir!

72
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:03,376
Come here a sec.

73
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,494
My dog
had puppies again.

74
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,251
Sorry. -Dvir,

75
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:25,297
keep your dog on a leash!
l'll chop off his leg, get it?

76
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,181
Mom, we have new volunteers.

77
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,978
Mom, we have new
volunteers, you have to get up!

78
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,138
Mom, go dress up.

79
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:48,535
Shut up
and make coffee!

80
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,619
Dvir, listen to me.

81
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,258
Put this moron with
the French faggot,

82
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,058
and give her a single room
next to the Youth Club. Got it?

83
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:06,858
Then go to Granny's. lf she's angry,
tell her l'm working in the field.

84
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,181
Working in the
field, eh? l'm 90'/. sure he's

85
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,101
at the pool
with some blonde

86
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,693
and 1 00'/. sure she is not Jewish.
-Hannah, lay off of him.

87
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,451
lf your father knew
how you boys are neglecting his tree

88
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,416
he'd be turning over in his grave.
-Hannah, that's enough now!

89
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:27,056
Who's going to give
out the jam?

90
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,578
Let him do it.
-l don't have the time.

91
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,181
Get over here.

92
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,616
You give one jar to
each member on the list,

93
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:42,656
and tell them it's
from Jonathan Avni's tree,

94
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,252
who is remembered
as a wonderful man to this day.

95
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,294
ls that clear?

96
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,774
Next time l'll
slash that ball!

97
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:56,531
lt's the ambulance driver's kid.
l'm striking her off the list.

98
00:11:58,622 --> 00:11:59,737
Go.

99
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,780
Thank her for me.

100
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:17,461
Close your eyes.
l have a surprise for you.

101
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,981
Was l on the list?

102
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:30,415
Give me a hug.

103
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:45,616
Why didn't you
sleep in the children's house?

104
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,577
l just went out for a walk.
-What walk?

105
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:51,980
Just a walk.
-Did you do your homework? -Not yet.

106
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:53,052
That's no good.

107
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,696
You don't do your homework,
you don't sleep, and you lie!

108
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:16,142
Look, l have
another surprise for you.

109
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,412
ls it translated?
-lt's inside.

110
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:34,497
What is it?

111
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,452
''l was thinking of
visiting the kibbutz this year.''

112
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:40,815
l'll finally get to see him.

113
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,781
He's never been here.

114
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,695
Maybe he'll want to stay.

115
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,934
Why are you afraid?
You're strong.

116
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,375
l'm not afraid.

117
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,373
l'm strong.

118
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:10,860
You're strong, Mom.

119
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,653
Comrades, our agenda is as follows:
1 . The fiscal report.

120
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:30,662
2. Popsicle and chocolate
theft from the kitchen,

121
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:34,538
and 3. Members continue to swim in
the pool when there's no lifeguard.

122
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,734
But before that,

123
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:40,333
Miri Avni requests to have
her boyfriend stay over for a month.

124
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:42,932
l tend to agree,
because l believe it is true love,

125
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:46,180
and even though he's a Gentile,
he's still the Swiss Judo champion.

126
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:49,261
But of course, we
still need to vote.

127
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:51,091
Miri!

128
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:01,812
We met on the beach in Netanya,
when l was at the sanatorium.

129
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,292
You'd like him.

130
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:10,655
For sure. l request your
permission to have Stephan over.

131
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:27,692
l don't see a problem,
l think she should be allowed.

132
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:33,341
Our regulations permit
members to have partners visit.

133
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:38,014
l'm in favor of allowing it
after all Miri's been through.

134
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:42,375
But one month is a long time
for a non-working guest. -lt is.

135
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:45,256
Then maybe he could
stay for two weeks.

136
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:49,381
l'd like to say that...
-We have nothing to say.

137
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,579
l'd like to raise
another issue:

138
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,419
When are we going
to decide on buying a new ambulance?

139
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,737
The old one has a
massive oil leak

140
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,019
and besides that,
its gear is shot.

141
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,261
l don't want to think what'd happen
if we ever have to rush anyone

142
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,861
to the hospital.
-Comrades!

143
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:12,100
Does anyone have anything to say
concerning Miri, or shall we vote?

144
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:30,377
''Stephan, my love.
Your letter made me very happy...''

145
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:36,297
''Stephan, my love.
Your letter made me very happy...''

146
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,855
''l love you and can hardly wait
to see you here at the kibbutz.''

147
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:43,419
''Can hardly wait'' is too much.
-What should l write then?

148
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:48,493
You can stay for 3 weeks.
-3 weeks without working? Make it 2.

149
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,500
2 weeks isn't long
enough for anything.

150
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,456
''Don't forget to buy gifts
for my kids.'' -That's important.

151
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:56,097
What sort of gifts?
-Firecrackers, cherry-bombs...

152
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,057
Absolutely not! lt's dangerous.
White chocolate or a puzzle.

153
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:05,701
''Yours, with much
love, Miri.''

154
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:10,334
''Yours, with much
love, Miri.''

155
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:13,455
Don't wait up.
-Don't come home too late.

156
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,141
Come on already.

157
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:33,939
Listen, you stay
here on watch,

158
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:35,531
l'll get the popsicles.

159
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:38,381
lf anyone comes, call me
and we'll run for it. Got it?

160
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:42,377
Can l come with you? -Dvir! lf you
want to grow up, you must be brave!

161
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,414
lf even stealing
popsicles scares you,

162
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,895
you'll always be a pussy. Got it?

163
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,857
Yes. -Good. So you
stay here and watch.

164
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:11,060
Just like a
mountain gale

165
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,620
Just like a
silent song

166
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:20,011
Like trees, in
gusts they flail

167
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:23,177
Like a flame
forever strong

168
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,938
Like a stranger
passing by

169
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:29,497
Without saying
a word

170
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:36,015
l just sing my song

171
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,098
l keep dreaming
my dream

172
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:43,170
l keep seeing
before my eyes

173
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:52,620
ls it true that
he's the Swiss Judo champion?

174
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:55,212
Sure, he's got
a black belt.

175
00:19:58,502 --> 00:19:59,855
ls he nice?

176
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,819
l've never met him,
but Mom says he has a kind heart.

177
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,814
She didn't say that
about anyone, not since Dad died.

178
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,257
How did Dad die?

179
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:19,657
lt was an accident.

180
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,771
That's what Mom keeps telling me.
What sort of accident, though?

181
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:02,012
The Judo champion
of Switzerland

182
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,300
l'm sure you'll
like him.

183
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:27,337
But be polite and don't ask
for the firecrackers until he offers.

184
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,814
Hasn't he arrived?

185
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,217
Stephan!

186
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:02,818
My love.

187
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,174
Look at that old fart.

188
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:10,493
Can l get
an autograph?

189
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:13,941
The European Karate
champion is here!

190
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:17,579
The European Karate
champion is here!

191
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:22,253
What an old guy!

192
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:46,293
lsn't your mother
coming to the dining hall?

193
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:49,452
l guess she's too
busy with loverboy.

194
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:04,460
Shabbat Shalom.

195
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,897
This is Stephan.

196
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:09,775
Hannah and Zvi.

197
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,976
Parents of my late husband.

198
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:16,132
Nice to meet you.

199
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,174
This is my darling Dvir.

200
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:21,734
Look at the dress
he bought me!

201
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,097
For you.

202
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:26,380
Charming kid.

203
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,696
This is Eyal,
my eldest.

204
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,337
Thanks.

205
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,813
They don't need his gifts.

206
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:42,540
For you, Madame.

207
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,336
Shabbat Shalom!
l have two announcements.

208
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:23,333
First: the kite competition
will be held next week, as scheduled.

209
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:27,179
My dog Pitzi
is in heat again.

210
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:30,779
Please keep your dogs
on a leash! l'm going

211
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,531
for my military service
on Sunday and it's important to me

212
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:38,134
that Pitzi doesn't
get pregnant again. Thank you.

213
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,177
Thanks, Stephan.

214
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,216
Mom, l hate puzzles.

215
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:05,222
Never mind. Smile
and say ''merci''.

216
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:07,417
Merci.

217
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:10,376
Just like a
mountain gale

218
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,896
Just like
a silent song

219
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:17,171
Like trees,
in gusts they flail

220
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,940
Like a flame
forever strong

221
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:24,058
Like a stranger
passing by

222
00:25:25,302 --> 00:25:27,896
Without saying
a word

223
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:32,214
l just sing my song

224
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:34,857
l keep dreaming
my dream

225
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,411
l keep seeing
before my eyes

226
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:42,141
All that ever was

227
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:46,371
l just sing my song

228
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:50,019
l keep dreaming
my dream

229
00:25:50,462 --> 00:25:53,260
l keep seeing
before my eyes

230
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:57,571
All that ever was

231
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:04,300
Like a sea
that is not calm

232
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:07,210
Like a straying dog

233
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,414
Like a voice
that calls

234
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:14,090
Like a land
that wasn't sown

235
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,534
Like a desert bush

236
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:20,371
Like a barren land

237
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:24,458
l just sing my song

238
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:28,178
l keep dreaming
my dream

239
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,011
l keep seeing
before my eyes

240
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:32,941
All that ever was

241
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:37,574
l just sing my song

242
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:41,139
l keep dreaming
my dream

243
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:43,652
l keep seeing
before my eyes

244
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:47,776
All that ever was.

245
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:29,971
Dvir and Uzi!

246
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:40,851
You have to navigate
back to the kibbutz before sunset.

247
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:44,499
Good luck with your
assignment.

248
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:49,416
Don't go off the trails, because if
something happens we won't find you.

249
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:24,857
Good morning, Captain. -l'm reminding
you: keep your dog on a leash!

250
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,370
You sang very well.

251
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:35,496
ln you go. Avram
will be back soon.

252
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:47,258
What is it?

253
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:57,737
Want one?

254
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,413
Dvir and Uzi
are smoking.

255
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:19,615
There's a
discipline problem with that class.

256
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,214
Shimshon, this is
what l wanted to speak to you about.

257
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,654
l've been house mother
for the Peach class for a while now

258
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:30,299
and l wanted to ask
if l could be made a teacher.

259
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:33,177
Being a teacher means
having much more responsibility.

260
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:36,021
l'm very
responsible, and you know it.

261
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,574
Strip.
l'll rip you apart.

262
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,335
l forgot
to bring a condom.

263
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:48,015
Very responsible
of you!

264
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:51,255
Quiet, Smiley.

265
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:01,701
Smiley.

266
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,055
What is it?
What do you want?

267
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,255
Do you want to go
for a walk? Go.

268
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:44,698
Don't come inside.
-Yes, yes.

269
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:58,013
What? -Shit!

270
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,295
Hooligans!

271
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,258
l'll kick your asses!

272
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,818
Today l'm happy.

273
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:42,211
Thank you.

274
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:48,174
From now on you
will always be happy.

275
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,172
lt is paradise here.

276
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:58,570
l understand why you never
wanted to leave all these years.

277
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,373
l'm willing to move here.

278
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:04,695
Very simply.

279
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:09,017
l will close my
restaurant, rent out the house

280
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:12,693
and give my pension
to the kibbutz.

281
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,139
We don't need anything.

282
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:20,332
Miri, this is
an ideal place to live together.

283
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,537
l love you, Miri.

284
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:47,771
Darling!

285
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:50,698
You're right
on time for the chicken.

286
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:54,100
Smiley did Avram's dog. -Don't worry,
nothing will happen. -Mom.

287
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,657
Come here.

288
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,812
l want to tell you a secret.

289
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,774
We're getting married.

290
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:10,057
Really? -Yes.

291
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:16,095
Would you
kindly offer me a light, Dvir?

292
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,057
Thank you,
it's for you.

293
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:10,411
Wait.

294
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:15,221
l'll help you.
l'm also a kite champion.

295
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:50,612
Hello.

296
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,377
Hello, Sir.

297
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,297
Where are you from?

298
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,573
From Paris. And you?

299
00:34:57,022 --> 00:35:00,856
From Switzerland.
Good luck with the competition.

300
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,531
Thank you.

301
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:07,618
The little one
likes you, do something.

302
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:20,260
How come you speak
French? -My parents do.

303
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:25,570
Where are they?
-My Dad's in France.

304
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,741
He is alone and had problems,
so he sent me here.

305
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:32,060
But soon he'll
send for me.

306
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:36,297
My Mom used to be alone too.
But now she's getting married.

307
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:38,136
Lucky you!

308
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:44,532
Good afternoon,
members of kibbutz Bet-Gvurot.

309
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:50,614
The judges have reached decisions
and l have the results right here.

310
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:54,138
3rd place...

311
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:56,380
lnbal Goren!

312
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,335
Great work, lnbal!

313
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:04,098

314
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:05,895
Great job, my sweet!

315
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,333
And in 1st place...

316
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:13,219
Dvir Avni!

317
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:21,214
You've won
for showing creativity and ingenuity.

318
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:23,778
Hip-hip-hooray!

319
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:27,821
Dvir, come here.

320
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:32,020
Get over here, l
want to talk to you.

321
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,980
Dvir, come here
right now!

322
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,662
How many times have l told
you to keep your dog on a leash!

323
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,013
l've told you a
thousand times...

324
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,697
My hand!

325
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,021
Violence?

326
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:06,812
Not in our community.
Not now, not ever!

327
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,457
lt's against all
our values, our education...

328
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:13,019
We will not
tolerate such bestial behavior!

329
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:16,772
He raised his hand
on one of us, he must go!

330
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:39,500
l'm not angry
at them.

331
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:41,011
l understand.

332
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:45,780
Stephan, don't go.

333
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,371
Miri,

334
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:49,781
think again.

335
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:52,736
We can't go on
meeting only once a year.

336
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,419
Bring the kids
and come to Switzerland.

337
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:57,181
l can't.

338
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:00,051
Why?

339
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:02,220
l don't understand.

340
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,454
l don't understand.

341
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,454
Little man. Take
good care of your mother.

342
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,018
Stephan,
don't go. Please.

343
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,418
Mom,
tell him not to go.

344
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,097
Maya,

345
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:21,251
want to come steal
popsicles with me?

346
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:27,017
Come on.

347
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,137
Listen,

348
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,142
you stay here
on watch,

349
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,501
l'll get the
popsicles.

350
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:44,572
lf anyone comes, call me
and we'll run for it. Got it?

351
00:39:45,262 --> 00:39:47,696
Can l come with you?
-Maya!

352
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,337
lf you want to grow up,
you must be brave!

353
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:54,058
lf even stealing popsicles
scares you, you'll always be a pussy.

354
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:56,735
Can girls
be pussies?

355
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:59,298
Whatever, it's just
an example. Now stay here

356
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:01,653
and keep watch.
-Alright.

357
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:11,931
Smiley!

358
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:14,615
Please wake up!

359
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,410
Please!

360
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:19,454
Please...

361
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,657
Get up now, please!

362
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,293
What kind of a mother are you?
-What's wrong?

363
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:31,540
He killed Smiley!
Because of you.

364
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:33,461
Because of you!

365
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:37,699
You're not a Mom,
you're a wreck!

366
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:42,017
Dvir... Go back
to the children's house. Now!

367
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,175
lmpossible.
Avram's a good guy, a great worker,

368
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,738
and l don't see any
reason to blame him,

369
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:52,537
considering your
dog could open doors.

370
00:41:52,982 --> 00:41:55,496
Maybe he was hungry, opened
the door and got locked inside!

371
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:58,137
This place is rotten!
-Don't raise your voice!

372
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,140
You've got two kids,

373
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:04,416
and we take care of everything.
Have you heard any complaints?

374
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:06,295
No.
-And why is that?

375
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:07,970
Because in our community,

376
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,697
we all give as much as we can
and get as much as we need.

377
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,179
When you were hospitalized... -That
was ages ago and l've recovered!

378
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:18,934
Your visitor didn't work for 2 weeks,
and that's great about our community.

379
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:23,534
Why was he kicked out?!
-Because he broke a member's arm!

380
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,532
That's enough! You can't blame
the kibbutz for your problems!

381
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:31,577
Why don't you ask yourself
what you can do for the kibbutz!

382
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,212
Miri,

383
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:36,410
don't do it!

384
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,057
Why?

385
00:42:58,462 --> 00:42:59,611
Why?!

386
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:05,776
Why?

387
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:12,175
Good morning...

388
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,980
l'm alright.

389
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:19,051
l'm alright.

390
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:24,452
l'm alright! -Miri?

391
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,176
lt's alright.

392
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:31,221
Miri... -l'm alright!
-Miri, everything's alright.

393
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,573
Come with me now.

394
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:35,853
You're late for work.

395
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:40,821
Can you hear me?

396
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:08,139
What does she want from me? ls it
my fault the Swiss guy dumped her?

397
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:09,817
You devil!

398
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,092
l'll kill you.

399
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:16,133
Miri, calm down!

400
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:18,690
Give me
the pitchfork!

401
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,291
l'll chop you up!

402
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:24,132
You maniac! -Miri, put it down or
l'll send you back to the hospital!

403
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:25,935
Go ahead,
hospitalize me!

404
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,613
Maniac!
-l'll kill you!!

405
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:37,330
Maniac!

406
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:38,737
The shoulder!

407
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:44,932
Stop it! Let me go!

408
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,978
Happy Birthday
to you...

409
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:42,981
Mazal Tov!

410
00:45:46,582 --> 00:45:47,810
Mazal Tov.

411
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:50,291
Aren't you happy?

412
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:53,017
l already have
a bike that Mom gave me.

413
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:58,977
Now you'll have a new one. -When
are they going to let Mom come back?

414
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:02,741
Dvir, we had this conversation
just the other week.

415
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:04,090
Your mother needs time.

416
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:05,861
l want to see her.

417
00:46:06,302 --> 00:46:08,258
She can't see you right now.
-Why not?

418
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:10,693
Dvir, don't worry.

419
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,370
She's in good hands.

420
00:46:16,302 --> 00:46:18,770
l've got to visit her.
She must miss me.

421
00:46:20,462 --> 00:46:23,181
Eyal is going to visit her tomorrow.
Would you like to write her?

422
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:26,455
l don't want to write her!
l want to see her!

423
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:48,934
Autumn

424
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:56,497
Hi, sweetie.

425
00:46:57,942 --> 00:46:59,011
How's Mum?

426
00:46:59,662 --> 00:47:02,130
As good as new.
- Really?

427
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:05,813
Looks great, she's all better.
That's why l brought her back home.

428
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:07,581
She's in the kibbutz?

429
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,537
Asleep.
You can see her later.

430
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:13,492
Will you come
with me?

431
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:17,140
Can't. My draft orders came,
l'm outta here in an hour.

432
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:20,941
You're not coming
to see Mom?

433
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:23,213
Dvir, don't be a baby!
l'm enlisting!

434
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:26,571
When are you coming back?
-ln 3 years.

435
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:29,334
But l'll be home
on weekends.

436
00:47:48,862 --> 00:47:52,741
Will you come with me to Mom's?
Just for a few minutes?

437
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:54,854
Don't worry, Dviri.

438
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:58,294
Go see her every day,
make sure she goes to bed early,

439
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,495
and see she's
off alcohol and medication.

440
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:37,491
Dviri...

441
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:42,257
How are you?

442
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:52,457
What's that?

443
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,936
lt's the puzzle
Stephan bought you.

444
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:06,374
l wrote him a letter.
Want me to read it to you?

445
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:09,417
Yes.

446
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:25,340
''Stephan, my love.

447
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:28,857
l was happy to get
your letter.

448
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:33,454
l want you to know l remained
faithful to you in the hospital.

449
00:49:33,902 --> 00:49:36,052
And l can
hardly wait...''

450
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:40,540
How is it so far?

451
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:43,221
Want to start over?

452
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,052
''Stephan,
my dear love''

453
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,055
Comma.

454
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:56,019
''l apologize for
everything that's happened.

455
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:00,933
And l want you
to know

456
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:03,450
that l love you

457
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,816
and miss you a lot.

458
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,417
Don't give up
on me, please.''

459
00:50:11,222 --> 00:50:12,211
Period.

460
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:18,254
Stephan's left me.

461
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:29,334
Don't worry, Mom.

462
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:32,094
We'll find someone
better for you.

463
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:42,382
''From Tel Aviv.
50 years old. An army officer.

464
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:46,610
lntelligent,
and has a car every other weekend''.

465
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,016
And this is his
military post address.

466
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,300
He wouldn't want me.

467
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,702
Fine,
then l'll write him.

468
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,895
''Young,

Don't write

475
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:57,932
Fine.

Up on your feet! Up!

477
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:32,891
Get in, coward!

''l swear to the Movement!''
-l swear...

479
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:39,491
Get in line.

480
00:52:41,142 --> 00:52:43,258
On the tractor!
Step forward!

481
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:46,412
l swear to the
Movement. -l swear.

482
00:52:48,142 --> 00:52:50,258
On the tractor!
Step forward!

483
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,613
l swear! -l swear.

484
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:56,415
On the tractor!

485
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:59,695
Step forward! l
swear! -l swear!

486
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:03,653
On the tractor!
Step forward!

487
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,811
Winter

488
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:26,337
Dvir!

489
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:28,818
l brought you
some kerosene.

490
00:53:35,142 --> 00:53:39,340
We agreed to bring her back, although
the kibbutz decided she wasn't sane.

491
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:42,700
But you have
to be careful.

492
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:45,335
Do you understand?

493
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:48,421
You have to be careful that
what happened to your father

494
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:50,090
won't happen to you.

495
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:53,892
What happened
to my father?

496
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:57,297
lt's her fault.

497
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,020
All her fault.

498
00:55:01,062 --> 00:55:02,415
Wanna do
something special?

499
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:06,937
Like what?

500
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:09,293
Wanna go for a walk?

501
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:13,701
But it's raining.
-Then we could cook something.

502
00:55:15,222 --> 00:55:18,976
Let's go out to the field,
get some potatoes and bake them.

503
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,136
Mom, it's raining.

504
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:23,140
We'll take
an umbrella.

505
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:25,774
You won't melt.

506
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:28,175
Would you like that?

507
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:31,772
Yeah.

508
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:41,336
This is fun!
-Say again, dear?

509
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:43,181
This is fun!

510
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:49,220
This is fun!

511
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:54,138
This is fun!

512
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:58,491
You're fun.
You are the best part of my life.

513
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,054
Let's go back.
l don't want you to catch a cold.

514
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:21,297
Dviri...

515
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:24,940
you're a big boy
now.

516
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,339
l want you to know
that this time l recovered for good.

517
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,498
Your mother is
as strong as an ox.

518
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,053
Mom,
what's that suitcase?

519
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:45,939
l'm going to Stephan.
Didn't l tell you?

520
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:50,374
No.
When are you leaving?

521
00:56:50,822 --> 00:56:52,494
ln one hour.

522
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:55,377
Mom...

523
00:56:56,982 --> 00:56:58,574
You're not going
anywhere.

524
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:19,611
''You are the world,
and the world is you.

525
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,622
l need you like
the air l breathe.

526
00:57:23,062 --> 00:57:26,259
Day and night,
and when l fall asleep.

527
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:30,219
Dad,
l want to hug you.''

528
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:36,622
Sounds better
in French.

529
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:39,295
Sounds good
in Hebrew, too.

530
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,177
Really?

531
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:52,735
This is from France.

532
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:56,140
My Dad told me to
save it for hard times,

533
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,702
when l can't take
it anymore.

534
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:02,534
l have two left.

535
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:04,381
Want one?

536
00:58:06,022 --> 00:58:07,501
Are you sure?

537
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:13,851
Thank you.

538
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:05,297
Good night.

539
00:59:13,022 --> 00:59:15,138
Don't stay up
too late, Dvir.

540
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:36,941
Have you been
drinking?

541
00:59:37,622 --> 00:59:39,055
l'm sorry, l was alone.

542
00:59:39,182 --> 00:59:42,094
And the puzzle is tricky.
All pieces are white.

543
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:44,897
You should go to sleep.
-l can't sleep.

544
00:59:46,902 --> 00:59:50,611
Why did he leave me?
-He didn't leave you. He loves you.

545
00:59:51,062 --> 00:59:52,541
Why doesn't he
write to me?

546
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:06,897
He will write...
l'm sure he will.

547
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:11,413
Now go to sleep, okay?

548
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,790
Today we
will learn about sex.

549
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,914
First, there's no
sex without love. And why?

550
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,032
Because two people who
have a baby must love each other.

551
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:39,516
Otherwise, their child
will not be happy. ls that clear?

552
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,629
So first there's
love, then sex.

553
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,389
But only after the
age of 1 8, is that clear?

554
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,550
This is the second
time you're late.

555
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:56,467
Next time you'll be punished!
-Take your seat.

556
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,638
This is the male
organ, the penis,

557
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,229
and this is the
female organ, the vagina.

558
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:13,796
The brain commands
the penis to become erect and grow

559
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:15,433
and it gets bigger
and bigger.

560
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:20,555
The vagina senses
it, and begins to lubricate,

561
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,273
in anticipation of
the penis.

562
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:25,837
The penis realizes this
and inserts itself in the vagina,

563
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:29,271
where all at once it ejaculates
millions of sperm cells.

564
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,630
This is how we get
pregnant.

565
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,114
So to sum it up:

566
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,710
Love plus sex,
after the age of 1 8,

567
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:39,957
equals pregnancy.
ls that clear?

568
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:44,874
Excuse me.

569
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:06,709
Have you seen
Dvir? -No.

570
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:09,719
He didn't sleep
in the children's house,

571
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,307
so he missed the personal assignment.

572
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:16,115
They're very angry with him.
-Shall l go look for him? -No.

573
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,868
There's lots of
work today. Start sorting.

574
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:41,954
Miri, you got a letter.
l just finished translating it.

575
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,271
Shall l read
it to you?

576
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:53,993
''Miri, my love.

577
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:57,829
Ever since l left lsrael,
l haven't stopped thinking of you.

578
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:01,874
You are the woman of my life.
You are my other half,

579
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:07,313
l could never let you go.
l believe we'll work it all out soon

580
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:09,670
and be able to be
together forever.

581
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:15,068
Meanwhile, you must be strong
and think only good thoughts.

582
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,398
Remember, love
conquers all. Stephan.''

583
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,038
lf a baby cries,
you will hear it over the intercom.

584
01:05:52,479 --> 01:05:56,552
Then you take a bottle of milk
and rush over to the baby.

585
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:58,389
ls that clear?

586
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:00,318
Yes. -Dvir...

587
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,471
Let's go patrol
the fence.

588
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:08,235
l'll let you fire
the rifle.

589
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:10,034
l wanna stay.

590
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:11,707
Scared, huh?

591
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:14,787
Fine.

592
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:18,634
Just don't you dare
fall asleep.

593
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:34,510
Kids, this is Avram. Don't burn the
milk, or you'll fail the assignment.

594
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:50,270
''l think of you
when l get up in the morning.

595
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,036
l write a poem for you
before l go to bed.''

596
01:06:59,399 --> 01:07:03,233
''l think of you
when l get up in the morning.

597
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,638
l write a poem for you
before l go to bed.''

598
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,672
Draw a flower here.

599
01:07:13,399 --> 01:07:14,354
A heart.

600
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:16,147
A heart's better.

601
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,554
Okay.

602
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:26,357
''P.S. Give my regards to Dvir. Do
as he says, 'cause he's a smart boy.''

603
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:45,874
Carob.

604
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,309
Mom...

605
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:31,038
What is it?

606
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:33,631
l'm depressed.

607
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:35,068
Why?

608
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:38,832
l'm alone.

609
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,507
No, you're not.

610
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,708
Everyone
is leaving me.

611
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,469
Nobody
is leaving you. Look.

612
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:53,948
You got another
postcard from Stephan.

613
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,278
l'm out of Elaterol.

614
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,394
What's Elaterol?

615
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,995
A pill that warms
my heart.

616
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:06,029
When did you start
taking it?

617
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,911
After your father
killed himself.

618
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:28,717
What do you need,
sweetie?

619
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,113
l need Elaterol.

620
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,913
Why?
-For my mother.

621
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,436
l gave her two packs
the other week. -She's out.

622
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:43,233
l can't give her any more.
-She needs more. lt warms her heart!

623
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,477
l know what it does,
but overdosing can be harmful!

624
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:49,069
She's suffering,
don't you get it? -Calm down.

625
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:51,310
You have lots of it!
Why are you being so mean?

626
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,952
You don't understand...
-Oh, yes l do.

627
01:09:57,839 --> 01:10:02,196
This is Hannah, my grandmother,
she runs the laundry service.

628
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,478
This is Zvi, my grandfather,
who's our teacher.

629
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,110
This is Miri, my
mother.

630
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:13,798
She works in the
laundry, too.

631
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:19,835
This is Stephan, her boyfriend.
Owns a restaurant in Switzerland.

632
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:22,517
That's Eyal,
my brother.

633
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,391
This is Jonathan,
my Dad.

634
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:29,115
He died, so that's
why he's in a different color.

635
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,754
And this is me.
-Well done.

636
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:44,115
How did your father die?
-Ronen! -Sorry.

637
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:48,471
My father killed
himself.

638
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,550
l don't know
what to do.

639
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:00,637
l'm scared.

640
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:04,155
Let's write her
another letter from Stephan.

641
01:13:04,759 --> 01:13:07,114
lt's no use.
She doesn't write him back.

642
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:14,555
So we'll write him
in her name.

643
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:27,197
''Stephan, my love...''

644
01:13:32,599 --> 01:13:34,954
What does she want
to say to him?

645
01:13:38,839 --> 01:13:40,875
That she is
willing to leave the kibbutz.

646
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:49,036
That she wants him
to send plane tickets right away.

647
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,597
That l love him.

648
01:14:11,759 --> 01:14:14,227
Spring

649
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,274
Thanks, sweetie.

650
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:06,308
Thanks.

651
01:15:19,559 --> 01:15:21,470
ln the field,
we ate nothing but plants,

652
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:23,351
then we had to navigate in the night.

653
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:27,314
l was out of bullets,
so l pulled out my knife!

654
01:15:27,759 --> 01:15:30,319
Then they put me
on the stretcher.

655
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,033
The tank
went up in flames,

656
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,993
the chopper
didn't show up,

657
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:36,792
so eventually
l got promoted!

658
01:15:39,879 --> 01:15:43,076
Why are you so quiet?
-Will you come with me to see Mom?

659
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:57,750
Dviri, l'm dying to get laid,
l've got two hours.

660
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:01,591
Mom's in bad shape.
-l know she is. What can l do?

661
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:06,188
Want some? - Someone's got
to help her. -No-one can help her.

662
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:07,952
She doesn't want to live,
she said so.

663
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:09,558
Don't worry.
Everybody wants to live.

664
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,359
Dad didn't. -Dvir, give me a break,
l'm dying to get laid!

665
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:15,154
Dvir!

666
01:16:16,799 --> 01:16:18,118
l'm sorry.

667
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,958
Sit down
for a second.

668
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:35,950
Don't take this
upon yourself.

669
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:38,957
You can't.

670
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:41,392
No-one can.

671
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,592
Mom's ill, she'll never recover.
-She would if Stephan wrote her.

672
01:16:48,799 --> 01:16:51,267
She can't go on
thinking about him.

673
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:53,755
lt's driving her crazy.

674
01:16:57,319 --> 01:16:58,547
She got a letter.

675
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:03,269
But l didn't have
it translated.

676
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:06,549
When?

677
01:17:25,559 --> 01:17:28,312
''l'm sending
three tickets,

678
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:32,113
in case Eyal wants
to come along.

679
01:17:42,439 --> 01:17:47,911
My love, l can hardly
wait to see you in Switzerland.

680
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,108
Love, Stephan.''

681
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:18,751
l'll miss you.

682
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:20,588
A lot.

683
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:29,117
Do you want to come with us?
There's a ticket for you.

684
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:31,798
l do.

685
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:37,874
We're leaving straight after
the fire ceremony. But it's a secret.

686
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,072
l won't tell.

687
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,032
What are you
thinking?

688
01:18:53,599 --> 01:18:55,954
l think l love you.

689
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:46,836
lt's a secret,
you see.

690
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:49,918
We're going
straight after the fire ceremony.

691
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:54,910
lt will be alright.
You must hold on for two more days.

692
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:59,755
Promise me you're
going to make it.

693
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:01,348
Promise?

694
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:04,953
Promise.

695
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,192
You're beautiful.

696
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,433
You're beautiful.

697
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:19,468
We're together.

698
01:20:19,999 --> 01:20:22,035
We're leaving
together.

699
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:28,034
We're together.
We're leaving together.

700
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:38,469
Our Bar Mitzvah
graduates, Peach class!

701
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:40,875
And first to go is...

702
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,833

-Lift!

703

Pull! Jump!

704
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:55,794
Well done!
-''Oren, my dear, may you be

705
01:20:56,039 --> 01:20:58,075
a source of pride
to the Movement and the kibbutz.

706
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:01,271
May you grow up
to be an officer, like me,

707
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:04,870
and may you always
remember where you came from.

708
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:08,398
We love you very much,
your father and mother.''

709
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,753
Well done, Oren.
Well done!

710
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:19,117

Well done! Go on!

714
01:21:27,959 --> 01:21:30,632
''My sweet Uzi,

715
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:32,990
l would like to ask
you, if l may,

716
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:36,192

717
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,115
and make everybody
proud of you.

718
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:42,473
Always remember,
we all love you!

719
01:21:42,959 --> 01:21:45,473
Your Dad and your Mom
and all the kibbutz members.''

720
01:21:50,879 --> 01:21:51,868
Well done!

721
01:21:54,559 --> 01:21:55,514
Next we have...

722
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:58,197
Dvir Avni!

723
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,193
Lift! Pull!

01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:05,594
Jump!

725
01:22:12,519 --> 01:22:14,350
''My dear Dvir,
on your special day

726
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:17,836
l wanted to wish you
that you'll be a kind person,

727
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,316
that you'll be
a person...''

728
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,792
My Dvir...

729
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:28,474
l tried writing,
but it didn't work out.

730
01:22:28,919 --> 01:22:30,750
So l'll give you my
blessing from the heart.

731
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,234
My child,

732
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:35,470
l wanted to be
a mother to you...

733
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:38,628
l wanted
to raise you

734
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,558
and to care for you.

735
01:22:41,919 --> 01:22:43,398
But l couldn't do it.

736
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:46,678
l'm sorry.

737
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:51,471
lt's not my fault.
-Miri. -Wait!

738
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:57,073
My darling Dvir,
l wish you a happy life!

739
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:59,953
Full of love.

740
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:06,797
And l hope you run away
from this place and never come back!

741
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:08,592
Let go of me!

742
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:11,037
Because this
kibbutz is death!

743
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:13,197
Full of evil people!

744
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:15,311
You must know
the truth!

745
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:17,677
You must know
the truth!

746
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:21,589
Your father wanted to leave, too!
But they suffocated him!

747
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:23,598
They crushed him!

748
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:25,518
Until he broke!

749
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,870
lt's a kibbutz
of evil people!

750
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:31,834
They wouldn't let
me take you and your brother!

751
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:33,837
They said l'm crazy.

752
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:36,431
They wouldn't let
me take my kids!

753
01:23:36,879 --> 01:23:39,916
You must know
the truth. Run away!

754
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:44,238
As far as you can!
Save yourself from this hellhole!

755
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:46,670
From these evil people!

756
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:48,957
Run away!

757
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:29,837
Forgive me.

758
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:33,837
lt's for life, Mom.

759
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,154
They're going to
hospitalize me. Tomorrow.

760
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:45,230
l just want
to sleep.

761
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:49,188
Help me.

762
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:54,477
We could
still go away.

763
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,068
We'll run away
first thing tomorrow morning.

764
01:25:58,879 --> 01:26:00,232
You won't be
hospitalized.

765
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,154
Dvir,

766
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:09,029
l want to sleep.

767
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,116
Please have mercy on me.

768
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:24,155
We'll go
to Stephan's.

769
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:26,908
We'll get up
and go to Stephan's.

770
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:30,952
l want to sleep.

771
01:26:33,759 --> 01:26:35,954
Don't you
understand?

772
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:40,677
Can't you
understand?

773
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:45,356
l have to go
to sleep.

774
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:51,310
l'm out of pills.

775
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,231
Help me, Dviri.

776
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:03,955
What pills
do you need?

777
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:07,788
Valium.

778
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:31,310
Take care
of yourself.

779
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,718
After l am gone,

780
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,673
Spare the gravestone,
Save it for a building.

781
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:58,350
Don't print a book of my life,
Save the space on the shelf.

782
01:30:58,799 --> 01:31:01,438
Don't waste a day in my memory.
Enough, we have had enough.

783
01:31:01,879 --> 01:31:03,949
Tzipora Shaul,
