1
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,197
Hey.

2
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:05,966
Daddy?

3
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,465
Daddy!

4
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,201
Okay, sweetie, I'm here.

5
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:18,043
There's monsters in the house.

6
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,774
There's no monstersin
the house, sweetie.

7
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:26,146
There's monsters, I heard them.

8
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:30,586
Oh, okay. I'm up, I'm up.

9
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:37,898
Why don't you get into
bed with mommy, okay?

10
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,999
Good girl.

11
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,233
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

12
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,742
All right. I'm in the hallway,

13
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:22,873
No monsters. What about the bedroom?
Okay.

14
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:26,184
No monsters in the
bedroom, sweetie.

15
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:29,554
Daddy, look in the kitchen.

16
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:31,756
Okay.

17
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,795
I'm walking down the hallway.

18
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:42,136
What do we have?

19
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,737
No.

20
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,867
No monsters in the office.

21
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,078
Daddy. Okay, I'm going
to the kitchen now.

22
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,979
Here we go.

23
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,220
What the hell...

24
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:10,699
No! Oh my God, no!

25
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,070
Oh my God, no! Oh my God!
Oh God!

26
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,281
Oh oh.

27
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,021
Oh God. Kathryn.

28
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:31,362
Oh oh oh.

29
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:35,024
No.

30
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,734
Oh my God.

31
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,404
Christ.

32
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:47,244
Oh God.

33
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,276
Oh, please.

34
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,245
Who are you?

35
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:53,386
Who the fuck...

36
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:07,909
What the... What the...
what do you want?

37
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,840
What do you want?

38
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,180
What is this?

39
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,310
Oh, don't hurt them.

40
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,880
Please don't. Please.

41
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,950
I'm begging you. Oh fuck.

42
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,221
No. Oh God.

43
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:33,762
If you hurt them, I
swear to God... No!

44
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:37,302
God.

45
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:43,802
You fucking fuck!

46
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,173
Oh! Oh! Please, not my baby.

47
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:48,013
Oh God. My baby, please.

48
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,055
No!

49
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,825
Reflexes positive, at 2+.

50
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,165
How's our respiratory rate?

51
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,906
Respiratory's at 20 and holding.

52
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,437
Pulse?

53
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:18,848
Check pupil size.

54
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:23,289
Looks like 2mm.

55
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,858
Excellent.

56
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,470
Responding to blood pressure.

57
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:51,552
Very good.

58
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,252
You were thirsty.

59
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,903
Now how about a bite of food?

60
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,633
Look.

61
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,074
Mmm.

62
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,374
Delicious.

63
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,055
Now you.

64
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,326
Perfect.

65
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,956
How we doing today?

66
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,657
We're doing great, aren't we?

67
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,367
We're eating our food.

68
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:35,368
Good.

69
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,440
Good.

70
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,339
John?

71
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,179
John?

72
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,679
I'm Dr. Timothy
Brady. I've been, uh,

73
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,351
treating you since
you were admitted.

74
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,020
Though I feel like

75
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,561
we're meeting each other
for the first time.

76
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:00,161
You've been comatose for
the past nine months.

77
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,362
This is Agent Gorman
with the F.B.I.

78
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:08,172
He has some questions for you.

79
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,043
John.

80
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,724
I'm gonna go over
there now, okay?

81
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:24,585
Given that you're the sole
eyewitness to the crime,

82
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,054
It's imperative that
we get your testimony

83
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,696
While it's fresh in your mind.

84
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,577
Do you remember the incident?

85
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:43,247
Everything?

86
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,688
Your wife and daughter
didn't survive the attack.

87
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,258
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,498
Do you...

89
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,010
Do you remember anything
before the incident?

90
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,010
Memory loss is to be expected.

91
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:11,211
But with proper therapy

92
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,741
it's likely you'll recover

93
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,682
a large portion of your
memories over time.

94
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:22,733
Have you ever seen this man?

95
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,034
Was he the man who murdered
your wife and daughter?

96
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,604
Yeah.

97
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,304
His name is Luc Deveraux.

98
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,576
His prints were all
over the crime scene.

99
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:44,645
Who is he?

100
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,417
Once a highly-decorated
serviceman,

101
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,686
but now he's best
classified as a deserter.

102
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,197
Why did... Why did
he kill my family?

103
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,707
Can you think of a reason?

104
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,777
I think that's enough for now.

105
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,348
Okay.

106
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,348
Try to get some rest.

107
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,259
Call me if you
remember anything,

108
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,329
no matter how trivial.

109
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,310
Put the plumber to work.

110
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,902
The last guy they sent out
charged me 150 bucks.

111
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:07,602
And it's still leaking.

112
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,473
And it's still leaking.

113
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,473
It's still leaking,
still leaking.

114
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,614
So I called 'em backhand I said,

115
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:18,783
"I already paid once. I'm
not gonna do it again."

116
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,765
Hey, are you okay?

117
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:34,436
Oh Jesus.

118
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,706
Hey hey. Where are you going?

119
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:25,362
Just sign here and here.

120
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,872
And these are your things.

121
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,548
Do you like it?

122
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,317
I love it. Because I made it.

123
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:25,828
I know you did.

124
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,697
Thank you, sweetie. Thank
you so much.

125
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:32,088
You're welcome.

126
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,243
Daddy?

127
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,398
Daddy.

128
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,169
There's monsters in the house.

129
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,743
Daddy...

130
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,349
Daddy!

131
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:36,821
Come on in, darling.

132
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,148
Double up special this evening.

133
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,383
Give it to me, give it to me.

134
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:20,413
Harder harder harder.

135
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,339
Come on.

136
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:37,618
Oh oh.

137
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,059
You came here to kill me.

138
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,870
Yet I'm prepared to give
you his greatest gift.

139
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:11,856
You will be freed.

140
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:14,463
You will serve him.

141
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,905
Ah.

142
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:27,290
From this moment on,

143
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,495
you're no longer a slave
to the government.

144
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:36,542
From this moment on,
your mind is your own.

145
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:40,529
You're no longer a slave.

146
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,960
From this moment on...
from this moment on...

147
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,371
You will seek vengeance
on your oppressors.

148
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:53,471
Freedom is yours.

149
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,256
We are brothers.

150
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,287
We are one.

151
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:03,989
Hello? John.

152
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,790
Who's this?

153
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,700
It's Isaac, man. Is that you?

154
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,870
Yeah, it's me.
Jesus Christ, man.

155
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,740
Where have you been? Has
everything b-been all right?

156
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:23,010
Everything's fine.

157
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,840
Oh man. I thought you were...

158
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:27,442
You should have called me, man.

159
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,581
Where are you? I'm home now.

160
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,982
I can't leave, you know. They...

161
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:35,421
They've been calling. I don't
know what it's about, man.

162
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,962
I haven't picked up the phone.

163
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,592
That's good.

164
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,833
Anyways he's not
making it easy, man.

165
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,733
Everything's here. It's loaded.

166
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,074
It's waiting to be
picked up, man.

167
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,074
But I don't know what to do.

168
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,404
You need to come
over, man, please.

169
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,714
What's the address?
Oh, you know.

170
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:57,714
It's in my house.
Tell me again.

171
00:24:57,715 --> 00:25:00,915
I don't understand,
man. I'm worried.

172
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,426
I think they're watching me,
man. I don't think I'm safe.

173
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:07,087
Okay, give me the
address and I'll come.

174
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:12,066
Man, it's... you know I'm at
woodland commons, 9c, man.

175
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:15,597
Same as before, man. I'm sorry,
but it's just too much, man.

176
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,538
You got to get here.

177
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:32,058
Isaac kiakov, 3-26,

178
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,759
significant progress
reducing gestation period

179
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,099
From phase II of universal
soldier program.

180
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,371
We'll know in a few weeks
if everything looks good.

181
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,072
Conversion rate on
embryos is way up.

182
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:53,081
Incubation period dropping
below nine months.

183
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,752
Dr. Su plans on adding
somatic stem cells

184
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,422
to the injection to make the
inhibitors more effective.

185
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:02,152
Still, I'm skeptical if we could
achieve a complete override.

186
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:04,313
As for implants, still a
struggle at the moment.

187
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,457
All right. How about a big round
of applause for fantasia?

188
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,887
Now put your hands together

189
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:05,459
for the lovely, the
luxurious raven.

190
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,240
Do you know me? Wait wait,
I wanna talk to you.

191
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,440
You really shouldn't be here.

192
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,380
Why is that?

193
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:26,549
You don't know?

194
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,051
I'm working. I'll
pay for your time.

195
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,060
But I don't have
time. Isaac kiakov.

196
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,392
Get your hands off me.
Do you know Isaac kiakov?

197
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:37,392
Hey, sweet tits. How
about a dance for Larry?

198
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:40,102
Yeah okay, Larry. I got time...
get your fucking hands off me.

199
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:41,602
Get your fucking hands off her!

200
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:43,101
Larry. Faggot!

201
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:44,272
Come on. We got to dance.

202
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:46,113
What the fuck?

203
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:11,244
Your mind is not your own.

204
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:26,466
Your mind is not your own.

205
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,297
Mommy!

206
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:46,408
Get him.

207
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,679
Hey!

208
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,299
Stay the fuck out.

209
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:44,506
Calm down.

210
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:48,277
Calm the fuck down!

211
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,917
Or I'm gonna hurt you.

212
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,888
Shh.

213
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,359
No. Calm down or I'm
gonna hurt you.

214
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,870
Calm down.

215
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,371
Why did you come back?

216
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,276
John!

217
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:46,386
Jesus Christ.

218
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:29,733
Back, John!

219
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:01,368
My brothers.

220
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,909
Let's not forget the
moment of sickness.

221
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,508
Our thoughts interrupted by

222
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,849
unfamiliar worships.

223
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:17,050
We were merely arms and legs

224
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:20,020
moving to the directive
of another mind.

225
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:23,521
But in an instant the
veil has lifted.

226
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:26,003
And today, brothers, I
stand here to declare

227
00:38:27,002 --> 00:38:29,862
your minds are now your own.

228
00:38:33,903 --> 00:38:37,101
Each and every one of
us bred into slavery,

229
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:40,369
superior to our creators.

230
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,439
They gave us nothing...
nothing inside

231
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:48,051
but the void in our
soul, the curse

232
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,022
that binds us together,
my brothers.

233
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:54,792
But then he came along.

234
00:38:54,793 --> 00:39:01,033
He turned the curse
into a blessing.

235
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,602
He is the inspiration.

236
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:05,504
He is the light
that set us free.

237
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,603
We are his eyes and ears

238
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:12,614
and soon we shall multiply 10,

239
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:15,956
20, a hundredfold!

240
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:22,385
We pioneers will spawn
the first generation

241
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:24,695
blessed with free will,

242
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,057
taking vengeance upon
those whose arrogance

243
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,466
once assumed our servitude.

244
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:36,037
With each passing day,
we grow stronger,

245
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:38,777
digging deeper into
the outside world.

246
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:41,807
Unnoticed, we live among
them like ghosts,

247
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:44,709
biding our time,
waiting for the moment

248
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,018
when our oppressors shall be
forced to kneel before us

249
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,190
and pay for their sins!

250
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,631
The day of reckoning!

251
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,809
In the club,

252
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,550
you looked at me like
you didn't know me.

253
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:47,021
Do you know me, John?

254
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:52,689
Yes.

255
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,001
What's my name?

256
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,042
Fantasia.

257
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:08,553
You don't remember
anything, do you?

258
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:15,823
No.

259
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,064
Something happened to me.

260
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,644
You really should go to
the hospital for this.

261
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:46,055
You remember where I worked?

262
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:49,225
Where I spent my days?

263
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:51,856
You drove a truck.

264
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:57,596
Picked things up down by
the dock near the club.

265
00:41:57,597 --> 00:42:00,708
Some of my customers
work over there.

266
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,666
The last time we saw each other,

267
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,248
tell me how you remember it.

268
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:12,219
We spent the night
before at your place.

269
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:16,117
You've been to my house?

270
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:19,318
It's not exactly a house.

271
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:24,628
More like a shack
out on the river.

272
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:27,098
Do you remember
how to get there?

273
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:29,269
I think so.

274
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,830
Anybody else know
about this place?

275
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,311
I don't know.

276
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,771
Okay, finish the story.

277
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:40,051
You came by the club,

278
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:44,951
sat in the corner
and watched me.

279
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:47,651
Same as always.

280
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:50,963
Drinking whiskey.

281
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:54,033
After my shift, I go to change.

282
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:57,193
And on my way outside,

283
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:59,233
I hear yelling coming
from the parking lot.

284
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:06,074
By the time I make it outside, you
were already into it with some guy.

285
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,705
It all happened really quick.

286
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:11,915
I scream your name, but
you wouldn't stop.

287
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,986
You were just pounding this guy.

288
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:19,324
He couldn't fight back

289
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:22,696
and still you don't stop.

290
00:43:28,697 --> 00:43:31,367
Even the bouncers were
afraid to get involved.

291
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,907
I scream your name.

292
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,307
Finally you stop.

293
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:42,448
You go to your
canard you take off.

294
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,789
The guy wasn't moving.

295
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,969
This is the last time I saw you.

296
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,211
Why do you think I did that?

297
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:09,392
Because he looked at me.

298
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,133
Come here.

299
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,502
Come here. Agh!

300
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:26,203
Come here.

301
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,904
Daddy?

302
00:45:33,904 --> 00:45:36,844
I can't sleep.

303
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:38,395
There's monsters.

304
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:56,038
No-ooo!

305
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:48,365
Are you alone?

306
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:50,366
Yeah.

307
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,646
What happened?

308
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:03,278
Are you in trouble, John?

309
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:07,578
My head injury,

310
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:09,459
it's not getting any better.

311
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,659
In fact, it feels like
it's getting worse.

312
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,959
I can't remember anything.

313
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,930
You heard what Brady said.
That's gonna take some time.

314
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:20,541
No, it's more than that.

315
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,242
I'm seeing things.

316
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:30,271
I'm seeing things that
aren't even there.

317
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:31,282
What are you seeing?

318
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:35,423
Him.

319
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:43,364
Deveraux?

320
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:48,434
How many of these
visions have you had?

321
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,575
I guess two.

322
00:47:57,577 --> 00:48:00,376
Over the past three years,
a number of our agents

323
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,417
have disappeared off the grid.

324
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:07,617
Now, we assumed that they have
been kidnapped or killed.

325
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:11,257
And then in June,

326
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:13,287
one of those agents was spotted

327
00:48:13,288 --> 00:48:15,599
on a surveillance tape
taken at the docks.

328
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,469
He was with a man that we
believe to be Deveraux.

329
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,368
The prevailing
theory's that Deveraux

330
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,500
had brainwashed
him, among others,

331
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,479
and he's... he's forming some
sort of separatist group

332
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,780
that's operating out
of these parts.

333
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:33,380
What's that got to do with me?

334
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:36,053
We heard that the individuals that
have had contact with Deveraux

335
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,053
are experiencing
similar visions.

336
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:44,192
He may be using some kind
of mind-control technique

337
00:48:44,193 --> 00:48:46,633
in an attempt to
access your psyche.

338
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:53,575
I can feel him watching me.

339
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:56,704
Look, he may be.

340
00:48:56,705 --> 00:49:01,215
And if he is, we will find him.

341
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,425
Thanks for talking to me.

342
00:49:14,427 --> 00:49:16,237
John.

343
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:23,136
If you go looking for Deveraux,

344
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:25,468
he'll find you first.

345
00:50:32,146 --> 00:50:34,556
Get him, come on, get him!

346
00:53:04,855 --> 00:53:06,885
This is it.

347
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:08,096
You wait here.

348
00:53:09,096 --> 00:53:12,467
I'll be back 10 minutes.
And what if you're not?

349
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,896
Wait another 10.

350
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:36,858
Your buddy kept calling,

351
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:39,129
asking if you'd picked
up your shit or not.

352
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,859
Kept calling and calling.

353
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,400
But I guess he won't
recalling any more.

354
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,961
Where is my shit?

355
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:48,900
Where do you think? Bring
your truck around.

356
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,540
I don't have the truck.

357
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:54,071
But I wanna take a
look. It's all there.

358
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:57,041
Yeah, I wanna take a look.

359
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,392
Take a look. I
don't give a fuck.

360
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:13,593
Where'd I take the
last container?

361
00:54:13,594 --> 00:54:15,594
Why are you asking me?

362
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:17,035
Just tell me where it went.

363
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:18,565
I don't know...

364
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:21,605
Down river, up river.it's
not my problem.

365
00:54:23,606 --> 00:54:26,844
Hey, man, look, this is between
you and Mr. caste llano.

366
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:29,745
I just work here.

367
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:31,585
And where is Mr. Castellano?

368
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,886
Where he always is.

369
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:35,686
He's in his office.

370
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,156
And he would know where
the shipments go?

371
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:41,927
Nothing goes up the river
unless Ron Castellano says so.

372
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:43,737
Good. I want to talk to him.

373
00:54:45,738 --> 00:54:48,637
I don't think right now is a good time.
I don't...

374
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:50,709
I don't know if... you
know what I'm saying?

375
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:55,210
Okay.

376
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:25,613
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

377
00:55:45,836 --> 00:55:48,976
How you've been, John?

378
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:51,837
Make yourself at home.

379
00:55:59,987 --> 00:56:02,788
You make him scared too, John.

380
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:05,828
That's when he's most dangerous.

381
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:09,528
Yeah, I'm more careful now.

382
00:56:09,529 --> 00:56:11,069
You can see that.

383
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:16,599
I keep an eye on things.

384
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,909
My shipment, where's it going?

385
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:27,250
If I knew I wouldn't
tell you, but I don't.

386
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,619
I never did, John.

387
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,220
You made sure of that.

388
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,959
I let you take your
containers up my river.

389
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,790
I didn't ask you where
you were going.

390
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,901
I learned my lesson.

391
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,170
You don't know anything, do you?

392
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,309
You're like him.

393
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:58,040
If someone leaves the
room for 20 minutes,

394
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,720
you'll forget they exist.

395
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,790
This man.

396
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,750
You know him? Go
fuck yourself.

397
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,070
Take it easy.

398
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,801
What difference
does it make, yeah?

399
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:22,971
What more can you take from me?

400
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,302
You tell me who he is.

401
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:27,271
Why don't you tell me?

402
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:30,393
He's your fucking
boss, not mine.

403
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:45,194
Your container was sitting
there collecting dust.

404
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,405
It made us wonder.

405
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:52,176
So we took a look at your
buddy, that little worm.

406
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:57,106
But we kept an eye on him.

407
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,887
Hey, I got all the
time in the world.

408
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:13,398
Every morning

409
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:16,298
when they're emptying
my piss bag,

410
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:19,870
I think about eating the
barrel of a shotgun.

411
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:26,279
But a gun, it don't allow these

412
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,150
little moments of bliss...

413
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:40,001
To get you through your day.

414
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,154
You're fucked.

415
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:06,434
You're fucked, John.

416
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:10,219
You're fucked!

417
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,914
It's not safe here. We
need to find that cabin.

418
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:38,892
You remember where it
is, right? I think so.

419
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:41,974
It's on highway 15 west...

420
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:46,162
Fuck, no, wait. Is
it 15 or is it...

421
01:00:15,538 --> 01:00:17,184
Get down!

422
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:01,470
Hold on.

423
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,540
Oh my God.

424
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:17,932
He's right there! What
the fuck are you doing?

425
01:03:09,135 --> 01:03:10,340
Ah!

426
01:03:53,853 --> 01:03:55,569
Come on.

427
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:59,444
Get back.

428
01:03:59,445 --> 01:04:01,864
Look out!

429
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:57,329
You guys all right?

430
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,392
Hey. Hey!

431
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:23,495
John.

432
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:00,009
I was trying to remember
what you looked like.

433
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:09,848
It started off... Better, but...

434
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,067
I don't know.

435
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,987
After a while...

436
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,939
It got harder.

437
01:11:23,954 --> 01:11:26,966
I can remember now.

438
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,953
So what are you? My brother?

439
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:35,652
No, we're kind of like
the same sort of thing.

440
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:41,031
But maybe they made you better.

441
01:11:41,032 --> 01:11:42,950
You mean Isaac?

442
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:47,537
Yeah, I think that's his name.

443
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:49,707
So you killed him.

444
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:51,785
It was you?

445
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,104
Everything?

446
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:57,215
Yeah, I killed him.

447
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:59,736
I had to.

448
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,110
Do you work for him?

449
01:12:13,259 --> 01:12:16,783
I get up every morning,

450
01:12:17,787 --> 01:12:20,167
I go to work.

451
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:27,134
I come home, I go to sleep.

452
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,876
The next day... repeat.

453
01:12:31,883 --> 01:12:35,739
Feels like a life,
but I'm not sure.

454
01:12:36,743 --> 01:12:39,152
Something feels strange.

455
01:12:39,162 --> 01:12:42,345
Then one day I got sick.

456
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:46,491
I can hear this voice in my head

457
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:50,245
telling me that I
gotta find him.

458
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:53,499
Telling me that I
gotta kill him.

459
01:12:56,511 --> 01:12:59,321
So I go.

460
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:02,403
And I find him

461
01:13:02,404 --> 01:13:05,327
and then he shows me the truth.

462
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,910
And my thoughts?

463
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:13,026
They're not my own.

464
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:18,518
He shows me where they live...
In here,

465
01:13:19,523 --> 01:13:21,300
tracking me.

466
01:13:24,311 --> 01:13:25,727
And then he sets me free.

467
01:13:27,734 --> 01:13:30,606
So now I'm with him.

468
01:13:30,616 --> 01:13:33,156
He tells me I gotta find...

469
01:13:35,164 --> 01:13:37,613
Isaac.
...Isaac.

470
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:39,721
Yeah.

471
01:13:39,722 --> 01:13:44,279
I gotta get some
container from him,

472
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,291
take it to the docks,
send it upriver.

473
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:50,173
So I do as I'm told.

474
01:13:52,181 --> 01:13:53,828
I always do.

475
01:13:58,849 --> 01:14:01,226
Then I met you.

476
01:14:01,227 --> 01:14:06,356
And that's when I
realize I'm not free

477
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:08,866
and that I'm just
a slave to him.

478
01:14:08,868 --> 01:14:12,422
So I leave him.

479
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:17,311
I don't think I was
supposed to meet you.

480
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,992
No.

481
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:24,733
I'm different than you.

482
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:32,374
I had a family... A
wife, a daughter.

483
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:35,345
I can remember.

484
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,945
The memories...

485
01:14:39,945 --> 01:14:44,015
It hurts, doesn't it?

486
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:46,385
Yes.

487
01:14:46,386 --> 01:14:48,926
Go to him.

488
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:50,967
He'll help you forget.

489
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:55,027
Go to the river.

490
01:14:55,028 --> 01:14:58,558
They'll come for you.

491
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,011
I knew you'd come back.

492
01:15:41,012 --> 01:15:42,923
Now I can make it go away.

493
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:46,652
John?

494
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:48,724
John.

495
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:50,973
John, stop it!

496
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:09,755
You're just like me.

497
01:16:17,756 --> 01:16:20,456
It's okay.

498
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:24,137
It's okay.

499
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:37,749
Take it out.

500
01:16:38,749 --> 01:16:40,678
T-take what out?

501
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,719
You'll know when you find it.

502
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:57,021
Ahh.

503
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:28,685
Now you're free.

504
01:22:42,153 --> 01:22:46,563
Hello, John. Nice
to finally meet.

505
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,963
Please tilt your head
and open your mouth.

506
01:22:53,964 --> 01:22:57,004
You're just a baby.

507
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,345
You couldn't be more
than three weeks old.

508
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,545
Are you feeling any discomfort?

509
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:10,514
Yes.

510
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:12,455
Where?

511
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:15,996
In my head.

512
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:19,896
Your resistance...

513
01:23:19,897 --> 01:23:22,525
That's what gives
you discomfort.

514
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:24,437
Do you understand?

515
01:23:26,437 --> 01:23:28,566
Yes.

516
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:31,508
Can you release it?

517
01:23:34,508 --> 01:23:35,949
Why not?

518
01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:44,059
What do you remember?

519
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,659
My wife.

520
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,900
Anything else?

521
01:23:54,901 --> 01:23:57,072
My daughter.

522
01:24:01,071 --> 01:24:03,441
What happened to them?

523
01:24:03,442 --> 01:24:05,241
He killed them.

524
01:24:05,242 --> 01:24:07,482
Who killed them?

525
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:11,322
Him.

526
01:24:11,323 --> 01:24:14,694
You never had a family, John.

527
01:24:16,693 --> 01:24:19,464
Your memories are artificial.

528
01:24:21,464 --> 01:24:23,463
You were produce din
a government lab

529
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:25,134
where I used to work.

530
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:27,304
Created to kill,

531
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:30,505
motivated by a memory implant

532
01:24:30,506 --> 01:24:32,305
that I developed

533
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:35,515
that stimulates the
sensation of free will.

534
01:24:35,516 --> 01:24:38,445
They created the memory

535
01:24:38,446 --> 01:24:41,347
of your wife and daughter.

536
01:24:41,357 --> 01:24:44,697
They never really existed.

537
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:52,338
You're a newborn...
Born a grown man.

538
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:59,608
Your memories, John,
they give you pain.

539
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:02,277
But I can release you from them.

540
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:05,349
I can release you
from your pain.

541
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:09,550
Would you like to
be free from pain?

542
01:25:12,549 --> 01:25:14,440
Yes.

543
01:25:30,442 --> 01:25:33,542
The one before you was
gonna bring the container.

544
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:37,683
The container holds the
missing pieces, John.

545
01:25:40,683 --> 01:25:43,694
So we can finish this lab.

546
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:49,663
So we can replicate

547
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:52,385
just like everyone else.

548
01:27:11,824 --> 01:27:14,623
You're doing great, John.

549
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:20,304
Daddy, it's raining.

550
01:27:20,305 --> 01:27:21,644
I got it.

551
01:27:22,665 --> 01:27:23,994
Come on.

552
01:27:33,201 --> 01:27:35,693
I want a story.

553
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,424
Right here.

554
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:43,491
How'd it get so deep?

555
01:32:27,478 --> 01:32:29,758
Hello, soldier.

556
01:34:28,986 --> 01:34:30,691
That's the spirit soldier.

557
01:34:30,692 --> 01:34:33,082
Ahhhh!

558
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:44,202
You still believe the lies?

559
01:35:45,224 --> 01:35:49,077
You don't realize
this is your home?

560
01:35:52,143 --> 01:35:54,820
You killed them.

561
01:36:02,994 --> 01:36:06,744
If you believe I did...

562
01:36:08,788 --> 01:36:11,976
Then I did.

563
01:36:26,282 --> 01:36:28,969
You're only killing
your own father.

564
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:15,953
There is no end.

565
01:40:17,955 --> 01:40:21,816
Always another John.

566
01:42:54,064 --> 01:42:56,165
How did you know I'd find him?

567
01:42:58,164 --> 01:43:00,434
You always find each other.

568
01:43:00,435 --> 01:43:01,804
You're like dogs that way.

569
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:05,985
You know, I suppose I
should be grateful, but...

570
01:43:07,985 --> 01:43:10,015
I can't help but feel proud.

571
01:43:11,016 --> 01:43:13,015
How's that?

572
01:43:13,016 --> 01:43:15,954
Because we were right this time.

573
01:43:17,955 --> 01:43:20,354
Your memories triggered
emotional responses

574
01:43:20,355 --> 01:43:22,425
that made you resistant.

575
01:43:22,426 --> 01:43:25,466
You acted on your own
behest, not ours.

576
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:29,496
You were designed with
selfish motivations...

577
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:32,206
Loyalty to family, not country.

578
01:43:34,206 --> 01:43:36,275
The John that came before you?

579
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:38,816
Sent on the same exact mission.

580
01:43:38,817 --> 01:43:42,485
And he came the closest,
but he disappeared.

581
01:43:42,486 --> 01:43:45,046
We made the necessary
adjustments,

582
01:43:45,047 --> 01:43:48,427
knowing that you'd pick
upright where he left off.

583
01:43:50,428 --> 01:43:52,426
You know where he is?

584
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:54,926
Mm mm. We'll find him though.

585
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:57,337
We always do.

586
01:43:59,337 --> 01:44:02,097
What about me?

587
01:44:02,098 --> 01:44:05,307
We'll take you in,
erase some memories

588
01:44:05,308 --> 01:44:10,306
and then you'll be...
Then you'll be free.

589
01:44:10,307 --> 01:44:12,408
Truly free.

590
01:44:12,418 --> 01:44:15,118
You seem disappointed.

591
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:21,189
Come on, I know you, John,
like a father knows his child.

592
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,530
You might not know meas
well as you think.

593
01:44:23,531 --> 01:44:25,431
I know that if you
didn't stop them,

594
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:27,630
they would've reproduced by now.

595
01:44:27,631 --> 01:44:30,141
Once that door is open...

596
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:40,354
That's how much you mean to me...
Everybody.

597
01:44:44,355 --> 01:44:46,653
So you created me

598
01:44:46,654 --> 01:44:49,493
to find the one who
killed my family

599
01:44:49,494 --> 01:44:52,125
and put them to death.

600
01:44:52,126 --> 01:44:55,497
That is correct.

601
01:44:57,497 --> 01:44:58,937
You killed my family.

602
01:45:00,938 --> 01:45:02,578
See? That's what makes
you so special.

603
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:05,977
You feel so intensely.

604
01:45:05,978 --> 01:45:07,948
You killed my family.

605
01:45:07,949 --> 01:45:10,589
No no, quite the contrary.
I created them...

606
01:45:11,589 --> 01:45:15,260
For you. I created them
to fill your void.

607
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:20,331
And then you killed them.

608
01:45:20,332 --> 01:45:22,131
I didn't kill them, John.

609
01:45:24,132 --> 01:45:25,602
Luc Deveraux did.

610
01:45:27,602 --> 01:45:29,042
Maybe.

611
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,609
But you put him up to it.

612
01:46:50,578 --> 01:47:00,843
THE END
