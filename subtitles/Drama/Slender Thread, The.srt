1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,271
Reynolds has made
my dreams come true.

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,674
And I have given him what
he desires most in return.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,876
And what's that?

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,634
Every piece of me.

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,437
He's a very
demanding man, isn't he?

6
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,037
Must be quite a challenge
to be with him.

7
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,870
Yes.

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,398
Maybe he's the most
demanding man.

9
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,476
Morning, ladies.

10
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,554
Morning.
Morning, madam.

11
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,556
Good morning, ladies.

12
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,552
Morning, Biddy.
Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

13
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,232
Morning, Nana.
Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

14
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,436
Pippa.
Morning, sir.

15
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,790
Try these.

16
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,634
Reynolds. They're delicious.

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,314
Remember I told you,
Johanna...

18
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,754
No more stodgy things?

19
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,590
I didn't know that.

20
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,958
You may have told it
to someone else.

21
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,360
Morning. Morning,
my old so-and-so.

22
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Where have you gone, Reynolds?

23
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,438
There's nothing I can say to get
your attention aimed back at me.

24
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,710
Is there?

25
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,396
I cannot begin my day
with a confrontation, please.

26
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,673
I'm delivering
the dress today.

27
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,679
And I can't take up space
with a confrontation.

28
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,156
I simply don't have
time for confrontations.

29
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,114
Good morning, Countess.
Good morning, Cyril.

30
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,270
Good morning, Peter.

31
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,672
Who is
this beautiful stranger?

32
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,030
I need to see you
far more often, Henrietta.

33
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,749
I am very excited.
I am, too. Come in.

34
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,390
Exquisite.

35
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,036
Yes?

36
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,635
Let's take it
for a walk.

37
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,116
Beautiful work, ladies.

38
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,799
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

39
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,914
It's beautiful, Reynolds.

40
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,753
Worth everything
we've been through.

41
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,031
I feel like it will
give me courage.

42
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,111
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats, please.</i>

43
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,391
Evening, Stephen. Is she here? Yes, sir.

44
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,558
What do you want
to do about Johanna?

45
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,875
I mean, she's lovely,
but the time has come.

46
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,755
And she's getting fat,

47
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,799
sitting around waiting for you
to fall in love with her again.

48
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,879
I'll give her
the October dress.

49
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,236
If that's all right.

50
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,758
I have an unsettled feeling,

51
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,996
based on

52
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,912
nothing I can put
my finger on.

53
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
Just butterflies.

54
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,432
Been having the strongest
memories of Mama lately,

55
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,273
coming to me in my dreams,

56
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,480
smelling her scent.

57
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,959
The strongest sense that

58
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,190
she's near us.

59
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Reaching out towards us.

60
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,032
I very much hope that she saw
the dress tonight. Don't you?

61
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,430
Yes.

62
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,996
It's comforting to think the
dead are watching over the living.

63
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,438
I don't find that
spooky at all.

64
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,152
Why don't you go
to the country tonight?

65
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,395
I'll follow tomorrow.

66
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,836
Good idea.

67
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,993
I like that idea very much.

68
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
My old so-and-so.

69
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,076
Mr. Hansford?

70
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,955
- Mr. Hansford?
- Hello?

71
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,554
- Good morning.
- Morning.

72
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,073
- Fill it up, please.
- I will do.

73
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,431
Check the oil and the tires.
Lovely. Thank you.

74
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,794
It's a hard frost
this morning.

75
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,792
It's cold, isn't it?
It's very bitter.

76
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,630
Ugh.

77
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,552
Excuse me. Could we have
a bit more toast, please?

78
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,630
Yes.

79
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,553
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

80
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,479
Good morning.
Morning.

81
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,394
What would you like
to order?

82
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,195
A Welsh rarebit...

83
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,157
With a poached egg
on top, please.

84
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,956
Not too runny.

85
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,830
And bacon,

86
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,116
scones,

87
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,113
butter, cream,

88
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,990
jam,

89
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,796
not strawberry.

90
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,470
No.

91
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,796
Raspberry?

92
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,470
What else?

93
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,470
Coffee or tea?

94
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,756
Do you have Lapsang?

95
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,953
I'll have a pot
of Lapsang, please.

96
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,309
Good choice.

97
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,710
And some sausages.

98
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
And some sausages.

99
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,155
Show me.

100
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,630
Will you remember?

101
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,750
Yes.

102
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm keeping this.

103
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,430
And now?

104
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,314
Will you have dinner
with me?

105
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,750
Yes.

106
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,074
<i>For the hungry boy,</i>

107
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,789
<i>my name is Alma.</i>

108
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,794
Am I late?
No.

109
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,276
What do you think?

110
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,156
Hmm.

111
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,190
I like the sauce.

112
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,676
Custard.

113
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,190
It's quite good.

114
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,270
Mmm-hmm.

115
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,034
May I, Alma?

116
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,313
I like to see
who I'm talking to.

117
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,834
Here.

118
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,596
Mmm.

119
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,918
There you are. That's better.

120
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,039
Does your mother
have brown eyes?

121
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,950
Green.

122
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,960
Do you look
very much like her?

123
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,915
I don't know, I think so.

124
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,635
Do you have a photograph?

125
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,910
Yes.

126
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,432
Would you let me see it?
Not here, at home.

127
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,789
Carry it with you.

128
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,594
Always carry her with you.

129
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,630
Where's yours?

130
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,596
Your mother.

131
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,594
She's here in the canvas.

132
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,472
What do you mean?
Hmm.

133
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,834
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

134
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,350
Secrets,

135
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,956
coins,

136
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,994
words, little messages.

137
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,079
When I was a boy,
I started to hide things

138
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,753
in the linings
of the garments,

139
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,639
things that only I knew
were there.

140
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,514
And over my breast, I have
a lock of my mother's hair,

141
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,513
to keep her
close to me always.

142
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,833
She was quite
a remarkable woman.

143
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,149
She taught me my trade.

144
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,560
So I try to never be
without her.

145
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,439
You must love her
very much.

146
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,950
Hello.

147
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,958
- This is Alma.
- Say hello to Alma.

148
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,470
Hello.

149
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,994
This is Alma.
Come say hello to Alma.

150
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,673
Come on, come on.
Hello.

151
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,553
Shall we show her
the house, lads?

152
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,639
I made this dress for her
when I was 16 years old.

153
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,710
It's beautiful.

154
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,669
'Twas for her second
husband, for the wedding.

155
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,596
My father had died
many years before.

156
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,314
Our nanny,
the evil Miss Blackwood...

157
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,238
Black Death,
we used to call her.

158
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,832
Because of superstition, she
refused to help me sew the dress,

159
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,955
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune,

160
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
to never be a bride.

161
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,033
Not that anyone
would have had her.

162
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,792
And she seemed ancient to us, I have
no idea how old she actually was,

163
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,837
and monstrously ugly.

164
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,396
So...

165
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,317
I worked alone
for months and months,

166
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,390
hunched over,

167
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,310
sewing and sweating
and sewing.

168
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,197
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

169
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,158
All the help I could have had from her.

170
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,197
'Twas my sister, Cyril,
came to my rescue in the end.

171
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,073
There are endless superstitions
when making a wedding dress.

172
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,559
Young girls afraid they'll
never marry if they touch one.

173
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,596
Or models afraid
they'll marry only bald men

174
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,160
if they put one on.

175
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,118
And where's the dress now?

176
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,237
I have no idea
what happened to it.

177
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,836
No idea.

178
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,237
Most probably
turned to ashes by now.

179
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,196
Fallen to pieces.

180
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,191
And your sister?

181
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,870
What?

182
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,834
Did she ever marry?

183
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,516
No.

184
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,474
C'mon, boys,
let's have a fire.

185
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,273
If you want to have a staring
contest with me, you will lose.

186
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,196
Hmm.

187
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,756
Hmm.

188
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
You're a very handsome man.

189
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,916
You must be around
many beautiful women.

190
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,550
Yes.

191
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,160
So, why are you not married?

192
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,156
I make dresses.

193
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

194
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,471
I'm certain I was never meant to marry.

195
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,792
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

196
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,275
I'm incurable.

197
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,989
Hmm.

198
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,919
Marriage would make me deceitful
and I don't ever want that.

199
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,999
You sound so sure
about things.

200
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm sure about that.

201
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,631
I think you're
only acting strong.

202
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,469
No, I am strong.

203
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,709
For who? Not for me, I hope.

204
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,597
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others

205
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,114
that cause heartache.

206
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,959
Would you help me
with something?

207
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,430
Yes.
Come on.

208
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,556
Good. Just jump up
on the box for me.

209
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,073
I think we're going to try and

210
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
pull this back for you.

211
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,990
Pretty good.

212
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,956
One moment.

213
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,034
We'll save that one
for another time.

214
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,796
Quite nice.

215
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,230
But, um...

216
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,836
Mmm.

217
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,550
Bit serious.

218
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,070
This one.

219
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,590
Do you like it?

220
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,513
Yes.
It's very good.

221
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,630
That's it.

222
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,079
Let's get that off you,
and then

223
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,915
I'd like to take your
measurements. Is that all right?

224
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,352
And who's this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

225
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,035
Hello, I'm Alma.

226
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,270
I'm Cyril.

227
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,760
Sandalwood and rose water.

228
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,713
Mmm. Sherry,

229
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,350
and...

230
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,433
Lemon juice?

231
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,235
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
We had fish for dinner.

232
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,430
- My old so-and-so.
- Would you mind?

233
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,233
Can you step
towards me? Ready?

234
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,790
Thirty-two.

235
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,750
Thirty.

236
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,830
Thirty-one.

237
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,953
Thirty-five and a half.

238
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,035
Fourteen and a half...

239
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,030
Seventeen...

240
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,430
Twenty.

241
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,710
Can you just stand normally? Yes.

242
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,592
I stand normally.
Like before.

243
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,549
What do you mean?
Straight.

244
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,670
Straight.
Like that.

245
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,989
Yeah, you didn't
say that.

246
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
Sixteen and a half.

247
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,270
Eight and a half.

248
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,110
You have no breasts.

249
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,556
Twenty-two.

250
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,999
Yes, I know.
Thirty-two and a half.

251
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,309
You can drop
your arm now.

252
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,639
I'm sorry.
No, no, you're perfect.

253
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,274
My job to give you some,

254
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,475
if I choose to.

255
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,596
Ten.

256
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,230
Nine.

257
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,676
Six and a half.

258
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,236
Twenty-five.

259
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,920
And 45. That's it.

260
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,200
- Would you try something else for me?
- Yes.

261
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,159
You have
the ideal shape.

262
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,759
- I do?
- Mmm-hmm.

263
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,590
He likes a little belly.

264
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,998
<i>I never
really liked myself.</i>

265
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,750
<i>I thought my</i>

266
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,113
<i>shoulders were too wide,</i>

267
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,953
<i>my neck was skinny
like a bird,</i>

268
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,240
<i>that I had no breasts.</i>

269
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,513
<i>I felt my hips were larger
than needed,</i>

270
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,474
<i>and my arms too strong.</i>

271
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,679
I feel as if I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

272
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,070
You found me.

273
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,235
Whatever you do,

274
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,750
do it carefully.

275
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,392
<i>But in his work,
I become perfect.</i>

276
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,716
<i>And I feeljust right.</i>

277
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,394
Good evening,
Mr. Woodcock, sir.

278
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,154
<i>Maybe that's how
all women feel in his clothes.</i>

279
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,314
You look beautiful, really.

280
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,710
Very beautiful.

281
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,274
You're making me
extremely hungry.

282
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,557
Thank you. I ordered
you a steak tartare.

283
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,996
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

284
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,196
My little carnivore.

285
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,150
I've just been on the telephone
to your favorite client.

286
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,950
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,592
Barbara Rose
is getting married again.

288
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,949
Oh, goody.

289
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,996
All right. Well...

290
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,230
Think I'd better have
another one of these.

291
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,756
That's your room.

292
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,069
I'm right next door.

293
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,310
Get your rest.

294
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,272
We'll start early
in the morning.

295
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,036
How early?

296
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,876
I'll wake you.

297
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,916
Good night.

298
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,076
Good night.

299
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,756
<i>Sometimes</i>

300
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,398
<i>we wake up
at 4:00 in the morning,</i>

301
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,112
<i>after we've gone
to bed at midnight.</i>

302
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,439
<i>And then he's ready
to start again.</i>

303
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,879
And I can stand endlessly.

304
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,038
No one can stand
as long as I can.

305
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,030
What is it, Alma?

306
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,910
What are you looking
so forlorn about, hmm?

307
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,030
I don't know, I...

308
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,956
I think I don't like
the fabric so much.

309
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,430
Well, Alma,
this fabric is adored

310
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,592
by the women
who wear our design.

311
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,920
It's perfect for this dress.

312
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,150
Cyril is right.

313
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,639
Cyril is always right.

314
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,194
It's not because the fabric is adored
by the clients that Cyril is right.

315
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,193
It's right
because it's right.

316
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,076
Because it's beautiful.

317
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,951
Maybe one day you'll
change your taste, Alma.

318
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,750
Maybe not.

319
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,313
Maybe you have
no taste.

320
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,393
Maybe I like my own taste.

321
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,877
Yes, just enough
to get you into trouble.

322
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,357
Perhaps I'm looking for trouble. Stop!

323
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,276
You know, at the big races
and the Derby and, uh, those...

324
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,676
Excuse me, Mr. Woodcock. Yes?

325
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,319
I would like to say that I hope one
day I could wear one of your dresses.

326
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,636
Oh, thank you.

327
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,677
If that's your wish, I
hope it comes true for you.

328
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,390
She really means it.

329
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,359
She told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you make.

330
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,070
Hmm.

331
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,351
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies, for your kind words.

332
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,476
Good night.

333
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

334
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,956
Good night. Thank you
very much. Good night.

335
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,040
You'd dig her up and sell the
dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

336
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,589
Well, otherwise it would
seem to be going to a waste,

337
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,512
but, yeah, I mean,
one but can try.

338
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,876
Nigel, why aren't
you eating your profiteroles?

339
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,950
What?

340
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,960
Have you had enough to eat?

341
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,230
You seem thirsty.

342
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,356
Morning, Reynolds.

343
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,713
Mmm-hmm.
Morning, Cyril.

344
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,355
Please, don't move
so much, Alma.

345
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,877
I'm buttering my toast,
I'm not moving too much.

346
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,950
Well, it's too much.

347
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,429
It's a distraction,
it's very distracting.

348
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,474
Maybe you pay
too much attention to it.

349
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,320
It's hard to ignore.

350
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,596
It's as if you just rode
a horse across the room.

351
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,914
This is too much movement.

352
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,238
It is entirely too much
movement at breakfast.

353
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,270
Perhaps you should
take your breakfast after him.

354
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,474
Or in your room.

355
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,559
I think he's being too fussy.

356
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,830
His routine, when he's
in it, is best not shaken.

357
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,752
Well...
This is a quiet time,

358
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,794
not to be misused.

359
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,275
If breakfast isn't right,

360
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,273
it's very hard for him to
recover for the rest of the day.

361
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,909
I didn't know that.

362
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,635
No, of course you didn't.

363
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,956
But you do now.

364
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,393
Still I think he's too fussy.

365
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,709
Well, that's as may be.

366
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,750
This is Flemish bobbin lace
from the late 1600s.

367
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,071
It's very rare,
very precious.

368
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,879
<i>I rescued it from Antwerp
during the war.</i>

369
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,311
<i>I've been waiting
for the right moment to...</i>

370
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,794
<i>To make something with it.</i>

371
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,156
Hold it.

372
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,550
That's very nice. That's
beautiful. That's good.

373
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,639
Best yet. Beautiful. Very
nice. Turn towards the light.

374
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,871
Um, just look towards
the window, please, Alma.

375
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,755
Amber, could you just
lift the bodice,

376
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,870
a little bit?

377
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,280
It keeps dropping down.

378
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,633
We need to get that adjusted
properly. It's ridiculous.

379
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,156
Just get it fixed.
Yes, sir.

380
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,072
Should've been ready today,
quite honestly.

381
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,389
Keep your eye on that.

382
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,199
Together. I'm not sitting on the floor.

383
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,430
Sit on the floor.

384
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,036
You're lovely.

385
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,800
Ah, it's great.
That's great.

386
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,031
Okay, hold that
while I change the film.

387
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,510
Have I finished yet?

388
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,750
All right, that's it.

389
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,633
I need to do some work.

390
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,240
Hell.

391
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,036
Yes?

392
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,030
May I come in?

393
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,550
I'm working.

394
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,480
Do you need anything?

395
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,760
It's fabulous
on the shoulders.

396
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,956
Shoulder drapes, and then
you can put it on completely.

397
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,555
Okay?

398
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,230
Good, good, good.

399
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,239
Alma? Is she ready?

400
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,710
Nearly.

401
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,273
Come on, please.

402
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Mmm-hmm.

403
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,955
Ingrid.

404
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,800
Uh, cape's wrong.
Let me do it.

405
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,390
Let me do it.

406
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,709
Ellie, you ready?
Let's have a look at you.

407
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,234
Stand here, please.

408
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,436
Mmm.

409
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,035
All right.

410
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,191
Off you go. Thank you, Pippa.
Ingrid, you ready?

411
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,960
Let me do it, let me do it.
Damn it.

412
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,871
You're no good to me
just standing there, Pippa!

413
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,435
- I need your hands on this.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry. Yes.

414
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,638
Just go. Go, go!

415
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,834
I'm sorry.

416
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,280
Let me drive for you.

417
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,634
<i>You see, when you...</i>

418
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,474
<i>When you love your work</i>

419
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,074
<i>and you can give
like he does...</i>

420
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,200
<i>You need to come down</i>

421
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,436
<i>again.</i>

422
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,115
<i>And then he's...</i>

423
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,309
<i>He's a baby.</i>

424
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,712
Like a spoiled little baby.

425
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,710
When he's like this,
he's very tender.

426
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,749
<i>Open.</i>

427
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,313
How long will these
episodes last?

428
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,438
Only a few days,
and then he's well again.

429
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,119
No. Alma, what are you
doing? There's tea for you.

430
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,074
Don't put the tray on the
table, please. Just take it off.

431
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,039
I didn't ask for tea.

432
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,875
No, but...

433
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,920
Can you take it out,
please?

434
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,474
Yes, I can take it out.

435
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,319
It's a bit late now, isn't
it? I'm taking it out.

436
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,357
Yeah, but it's a bit
late now, isn't it?

437
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,194
But I'm taking it out.

438
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,194
The tea is going out, the interruption
is staying right here with me.

439
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,713
What if they are yellow
underneath and white on top?

440
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,952
The poison ones
have gills.

441
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,959
Look at the book
in the kitchen.

442
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,320
We cook them in fat?

443
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,873
No, we'll cook them
in butter.

444
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,120
But not too much.

445
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,680
Mr. Woodcock detests
too much butter.

446
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,030
There's a very good chance Barbara
Rose will ask you to attend her wedding.

447
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,713
What do you want me
to do with that?

448
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,394
Accept her invitation.

449
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,440
If you can stomach it.

450
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,992
I really wish I hadn't heard
this till later on, Cyril.

451
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,914
It's very unsettling.

452
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,436
Well,

453
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,590
chin up.

454
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,958
Barbara Rose pays
for this house.

455
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,836
All right?

456
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,272
Morning, Barbara.

457
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,076
Morning, Cal.
Morning, Tippy.

458
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,351
Good morning,
Mr. Woodcock.

459
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,474
Reynolds.

460
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,674
Let's get started.

461
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,120
Put it in there.

462
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,674
Thank you.

463
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,512
I'm just going
to lift this up, Barbara.

464
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,636
Oh.

465
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,877
I know you're doing
the best you can.

466
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,915
Don't do that.

467
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,356
Take your hand away,
please. I'm still so ugly.

468
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,870
Barbara, I'm trying to
make you a beautiful dress.

469
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,400
I need your help.

470
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,915
Uh, please.

471
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,599
Reynolds, will you come?

472
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,519
Just stand still, please.

473
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,277
It's really not my place,
Barbara.

474
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,554
This is what I do.

475
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,519
This is my place, here.

476
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,117
I'm afraid I must insist
that you come.

477
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,872
<i>George Riley,
News of the World.</i>

478
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,755
Who'll be the attendant at
the wedding? My son, Cal.

479
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,437
My Cal, my son.

480
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,919
He's so wonderful, he's so
in favor of this marriage.

481
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,400
<i>John Evans,
Daily Mail.</i>

482
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,278
And what of your holdings,
Miss Rose?

483
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,109
Do they become
Dominican property?

484
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,471
I don't know, I don't
think so. If I may say,

485
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,796
we are being married
under Dominican law,

486
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,839
but in my country,
her money belongs to her

487
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,679
and my money belongs to me.

488
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,594
Anyway, why would I need her
money? I have enough of my own.

489
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,037
What's Barbara brought
into your life?

490
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,080
I brought sincerity
into his life.

491
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,912
Sincerity? Then one
kiss for the cameras.

492
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,719
Go on, give us a kiss
for the cameras, Miss Rose.

493
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,393
The answer
to the question

494
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,319
is sincerity. Let's give them a kiss...

495
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,154
Rubio, tell us about selling
visas to the Jews during the war.

496
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,640
Thank you.

497
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,074
Visas? Jews?

498
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,669
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you for that.

499
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,554
Jews, visas?

500
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,112
That dress
doesn't belong here.

501
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,473
- Don't start crying.
- I'm not crying.

502
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,476
I'm angry.

503
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,320
Well, don't start blubbering,
Alma. I'm not blubbering.

504
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,552
She doesn't deserve it.

505
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,558
It's your work.

506
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,790
Come on.

507
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,200
Tippy?

508
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,269
Mr. Woodcock.

509
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,397
What is it?
I would like the dress back.

510
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,960
Miss Rose is sleeping.

511
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,600
Well, that's got nothing
to do with the dress.

512
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,000
Can you go and get it
for me, please?

513
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,958
She's sleeping.

514
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,315
In the dress?

515
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,754
Well, yes.

516
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,194
Go and take the dress off her
and bring it to me right away.

517
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,954
I don't think so. Take the
fucking dress off Barbara

518
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,793
and bring it to me
or I'll do it myself!

519
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,320
I beg your pardon?

520
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,914
Alma.

521
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,115
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.
Cal.

522
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,680
I...

523
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,513
It's no business of ours

524
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,309
what Mrs. Rose decides
to do with her life.

525
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,791
But she can no longer
behave like this

526
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,390
and be dressed
by the House of Woodcock.

527
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,320
Thank you.

528
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,149
I love you.

529
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,559
Pedigree. That's for mother. Racy.

530
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,238
Uh, she'd like
something like that, but...

531
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,039
- Thank you, dear.
- It's Mona's day.

532
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,197
Yes, it is. So I'd like
to wear something for her.

533
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,351
Yes, of course. She
mentioned that last time.

534
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,669
Did she?
Yeah.

535
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,194
Did she really?
Yeah.

536
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,475
All right.

537
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,434
- Julie.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,159
- Do we have porridge?
- Yes, we do.

539
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,473
- Um, do we have cream?
- We do, yes.

540
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,040
- Thick cream?
- Oh, yes.

541
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,032
That's what I'd like
for breakfast, please.

542
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,191
All right, sir. Don't
forget the salt this time.

543
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,710
I shan't, I shan't. Oh, Alma,
would you like some porridge...

544
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,480
Yes.
This morning?

545
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,751
Some for Alma as well,
please. Right away.

546
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,192
And, um, bacon and eggs
with that. All right, sir.

547
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,675
Morning.

548
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,309
I'm so hungry.

549
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,517
Delighted that we have
cream in the house.

550
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,836
Yes.
Makes all the difference.

551
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,752
It's essential
with porridge.

552
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,912
A little bit
naughty though.

553
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,550
Dear Reynolds.
Your Royal Highness.

554
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,399
Hello.
How beautiful you are.

555
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,270
- How nice to see you again.
- Your Royal Highness.

556
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,317
Cyril!
Your Highness.

557
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,477
Hello. How lovely to see you.

558
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,040
Good morning.

559
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,315
<i>When you dream about your wedding
dress, what is it that you dream?</i>

560
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,234
<i>I dream that it's the most
beautiful wedding dress</i>

561
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,834
in the world.

562
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,195
Naturally.

563
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,671
Perhaps the only wedding dress
in the world.

564
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,115
Yes.

565
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,160
Or to take it just
a little step further,

566
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,076
perhaps the only wedding dress
that was ever made.

567
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,316
<i>Oui.</i>

568
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,592
Is Your Royal Highness a gold
person or a silver person?

569
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,558
Silver.
Good.

570
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,314
Lace or pearl?

571
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,710
Lace.

572
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,634
Very good.

573
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,790
<i>Merci.</i>

574
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,117
I want to wish you

575
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,432
good fortune
for your wedding.

576
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,355
Thank you.

577
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,993
<i>Je m'appelle Alma.</i>

578
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,271
Lovely to meet you,
Alma.

579
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,995
I live here.

580
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,474
Come in.

581
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,229
Alma.

582
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,319
Good morning, Cyril.

583
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:12,475
I wanted to ask your help in a
gift I wanted to make for Reynolds.

584
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,671
I want to make him
a surprise.

585
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,518
If everyone left the house

586
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,840
when he takes his walk
on Thursday,

587
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,151
I will cook for him, dinner.

588
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,760
And when he comes back,
no one will be there but me.

589
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,838
I'll be waiting for him,

590
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,432
I will surprise him and we
can have dinner together,

591
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,920
just the two of us.

592
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,834
Do you like this idea?

593
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,510
Would you help me?

594
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,473
It isn't his birthday.

595
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,676
I know.

596
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,032
I would advise
against this, Alma.

597
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,035
Why? Because he doesn't like surprises.

598
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,072
He does. Well, he won't like this one.

599
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,158
I'm trying to surprise him

600
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,792
and love him the way
that I want to.

601
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,518
Well, if you're looking
for something kind to do,

602
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,396
perhaps you could think of
something else.

603
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,191
No, I really must advise
against this, Alma.

604
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,360
I don't think there could be a more
inappropriate time to try something new.

605
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,999
This is what I want to do,

606
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,152
and I think
it will be very nice.

607
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,713
I respect your advice, Cyril.

608
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,591
But I have to know him
in my own way,

609
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,512
and this is what
I want to do for him.

610
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,350
Good night.

611
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,791
<i>Good night.
Good night, madame.</i>

612
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,669
<i>Good night, madame.</i>

613
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,755
Good luck.

614
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,675
Oh, Alma. What is this?

615
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,039
I love you, Reynolds.

616
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,958
Yes, but what is this?

617
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,760
It's a surprise.

618
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,435
Are you hungry?

619
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,475
Where is Cyril?

620
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,674
I've sent everyone home.

621
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,080
Where is Cyril?

622
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,155
She's left.

623
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,714
What time did she leave?

624
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,149
This afternoon.

625
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,480
I've made us dinner.

626
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,599
Let me collect myself
for a moment.

627
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,719
I'll just have
a bath, I think.

628
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,672
This is very kind
of you, Alma.

629
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,312
Would you like a champagne
or a martini? No, thank you.

630
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,193
Oh, is that your dress?
It's finished.

631
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,030
Let's have
a look at it.

632
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,030
Hmm.

633
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,839
It's rather interesting.

634
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,560
Very good work.

635
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,833
I'll just have
my bath now.

636
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,713
When will Cyril get back?

637
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,151
Mmm, tonight?

638
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,716
How was your appointment
with the princess?

639
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,793
She's very beautiful, like
a sculpture of some kind.

640
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,150
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,356
So will you make her
a wedding gown?

642
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,476
I have made her baptism,

643
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,277
her First Communion
and confirmation dresses.

644
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,395
I made the dress
for her presentation at court,

645
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,632
indeed the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

646
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,795
It's only right that I should make
her wedding dress, wouldn't you think?

647
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,432
Christ.
No.

648
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,594
But this is not
what I wanted to say.

649
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,637
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I said, I...

650
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,910
This is meant
to be a nice evening.

651
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,000
Let me serve you.

652
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,400
Do you like it?

653
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,390
I do.

654
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,075
No, you don't.

655
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,079
You don't like it at all.

656
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,996
Usually, you always
tell me what you think.

657
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,395
What is this?

658
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,070
You're lying.

659
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,596
As I think
you know, Alma,

660
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,991
I prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt.

661
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,715
And knowing this, you've prepared
the asparagus with butter.

662
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,594
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

663
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,754
being able to pretend
that I like it made this way.

664
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,919
Right now, I'm just admiring
my own gallantry

665
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,152
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

666
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,993
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

667
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,871
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

668
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,918
I'm just waiting around
like an idiot for you.

669
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,714
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

670
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,909
This is not...

671
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,472
I know it's not going
as I expected.

672
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,478
I didn't mean
these things to come out.

673
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,279
I'm sorry, but it was
meant to be nice.

674
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,635
Well, what did you expect?

675
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,958
I wanted time with you. I
wanted to have you to myself.

676
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,431
You have me all the time.
No.

677
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,830
What on earth are you
talking about? I don't!

678
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,793
There are always
people around.

679
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,560
And if not, then there's
something between us.

680
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,040
Something between us?
Yes.

681
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,589
What?
Some...

682
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,433
What?
Distance!

683
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,194
When did this happen?

684
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,755
What happened to make you
behave like this?

685
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,070
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

686
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,114
Yes.
I don't.

687
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,197
Well, that's
very predictable of you.

688
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,240
Don't act so tough.
I know you are not.

689
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,598
Yeah, that's right. That's
right. If I don't protect myself

690
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,479
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

691
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,279
and take over
my corner of the room

692
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,317
and ask me about
their fucking asparagus!

693
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,511
Don't be a bully. You're being
a bully. There are other things

694
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,871
I'd like to do with my time.
It's my time! I have no idea

695
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,912
what I'm doing here
in your time! My time!

696
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,229
What am I doing here?

697
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,312
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you!

698
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,959
Waiting for what?
Waiting for you.

699
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,394
Waiting for what?

700
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,836
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

701
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,994
To tell me to leave.

702
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,873
So tell me.

703
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,357
So I don't stand around
like a fucking fool.

704
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,238
Asparagus, is this all about
your asparagus?

705
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,994
No, it's not about asparagus.
Then what the hell is it about?

706
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,440
Are you a special agent

707
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,240
sent here to ruin my evening
and possibly my entire life?

708
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,436
Why are you so rude to me?

709
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,517
Why are you talking to me
like this? Is this my house?

710
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,671
This is my house, isn't it?
Yes, this is your house.

711
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,274
Is this my house?
Of course it's your house.

712
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,551
Or did somebody drop me on
foreign soil. What a question!

713
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,835
Behind enemy lines?

714
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,593
It's you who brought me here.
I'm surrounded on all sides.

715
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,359
It's you who brought me here.

716
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,920
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

717
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,315
Do you have a gun?

718
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,954
You here to kill me?

719
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,595
Why are you...
Do you have a gun?

720
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,160
Stop it!
Where's your gun?

721
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,594
Stop being a child.
Where's your gun?

722
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,717
Stop playing.
Show me your gun.

723
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,513
Stop playing this game!

724
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,035
I am not.
I'm not playing a game.

725
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,038
Yes. Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.
What game am I playing?

726
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,791
What game? What precisely
is the nature of my game?

727
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,156
You tell me.
Oh, this whole...

728
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,679
What? All your rules and your walls

729
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,558
and your doors
and your people

730
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,032
and your money and all
these clothes and everything!

731
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,554
This, this, this game!

732
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,269
Everything here!
The whole... Pfft!

733
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,833
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

734
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,877
Everything is a game!

735
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,550
"Yes, mister!
No, madam! Yes."

736
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,715
Well...

737
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,197
If it's my... "I don't eat
this. I don't drink that.

738
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,829
"I don't..." If it's my
life that you're describing,

739
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,873
it's entirely up to you whether
you choose to share it or not.

740
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,474
If you don't wish
to share that life,

741
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,394
as apparently it's so disagreeable
to you in every respect,

742
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,200
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

743
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,710
Yeah.

744
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,638
Sometimes it's good for him to
slow down his steps a little.

745
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,231
Would you like me
to ask Alma to leave?

746
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,959
No. Why?

747
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,157
Well, if you're going
to make her a ghost,

748
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,040
go ahead and do it.

749
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,715
But, please, don't let her
sit around waiting for you.

750
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,199
I'm very fond of her.

751
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,791
Oh, you're very fond of her,
are you? In that case...

752
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,995
No, don't turn it on me. I
don't want your cloud on my head.

753
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,833
Oh, shut up, Cyril.
No, you can shut right up.

754
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,391
Don't pick a fight with me, you
certainly won't come out alive.

755
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,439
I'll go right through you and it'll
be you who ends up on the floor.

756
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,874
Understood?

757
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,920
Morning, Pippa.
Morning, sir.

758
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,878
Pen, book and glasses? Yes,
they're all there for you, sir.

759
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,075
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning, sir.

760
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,713
Excellent work, ladies. Um...

761
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,757
It's just not
very good, is it?

762
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,790
It's ugly.

763
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,273
You all right, sir?

764
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,154
Reynolds?

765
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,558
Reynolds,
are you all right?

766
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,875
Mr. Woodcock,
he seems to be ill.

767
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,915
Who seems to be ill?

768
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,999
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

769
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,830
I'm sorry, Biddy.
Who's fallen over?

770
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,594
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

771
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,637
There's stains
on the front of the skirt

772
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,599
and there's a hole
in the lace on the bodice

773
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,360
and there's shoe polish
on the front of the dress.

774
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,799
Shoe polish from what?

775
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,875
From his shoe.

776
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,316
I'm fine.

777
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,597
Oh, I don't know what
the hell came over me.

778
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,874
Must be something
I've eaten.

779
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,434
Mmm-hmm.

780
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,195
Oh, God.

781
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,880
You should lie down now.
No, I'll be fine in a minute.

782
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,080
Please lie down. No, really,
don't fuss, Alma, please.

783
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,435
Just don't fuss.

784
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,632
Whatever it is, if you fuss,
I'll die right here.

785
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,238
I promise I won't fuss.

786
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,559
Let me do that, please.

787
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,714
I have to take these off.
Yes, I'll take them off.

788
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,475
Alma? Alma?

789
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,955
Yes?

790
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,360
Um...

791
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,909
Would you tell them
I'll be down shortly?

792
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,600
Yes, of course.

793
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,599
Hello, Cyril.

794
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,876
Hello.

795
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,315
What is it?

796
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,155
I don't know what the
bloody hell came over me.

797
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,318
I'll be all right
in a moment.

798
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,313
Oh, you don't
look all right.

799
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,315
Where does it hurt?

800
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,874
Hurts all over.

801
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,957
I've never really felt
like this before.

802
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,632
Is it your stomach?
Is it something you've eaten?

803
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,280
No, I don't think so.
Just sore, really.

804
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,555
So please tell them
I'll be with them in a minute.

805
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,553
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're to stay here and rest.

806
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,553
Would you like me
to do anything?

807
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,314
Just give me silence.

808
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:11,717
Shall I call the doctor? No, Cyril,
you certainly will not, please.

809
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,479
- All right.
- Um...

810
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,077
Exhausted yourself.
Just give me silence.

811
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,351
Burning up. You take
care of the dress for me.

812
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,079
Yes, of course I will.
It's all right.

813
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,594
I just...

814
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,151
I just want...

815
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,435
That's it.

816
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,835
Come on, Alma.

817
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,960
I think I may be sick again.

818
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,920
We're gonna have
to do a lot of work

819
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,595
to get this dress ready
for tomorrow, you know.

820
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,714
We're gonna have to undo the front
of the dress and replace the skirt.

821
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,151
We're gonna have to cut
a new panel of the satin

822
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,038
and then there's also the
organza that needs to be...

823
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,840
Yes, I'll deal with that in
a minute, Biddy. Thank you.

824
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,074
You're soaked. We need
to change your pajamas.

825
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,633
I'm scared, Alma.

826
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,399
Yes, of course you are.

827
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,992
Do you think
I'll ever get better?

828
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,680
Of course.

829
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,320
I'll take care of you.

830
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,552
Madam, there's
a telephone call.

831
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,552
He's settled now, sleeping.

832
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,635
The doctor's here.
What doctor?

833
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,279
The doctor I sent for.

834
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,190
Oh, no, but he doesn't...
He needs to be examined.

835
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,320
No.
Yes!

836
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,193
No, he's not dying.

837
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,919
He needs to be examined.

838
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,917
He's sleeping now.
That's what he needs.

839
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,354
Let me be unambiguous.

840
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,909
Come out of the room
and downstairs immediately.

841
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,156
All right.

842
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,753
Alma, this is Dr. Hardy.

843
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,593
How do you do, Mrs. Woodcock?

844
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,353
How do you do?

845
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,109
How's he feeling?

846
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,471
He's better.
He's sleeping.

847
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,678
Is he able to keep
anything down yet?

848
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,599
He hasn't tried yet.

849
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,831
Uh, I was going
to make some soup.

850
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,514
And his fever?

851
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,034
It has gone down.

852
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,350
Uh, would you like me to see him? Yes.

853
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,195
Is that all right, Mrs.
Woodcock? Yes, it is!

854
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,754
Reynolds, Lady Baltimore has
sent her godson to see you.

855
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,360
Dr. Hardy.

856
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,433
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

857
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,520
May I examine you?

858
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,199
Keep your hands off me.

859
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,317
I'd just like to take
your temperature. Alma,

860
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,875
there's a strange boy in the
room. Can you get him out, please?

861
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,795
I admit I do look
young, but I... Fuck off.

862
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,112
Reynolds, please,
just let him examine you.

863
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,839
Yes, fuck off.

864
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,880
- I think this is clear.
- Hmm.

865
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,633
He wants you
to fuck off.

866
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,874
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

867
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,789
- I'm very sorry.
- Not to worry.

868
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,755
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

869
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,638
- 9:00 a. m.?
- Yes.

870
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,110
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

871
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,640
Of course, Doctor.

872
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,554
Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.
Good night, Doctor.

873
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,670
Follow me.

874
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,913
When will it be ready?

875
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,077
I don't know.

876
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,120
Let me put it another way.

877
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,234
This dress will be ready by 9:00 a. m.
because that's when it leaves for Belgium.

878
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,440
Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
you'll have to work late this evening.

879
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,391
The dress needs to be ready by 9:00
a. m. to make its journey to Belgium.

880
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,360
Do expect to be here
for quite some time.

881
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,678
If you need to use the telephone,
please use the one in my office...

882
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,593
Nana and Biddy...
...to alert your families.

883
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,909
What can I do to help?

884
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,118
Could you pin the ribbon on the
hem there, please? Thank you.

885
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,272
Ladies, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
you'll have to work late this evening.

886
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,192
The dress needs
to be ready by 9:00 a. m.

887
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,273
and I know there's rather
a lot to do on it still.

888
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,400
So please do expect to be here
possibly for most of the night.

889
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,231
If you need to make telephone calls,
do so from my office. Thank you.

890
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,112
Are you here?

891
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,872
Are you always here?

892
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,278
I miss you.

893
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,595
I think about you
all the time.

894
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,551
I hear your voice
say my name when I dream.

895
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,080
Then when I wake up, there are
tears streaming down my face.

896
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,272
I just miss you,
it's as simple as that.

897
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,230
I want to tell you everything.

898
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,714
I don't understand
what you're saying.

899
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,792
I can't hear your voice.

900
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,438
Your fever's gone down.

901
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,311
I love you, Alma.

902
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,470
I don't ever want
to be without you.

903
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,679
I love you.

904
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,431
I have things
I want to do.

905
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,200
I had thought my days
were unlimited.

906
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,231
The mistakes I've made
and made again,

907
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,232
they can no longer
be ignored.

908
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:14,156
There are things nagging at me.
Things that now must be done.

909
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,716
Things I simply
cannot do without you.

910
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,159
To keep my

911
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,355
sour heart
from choking.

912
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,197
To break a curse.

913
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,114
A house that doesn't
change is a dead house.

914
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,277
Alma, will you marry me?

915
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,753
Will you marry me?

916
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,069
What the bloody hell
are you thinking about?

917
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,199
Will you marry me?

918
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,835
No?

919
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,434
Yes.

920
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,433
Will you marry me?

921
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,874
Yes, I will.

922
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,709
Reynolds to Alma, when you say
these binding and contracting words,

923
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,439
you'll be looking
at each other.

924
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,592
After all, it is each other
you are marrying and not me.

925
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,356
Reynolds... I call upon
these persons here present...

926
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,919
I call upon these persons
here present...

927
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:26,277
To witness that I,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...

928
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,437
Do take thee,
Alma Elson...

929
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,920
Do take thee,
Alma Elson...

930
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,470
To be my lawful
wedded wife...

931
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,760
To be my lawful
wedded wife.

932
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,953
Alma... I call upon
these persons here present...

933
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,394
I call upon these persons
here present...

934
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,557
<i>To witness that I,
Alma Elson...</i>

935
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,115
<i>To witness that I,
Alma Elson...</i>

936
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,760
<i>Do take thee,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...</i>

937
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,271
<i>Do take thee,
Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock...</i>

938
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,392
<i>To be my lawful
wedded husband.</i>

939
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,836
<i>To be my lawful
wedded husband.</i>

940
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,031
<i>And it now gives me
great pleasure to say...</i>

941
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,870
<i>Congratulations.
You are now husband and wife.</i>

942
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,158
<i>And you may kiss the bride.</i>

943
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,830
An hour? Uh, an hour? That's okay.

944
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,440
Cuckoo.

945
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,279
I'll see you later.
See you later.

946
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,477
- Have a good time.
- You, too.

947
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,277
You, too, have
a good time.

948
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,759
Not for me,
thank you.

949
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,399
Dr. Hardy?

950
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,234
Dr. Hardy? Oh! Hey. Sorry, excuse me.

951
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,676
Reynolds, do you
remember Dr. Hardy?

952
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,912
Good evening, Mr. and
Mrs. Woodcock. Oh, hello.

953
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,798
How do you do, Mr. Woodcock?
How are you feeling?

954
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,754
I think we met in a
puddle of sweat, didn't we?

955
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,194
Yes, that's right.

956
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,033
I probably owe you
an apology of some kind.

957
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,356
I seem to remember barking
at you. There's no need.

958
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,512
I've been laid siege by
much worse. Oh, really?

959
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,434
You look very healthy.
How are you feeling?

960
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,838
Didn't I tell you
to fuck off?

961
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,440
Yes. Yes, you did.

962
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,956
Dinner is served,
everybody!

963
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,634
Come along.

964
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,833
That's your
shifty-eyed godson?

965
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,354
Shifty-eyed?

966
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,669
He's got perfectly
normal eyes.

967
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,560
I'm rather less fat, I think,
than when you last saw me.

968
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,955
Really?
Yes.

969
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,679
Thank you
very much indeed.

970
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,918
It's fallen off me.
Ooh! I'm so sorry.

971
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,072
...there are secrets
nobody tells.

972
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:16,874
Your wife has got that gorgeous
glow you get with a first marriage.

973
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,793
How long
will you be here for?

974
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,673
Seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

975
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,631
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

976
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,710
Oh, um...

977
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,439
We don't have any.

978
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,674
Well, you should come out for
the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

979
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,796
I don't know what that is.
It's not something I'd suggest

980
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,593
if I didn't think you'd have
a wonderful time.

981
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,478
It's really something
to be seen.

982
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,071
I'll pass it on
to my husband.

983
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,914
But I think we'll stay in.

984
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,754
Change your mind.

985
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,435
Or get him to change his
mind, or whatever it takes.

986
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,479
Now, please come. I promise
you the time of your life.

987
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,277
How do you know
how my life has been?

988
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,240
I don't.

989
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,754
You're right.

990
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,472
I think this would be quite a
fine time, if you'd like to come.

991
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,520
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

992
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,880
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

993
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,518
What on earth are you doing?

994
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,553
I rolled a three. Yes,
but that's the four pip.

995
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,957
Go back to the bar where
you belong. Oh, sorry.

996
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,472
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

997
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,791
I'm not cheating.
I don't need to cheat.

998
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,152
Oh, good. You do need to be
able to count, on the other hand.

999
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:07,194
Backgammon, by the way,
I get treble the score

1000
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,596
because you haven't gotten
any checkers off the board.

1001
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,796
Oh.

1002
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,076
Stupid game anyway.

1003
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,874
Well, maybe it seems stupid to
you now as you're currently losing,

1004
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,469
but I dare say
if you were victorious,

1005
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,876
I'm confident you'd see it
in a different light.

1006
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,032
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent. Next.

1007
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,149
Me, please.

1008
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,912
What? What are you
so cranky about?

1009
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,479
Have fun with
your next opponent.

1010
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,916
Why, I think I will, a lot
more than I did with you.

1011
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,756
Gosh. She's really
very rude, isn't she?

1012
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,673
My heart breaks for you.

1013
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,558
Oh, really?

1014
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,479
Being married
to a toddler.

1015
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,432
I don't want
to be racist,

1016
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,440
but, I mean, is there some sort
of custom at this time of the night

1017
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,113
in her country, where...

1018
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,239
I mean, what's she doing? Where what?

1019
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,960
I don't know. I don't know
if she's up stealing things

1020
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,997
or attacking people, I mean...

1021
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,273
I want to go dancing.

1022
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,040
When?

1023
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,520
Right now.

1024
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,833
You're joking.
No, I'm not.

1025
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,473
It's New Year's Eve.

1026
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,231
Well, I'm not going dancing.

1027
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,639
There's a party at the Devonshire
Hall to celebrate the New Year

1028
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,751
and I want to go.

1029
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,432
We need to go dancing.

1030
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,516
So what are you going
to do about it?

1031
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,590
I'm going to stay right here
and I'm going to work.

1032
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,030
<i>On the hour,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1033
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:05,234
<i>Are you ready to welcome in our
lovely, glorious, Happy New Year?</i>

1034
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,353
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1035
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,029
<i>Here we go!</i>

1036
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:15,036
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1037
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:21,316
<i>five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!</i>

1038
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,799
How does it feel?

1039
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,192
Well, I think it feels
a little big.

1040
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,997
Shall we just take it in on the waist?
We can take it in a little on the waist.

1041
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,879
Yes. Yes, okay. Just take it out.

1042
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,232
How's that feeling?
I think that's better.

1043
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,440
Would you excuse me for a
minute, please, Mrs. Vaughan?

1044
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,349
Where has
Henrietta Harding been?

1045
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,595
She's been to another house.
Which one?

1046
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:56,236
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I didn't want to.

1047
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,837
Is there something I'm unaware of?
Because as far as I can remember,

1048
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,037
all I have done is
to dress her beautifully.

1049
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,636
I don't think that matters
to some people.

1050
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:15,352
I think they want what
is fashionable and chic.

1051
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:20,038
Chic? Oh, don't you start using
that filthy little word. "Chic"?

1052
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,511
Whoever invented that ought to
be spanked in public. I don't...

1053
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,549
I don't even know what that word means.
What is that word? Fucking "chic"?

1054
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,795
They should be hung, drawn
and quartered! Fucking "chic"!

1055
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,798
It shouldn't concern you.
It does concern me.

1056
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:35,271
It concerns me very much, Cyril,
because it's hurt my feelings.

1057
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,477
It's hurt my feelings.

1058
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,391
So, what's all
this moaning about?

1059
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,158
I am not moaning.

1060
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,319
I do not like
to be turned away from.

1061
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,439
Nobody does.

1062
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,671
But I don't want to hear it
because it hurts my ears.

1063
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,557
I've made a terrible mistake in
my life, Cyril. I've made a...

1064
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,275
I've made a terrible mistake.
I need you to help me.

1065
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,712
What do you want me to do?

1066
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:48,275
I can't work.
I can't concentrate,

1067
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,192
I have no confidence.

1068
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,393
She does not fit
in this house.

1069
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,558
We built this house,
the two of us.

1070
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,831
Now, she's turning the whole
bloody place upside down.

1071
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,713
She's turning me
inside out.

1072
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,393
She's turning you and me
against each other.

1073
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:11,359
Her arrival has cast
a very long shadow, Cyril.

1074
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,196
Mrs. Vaughan is satisfied
with the dress.

1075
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:23,350
No one gives a tinker's fucking curse
about Mrs. Vaughan's satisfaction!

1076
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,799
Thank you, Alma.

1077
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,240
Not at all.

1078
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,118
What a model of politeness you two are.

1079
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,351
There is an air of
quiet death in this house

1080
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,719
and I do not like
the way it smells.

1081
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,712
Would you like
a glass of wine?

1082
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,678
No, thank you.

1083
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,392
Can I make you a martini?

1084
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,991
Nothing for me,
thanks.

1085
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,914
Water?

1086
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,231
I want you
flat on your back.

1087
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,633
Helpless.

1088
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,235
Tender.

1089
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,350
Open.

1090
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,957
With only me to help.

1091
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,275
And then I want you
strong again.

1092
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,317
You're not
going to die.

1093
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,910
You might wish you were going
to die, but you're not going to.

1094
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,475
You need
to settle down a little.

1095
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:38,758
Kiss me, my girl,
before I'm sick.

1096
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:03,716
I think, perhaps,
you should telephone

1097
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,720
that boy doctor
of yours, just in case.

1098
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,472
You don't trust me?

1099
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:15,035
No, I do trust you.
It's just...

1100
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,038
If you wish.

1101
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,280
But I will make
you well again.

1102
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,153
I will.

1103
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,033
I love you.

1104
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,073
I love you, too.

1105
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,558
And I think, perhaps,
you should leave the room.

1106
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,235
Close the door behind you. Yes.

1107
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,992
I'll be right outside.

1108
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,950
<i>If he didn't
wake up from this,</i>

1109
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,791
<i>if he wasn't here tomorrow,</i>

1110
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,479
<i>no matter.</i>

1111
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:12,398
For I know he'd be waiting
for me in the afterlife.

1112
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:15,755
Or some safe,
celestial place

1113
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:22,156
in this life and the next
and the next one after.

1114
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:27,160
<i>And for whatever there is on
the road that follows from here,</i>

1115
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,075
<i>it would only
require my patience</i>

1116
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,233
<i>to get to him again.</i>

1117
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:38,715
You see, to be in love with
him makes life no great mystery.

1118
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,555
Say, "Ah."

1119
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,835
Ahh.

1120
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,073
Very good.

1121
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,358
You can put
your robe back on.

1122
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,277
<i>Sometimes I jump ahead
in our life together.</i>

1123
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:07,070
<i>And I see a time near the end.</i>

1124
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,916
<i>I can predict the future
and everything has settled.</i>

1125
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:18,157
<i>And all our lovers
and children and friends</i>

1126
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,438
<i>come back and are welcome.</i>

1127
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,596
<i>And we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing</i>

1128
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,515
<i>and playing games.</i>

1129
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,991
<i>I am older
and I see things differently,</i>

1130
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,590
<i>and I finally understand you.</i>

1131
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,789
<i>And I take care
of your dresses.</i>

1132
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:59,831
<i>Keeping them from dust
and ghosts and time.</i>

1133
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,553
Yes, but right now,
we're here.

1134
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,036
Yes, of course we are.

1135
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,909
And I'm getting hungry.
