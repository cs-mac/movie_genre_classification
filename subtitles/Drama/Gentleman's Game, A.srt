1
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,597
No offense, but...

2
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,397
your hair's messed up.

3
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:53,207
You must have been in a hurry
falling down from heaven,
you didn't have time to fix it.

4
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,417
Do you want to have a drink?

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,317
Let's do it in order of importance.

6
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:03,217
How old are you?

7
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,817
20 years old.

8
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,917
How about all of you, Ajussis?
(Ajussi - Older man, Uncle)

9
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:09,727
There are no ajussis here.

10
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:12,327
There's only a 10-year difference.  Call us oppa.
(Oppa - Older brother, boyfriend)

11
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,927
We're 30 years old this year.  Born in 1983.

12
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:17,727
Don't believe them.
They're sneaky.

13
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:20,737
Isn't this straight out lying?

14
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:26,237
It's the new year, so we're 31.  Born in 1982.

15
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,037
But doesn't she look like Jeong Pal?

16
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:30,647
That guy who got married in 1st year college
or was it 2nd year college?

17
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:31,647
Jeong Suk?

18
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,647
I heard that punk is an animation director.

19
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:38,347
Were you referring to Na Jeong Suk?

20
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,457
How did you know? Is he that famous?

21
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:44,157
Ajussis, how do you know my father?

22
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,967
Nobody said the name earlier.

23
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:33,107
Yesterday was... February 14.

24
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:43,917
Today is... February 15.  Wednesday.

25
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,947
=The gallery site... me and Director Choe will go...=

26
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:16,847
=The man I want to confess to is Gim Do Jin.=

27
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:24,157
<i>You will accept it, right?</i>

28
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:27,557
<i>Of course. You will surely feel
it's very absurd and unimaginable.</i>

29
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,567
<i>That there's such a woman saying this
after only meeting for a few times--</i>

30
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,967
<i>Are you okay with that?</i>

31
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:32,667
<i>Excuse me?</i>

32
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:36,467
<i>If I were to accept this,</i>

33
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,777
<i>who knows you might live happily ever after with me.</i>

34
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,477
<i>Of course, it's enough.</i>

35
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,977
<i>If I hope for more, that would
make me a bad woman.</i>

36
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,887
<i>T-Then...</i>

37
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,987
<i>How?</i>

38
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,087
<i>Why, exactly?</i>

39
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,187
<i>When did it start?</i>

40
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,507
Really?

41
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,807
Teacher Seo really confessed to him?

42
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,117
That's right.

43
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,917
You don't know what kind of spectacle that was.

44
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,517
But it happened before my eyes,
so I have to believe it.

45
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:27,317
And why did she have to do it so sincerely?

46
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,527
Why are you angry?
Isn't it good that they can be together?

47
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,527
I wanted I Su to be with you.
Not with Do Pal.

48
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,927
You wanted Yun and I to be together?

49
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,927
I heard Teacher Seo confessed to you.

50
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,537
A straight ball strike.

51
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:42,037
What kind of big news is it?
How come everyone knows?

52
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:42,837
Give me the same.

53
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:44,237
Yes.

54
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,337
The country is generally having a fine weather,
so what's the difference?

55
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,437
Such a know it all...

56
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:52,247
So... are you going to formally date Teacher Seo?

57
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:55,447
I want to but I think she's embarrassed.
She keeps avoiding me.

58
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,347
She said you're embarrassing?

59
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,057
Leave, if you're done.
Aren't you busy?

60
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:04,057
I Su is a good woman.  Very kind.

61
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:04,957
Is that so?

62
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,457
She's an honest woman.

63
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,067
The fact that I never introduced her to you,
doesn't it say it all?

64
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,067
Maybe you just forgot about it.

65
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,567
If you're not sincere,
better reject her.

66
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,167
She's not the type to satisfy your curiosity.

67
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,877
Curiosity can eventually become sincerity.

68
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,277
Who knows, it might be changing now.

69
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:24,177
But while you're in the midst of changing,
models, stewardess, doctors, graduate student and the likes,

70
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,877
Find one amongst them.

71
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,777
Exclude I Su from that list.

72
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,787
Maintain your playboy character.

73
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,997
Do it properly!

74
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:49,107
Because of you, I'm going out of my mind.  Really!

75
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,907
Until you talked about that unrequited love or whatever,

76
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,807
I was living in peace.

77
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,007
But suddenly, I told him,
"The guy I like was actually you".

78
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,907
I even sent a big basket of chocolates.

79
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,717
This is the biggest reversal since Sixth Sense?
What do I do?

80
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,017
I know that too.

81
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:05,817
But please consider it from my perspective as well.

82
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,427
I did that because I really wanted you
and my brother to be together.

83
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:12,127
Otherwise, will you get another
chance to confess to him ever?

84
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,527
Who told you to stop?

85
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,027
Teacher, I don't get you.

86
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,737
Since I've already laid the path for you,
you should have at least tried.

87
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,737
How could you have changed
the direction of your confession?

88
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:23,737
What did Do Jin oppa say?

89
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:26,437
What else can he say?
He probably thinks I'm this crazy woman!

90
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,337
In this kind of situation,
you have to be positive.

91
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:30,047
That was what you taught us, Teacher.

92
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:32,547
What else can he say?
He probably thinks I'm this crazy woman!

93
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:33,947
Just like that.

94
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:34,947
Come here.

95
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:36,947
Teacher, phone.

96
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,647
What do I do?

97
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:41,457
This is already the 5th call.

98
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,457
I'm not answering it.
I'm not going to...

99
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,357
Do you want to be like an ostrich all your life?

100
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:51,767
Now more than ever, I can't take his call.

101
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,567
I have an idea.  Give it to me.

102
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,477
Hello.  I happened to pick this phone off the streets.

103
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,777
=Is it you, Mi A Ri?=

104
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,777
He recognized me.

105
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:10,087
I'm really dead!  Let's die together.

106
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:15,287
Avoiding me like this, can't help
dig you out of your grave.

107
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:32,707
<i>Tae San.</i>

108
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,407
<i>I love you so much,
it gives me the chills.</i>

109
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:36,407
<i>So excruciatingly handsome.</i>

110
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:39,117
<i>My Tae San.</i>

111
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,117
<i>But, you're really awful.</i>

112
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:44,117
<i>How can you steal my heart</i>

113
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,917
<i>without my permission?</i>

114
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:55,927
<i>Therefore, I've become
a person without a heart.
So, can you take me?</i>

115
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,747
A person without a heart?

116
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,657
Is she in her right mind at all?

117
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,267
We meet again.  I'm sure
you're not here to see me.

118
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,267
Yes.  I'm here to see Seo I Su.

119
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,467
She had done enough wrong to me.
Now, she's even avoiding my calls.

120
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,067
She's not home.

121
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,777
There are 2 reasons why a woman rejects a call.

122
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:44,877
Either she likes him very much
or she hates him to bits.

123
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:50,387
Is it because she hates herself too much
for liking him too much?

124
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,987
That's only possible in Romeo and Juliet.

125
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:54,987
See you.

126
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:09,107
Teacher Seo.

127
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:21,317
Well... God loves us, doesn't He?

128
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,117
Enjoy your drink.

129
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:31,127
Hello, Madam.

130
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:32,427
Hello.

131
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:34,327
Hello.

132
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:44,537
Organic Earl Grey.

133
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:47,837
Jae Sik, 1 cup of Earl Grey.

134
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:48,847
Is that all?

135
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:50,747
I just ordered, didn't I?

136
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,747
What are you doing?

137
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,047
How can I take my wife's money?

138
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:54,847
Take it.

139
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:57,347
Yes.

140
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,557
Please sign.

141
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,767
Sign your name, please.

142
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:34,587
I slept at Do Jin's place, Customer.

143
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:36,887
Do you want me to call him, Customer?

144
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,797
Hello.

145
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:41,197
Oh... Hong pro.

146
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,997
I need some caffeine.

147
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:48,297
Omo.  Eonni, long time no see.
You look younger.
(Omo - Oh my)
(Eonni - Older sister)

148
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,707
I spent money, that's why.

149
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:50,907
You don't look bad.

150
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,507
Is that so?  I just used a bit of BB cream.

151
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:57,707
If a woman my age takes special care,
her age won't show.

152
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,717
Then you have to take special care, too.

153
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,917
I said you don't look bad.
I never said you look good.

154
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:07,417
Aren't you supposed to exert
extra effort in golf, instead?

155
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,627
Everytime I see you,
I envy you to death.

156
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:13,827
You've no ability whatsoever.
Living in luxury because your family is rich.

157
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:18,027
It seems like you spend your idle time
in useless endeavors.

158
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,837
Pro?  What are you ordering?

159
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:22,537
Latte?  Cappuccino?

160
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:26,237
Americano cafe with lots of ice.
I want a large size.

161
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,437
I'm leaving.

162
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,247
Why did you butt in?

163
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:34,547
I was about to answer, didn't you see?

164
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:39,357
Are you leaving?  Go, then.

165
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,977
<i>You've already confessed,
why just this reaction?</i>

166
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:27,197
<i>Please don't get caught.</i>

167
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:31,307
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
I'm dead meat.

168
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,227
I told you not to get caught.

169
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:02,537
You have a one-sided love with Tae San,
yet you confessed to me, Seo I Su.

170
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:05,037
How's... it going?

171
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,437
Not so good.

172
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,937
Not as bad as I feel.

173
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,547
Because you were so embarrassed,
you didn't even answer your phone.

174
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,347
Can't sleep and can't eat either.

175
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,547
Yes, right.

176
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,247
Because you used me.

177
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,347
Yes, right.

178
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,857
There are only 3 types of situations
that a man can't tolerate.

179
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,957
Stolen pen.

180
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,257
Seeing the curses against him on the post it notes.

181
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:29,967
And also receiving the chocolates
from the woman who cursed him.

182
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,767
I didn't steal it.
Why do you keep saying I stole it?

183
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,767
You're really such a rascal.

184
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:44,677
Do you want to talk somewhere else?

185
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:46,277
Fine.

186
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,787
There's a coffee shop nearby.

187
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:49,787
You want to walk?

188
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:53,787
I want a private place with
soft sofa and expensive wine.

189
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:57,787
Where we can have 4 walls to isolate us from
the prying eyes of the people and the noise outside.

190
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,997
And then use the living room
or the bedroom afterwards.

191
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:06,497
You want to go to a hotel?

192
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,007
You don't have roof and walls in your house?

193
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:12,907
Are you living on the hills
of the outer suburbs?

194
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:17,807
You don't want to?
Should we go to a hotel?

195
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,027
Please sit.

196
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:41,437
I drank too much yesterday,
if I drink more, I might vomit.

197
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,947
Did I caught you off guard yesterday?

198
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:53,047
Actually, it's--

199
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,047
Since when did you start liking me?

200
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,967
What do you like about me?

201
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,167
I am sorry.

202
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,967
You really wanted to confess to me that badly.

203
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,777
You even bought a chocolate basket this big.

204
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:23,877
Something so heavy, even the sick
and the old can't carry it.
It's too dangerous.

205
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:27,477
I'm... really sorry.

206
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,687
It's not that I can't understand it.

207
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,287
I really don't want to say this but really...

208
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,587
"I love you so much,
it gives me the chills."

209
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:38,087
So excruciatingly handsome, am I?

210
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,297
From the way you're glaring at me,
looks like you don't agree.

211
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,897
Such a coward.

212
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:48,497
Actually ""I love you so much, it gives me the chills."
is really far out.  So I didn't hear the rest.

213
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:53,707
Excruciatingly... bad, is that it?

214
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,917
Is that how you understand it?

215
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,417
Sorry.

216
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:07,317
Excruciatingly... busy?
Swamped with work.

217
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,327
There are only 4 types of
situations a man can't tolerate.

218
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,827
You just said 3 types earlier.

219
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,527
You just added another one yourself.

220
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,627
Omo!  Look at me.

221
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:20,337
President Gim, you actually
look like a "flowering" man.

222
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:28,947
No wonder, everytime I see you, I feel that
you're so excruciatingly handsome indeed.

223
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:34,847
What?  Don't tell me you
don't feel like a "flowering" man?

224
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:38,647
Omo!  I totally agree with it after I heard that.

225
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,357
This is upsetting.

226
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,157
Aren't you a bit too modest?

227
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,157
Are you suffering from multiple personality disorder?

228
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,057
Is Teacher Seo I Su inside?

229
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:48,257
What I saw is a thief
who specializes in unrequited love.

230
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,367
A woman who denies when backed into a corner.

231
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,567
You're flattering me too much.

232
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,467
Why did you come here today?

233
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,777
I was thinking about you.

234
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,877
Tae San was looking, wasn't he?
Yesterday's confession.

235
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:07,377
I've also thought about this.

236
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:10,587
Just say, "I hate that woman,
I rejected her".

237
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:11,487
Those kinds of words.

238
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,587
I don't hate you.

239
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:14,287
What did you say?

240
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:15,487
I said, I don't plan on doing that.

241
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,587
Why?  What's so difficult about this?

242
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,597
I can't go and tell him I've been rejected?

243
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:20,797
I already gave you the reason.

244
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:21,797
What's the reason?

245
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,197
Are you planning to keep
ignoring my calls?

246
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:25,097
Are you going to keep calling me?

247
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:26,997
You don't plan on taking my calls?

248
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,207
Whether I like it or not, that's not the issue.

249
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,407
Then just answer it.

250
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,547
I came to get my clothes.

251
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,247
Those women who sleep with you,
aren't they willing to do your laundry?

252
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:18,757
That's one aspect and I also left
some of my nice clothes here.

253
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,157
My nice clothes are all in here.

254
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,057
Why do you come at a time
when I'm not around?

255
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:24,257
I saw that the lights were off from outside.

256
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,957
Then all this time,

257
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,167
you never came in because the lights were on?

258
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,367
Are you hurt?  Where?

259
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,967
I'm not hurt.

260
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,567
It's my punishment.

261
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:40,777
But my punishment has nothing to do with you.

262
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:43,577
Have coffee before you leave.

263
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:39,137
Since there were only Tae San and I here,
we kept things up there.

264
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:41,637
We have to move them
so that you can reach them.

265
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,937
Otherwise, you might get hurt.

266
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,737
Pretending to care.

267
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,137
I'm not moving them.
Leave it there so that I'd get hurt.

268
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:51,047
After I get hurt, I'll file a lawsuit.

269
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:55,147
That way, I can see you.

270
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:58,957
I'm leaving.

271
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:04,557
I'll break all the dishes.

272
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,427
Why are you going to Gangneung?

273
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:14,827
To watch a baseball match.
You want to come?

274
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:15,927
No way...

275
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:17,327
To see men in their baseball uniforms?

276
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:20,537
I'm warning you.  Don't use
this baseball match as an excuse

277
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:21,737
to set up your getaway plans.

278
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:26,137
At most, you'd only lose your pretty wife
but we will lose our landlord.

279
00:21:26,237 --> 00:21:28,037
Do you know what her strong point is?

280
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:30,047
She only considers a man's physical appearance.

281
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,447
Do a good job.

282
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,447
You punks... don't you know
how well behaved I am these days?

283
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:35,847
We're more well behaved.

284
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,647
Isn't that for my happiness, anyway?

285
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,157
When is the competition?

286
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,857
I Su will come with me.

287
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,457
You go and pick up our office staff.

288
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:43,457
Fine.

289
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,357
You should come and hit some balls, too.

290
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:49,067
Our Do Pal values his passion
more than his friendship.

291
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,167
Friendship was invented by single men.

292
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,467
I'll go ahead.

293
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:56,567
So rude.  Your hyeongnims are still talking.
(Hyeongnim - Respected older brother)

294
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,877
Don't give refills, otherwise their nagging won't end.

295
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:02,077
Most of it revolves around you anyway.  Go.

296
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,877
That is why don't give them refills.

297
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:13,887
Welcome.

298
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,197
Hello, Chairman Seong.

299
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:24,297
I am President Gim.

300
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:27,897
Yes, Tae San's doing very well.

301
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:32,407
Yes, Tae San has eaten.

302
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:36,507
It's nothing.  I was just wondering
if you have time this weekend.

303
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:41,517
I'm going crazy.

304
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:42,917
Why? Did something happen?

305
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,117
Chairman Seong...

306
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:48,217
Of all days, she has to pick the morning
of that baseball match to inspect the properties.
I'm going crazy, really.

307
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,627
Man. Why must it be that day?

308
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:55,627
Exactly.  What can I do?

309
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,737
Can you go instead?

310
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,237
- Of course I can.
- Really?

311
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:03,537
That is, if you want to sever
our relationship with Chairman Seong.

312
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:05,737
I really want to beat you up.

313
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:10,247
Why couldn't you be as charming as me?

314
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,947
I'm sorry.

315
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,847
I can go to Gangneung for you.

316
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,247
I'll pick Teacher Seo up.

317
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:20,857
Forget it. I'll ask Yun, instead.

318
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,357
It's me.

319
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:28,767
I have a client meeting this weekend.
I can't pick I Su up.

320
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:31,167
Can you pick her up instead?

321
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,267
The office staff?

322
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:37,267
We're one family.
Do Pal will take care of it.

323
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:41,177
And best of all, he said he will.

324
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:45,277
Why is it too much trouble
to give this woman a ride?

325
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:52,187
Mi A Ri.  It's Do Jin oppa.

326
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:04,397
I'm also very happy to meet you.

327
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,807
I'm not avoiding you.
I left something at home.

328
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:17,607
That's right. No woman avoids me.

329
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,717
Why are you here?

330
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:23,917
I have a baseball match today.
I need to leave as soon as Yun arrives.

331
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:28,117
I know. But, you have to come with me.

332
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:33,127
There's no room in Yun's car.  No room...

333
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:44,237
So... you're all here because
Do Jin asked you to come over?

334
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:46,737
He said you cannot have
an empty seat in your car.

335
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,547
He said not to worry about Teacher
since he's picking her up.

336
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:52,947
That son of a bitch.

337
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:54,247
It'll be tight. Will it be all right?

338
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,147
- Yes! No problem!
- Me too.

339
00:24:56,147 --> 00:25:00,757
Rather than get stuck in the car for 3 hours
with President Gim, it's much better to take a bus.

340
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:03,757
Let's go. Get in.

341
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,857
President Gim asked us to get our uniforms.

342
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:09,867
He wants us to do that, too?

343
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,967
Are we putting this in the car?

344
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,677
Go ahead.

345
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:26,277
Oppa, how do I look?

346
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,687
Pretty, isn't it?

347
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,897
Now, you look a lot prettier.

348
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,597
Go. Let's go.

349
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:51,407
What position are you going to hold?
Last time, I saw--

350
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,807
Last time, Tae San threatened me.

351
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,607
I don't like baseball.

352
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:58,207
Except for golf.  All ball games feel like a gang war.

353
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:01,517
Don't you like fights?

354
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:04,117
But why are you going to this match?

355
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:09,127
Blue Cat needs a handsome muse.

356
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:14,727
Do you have something
to eat in your bag?

357
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,627
I brought some Kimbap and hard boiled eggs.
(Kimbap - Dried seaweed roles with rice)

358
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,437
So this strange smell is coming from the Kimbap?

359
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,037
It's a long ride, we might get hungry.

360
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,337
Who?

361
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:25,637
Unrequited love with Tae San
but confessing to me.

362
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:27,637
Did you make that Kimbap for Yun?

363
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:29,947
- You want to have some?
- Forget it.

364
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,847
Then eat the eggs.

365
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:33,247
- What are you doing right now?
- What?

366
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:35,347
I hate chicken.  I don't even meet
people born in the year of the chicken.

367
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,547
And you dare peel an egg
laid by a chicken in my car?

368
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:38,957
Haven't you noticed the condition of my car?

369
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:42,857
My car has a germ free environment where even
a medical experiment can be conducted at any time.

370
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:46,357
My car is in this condition 365 days of the year.
Do you know what it means?

371
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:49,767
Does your friend own a car wash?

372
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:53,067
Not that.  I love my car.

373
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:56,967
Eating in the car. Sticking things in the car.
Throwing things in the car.  Car--

374
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,977
In this situation, might as well give the car a name.

375
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:04,577
It can't be...

376
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,577
You want to go to the toilet?

377
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:10,387
Oh no, you did name it.

378
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:11,687
What's the name?

379
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:15,087
Is it a male or a female?

380
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,107
Get off.  Bring your bag.

381
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:34,107
You're not thinking of leaving me--

382
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:36,607
You can't have that bag with those food in my car.

383
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:39,717
Ingest it first before getting back in.

384
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:51,327
Do you usually eat that much?

385
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:55,127
I like eating these sorts of stuff
at freeway rest stops.

386
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,527
Does your comprehension deteriorate
when you're eating?

387
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:00,537
I was asking how a woman can eat so much.

388
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:02,337
That's why I wanted you to eat this with me.

389
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:05,637
Forget it.  I don't eat with a thief.

390
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:06,737
Seriously.

391
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:10,147
But, you don't really remember me?

392
00:28:11,747 --> 00:28:16,947
Red yarn.  Contentious behind.
You really don't remember?

393
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,657
Since you've regurgitated all the food in your mouth,
you must have forgotten it.

394
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,257
I don't know!  I don't know!
I have told you so many times already!

395
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:25,857
Even if you ask me a million times,
I still don't know!

396
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,267
Oh, that's how much you've forgotten.

397
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,267
I got it.  Hurry, let's go.

398
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,467
There's still a lot left.

399
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,167
You've already eaten enough.

400
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,667
Come on.

401
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:58,797
What did you do again?

402
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:04,997
Yeah. Why?

403
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,007
We're here?

404
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,707
We're in Yangyang.  Get off the car.

405
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,707
Yangyang?

406
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:20,117
Yangyang?

407
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:27,917
Why are we in Yangyang?

408
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,527
It's an emergency.

409
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:32,127
It's a very important problem that has something
to do with Tae San, Yun and my life.

410
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:35,727
Then, you should have dropped me off at Gangneung.

411
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,527
The match will start at 2.
It's already 12:30.

412
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,337
Then what are you standing there for?
Hurry take a taxi to the bus stand.

413
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:43,537
Please don't do this.

414
00:29:43,537 --> 00:29:48,037
Although I don't look like it, but I am someone
who acts irrationally when backed into a corner.

415
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,947
Since I'm an Ethics teacher,
I have great curiosity in unethical matters.

416
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:53,447
Then, we're about the same.

417
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,147
Here.

418
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,047
Hey! Hey!

419
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:02,457
From the minute we set off,
how can you mess up someone's schedule like this?
What do you expect me to do?

420
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,967
What exactly is it?

421
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:16,367
Hold your horses.

422
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,977
Go to the toilet and listen to this first.

423
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:21,977
When did you get here?

424
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,077
- Last night.
- In what?

425
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:23,877
I caught a plane.

426
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:26,277
What if she tries to confirm the passenger list?

427
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:27,377
Looks like I took my car.

428
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:29,987
- Why are you here?
- To play golf, of course.

429
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:31,687
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

430
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:34,487
Yes, Ji Su.  I'm President Gim.

431
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:36,487
Yes, Jeong Rok is with me.

432
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,087
Of course, don't worry.

433
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,797
You know I'll always be on your side.

434
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,697
No, we'll be going to Gangneung.

435
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:46,497
Jeong Rok is going home now.

436
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:47,897
We wanted him to finish his Sashimi
before he heads back,

437
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:50,707
but he said his plane is leaving soon
so he couldn't stay.

438
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,607
Okay then.

439
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,607
I'm leaving tomorrow.

440
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,107
And furthermore, I brought my car,
why'd you say airplane?

441
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,317
Then step on the accelerator and fly faster than a plane.

442
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,017
I've never met someone as nice as you.

443
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,617
Actually, I met Hae Ju.

444
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,427
She was in my shop and
you even bumped into her.

445
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:12,327
Who's Hae Ju? Was she the one who
dumped you and married a doctor?

446
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,027
No, that was Jeong Mi.

447
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,327
The one who dumped me and
married an accountant, Baek Hae Ju.

448
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,327
Your first love--

449
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:21,237
She's not my first love.
My first love was Yun Hui.

450
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:25,437
So, what happened afterwards?

451
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:28,037
She gave me a call yesterday saying
she wanted to go for a ride.

452
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,647
So I drove all the way to the East China Sea.

453
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:30,747
Did you sleep together?

454
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:33,947
What are you saying?

455
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:37,747
After her divorce, she's been living with her daughter.

456
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,257
She must have suffered a lot.

457
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:43,257
That beautiful face had all but disappeared.

458
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:45,857
Although she's without a doubt an ajumma,
(Ajumma - Older lady, Aunt)

459
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:48,357
but my heart still ached for her.

460
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:51,267
So we watched the sea together,
drank a bit of wine,

461
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:54,167
booked a hotel room for her.

462
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,267
It's true.  That's the whole truth!

463
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,067
Perhaps... it's your child?

464
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,077
Hey!

465
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:02,177
Excuse me. Madam asked me to pass this to you.

466
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:04,177
The car was driven away by Madam.

467
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,077
Madam!

468
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:08,887
Did you get married secretly?

469
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,787
<i>You looked very busy. So I went ahead.</i>

470
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:16,187
<i>But I didn't have enough time
to ask for your permission.</i>

471
00:32:16,187 --> 00:32:19,297
<i>Then, see you in Gangneung.</i>

472
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:25,797
Take the plane, I'm taking your car.

473
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,497
Who took your car?

474
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,407
Was it a girl?

475
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,407
Is she pretty?

476
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:50,227
Are you a high school student?

477
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:51,227
A runaway?

478
00:32:51,227 --> 00:32:52,127
Holiday.

479
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:53,827
Where are you going?

480
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:55,927
Tell me. I'm a high school teacher.

481
00:32:55,927 --> 00:33:00,437
I just stole this car.  Is that all right?

482
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:05,537
I'll be your best accomplice.
But, you don't have a gun, do you?

483
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,947
So... they were all in your car?

484
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,447
Yes.

485
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:16,247
Since he did all this, maybe Do Jin
is serious with Teacher Seo.

486
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:17,247
But still...

487
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:24,357
I don't know why but I don't feel comfortable with this.

488
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,557
It's Se Ra.

489
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:31,367
Yes, it's me.  Where else can I be?
Of course, at the baseball field.

490
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,467
Where's my Hong pro?

491
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,967
I'm at the driving range.

492
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,967
I Su said she went to Gangneung
for the baseball match.

493
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,577
Tae San, are you there?

494
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:42,977
I Su said she's joining the match?
She went to Gangneung?

495
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,677
If I Su went to the match, then I just got caught.

496
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:48,477
I am currently holding the phone with both my hands,
with great reverence.

497
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,387
Im Tae San?

498
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:51,587
Are you a baseball player?

499
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:53,287
I'm an architect, of course.

500
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,487
Do you have to do this every weekend?

501
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:55,987
Of course, I won't be doing this next week.

502
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:58,797
If I do this for 2 weeks straight, is that still
an architect?  That's a baseball player already.

503
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:01,397
What shall we do next week?
Kiss?  Skinship?

504
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:02,697
He-hello?

505
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:04,397
Se-Se-Se Ra?

506
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:06,597
Miss Hong.

507
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:10,907
Why did I bring up kissing?

508
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,607
Was I too self-centered?

509
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,807
Yes.  Generally, after skinship comes the kiss.

510
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:19,107
Oh, so that's how it is.

511
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,617
<i>How do I look?</i>

512
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:24,617
What's that again?

513
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:26,417
She's also one of Do Jin's creations.

514
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:29,027
Oppas!...  Fighting!
(Oppa - Older brother, Boyfriend)

515
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,127
Victory! Victory!

516
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:37,127
V. I. C. T. O. R. Y.

517
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:44,337
Fighting!

518
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:02,257
Where's my car?

519
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:03,457
Do you want to know?

520
00:35:03,457 --> 00:35:04,957
Then listen carefully.

521
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,857
I only want one thing.

522
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:10,067
Never bring up my shortcomings with you again.

523
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,367
Including the incident that
I've forgotten about.  Okay?

524
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,667
Then that's a bit too infuriating, isn't it?

525
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,367
Teacher Seo.

526
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,277
It's a deal then.

527
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:28,277
If you're all done, please head to the field.

528
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:32,187
I love you, President.

529
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:36,887
This lapse is work related,
go ahead and punish me.

530
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,797
Everytime I make eye contact,
they express their admiration for me.

531
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:42,397
Like this.

532
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:46,697
You're really handsome, President.

533
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:52,407
But when will you ever do
something to receive such punishment?

534
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:56,107
Where's my car?

535
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:35,147
Betty!

536
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:06,077
Kinetic energy of a gaseous substance EK.

537
00:37:06,077 --> 00:37:09,987
It will only change with the absolute temperature, T.

538
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,487
Kinetic energy is directly proportional
to the absolute temperature.

539
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:17,287
The higher the temperature,
the more prone it is to molecular diffusion.

540
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:29,207
Right here.

541
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,707
Play!

542
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:48,827
Out!

543
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:52,527
Good ball.

544
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:05,437
Good shot!

545
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:20,657
Oppa!  My Oppa!

546
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:23,757
Do your best.

547
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:26,257
Oppa! Fighting!

548
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,667
Mi A Ri is here!

549
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:49,687
Win.

550
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:56,987
Oppa...!

551
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:08,907
Im Mi A Ri!

552
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:12,607
Mi-Mi A Ri.

553
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,407
Are you all right?

554
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:17,507
Im Mi A Ri, are you all right?

555
00:39:17,507 --> 00:39:18,207
Mi A Ri.

556
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:19,717
It looks bad.

557
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:23,117
Mi A Ri. Eyes. Open your eyes.

558
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:33,527
Are you all right?

559
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:36,527
Where were you hit?  Where?

560
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:38,837
Are you all right?  Can you see me?

561
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:42,937
I'm not all right.

562
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:51,947
Looks like you have to use your sincerity
and love to slowly help me get better.

563
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:55,047
It was a direct hit on the head, really.

564
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,147
Can you see this?  How many?

565
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:02,257
I can't see... Yun oppa...

566
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,267
Hurry, get in.

567
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,767
I'll bring her home. Take care of the things here.

568
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,067
Don't worry, just go.
Pass by the hospital first.

569
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:16,867
You want me to leave with you?

570
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,677
No way... I want to go with Attorney.

571
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,777
Atty. Choe, I want to file a case.

572
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:23,477
Let's talk about it on the way home.

573
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:25,177
Right, let Yun take her.

574
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:27,177
You stay and take care of things here.

575
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:30,887
If you're worried, I can go with them.

576
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,887
What are you doing, Teacher?

577
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:34,887
Nothing was really going to happen.

578
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:37,687
But good thing, I got hurt.

579
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,997
Looks like you'll be all right going alone.

580
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:40,597
Go.

581
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:42,997
Then, we'll go ahead.

582
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:46,297
Teacher, take care of my bag.

583
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,607
Sorry to bother you.

584
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:54,707
I'll give you a call.

585
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,617
Is your sister all right?

586
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:09,927
She won't die.  She's fine.

587
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,827
We're heading back to the pension house now.

588
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:13,727
Those who need to wash, wash up.

589
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:15,227
Those who need to eat, eat.

590
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:47,457
Was that from I Su's room?

591
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:51,167
She's calling me.

592
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:54,667
It's a secret code between us.

593
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:01,077
Hey.  What the hell did you do to her?

594
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:25,797
Right now, are you officially provoking me?

595
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:27,997
You provoked me first.

596
00:42:27,997 --> 00:42:29,007
How's the squid?

597
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,307
I hacked it to pieces.

598
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:37,107
This squid's life...

599
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:38,717
What kind of a man are you?

600
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,117
When I gave you the car keys,

601
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:43,217
didn't we just agree to
never raise the past again?

602
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:45,117
What made you think I agreed to it?

603
00:42:45,117 --> 00:42:47,017
That is...

604
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,727
Because you're a man.  A gentleman.

605
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,727
Do I look like a gentleman to you?

606
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:55,127
I'm very sorry.  I'm not a gentleman.

607
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:56,627
Why?

608
00:42:56,627 --> 00:43:01,337
Aren't you being a bit too critical on yourself?

609
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,537
You will... keep your end of the deal?

610
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:06,637
You're really stupid.

611
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:09,147
You're also lacking in foresight
when it comes to men.

612
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:09,947
What?

613
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,847
The man standing before you now,

614
00:43:11,847 --> 00:43:16,047
do you reckon he's no better
than your average man on the streets?

615
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:19,757
Especially with regard to concealing
an unrequited love after the confession.

616
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,357
Let alone settle this properly,

617
00:43:21,357 --> 00:43:25,057
but instead this woman actually made
the situation more complicated.

618
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:27,857
How can you directly go from stealing a pen
to stealing a car?

619
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:29,267
Burglar Miss Seo I Su.

620
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:32,467
Because the competition was at 2--

621
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,767
Therefore... what do you want?

622
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,267
What my staff did earlier, you saw it, right?

623
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:39,677
Staff?

624
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:43,277
Don't tell me... you want me to...

625
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:44,777
That's right.

626
00:43:44,777 --> 00:43:47,177
Next time, as soon as yell "Seo I Su",

627
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,687
Regardless of when, where, what and why...

628
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:52,187
you have to praise me.

629
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:54,587
You must use flattering words.

630
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,087
I'm speechless.

631
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:57,787
What if I don't do it?

632
00:43:57,787 --> 00:43:59,997
What?  Will you spill everything to Tae San?

633
00:43:59,997 --> 00:44:02,997
Don't try me.

634
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:09,407
Wow. Look at this bruise.

635
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,307
Will this take weeks to heal?

636
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:12,107
So what if it does?

637
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,807
It has to take a long time so I can
get some settlement money.

638
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:16,607
From now on, I am a client.

639
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:20,017
You're my lawyer.

640
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:23,117
Are we lost?

641
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:25,317
This is heading to Seoul.

642
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:26,817
Seoul.  220 kilometers.

643
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:29,827
No bleeding, great vision.

644
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:34,627
I think you don't need a lawyer but an egg.

645
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,837
Oh... what do I do?

646
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:41,337
My eyes are swollen and painful.

647
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:46,237
It's turning black.

648
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,237
It feels like my eyes are about to fall off.

649
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:51,847
I'll lie down for a while.

650
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:14,067
It's a bit cold, thank you.

651
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:45,097
This is Mi A Ri's bag.

652
00:45:45,097 --> 00:45:47,897
Those clothes are Mi A Ri's, too?

653
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:51,107
There was an accident so...

654
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:54,807
I Su, I didn't know you have this side.

655
00:45:54,807 --> 00:45:58,407
I Su, it's best if you hitch
a ride back with him, is that okay?

656
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,017
I have to meet Se Ra.

657
00:46:01,017 --> 00:46:03,817
Is that so? Then, bring me with you.

658
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:05,917
What's wrong with you?

659
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:07,517
Didn't you say you're not going home?

660
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:09,427
You said we're going to stay here.

661
00:46:09,427 --> 00:46:11,127
When did I say that?

662
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,227
Don't be shy about it.

663
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:15,127
Tae San, you'll understand. Will you?

664
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:18,027
She said since we came all the way here,
she must try the Sashimi before heading back.

665
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:20,037
That's why I said that.

666
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:23,337
I'd like to, Miss Seo I Su.

667
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:27,337
Then, are you coming back again?

668
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:30,647
Answer him. Seo I Su.

669
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:45,057
I think she's still very shy.

670
00:46:45,057 --> 00:46:47,057
In fact, I can hear it.

671
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,067
I'll buy you chicken.  Did she say that?

672
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:51,367
No, it's not like--

673
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,467
If it's like that, I'll just say it out loud.

674
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,067
But she's still shy about it.

675
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,367
She even praised me.

676
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:58,467
Then go back.

677
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,577
Let's go.

678
00:47:04,277 --> 00:47:05,577
Teacher Seo has totally become a different person.

679
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:06,277
Beautiful. Beautiful.

680
00:47:06,277 --> 00:47:07,977
Too cool. Too cool.

681
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:09,787
Guys!

682
00:47:09,787 --> 00:47:11,387
She's prettier from the front.

683
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:13,487
It caught me by surprise, too.

684
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,787
How can they look so good together?

685
00:47:15,787 --> 00:47:19,197
Be careful of that punk! I Su!

686
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:30,807
<i>Come! Cheers!</i>

687
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:39,117
You're not eating?

688
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:41,917
Is it really because of this Sashimi?
The reason for making me stay behind.

689
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:43,117
How is that possible?

690
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:44,017
Then, what is it?

691
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:46,917
You've never been in love before?

692
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:49,227
I was considered a prodigy.

693
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:52,327
A love prodigy.

694
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,127
Then, you should know.

695
00:47:54,127 --> 00:48:01,037
The reason why a man would hold a woman
at such a distant and unfamiliar beach side.

696
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:04,237
That's why I'm asking.
What exactly is your reason?

697
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:08,237
It sure is embarrassing
if you don't know at that age.

698
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:19,357
I want you to drive... to Seoul.

699
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:22,157
You look disappointed.

700
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:25,057
Looks like you want something else.

701
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,867
Put it down...

702
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,777
Do you really want to sleep with me?

703
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:41,077
I'm ready for it.

704
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:46,277
Oh, gross...

705
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:03,097
As a woman, why can't you set
your sight for the long run?

706
00:49:03,097 --> 00:49:05,397
That's right.

707
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:07,197
Me?

708
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:14,307
This woman's problem is always
the bottom part of her clothes.

709
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:56,347
Thank you.  You're very kind.

710
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:00,757
You're quite persistent.

711
00:50:00,757 --> 00:50:04,357
Although I still feel that we're both to blame,
but anyway...

712
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:08,967
Thank you.

713
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:12,667
That's quite an impressive confession.

714
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:16,667
Why be a baseball umpire?

715
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,377
Teaching children is already tiring enough as it is.

716
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:21,577
Aside from teaching the children,

717
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:24,177
I love baseball the most.

718
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:26,877
And I also like...

719
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:30,087
Im Tae San, the baseball player.

720
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:37,587
For putting you in an awkward situation
because of my confession,

721
00:50:37,587 --> 00:50:39,897
I'm really sorry.

722
00:50:40,597 --> 00:50:42,897
Please understand.

723
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:44,997
Now, I...

724
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:51,047
have even lost my chance... to confess.

725
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,767
We'll schedule the construction work next week.

726
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,867
Sure.

727
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:59,577
But President... how old are you this year?

728
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:02,277
41 years old.

729
00:52:28,197 --> 00:52:29,607
<i>As a 41 year old, this answer...</i>

730
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:32,507
<i>is when you won't allow yourself
to feel wronged and dejected again.</i>

731
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:34,207
<i>It's already March where spring flowers bloom.</i>

732
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:40,517
<i>It's a season most suitable to a "flowering" man like me.</i>

733
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:43,617
<i>Although some women might laugh at this.</i>

734
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:56,827
Hello, everyone.

735
00:52:56,827 --> 00:53:02,237
I presume everybody knows me.
The Ethics Goddess, Seo I Su.

736
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:12,847
<i>Not 20, maybe roundabouts 15 people
tossed coins to enter.</i>

737
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,247
<i>I told you so.  Should not be more than 20 people.</i>

738
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:15,847
<i>I'm sure of it.  I know it.
No problems, for sure.</i>

739
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:18,047
They are kings when it comes
to throwing.

740
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:19,157
How many times do I have to say the same thing?

741
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,757
My throat is aching.
How many times do I have to say it?

742
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:23,657
What did I do wrong in my previous life?

743
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:25,957
What the heck?

744
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,657
What goddess?

745
00:53:27,657 --> 00:53:29,367
It's such a waste of time.

746
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:30,967
It's not even Chinese, English or Math.

747
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:33,467
She's merely an Ethics teacher.

748
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:37,067
Ethics is not even included in the college exams.

749
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:38,877
What's the use of attending her class?

750
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:42,777
Just try and stop me from doing
my other assignments in her class...

751
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,577
I will punish her immediately

752
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:46,977
and then lay her off.

753
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,897
Hello, Friend.

754
00:54:03,897 --> 00:54:06,497
I'm sorry but can you repeat
what you just said earlier?

755
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:08,907
Wh-wh-what did I say?

756
00:54:08,907 --> 00:54:10,707
No?

757
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:14,207
You can't even do this for a friend. So disappointing.

758
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:19,717
You jerk! #@%&

759
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:25,417
This is the most common violent attack
in school campuses of the Korean peninsula.

760
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:28,617
Next time, it'll be the Chinese version.

761
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:30,827
So...

762
00:54:31,827 --> 00:54:33,527
Don't look down on her.

763
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:36,527
You're here.

764
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,627
Everything's going smoothly?

765
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:40,537
There are no problems with the store,

766
00:54:40,537 --> 00:54:42,737
but it feels like something
is going to happen to you.

767
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,937
Me? Why?

768
00:54:43,937 --> 00:54:47,337
Earlier, Madam came and took away the credit card bills.

769
00:54:47,337 --> 00:54:49,247
What? You jerk.

770
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:51,347
This kind of thing, why tell me only now?

771
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:53,947
Do you think that I pay you just to sell coffee?

772
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:55,647
How long ago since she left?

773
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:56,447
Where did she go?

774
00:55:08,457 --> 00:55:10,567
I can handle it.

775
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,467
Really...

776
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:15,867
Hey!

777
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:17,567
What are you doing?

778
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:20,377
Stay far away from my wife.

779
00:55:20,877 --> 00:55:21,677
Say hello.

780
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:23,377
He's a man who shares the
same family registry with me.

781
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:24,877
Nuna, you're married?
(Nuna - Older sister)

782
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:25,977
Don't worry.

783
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:28,477
I think we'll be having separate
family registers soon.

784
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:31,587
Honey, how can you make such a scary joke?

785
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:34,687
In front of a strange man.

786
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:36,287
If you came because of the credit card bills...

787
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:37,587
then tell me your prepared excuses.

788
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:39,697
Credit card bills?

789
00:55:39,697 --> 00:55:42,697
So it's with you.

790
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:45,897
Your naughty curiosity.

791
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:48,707
Kimbap Heaven, 2 million Won.

792
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:50,707
What is that?

793
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:52,207
Don't tell me, you're operating a Kimbap business.

794
00:55:52,207 --> 00:55:54,107
What are you saying?

795
00:55:54,107 --> 00:55:56,907
What is that?

796
00:55:56,907 --> 00:55:59,017
Tae San and his baseball team.  Blue Cat.

797
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,817
I treated them to lunch.

798
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:01,917
So it's like this.

799
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,917
Wow.  They can sure eat.

800
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,717
They can sure eat...

801
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:10,727
1 000 Won a piece of Kimbap,
each of them can actually eat
166 000 Won a piece.

802
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:18,227
Nowadays, night clubs, these types of places,
will use other shop's name in their receipts.

803
00:56:18,227 --> 00:56:19,237
What are you doing?

804
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:20,837
Butting into our business.

805
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:22,437
Do you want to go to heaven?

806
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:24,337
Should I send you there now?

807
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:25,537
No.

808
00:56:25,537 --> 00:56:28,137
You like flowers, right?

809
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:32,547
For you...

810
00:56:35,447 --> 00:56:37,247
Should I bring this home?

811
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:38,347
Where shall I put it?

812
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:40,757
Bring it to heaven.
Give it to the angels.

813
00:56:40,757 --> 00:56:43,257
Aren't angels females?

814
00:56:44,757 --> 00:56:45,557
Wife.

815
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:46,357
Honey.

816
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:47,357
Darling!

817
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:48,157
Min Suk nuna...

818
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:33,707
What is the reason for
deciding to be an architect?

819
00:57:33,707 --> 00:57:35,007
Gim Do Jin:

820
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:38,717
"Because during the 90's, the age of capitalism,

821
00:57:40,517 --> 00:57:43,217
my parents wanted me
to become a professional.

822
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:45,517
An architect is also a professional.

823
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:47,217
So carrying the spirit of the X generation,

824
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,727
I chose to be an architect."

825
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,327
"Those were my prepared answers."

826
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:54,427
The truth is I scored high enough to get in.

827
00:57:55,127 --> 00:57:58,627
Are there any buildings you
want to see in your lifetime?

828
00:57:58,627 --> 00:58:00,237
<i>Why should I go see a building before I die?</i>

829
00:58:00,237 --> 00:58:01,937
<i>That time is very valuable.</i>

830
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,437
Then, what do you want to see?

831
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:04,937
Your beloved wife's face?

832
00:58:04,937 --> 00:58:05,937
<i>I am a lone wolf.</i>

833
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:07,337
That's unexpected.

834
00:58:07,337 --> 00:58:08,847
Is there a particular reason for it?

835
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:11,647
<i>I don't think I can spend
a lifetime with one woman.</i>

836
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:14,047
<i>I also don't think that I can love
1 woman for the rest of my life.</i>

837
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:17,147
<i>I don't want to share the money I earn
with my wife or my children.</i>

838
00:58:17,147 --> 00:58:18,147
<i>That's about it.</i>

839
00:58:18,357 --> 00:58:20,957
Really...

840
00:58:21,057 --> 00:58:26,157
President Gim Do Jin left us a few words
prior to the end of his interview.

841
00:58:27,657 --> 00:58:30,567
<i>Please embellish that for me.</i>

842
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:33,267
Such a straight shooter.

843
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:36,267
But, what's up with this man?

844
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:39,777
It seems like I am hearing his voice over
while reading this article.

845
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:48,177
Poor you.

846
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:51,387
No man sent you home.
That I can understand.

847
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:54,587
Why don't you even have a man
who can have coffee with you?

848
00:58:54,587 --> 00:58:57,087
Did you end it with Do Jin?

849
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,097
I already told you we don't have
that kind of relationship.

850
00:58:59,097 --> 00:59:00,997
If that's the case, then go out with Yun.

851
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,397
Although he was married but...

852
00:59:02,397 --> 00:59:05,897
He has high market value, handsome.

853
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:07,397
To be honest, he is too good for you.

854
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:09,707
He is even a lawyer.

855
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:16,007
Otherwise, just go on a blind date.

856
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:19,017
I know of a good seonbae in our pitching team.
(Seonbae - Senior, Mentor)

857
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:21,217
Forget it.

858
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:25,717
Don't tell me it's because of that
20-second man you told me before?

859
00:59:28,827 --> 00:59:30,627
No.  It's not because of him.

860
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:32,427
Who is it?

861
00:59:32,427 --> 00:59:35,727
Is he someone I know?

862
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:37,727
All right, set me up on a date.

863
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:40,337
Really?

864
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:43,737
But, at our age, we call it date.

865
00:59:43,737 --> 00:59:45,237
But in reality, it's a marriage introduction.
You understand?

866
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:46,637
I know.

867
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:48,037
When are you setting it?

868
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:55,047
You're alone?

869
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:56,047
They're in the car park.

870
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:57,247
What do you want to eat?

871
00:59:57,247 --> 00:59:58,957
With my teacher?

872
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,857
Do you like I Su that much?

873
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:02,857
If I were a man, I would make her my wife.

874
01:00:02,857 --> 01:00:04,957
I really hope I can have
a sister-in-law like her.

875
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:07,357
Se Ra's also good. She's cool.

876
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:08,667
What's so good about her?

877
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:09,467
It's only you who thinks so.

878
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:10,367
This girl, really.

879
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,167
For a girl who lived in the U.S.,
how can you have a Joseon mentality?

880
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:14,767
Is this how you treat your future sister-in-law?

881
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:18,167
Why?  Mi A Ri is back biting me again?

882
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:19,477
I'm starving.

883
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:20,477
Where is my teacher?

884
01:00:20,477 --> 01:00:21,977
I Su went on a blind date.

885
01:00:21,977 --> 01:00:22,577
Blind date?

886
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,677
Why must she go on a blind date?

887
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,477
She already has someone she likes.

888
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:28,377
Who? Do Jin?

889
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,287
From the way she's behaving,
looks like she'd been dumped.

890
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:31,587
Dumped?  By Do Jin?

891
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:32,787
Where is the place?

892
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:33,387
So what if you know?

893
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:35,187
We have to drag her out.

894
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:36,087
Just like in the movies.

895
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:39,397
Who? The three of us?

896
01:00:39,397 --> 01:00:41,797
Go ahead and order first.

897
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:45,397
What slander did you tell him?

898
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:49,407
It's just random talk between brother and sister.

899
01:00:49,807 --> 01:00:51,507
Why do you hate me so much?

900
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:52,907
Do you really want to know?

901
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:55,207
I couldn't care less in the beginning,

902
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:56,507
but now I'm a bit curious.

903
01:00:56,507 --> 01:01:00,017
When you went to New York with Oppa to see me,
do you still remember?

904
01:01:00,017 --> 01:01:02,017
You just started dating.

905
01:01:02,017 --> 01:01:02,517
So,

906
01:01:02,517 --> 01:01:05,517
Oppa went to see the major league baseball that day.

907
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:10,327
I saw you kissing a guy you
had just met at a club.

908
01:01:10,827 --> 01:01:12,427
You... me...

909
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:15,327
are not the type who'd
stay in a library, am I right?

910
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:18,527
I never told my brother.

911
01:01:18,527 --> 01:01:20,237
That's why I hate you so much.

912
01:01:20,237 --> 01:01:21,537
I hope you can understand.

913
01:01:21,537 --> 01:01:23,337
Oh, I see.

914
01:01:23,337 --> 01:01:25,337
The reason is very clear.

915
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:27,537
Of course, you'd hate me.

916
01:01:27,537 --> 01:01:29,447
I admit it.

917
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:30,247
Admit?

918
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:33,047
What can I do?  I already kissed him.

919
01:01:34,347 --> 01:01:38,647
Do I continue to sit here or do I leave?

920
01:01:38,647 --> 01:01:41,057
Do as you wish.

921
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:49,967
She said I got dumped?

922
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:51,967
I'll call you again.

923
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,567
Because of the Sokchodong leaking incident,

924
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:56,467
I'm at Yun's office.

925
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:02,277
Was that Tae San?  Why?

926
01:02:02,277 --> 01:02:06,977
Some girl went on a blind date.

927
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,987
Who is she?

928
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:12,887
Why?  Are you worried it was Mi A Ri?

929
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:13,987
You, brat...

930
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:16,487
What did the owner say?

931
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:22,197
He said no one ever told him about
changing the drainage pipe size to 120 mm.

932
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,997
But because he said that,

933
01:02:24,997 --> 01:02:26,597
it makes it a lot easier for us.

934
01:02:26,597 --> 01:02:27,397
Why?

935
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:29,407
Your recorder.

936
01:02:29,407 --> 01:02:31,207
There must be a record of it.

937
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:33,907
Did you keep the file?

938
01:02:33,907 --> 01:02:36,007
This thing is useful.

939
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:38,507
Then, there's nothing to worry about.
Want to have coffee?

940
01:02:38,507 --> 01:02:40,117
Is it Teacher Seo?

941
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:42,617
The woman on a blind date.

942
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:46,217
Do I ask you to stay put?

943
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:49,827
Or do I push you to go?

944
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:16,447
Iced Americano with 3 shots.

945
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:20,257
Do you wear something like this
when you meet other men?

946
01:03:20,257 --> 01:03:22,857
It's not that pretty.

947
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:24,857
It's been quite a while.

948
01:03:24,857 --> 01:03:27,857
Long enough that the seasons have changed.

949
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:36,567
Actually, I am meeting someone right now.

950
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,467
There's 10 minutes before the set time.

951
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:40,577
You're so early.

952
01:03:40,577 --> 01:03:44,177
Why must I save a girl who's so eager
to go on a blind date?

953
01:03:46,177 --> 01:03:49,287
Tae San asked me to bail you out.  Seo I Su, you.

954
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:51,687
Tae San asked you to save me?

955
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:54,087
Was that all you heard?

956
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:56,087
I don't have to come but I still came.

957
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:58,287
You don't feel anything at all?

958
01:03:58,287 --> 01:04:01,297
You didn't have to come.
But why are you here?

959
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:02,897
I've decided to embark on a one-sided love.

960
01:04:02,897 --> 01:04:03,697
With whom?

961
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:04,297
You.

962
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:05,397
Which 'you'?

963
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:07,297
M-me?

966
01:04:35,827 --> 01:04:37,627
Don't you remember meeting me in Busan?

967
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:38,427
What is your father doing?

968
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:39,837
This person...

969
01:04:39,837 --> 01:04:41,737
Your first blind date isn't over yet.

970
01:04:41,737 --> 01:04:44,337
For male number 2, meet him next time.

971
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:45,337
You don't have appetite?

972
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:46,037
How can I?

973
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:48,337
Even if it's cast iron, I would still gobble it down.

974
01:04:48,337 --> 01:04:50,447
You really make me witness a lot of things.

975
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:53,147
I don't have the confidence to make Mi A Ri like me.

976
01:04:53,147 --> 01:04:54,047
The bar was 5 hours and 10 minutes ago.

977
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:56,347
This is the hotel.

978
01:04:56,347 --> 01:04:58,957
Yun Pal moved from our house
to live with his mother-in-law.

979
01:04:58,957 --> 01:05:01,057
Your friend came over and took it away.

980
01:05:01,057 --> 01:05:03,157
Is this how a person with one-sided love
supposed to behave?

981
01:05:03,157 --> 01:05:05,657
Can't a man with one-sided love
sleep with another woman?

982
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:08,457
Why? You want to sleep with me?
