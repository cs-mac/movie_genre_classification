Sugared almonds mean christenings.</i>

and communicate our news:</i>

<i>from the grocer who is moving

<i>When people needed
a business card, where did they go?</i>

10
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:33,439
<i>To the stationers or to the printers.</i>

11
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,126
<i>People ordered
a couple of thousand cards.</i>

12
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:39,682
<i>You'd wait a month
but how long did you keep them?</i>

13
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,081
<i>Ten years, a lifetime.</i>

14
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:45,120
<i>Nowadays who stays put for five years
or keeps a job two years?</i>

00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,635

22
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,965
you sell sugared almonds...

23
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,202
See what I mean?

24
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:10,000
Sugared almonds mean christenings.
And christenings mean invitations.

25
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,683
All right, sir?
Take a seat, drink some water.

26
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:20,241
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right, thanks.

<i>At home one evening,</i>

31
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,315
<i>Simon Hirsh looked
at his hands and nails.</i>

32
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,835
<i>They were yellow
like an old dog's claws.</i>

33
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,480
<i>Simon had never imagined
he'd grow old.</i>

34
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:43,394
<i>Yet there it was, staring back at him.
He had not realised.</i>

35
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:53,360
<i>He wandered why all those years
had gone by so fast.</i>

36
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:58,605
<i>He tried to reflect on his life.
But what could he remember?</i>

37
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:01,684
<i>A dozen faces
whose names he mixed up</i>

38
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:07,278
<i>His daughter, long gone. The smell
of four or five houses he'd lived in.</i>

39
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,318
<i>And all those absurd things
he'd had to sell to earn a living.</i>

40
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,674
<i>How long did he have left?</i>

41
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:18,162
<i>Fifteen years? Twenty?
What would happen?</i>

42
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,997
IT WAS AROUND THAT TIME
THAT HE MET MICKEY...

43
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:30,200
<i>"Look," says Mickey, "relax your hips.
Go on then!"</i>

44
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,122
<i>"No I don't want to."</i>

45
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,359
Go on. Look.

46
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,396
"How would you know? Try."

47
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,800
- See? Relaxed and dynamic.
- I don't care.

48
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,836
Look! it's great. Look.

49
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:42,559
And right, and front!

50
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:45,404
And right and front...
The knee is relaxed.

51
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:50,762
- I'm not about to dance in the street.
- The knee is relaxed. Look.

52
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,875
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

53
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,717
- Are you embarrassed?
- What's the difference? I don't want to.

54
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,040
- It's stupid to be embarrassed.
- I'm stupid.

55
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:04,837
- You're worried about being ridiculous?
- Just drop it.

56
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:08,002
Right now, you're being ridiculous.
We're alone.

57
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,796
- I don't want to.
- How d'you know without trying?

58
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:17,919
- Go on, try it. No one's looking.
- Makes no difference.

59
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:21,594
- Dancing's not the problem.
- Then what is?

60
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:24,159
I don't want to ruin my shoes!

61
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:27,322
- Shall I turn around?
- Makes no difference to my shoes.

64
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,915
I'm talking to you, mate.

65
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:48,683
- What are you doing?
- Meeting a client in Villetaneuse.

66
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,922
Do me a favour? All done by midday.
I'll buy lunch at Marguery.

67
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,081
- Then you head to Villetaneuse.
- What's the favour?

68
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,637
- Surveillance.
- What?

69
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:58,833
Surveillance. For me.

70
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,195
- Marlon broke his arm, he can't come.
- No way.

71
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:05,122
It's dead easy:
sit in the car, look around,

72
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:08,315
read the paper,
check it's recording, turn the tape over.

73
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:11,276
- No.
- You know how to turn a tape over?

74
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,641
You know how to turn a tape over,
don't you?

75
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,561
Well, do you?

76
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:18,798
No!

77
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:36,802
What do you want?
Now's not the time for cleaning.

78
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:39,119
Get out! Close the bloody door

79
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,191
<i>Listen, he's pretty wired today.</i>

80
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:59,202
<i>I don't think he'll make a deal
with the guy.</i>

81
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:28,912

- Of course.</i>

<i>Danata's waiting for a friend.</i>

83
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,962

try to get her registration number.</i>

84
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:41,557
<i>Loosen your hips
The hips are the key. Nice and relaxed.</i>

85
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,716
<i>Watch your feet</i>

86
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:59,117
<i>-Someone's at the door, Mr. Danata.
- I'll get it.</i>

87
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:04,242
<i>-I said I'd get it.
- Very well, sir.</i>

88
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:09,596
<i>Leave me for an hour.
If the phone rings, don't answer.</i>

THE HOSPITAL HAD A SEPARATE
WING FOR DEEP COMAS

90
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,069
THE OTHER TWO...
LONG BEFORE ALL THAT

91
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,072
Don't let me got in your way, will you?

92
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,590
You! Don't let me get in your way.

93
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,120
Piss off, then!

94
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:40,994
Piss off!

95
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,759
- There's no room, get in the back.
- I can't!

96
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:16,838
- My leg is infected.
- It's the back or nothing.

97
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:19,554
OK, OK, I'll get in the back.

98
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:24,955
Arsehole. That piece of shit
would've run me over.

99
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:26,879
Oh, shit.

100
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,110
No, not Max. Marx.
Marx, like Karl Marx.

101
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,276
Karl Marx: ring a bell?

102
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,516
No? Right. What about you?

103
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:38,790
- What's what about me?
- What's your name?

104
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:41,752
- Frédéric.
- What? Frédéric?

105
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,075
Ha! Frédéric!

106
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:46,475
- Why? What's wrong?
- Not Frédéric.

107
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,432
Frédéric's a woman's name.

108
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,392
For fuck's sake,
take your feet off my suitcase!

109
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:56,598
Freddy...
Freddy... Freddo...

110
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,676
Even Freddo... Freddo's a dog's name!

111
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:02,190
You couldn't care less
what anyone says to you, eh?

112
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:04,599
How many fingers?

113
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,234
- Three.
- You're a fast one, aren't you?

114
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:12,031
Olympique de Marseille lost recently.

115
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,077
I'll have to cut your hair.

116
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,318
So they lost...

117
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,514
What do you tell your son?

118
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:49,949
Anything. I don't know...
Whatever's going through my head.

119
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,355
What's going on outside.
Who I've seen, what I've done.

120
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,754
What his cousins and friends say.

121
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,268
Funny stories I hear on the radio.

122
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:02,909
Sometimes I bring him newspapers
and I read to him.

123
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:05,633
Or I sing him a song.

124
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,398
Today I brought him pictures
of the house,

125
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,509
his mother, his sisters.

126
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,716
So when he wakes up,
he won't be completely lost.

127
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,838
Mickey...

128
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,711
It's me, Simon.

129
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,036
Mickey...

130
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:35,389
What did I expect?

131
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:39,353
What can I tell you? I don't know...

132
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,828
I'm supposed to talk to you...

133
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:52,549
Right, Mickey, it's me, Simon.

134
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,748
You went to see him?

135
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:59,837
- And how is he? Still...?
- Of course.

136
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:02,711
I wanted to go see him, but then...

137
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:07,388
- What was he thinking, going alone?
- I don't know.

138
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,793
- Would you like another coffee?
- Yes, please.

139
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:12,386
Two coffees, please, Miss. Thanks.

140
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:17,353
Ignore this, the lads did it for a joke.

141
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,548
Who was Danata?

142
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,077
A crook.

143
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:25,510
We'd been after him for a month:
betting, dope...

144
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,310
Why Mickey?

145
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,906
I mean, why did they shoot HIM?

146
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,189
Because he was there.

147
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,434
Just because he was there?

148
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,026
Sometimes that's all it takes.

149
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:39,671
Can I ask you something?

150
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:46,513
If you'd been with him,
would things have been different?

151
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,754
For Mickey? No.

152
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:55,152
- Have you found anything out?
- Not yet, it's too soon.

153
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:59,635
We'll do everything we can.
We'll find him one way or another.

154
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,353
Did he tell you what he did
outside of work? His friends?

155
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:06,072
No, not really. Why?

156
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,985
We haven't found anyone to notify.
No friends or girlfriend. No one.

157
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,188
His stuff at the station doesn't matter.

158
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:17,515
But his landlord calls us ten times a day
to get his flat back.

159
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,392
- What about his parents?
- Mickey doesn't have parents anymore.

160
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,826
The new tenants move in in a fortnight.

161
00:13:55,945 --> 00:14:00,792
I went ahead and put the mattress away.
What shall I do with the rest?

162
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:03,749
Keep the furniture.
I'll take care of the rest.

163
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,074
The television as well?

164
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,752
Shall I keep the television as well?

165
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,708
If you want.

166
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,392
There's something
I don't really understand...

167
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,076
Are you with the police?

168
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,471
Police or family?

169
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,873
If anyone asks,
you can tell them you don't know.

170
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,311
Off! That's my bed. Clear off.

171
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,947
Can't you make less noise
when you eat? Your mouth!

172
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:48,189
Close your mouth. I see everything
in your mouth. It's revolting.

173
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,386
Like a concrete mixer.

174
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:53,951
Didn't you learn to eat
with your mouth shut? The belt.

175
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:57,233
The belt, there.

176
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,508
See those shoes?

177
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,431
- What d'you think they're made of?
- Leather.

178
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,672
Very good. What sort of leather?

179
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:14,835
Horse leather.

180
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,231
Nothing beats horse leather.
Did you know?

181
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:20,712
Feel them. Here, have a feel.

182
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,111
Feel that? Hmm? Feel the texture?

183
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:26,831
I bought them from a guy
who lost everything at the races.

184
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:30,551
- See, the initials are inside.
- The horse's?

185
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,385
- Course not. The guy's.
- The guy's...

186
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:39,465
He figured that nag stripped him bare,
it's his turn now. He waited five years.

187
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:44,875
Five years later, when they took
the nag to the abattoir,

188
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:47,112
he was outside, waiting.

189
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,994
What for?

190
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,787
The shoes!

191
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,752
We're closing.

192
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:04,787
- Marx.
- Yeah?

193
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,550
Can I lie next to you?

194
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:15,187
Can I sleep next to you?

195
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:21,110
Never again.

196
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:24,750
Never wake me like that again,
do you hear me?

197
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:27,912
I can't believe it.
Who do you think you are?

198
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:31,630
You poof! I'll put you right,
just you wait.

199
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,828
Wake me like that once more
and I'll crush your skull. Got it?

200
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,547
I get it, Marx.

201
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:43,070
We wanted to have lunch outside,
but it rained so we had to go inside.

202
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:48,428
Sandrine came with Jeanne.
They bought a house...

203
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,864
Her bloke found work again.

204
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:55,147
You know Jean-Jo the beekeeper,
the one who talks to insects.

205
00:16:56,463 --> 00:17:01,185
She showed us pictures of the house.
She asked me three times how I was.

206
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,425
Then the rain stopped,

207
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:14,114
so the Lefèvre kids played
in the garden.

208
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:17,863
<i>I went into my office
but the little one was sleeping so...</i>

209
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,831
<i>Simon, can you hear me?</i>

210
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,990
<i>Danata's waiting for a friend.</i>

211
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:04,585
<i>If she drives here,
try to get her registration number.</i>

212
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,583
<i>- I said, I'll get it.
- Very well ,sir.</i>

213
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:18,832
<i>Leave me for an hour.
If the phone rings, don't answer.</i>

214
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:32,385
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the area...

215
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:36,109
You shouldn't be here.
I told them not to let anyone in!

216
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:38,542
- I needed a word.
- About?

217
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:40,982
How's it going?
The investigation? Mickey?

218
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,463
You think now's the time?

219
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:47,225
Nono! Tell her to shut it, will you?

220
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,265
Of course it's progressing.

221
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:53,590
- Have you found anything?
- Nothing conclusive yet.

222
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,466
We know the killer was quite young,
early twenties.

223
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:00,472
Left-handed. Wore trainers.

224
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:04,631
- We think they were pros.
- There were several of them?

225
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:08,063
That's enough, Mr Hirsch.
Let us do our job now.

226
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,228
Nono!
Where's that useless bastard? Call him.

227
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:15,027
- Is this linked to the investigation?
- What? The whore? No.

228
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:18,384
- You're not doing everything you can.
- What?

229
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,266
You said, "We'll do everything we can."
You're not.

230
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:25,306
- You're losing focus if it's not related.
- You have no idea, do you?

231
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,822
You think the administration
can double our numbers?

232
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:31,104
Only the murders are doubling!
The dead all matter equally.

233
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,952
I think you don't give a shit
about Mickey!

234
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:36,507
- You've no right.
- Admit it!

235
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:42,067
Queen of hearts,
two low black cards.

236
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,264
Where's the queen? The queen.
Where's the queen?

237
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,305
There! Two hundred francs!
Two hundred!

238
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,584
Red wins, black loses.
Follow the queen. Where's the queen?

239
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,624
There! A hundred francs. A hundred!

240
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,701
- Yes! Two hundred! Two hundred.
- You're a bit cagey.

241
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,626
The cane! The cane.
Don't just stand there for fuck's sake.

242
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,068
Go on, hit him! Go on! Harder!

243
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,309
He can't feel a thing! Go on!

244
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,387
Leave it! Fuck...

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,949
Shit. I could break my hand on that now.

246
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,347
You didn't have to hit so hard.

247
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,468
Shit, I think he got my ear.

248
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,184
Is it bleeding?

249
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,385
I can't see.

250
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,867
- It's not bleeding?
- Dunno.

251
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,145
The suitcase.

252
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,271
Coming or not? Hey!

253
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,831
210, 230, 250...

254
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,787
- 250, 270, 290, 310...
- 370.

255
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,948
Shut up, I'll lose count!

256
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,949
That's how much there is: 370.

257
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,266
330, 350, 370.

258
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:31,265
- How about Johnny?
- What?

259
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,030
Johnny's a good name, right?

260
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:38,030
- it's better than Frédéric, isn't it?
- There are gamblers in here.

261
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,348
There are gamblers here, I know it.
I can smell it.

262
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,587
Those two guys in the corner...

263
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:48,909
Don't turn around, you idiot!
Don't turn around.

264
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,948
Bloody shame.

265
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,710
What can you do with 370 francs?
Shit!

266
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:59,947
- I could've had them. Easy.
- I have some.

267
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,300
- What?
- I have some.

268
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,866
- What?
- Cash. I've got some if you want.

269
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,425
No. What if I lose it?

270
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,668
- It doesn't matter if you lose it.
- Doesn't matter?

271
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,101
- Here, if you wanna play, go.
- How much is there?

272
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:17,108
I don't know. it's dole money...

273
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,950
The dole! I won't touch that.

274
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,506
- It's my work experience. Here.
- If it's work experience... I'll count it.

275
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,940
<i>- Three.
- Three.</i>

276
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,470
<i>- Three.
- Two.</i>

277
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:50,749
<i>Three plus six.
Three hundred plus six hundred.</i>

278
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:56,745
<i>We all need to make ourselves known
and communicate our news:</i>

279
00:22:56,858 --> 00:23:00,465
<i>from the grocer who's moving
to the unemployed man finding a job.</i>

280
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:03,866
<i>When people needed
a business card where did they go?</i>

281
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:06,504
<i>To the stationer's or the printer's.</i>

282
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,666
<i>People ordered a couple of thousand.</i>

283
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:13,022
<i>You'd wait a year. But you kept them
ten years or a lifetime.</i>

284
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:16,745
Obviously the advantage
is that they are small.

285
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,702
The quality is excellent.

286
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:23,584
There are logos. People feel
like they've done it themselves.

287
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:26,019
Business cards,
invitations, party menus,

288
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,709
wedding invitations,
receptions, catwalks...

289
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:32,300
It's out of the question. it's maintenance.

290
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:36,461
Ask Richer, it's his job.

291
00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:39,661
Tonight?
I'm in his office. I'll ask.

292
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,780
Tonight won't work.
I tell you, tonight doesn't work.

293
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:52,426
That's your business, not mine!
I have to go. Someone's waiting for me.

294
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:03,827
No, not here again!
We've been here twice already.

295
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:11,143
What does that bloody office want now?

296
00:24:11,257 --> 00:24:13,305
I'm busy. That's that.

297
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:19,060
Pain in the arse.

298
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,748
"We'll do everything we can.
Everything we can."

299
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:26,738
Useless bastard. He's doing nothing!
Goes all out to go for a ride though.

300
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,982
Sorry.

301
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:50,187
- You with them?
- No.

302
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:51,787
Thought as much.

303
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:55,178
- What about you?
- It's me they're looking for.

304
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:57,379
Just to ask me questions though.

305
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:01,225
Don't worry, they can't see us.

306
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:05,585
When they're like that, they're blind.

307
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,587
I've seen you somewhere?
Do we know each other?

308
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:11,667
- You friends with that cop who got shot?
- Yes.

309
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,781
I must've seen you with him
at that canteen...

310
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:15,944
The Marguery?

311
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:19,106
Yup, while you were having a feast,
I froze outside.

312
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,426
- How did you know him?
- I was his informant.

313
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:26,542
- Think they're on to something?
- No. They're making too much noise.

314
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:32,499
Anyway, they'll never find
the guy who did Danata in.

315
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,505
- Why not?
- Because he's a pro.

316
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,541
- Pros don't got found just like that.
- So they don't get found?

317
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:42,900
Sometimes. But a lot later.
Randomly. In the boot of a car.

318
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:47,465
With a hole in the head. Hands tied
with barbed wire. Same as informers.

319
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,258
Looks like the intermission is over.

320
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:56,662
<i>It's not getting better in the East.
The West bows to Yeltsin's reforms.</i>

321
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:59,825
<i>Seventeen countries grant
an extension to the Soviet debt.</i>

322
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:03,941
There's a picture below of women
looking at frozen chickens.

323
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:10,858
Stock exchange: down 0.4
No picture.

324
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:13,741
Let's see: weather forecast.

325
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,541
Not much change
over the next couple of days.

326
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:19,387
- It's late.
- Yes...

327
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:24,343
- Have you eaten?
- No.

328
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:29,463
- Are you hungry?
- No.

329
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,986
- Are you OK?
- No.

330
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:42,016
If you don't want to lose it, don't give it.
I didn't ask you for anything.

331
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:45,743
- Did I ask you for anything?
- No.

332
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:49,542
- See?
- It doesn't matter, Marx.

333
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:52,738
I lose his money
and he says it doesn't matter.

334
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,981
What is it?
What's with the puppy dog face?

335
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,385
Fuck it.

336
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,818
Where are you going?

337
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,177
None of your business.

338
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:19,104
- Can't I come?
- No, you can't come with me.

339
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:21,695
I need to be alone. It's business.

340
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:25,501
I don't normally have someone in tow.
I don't want to either.

341
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:27,344
I understand.

342
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,741
What are you going to do?
Any plans?

343
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,503
Better think about it.

344
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:43,100
Yesterday you said,
"I'll think about it."

345
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:48,146
- You said you would figure it out.
- it's all figured out.

346
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:52,385
If I come back,
I'll leave a note for you at the hotel.

347
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:56,625
Can't I come with you?
I'll just come to the station with you.

348
00:27:56,735 --> 00:27:59,898
You can't come with me.
It's out of the question.

349
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:01,779
All right, that's OK.

350
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,982
Right, bye.

351
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,018
See you, kiddo.

352
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,142
Hey, sir, come quickly!

353
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:59,223
Yes, but give us until tomorrow.

354
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:03,100
- Give us until tomorrow.
- Look at that, it's disgusting.

355
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:06,263
Just look at it!
Move out of the way.

356
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:11,702
I'm thirsty, Marx.

357
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:13,825
Marx...

358
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:16,696
- I'm thirsty.
- Shut it.

359
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:25,818
Here you go. Your share.

360
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:29,825
Hey, here you go. Take it.

361
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,099
You gave me some cash,
I'm giving it back.

362
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,454
It's yours. That's business. Take it.

363
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:41,014
- What next?
- What d'you mean, what next?

364
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:44,581
What are you doing next?

365
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:48,857
I don't know what I'm doing next.
Keep things moving.

366
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:56,184
Hey! I was thinking...

367
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,221
What are you going to do with it?

368
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,097
- With what?
- Your dough.

369
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:04,899
What are you going to do with it?
Keep it stuffed in your strides?

370
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,863
Dunno... Why?

371
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:11,743
In that case, maybe I should keep it.

372
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,015
If you want. Here you go.

373
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,258
Here.

374
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:21,976
Don't you want
to buy yourself something?

375
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:26,815
- Like what?
- I dunno. Something you'd like.

376
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,101
<i>-I'm not wearing any knickers.
- Bad habit.</i>

377
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:45,183
<i>There's stuff everywhere.
Hurry, I don't have all day.</i>

378
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:55,575
Paper cups, kitchen utensils,

379
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,013
vacuum cleaners
made in East Germany,

380
00:30:58,132 --> 00:31:01,739
frames for glasses,
three-wheel cars, typewriters...

381
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,616
I mean absolutely everything.

382
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,973
One day I decided to go solo.

383
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:10,700
So I took over a toy factory
not far from Montargy.

384
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,940
Unfortunately the business went bust.

385
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:16,534
I had a factory filled with toys
on my hands.

386
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:20,452
I had to empty it
so I took the stuff home.

387
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:23,337
It was everywhere.
Couldn't walk around. We crawled.

388
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:27,138
We couldn't open a cupboard
without a stuffed bear falling out.

389
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,573
The ducks were the worse.
15,000 ducks.

390
00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:31,979
Ducks with cymbals for feet.

391
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:35,100
You wanted a glass in the kitchen...

392
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,214
You went for a piss...

393
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:41,223
You picked your shoes up
in the morning... Hell.

394
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,460
You know why I worked for Mickey?

395
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:48,534
Because he was good-looking.
And because scared me.

396
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:54,295
If a couple times I didn't get him
what he wanted, he'd beat me up.

397
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,703
Here, see...

398
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:00,895
That was him.

399
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,141
Didn't you know?

400
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:07,223
No.

401
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:14,016
- How?
- You want to know the details?

402
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,816
Yes.

403
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:18,299
- His method, then?
- Yes.

404
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,221
That was a car battery.

405
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:27,731
He made sure I was ready first.
What comes before is important.

406
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:32,736
First, he tied me to the bumper.

407
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,092
Then he rummaged through the boot.

408
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:38,932
He made sure it lasted a while
so I'd start sweating.

409
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:43,215
So I could think about the car jack
he'd beat me up with.

410
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:48,573
Then he came back,
like he was sorry for the wait.

411
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,739
It wasn't the jack, it was a plastic bag.

412
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:57,300
It was an jump lead with crocodile clips.
The price tag was still on it.

413
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,096
So he plugged them
into the battery and...

414
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,373
Music, maestro!

415
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:04,812
I thought I was finished.

416
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,939
What does he want?

417
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,531
- What?
- You know the other girl?

418
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,779
Do I really have to? I'm not up for it.

419
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,973
- Do what you want, just leave me alone!
- OK.

420
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,933
Leave me alone!

421
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,621
- Got it?
- Got it.

422
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,732
- I'll kill him!
- For the girl, I think I'll...

423
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,251
- I'm not really up for it.
- Fuck off!

424
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,972
You've never done it?

425
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,136
When I ask you if you've ever done it,
do you know what I mean?

426
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,820
I understand.

427
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,331
So have you done it?

428
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,853
- l don't think so.
- You haven't done it then?

429
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,372
You've never tried?
Not with a woman or with...?

430
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,132
- No. But do we have to do it?
- No one has to do anything.

431
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,971
- If we don't have to, I'd rather not...
- Whatever you want.

432
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,570
- We can still be friends though?
- What?

433
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,772
Even if I don't do it.

434
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:59,498
Doesn't matter. If you don't want to fuck,
don't. They're your balls, not mine.

435
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,691
Wedding invitations,
receptions, catwalks...

436
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,289
Whatever you like,
there are dozens more.

437
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:09,573
I saw your confectionery department,
you sell sugared almonds.

438
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:12,499
See what I mean?
Sugared almonds mean christenings.

439
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:16,216
Christenings mean invitations.
I have to make a call.

440
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:20,012
Simon Hirsch here.
You just called ms, who's this?

441
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:24,020
- Mickey's friend. The crocodile clips...
- Oh, and...

442
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:27,611
<i>A guy got done in Lyon six months ago.</i>

443
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:30,972
<i>His name's Carver, but it's Merlin
that's important, his associate.</i>

444
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,333
<i>Merlin's behind it. The killer
came from Paris. Young guy in his twenties.</i>

445
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:38,180
How do I find this Marlin?

446
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:40,451
- Got a pen?
- Yes, go ahead.

447
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,220
<i>A nightclub in Lyon, you can't miss it:
L'enchanteur.</i>

448
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:48,498
Talk to him when I'm not around.
All right, Colette?

449
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:53,251
Talk to him about anything you like,
the weather, read him the newspaper...

450
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,895
- Do you have a family?
- Two girls.

451
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:58,740
Tell him about your daughters.

452
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,658
You take the leg.

453
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:05,170
Ready? Let's go.

454
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:13,058
SIMON HIRSCH'S DREAM

455
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:15,330
<i>Is that you Simon?</i>

456
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,974
Come here. Closer.

457
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,210
Does it make you sad?

458
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:34,012
Sad?

459
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:37,931
Of course.

460
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:41,257
Why didn't you do it to me anymore?

461
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:43,769
I don't know.

462
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:47,335
You didn't want me anymore?
You weren't attracted to me anymore?

463
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:53,050
That's not it. I've always been
attracted to you. It's me.

464
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,536
It's just time passing.

465
00:37:58,447 --> 00:38:00,017
I must've forgotten.

466
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:03,017
Is it so important?

467
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,970
Of course it's important.

468
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,488
My youth is slipping away.

469
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:13,489
- I want to be attractive, to be loved.
- Do you love that arsehole?

470
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,732
- What does he want?
- He finds me attractive.

471
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,487
What about me? Do you still love me?

472
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,055
I just don't know anymore, Simon.

473
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,130
You too felt old
and needed something else.

474
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:34,411
You found Mickey.
He's young and good-looking.

475
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,689
You can tell him whatever you like.

476
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:38,855
I don't mean to hurt you,

477
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,447
but at least
he can't betray you anymore.

478
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,098
<i>Louise hadn't yet returned from work,</i>

479
00:38:58,207 --> 00:39:01,177
<i>so Simon left her a note
on the refrigerator:</i>

480
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:04,575
<i>"I'm going down south,
I'll be back in two days."</i>

481
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,655
<i>In the rear-view mirror,</i>

482
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:10,249
<i>he saw his house, then the street,
then the town disappear.</i>

483
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:15,054
<i>He thought about the hospital,
Mickey's room and the silent corridor.</i>

484
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:18,056
<i>Then he remembered
he hadn't called work.</i>

485
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,727
<i>He nearly stopped
but continued instead.</i>

486
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,974
<i>It could wait.</i>

487
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,648
There was a programme
on the telly yesterday.

488
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:35,248
It had the Iron Man
but it wasn't a series...

489
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,687
it was like a report and...

490
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:40,810
there was a journalist.

491
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,133
The journalist was interviewing
the Iron Man.

492
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:44,691
The Iron Man walked.

493
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:48,492
He was walking with his legs.
He was walking, you know, really.

494
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:52,736
- So what?
- Dunno... You don't think it's strange?

495
00:39:52,846 --> 00:39:56,373
I mean, a paralysed man
who starts walking.

496
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,409
It was an actor doing it.

497
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:03,487
Tell an actor to sit in a wheelchair,
he sits his arse in a wheelchair.

498
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:07,372
It's his job.
It's not real, it's acting.

499
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:11,536
- It's not real if he sits in a wheelchair?
- Yeah.

500
00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:14,416
We're going to Paris.

501
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:17,291
- Get in the back.
- Not me, my leg's bust.

502
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,568
Bloody hell!

503
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:25,176
They could get an actor
who bust his legs, like, in a bike crash.

504
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:28,972
Or just take any actor
and break his legs with a hammer.

505
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:32,090
Now you're just taking the piss.
You're joking.

506
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:34,730
<i>Simon Hirsh calling.</i>

507
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:39,931
<i>Can I talk to the boss? No time.
Tell him I'm on a big deal near Lyon.</i>

508
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:43,094
<i>Can you sort it out
with Blondel and Mergaux?</i>

509
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:46,254
I'll need an advance. Are you joking?

510
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:50,609
With the hotel and lunches for a week,
I'll need at least 5,000F.

511
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:54,571
Yes, 5,000 in my account.
Just search under 'H'.

512
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,495
'H' for Hirsch and 'B' for bank. HB.

513
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:00,415
'Human Bomb', yes, that's very funny.

514
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:21,576
- So what's your name then?
- Robert.

515
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:23,926
Listen, Robert, are you listening to me?

516
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:25,729
- Yes.
- "Yes, sir."

517
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:28,132
You call me sir, I'll call you Robert.

518
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:30,486
- Yes, sir.
- Mr Masked Avenger to you.

519
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:32,095
Yes, Mr Masked Avenger.

520
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:34,970
The worst is over.
You'll say anything I want.

521
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:37,975
- I'm listening.
- What are you doing?

522
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:40,929
Stretching my legs. It's tiring.

523
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,286
- Is that your family there?
- Yes.

524
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,214
- Your kids?
- Yes.

525
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:48,010
- They're cute.
- Yes.

526
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,490
Right.

527
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,814
No. Non.

528
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,336
No! No!

529
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:01,488
The name of the guy
you hired to kill Marlin?

530
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:05,575
- I'm Merlin!
- Merlin, Carver, whatever, I don't care.

531
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:08,449
All the same to me.
The young guy's name?

532
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:11,329
I don't know. I don't know.

533
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:18,092
- It wasn't a young guy.
- Want another go?

534
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,889
No! It wasn't a young guy. I swear.

535
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:24,975
It's an old guy.
His leg was bust. I swear.

536
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:57,772
I'm going shopping.
What d'you want for tonight?

537
00:42:57,884 --> 00:42:59,886
What do you want for tonight?

538
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,610
In front of the guys you say that?

539
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:06,490
Fuck me! What have I done
to land such an idiot?

540
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:09,813
First, I don't give a shit
what I eat tonight.

541
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:13,849
Second, when I'm with people,
don't ask me what I want to eat.

542
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:17,173
And third... Take that cap off.

543
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:19,809
- What do I ask then?
- Nothing.

544
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:21,334
- Why?
- Why?

545
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:24,731
- You don't understand why?
- No, I don't.

546
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:28,689
- It's embarrassing. Women ask that.
- Really?

547
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:32,046
Women, I tell you! Get it?

548
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,574
No?

549
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:37,126
You exhaust me.

550
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:42,372
Aren't you staying?

551
00:43:54,563 --> 00:43:57,373
Come quick, it's started already
on the telly.

552
00:44:01,563 --> 00:44:03,645
Careful you don't fall.

553
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:08,370
What flavour pizza is it today?

554
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:12,852
It's the Super Royale.
Mushrooms...

555
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:16,888
There's a girl going down some stairs.
She has a really long dress.

556
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:19,734
There are angels following her.
It's for perfume.

557
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:23,484
Now there's... This one is...

558
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,253
It's a girl.

559
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,809
And, um, she's... she's naked.

560
00:44:27,923 --> 00:44:33,692
She's in a field
and then there are bunnies.

561
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:35,805
So that's for yoghurt.

562
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:38,607
Are you eating your pizza?

563
00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:40,372
- No.
- Now there's...

564
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:42,723
- There's someone?
- No, the flat's empty.

565
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:45,049
Then he comes in...

566
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:49,451
He looks out the window
and there are children in the street...

567
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,405
Six children in the street.

568
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,729
There's the policeman
with the yellow feet.

569
00:45:02,842 --> 00:45:05,607
<i>What do you mean, what an I doing?
I'm working!</i>

570
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:08,373
<i>Yesterday I sold five bikes, yes, five!</i>

571
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:11,884
<i>How d'you think that happens,
by staying put?</i>

572
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:16,690
I'm getting worked up? No, I'm not.
But you're starting to piss me off!

573
00:45:16,802 --> 00:45:21,524
Receipts? What about them? it's hardly
my fault if the mail isn't doing its job.

574
00:45:21,642 --> 00:45:24,248
I need 5,000F in my account.

575
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,126
5,000.

576
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:27,732
3,000, then.

577
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:32,325
Bad weather reports...
News... News...

578
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:01,846
<i>What do killers do?</i>

579
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:05,932
<i>They travel, they kill, they move on.
They're always on the move.</i>

580
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,011
<i>They stay in hotels
and keep a low profile.</i>

581
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:12,967
<i>They stay one night, then move on.
Like travelling salesmen.</i>

582
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:18,972
The shower room keys.

583
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:21,163
Do you have local newspapers?

584
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,806
- Yes, which?
- All of them.

585
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:35,123
Mr Danata wants his dough
on Monday, understood?

586
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:38,290
Monday! You piece of shit!

587
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:47,690
Why did they do this to you?

588
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,645
- I owe them money.
- A lot?

589
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:52,126
- Three.
- Three what?

590
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:56,326
- Three too many. Leave me be.
- Here, hold this over your nose.

591
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,125
Hold this. Here.

592
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:07,283
- Here you go. This enough?
- Course it's not enough.

593
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:10,723
What'll happen to you
if you don't give them the money?

594
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:14,971
- What's going to happen to you?
- What do you think?

595
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:19,203
Piss off, then. Leave me.
I've got a headache.

596
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:21,403
Piss off.

597
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:24,809
You're getting on my nerves.
Do me a favour, go.

598
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,881
Why did you rob the pizza place?

599
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,162
- You told me...
- I told you to?

600
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,807
I told you to go rob the pizza place?
Fuck me!

601
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,729
So it's my fault?

602
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,801
If I owe money, it's my own business.
I don't need anyone to sort it out.

603
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,321
Unbelievable!

604
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,321
You can't do a hold-up in a pizza place
every time I owe cash!

605
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,442
We need to lie low.

606
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,123
- I'm sorry.
- No.

607
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,246
Don't say sorry. Don't give a shit
about anyone. Fuck 'em!

608
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,409
If you weren't so dumb,
you wouldn't need to apologise.

609
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:51,250
- Follow me, sir.
- Yes, sir, I'm coming.

610
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,648
- What are they going to do to me?
- Nothing. What can they do?

611
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:00,400
Do you know if the pizza restaurant
owner pressed charges? Yes?

612
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,123
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

613
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,283
What's pizza arsehole's name?

614
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,121
What about Danata's cash?

615
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:41,162
I don't know, I'll improvise.

616
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:44,688
- Or we could also kill.
- What?

617
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:48,246
- We could kill you!
- Now, that's a really great idea!

618
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,920
That way, your boss can definitely
say goodbye to his cash.

619
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:54,565
- Got a better idea?
- Give me work.

620
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:59,526
Your boss takes his cash
out of my salary, than were sorted.

621
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,166
Oh, yeah?
And what can you do, arsehole?

622
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:06,522
Pretty much the same as you, twat.

623
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:09,483
I'm gonna be the guy now. Scare me.

624
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:12,727
Look at me. Hey, look at me!

625
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:15,159
Stop eating!

626
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:19,249
Look at me and make me shit my pants.
Come on!

627
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:20,803
Go on.

628
00:50:25,878 --> 00:50:27,323
What's that?

629
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:31,443
I said scare me, not be a clown.
Say stuff to me.

630
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:34,767
- What sort of stuff?
- Violent stuff.

631
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,289
Fucking hell.

632
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:40,119
Give me back my dough,
give it back!

633
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:45,802
Or I'll fuck you up,
I'll make confetti with your little head.

634
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:50,207
- Go on. Tell me! Say it.
- Give us back the dough.

635
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:52,639
- We'll kill you!
- Look at me.

636
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:57,605
I'll fuck you up. I want my dough.
What d'you mean never? Give it back!

637
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,766
- Stop.
- Can you believe that guy?

638
00:50:59,878 --> 00:51:02,529
Stop it. Now hit me.

639
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:05,118
Go on, hit me! Go on, do it.

640
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:09,527
Come on, hit me. Hit! Come on!

641
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:12,323
Stop it, I'm not going to hit you.

642
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,800
Stop it, I'm not going to hit you, Marx.
Why would I?

643
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:19,079
Who are you?

644
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:21,678
- Know why we're here?
- What do you want?

645
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,767
- I did nothing wrong.
- The date?

646
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:28,599
- I don't know you.
- What's the date today? The...the...?

647
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,800
- The twelfth.
- The twelfth, that's right!

648
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:33,124
When were you supposed
to pay Mr Danata back?

649
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:35,046
I don't have the money.

650
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,568
- You don't?
- No.

651
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,839
You'll cough up for my friend!

652
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,167
- You don't wanna pay?
- But...

653
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:43,678
You'll regret this.
My friend isn't like me.

654
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:47,961
- I'm the nice guy. Wait till you see him.
- My wife is sick...

655
00:51:48,077 --> 00:51:51,968
Fuck your wife!
You asked for it, I'm calling my friend!

656
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:53,841
You asked for it! Johnny!

657
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:57,643
You have to pay now, please, sir.

658
00:51:57,757 --> 00:52:00,044
You have to pay!

659
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,323
No?

660
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:17,764
Let me handle it. Just watch.

661
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:19,845
Stop eating!

662
00:52:19,957 --> 00:52:22,927
When I signal to you, you got in there

663
00:52:23,037 --> 00:52:25,483
- What's the signal?
- l dunno, something like this...

664
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:26,917
A young man
and an older one with a cane.

665
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,243
I remember
because of the tatty suitcase.

666
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:32,087
They asked me to bin it
but I forgot.

667
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:37,405
The young guy stayed inside all day
watching television.

668
00:53:37,516 --> 00:53:39,086
- Did he say anything?
- No.

669
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:42,120
- How long did they stay?
- One night.

670
00:53:42,236 --> 00:53:44,079
- Could I see the suitcase?
- Sure.

671
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:46,927
- Martine, 108, please!
- I'm coming.

672
00:53:47,036 --> 00:53:49,960
- Will you be wanting the room?
- Yes.

673
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:09,679
- Is the bathroom through there?
- Yes.

674
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:11,718
You don't have to, you know.

675
00:55:11,835 --> 00:55:15,681
- Take a shower if you like.
- Whatever you like.

676
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,476
What do you want to do?

677
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:28,562
What do you want to do then?

678
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:30,484
Not in the mood?

679
00:55:36,754 --> 00:55:38,961
Can I smoke?

680
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:47,756
- I'd like to know what it's like.
- What?

681
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:52,836
What it's like...

682
00:55:54,234 --> 00:55:55,998
...between guys.

683
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:59,354
Not what you think...

684
00:55:59,474 --> 00:56:03,160
I mean, what it's like in everyday life.

685
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:06,082
Feelings, all that.

686
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:10,595
You live with someone?

687
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:13,485
Yes.

688
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:16,242
What's his name?

689
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,675
- I don't want to tell you that.
- Stay.

690
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,876
If you don't want to answer, don't.

691
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:28,558
His name's Marc.

692
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,676
Have you known him long?

693
00:56:30,794 --> 00:56:33,843
A little while. Two years.

694
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:35,285
And...

695
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:42,314
How do you live? The two of you?
See him every evening after work?

696
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:46,924
Well, yes.
Except when I'm working nights.

697
00:56:47,034 --> 00:56:51,403
And when you see each other,
what do you do?

698
00:56:51,514 --> 00:56:54,120
I don't know,
the same as everyone else.

699
00:56:55,674 --> 00:56:58,837
We talk, have a bite to eat,
watch telly.

700
00:56:58,953 --> 00:57:01,604
- Do you eat at home?
- Yes, sometimes.

701
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,920
- Is he the one who cooks?
- No.

702
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:06,479
No, I do. He's useless at cooking.

703
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,679
When you come home
in the evening...

704
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:16,762
What d'you do?
D'you open the door and... call him?

705
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:21,164
No need, he recognises me.

706
00:57:21,273 --> 00:57:26,643
When he's in our room or the bathroom,
he asks. I don't answer and he knows.

707
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:31,835
- Is he jealous?
- No, he's not, really.

708
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:34,876
But I am. Loads.

709
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:39,874
I hate people looking at him,
people talking to him.

710
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:42,519
I know I shouldn't, I can't help It.

711
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:45,681
Does he know what you do?

712
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:49,802
- No, not really.
- So you lie to him?

713
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:54,801
A little bit.

714
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:56,756
Aren't you scared?

715
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:02,918
Yes, I am. All the time.

716
00:58:06,393 --> 00:58:08,432
Hello, Garches Hospital, please.

717
00:58:08,993 --> 00:58:12,395
Can you please put me through
to the 'deep coma' wing.

718
00:58:12,513 --> 00:58:15,960
I'd like to speak to Colette,
the on-call nurse.

719
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:19,122
Hello, this is Mr Hirsch.

720
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:21,998
I'm down south.

721
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,319
I'm calling to see how he is.

722
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:28,199
It's stable.

723
00:58:28,312 --> 00:58:30,553
Could be worse, I suppose.

724
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:32,595
Have you been talking to him?

725
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:37,283
My car!

726
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:40,803
Shit!

727
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:45,482
Shit...

728
00:58:56,072 --> 00:58:58,200
- Want to press charges?
- Sorry?

729
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:00,474
Do you want to press charges, sir?

730
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:03,163
No. No, I won't press charges.

731
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:15,397
<i>Hirsch here,
put me through to the boss.</i>

732
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:19,119
<i>Don't know what it's like at your end
but it's mad down here.</i>

733
00:59:19,232 --> 00:59:25,399
<i>They're fighting for the bikes.
I'm selling ten a day. I'm snowed under.</i>

734
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:29,073
<i>In fact, I need another advance.</i>

735
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:32,355
<i>What do you mean, fired?
What are you talking about?</i>

736
00:59:32,472 --> 00:59:36,477
<i>Wait! Wait! A grand. Just a grand.</i>

737
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:41,481
Who else?

738
00:59:41,592 --> 00:59:45,233
No, I don't know him
but I've heard of him.

739
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:48,082
Get straight back on it?
Yes, of course.

740
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,680
None? That's a pain.

741
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,715
All right, none.

742
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,321
There's some missing, Marx.

743
00:59:57,431 --> 01:00:00,321
- Yes, OK. It is...
- There's some missing.

744
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,921
It's... OK.

745
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,715
- What?
- There's some missing.

746
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:06,562
Why the fuck are you telling me this?
What am I gonna do about it?

747
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:08,833
You handle the cash.

748
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:12,000
If you don't pay attention,
it's your problem.

749
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:14,239
- What are you doing?
- Guess.

750
01:00:14,351 --> 01:00:16,831
- You're going out.
- Got a problem with that?

751
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:19,431
- No.
- So carry on, then.

752
01:00:30,871 --> 01:00:33,715
- No.
- Me neither.

753
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,117
- So what am I gonna tell Danata?
- Dunno...

754
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:45,599
- Can't he wait a bit longer?
- So you'll lose everything again?

755
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:49,477
The kid and I keep working
and he keeps everything this time.

756
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:52,595
That was before. It won't work this time.

757
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:56,193
- What am I gonna tell him then?
- I don't know!

758
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:01,201
We could fix it
if you'll make yourself useful.

759
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,882
You want to make yourself useful?

760
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:06,761
Depends.

761
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,838
What would I have to do?

762
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,121
- Finish this guy off.
- What?

763
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,675
Finish him off. Bam!

764
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,236
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

765
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:26,321
We give you the address, you shoot
and your debt with Danata's erased.

766
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,431
Plus extra.

767
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,634
- All right?
- Yes.

768
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,358
- What are they doing here?
- We're just talking. Go to bed.

769
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,633
- You all right?
- I said I'm fine. I'm fine.

770
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:58,752
- So?
- No, I can't.

771
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,032
So you won't help Danata?

772
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,834
Not like that.

773
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,921
- You're out of options.
- Not that, not that.

774
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,078
- What shall I say?
- l dunno.

775
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,637
That's your job!
I don't give a shit!

776
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,752
Fuck off!

777
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:19,356
Go on. Go on, shoot!

778
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,837
Marx, what's going on?
What's going on?

779
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,679
What are you waiting for?

780
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,590
Let him go! Let him go!

781
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,395
- Right-handed or left-handed?
- He doesn't know what it's about.

782
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:34,116
- If you don't answer, I'll break both.
- Don't answer.

783
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:35,719
Please, don't!

784
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:45,992
There now, it's all over.

785
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,111
It's my fault.

786
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:50,120
My hand...

787
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:59,429
- Is it about the money?
- That's not all.

788
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:05,152
They want to force me
to do something.

789
01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:08,352
- So why did they hurt me?
- To force me.

790
01:03:08,469 --> 01:03:10,870
They know you're my mate.

791
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:13,230
- "My mate"
- So?

792
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:16,193
- You said "mate".
- What d'you want me to say?

793
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:18,391
I don't know, but...

794
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:21,240
What do they want you to do?

795
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:24,478
Imagine shooting something like that.

796
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,114
It's like darts.

797
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:28,675
Lift, aim and...

798
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:31,076
What are you talking about?

799
01:03:31,189 --> 01:03:33,590
Do you realise what you're saying?

800
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:37,680
Darts?
What the hell? Think it's a game?

801
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:41,475
Think you'll win some bubbly at the end?
Put that down!

802
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:47,914
Ware talking about killing a guy.
Giving him one with that.

803
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:52,318
A human being. Do you understand
that? Get that into your tiny brain.

804
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:57,559
I understand that. I also know
what will happen if you don't do it.

805
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,477
So what?

806
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:05,515
If you don't want to do it, I can...

807
01:04:06,828 --> 01:04:09,832
If you don't want to do it, I will.

808
01:04:11,028 --> 01:04:12,951
I don't mind doing it.

809
01:04:54,868 --> 01:04:57,917
How oleaginous,
France aligns itself with the rest.

810
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:01,475
No picture.

811
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:05,274
Yugoslavia.
it's kicking off on all fronts.

812
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:10,554
There's a picture of kids
playing ball in a bunker.

813
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:13,877
Stock market: up 0.31%.

814
01:05:13,987 --> 01:05:16,388
No picture. The classifieds...

815
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,875
- Interested in what I'm talking about?
- Not really.

816
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:26,591
Want a fight? Eh?

817
01:05:26,707 --> 01:05:30,393
We can go outside and have a fist fight.
A proper brawl.

818
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:33,556
Come on, now. Be a sport.

819
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:35,556
Can I?

820
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:46,434
Quickly though, my kid's on his own.

821
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:23,398
Daddy? Daddy, is that you?

822
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:27,078
What you doing here?

823
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:29,189
Recognise me? It's Sandrine.

824
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:32,916
That's enough now!

825
01:06:38,506 --> 01:06:39,951
Look at me!

826
01:06:42,546 --> 01:06:45,550
I'm tired. I'm tired...

827
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:48,907
It's going to be fine.

828
01:06:49,026 --> 01:06:51,506
Come on, I'll take you home.

829
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:53,867
The lift is on the right.

830
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:56,114
Eighth floor, left out of the lift.

831
01:06:56,226 --> 01:06:58,388
- So...
- What's the guy's name?

832
01:06:58,506 --> 01:07:00,827
Who cares? Don't worry about that.

833
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:02,835
Anyway you can't go wrong...

834
01:07:02,946 --> 01:07:06,428
there's a doormat with his initials
in front of the door.

835
01:07:06,546 --> 01:07:09,470
- What are his initials?
- That doesn't matter.

836
01:07:09,586 --> 01:07:11,554
So you arrive with your helmet on.

837
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,987
- Come out the lift...
- What helmet?

838
01:07:14,106 --> 01:07:16,393
A bike helmet like all delivery boys.

839
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:18,554
He's expecting flowers,
you bring them.

840
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:21,670
- So you wear a helmet, that's the plan.
- Fine.

841
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:23,675
- You ring the doorbell.
- l ring...

842
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:27,313
He looks through the peephole.
You look normal, you...

843
01:07:27,426 --> 01:07:30,077
- Look at the initialled mat.
- Whatever... Don't panic.

844
01:07:30,186 --> 01:07:31,950
I won't panic.

845
01:07:32,066 --> 01:07:34,751
If he asks you,
you say flower delivery.

846
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:37,551
- All right? So say it.
- What?

847
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:40,715
"Flower delivery."
Louder. He can't hear you.

848
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:42,396
- Flower delivery.
- Louder.

849
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:44,634
- Flower delivery.
- What?

850
01:07:44,746 --> 01:07:46,396
- Lift?
- Right.

851
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:48,076
- Floor?
- Eighth.

852
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:49,347
- Flat?
- On the left.

853
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,195
- What is it?
- Flower delivery!

854
01:07:51,306 --> 01:07:53,513
- Louder!
- Flower delivery!

855
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:57,028
- What is it?
- I'll scare him if I shout so loud.

856
01:07:57,146 --> 01:07:58,955
Never you mind. Go on.

857
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:03,753
I'll wait out front.

858
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:13,192
- What?
- I forgot the gun.

859
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,115
What is it?

860
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,075
Flower delivery.

861
01:08:50,905 --> 01:08:52,589
What is it?

862
01:08:52,705 --> 01:08:54,230
Flower delivery, sir.

863
01:08:55,785 --> 01:08:57,275
Flower delivery.

864
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,630
So?

865
01:09:09,665 --> 01:09:11,076
So?

866
01:09:12,345 --> 01:09:14,347
Well, I killed him...

867
01:09:15,265 --> 01:09:16,676
Shit...

868
01:09:18,985 --> 01:09:22,467
- Shit, blood...
- It's not my blood. it's not my blood.

869
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,074
It squirted.

870
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:45,912
- It'll fit.
- Too tight?

871
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:47,435
No, it's fine.

872
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:52,308
This one's fine too.

873
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:01,389
Jeanne?
Jeanne, where are you?

874
01:10:03,505 --> 01:10:05,826
Want me to leave you alone?

875
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:11,030
- Have you called mum?
- No.

876
01:10:13,345 --> 01:10:15,347
Want me to do it?

877
01:10:46,103 --> 01:10:48,868
You taking all that old stuff back out?

878
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:51,668
We're going out for a walk.
Fifteen minutes.

879
01:10:51,783 --> 01:10:53,785
- Watch Jeanne for us?
- Sure.

880
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:58,584
- Need anything?
- No, thanks.

881
01:11:53,264 --> 01:11:56,427
Mr Marx, someone's waiting
for you downstairs.

882
01:11:58,624 --> 01:12:00,274
Excuse me.

883
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:05,827
You wanted to talk to ma?

884
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:09,151
- How are you?
- Fine.

885
01:12:09,263 --> 01:12:10,992
- A drink?
- No.

886
01:12:11,103 --> 01:12:14,391
- What is it?
- I'm here on behalf of Mr Calvin.

887
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:16,504
He knows about what you do.

888
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:22,784
Jo the Greek in Marseilles,
Carver in Lyon, the brothers Attoun.

889
01:12:22,902 --> 01:12:26,190
L'Alsaco, Francis le Begue in Grenoble.
Shall I go on?

890
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:31,750
I don't know you.

891
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:34,308
I don't know you're... Calvin, is that right?

892
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:41,311
I don't understand what you're saying
and even if I did, I only work for Danata.

893
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,425
It's about him, precisely.

894
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:47,828
Really?

895
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:57,032
Mr Calvin doesn't want
Mr Danata around anymore.

896
01:13:27,582 --> 01:13:29,664
Looking for someone?

897
01:13:31,182 --> 01:13:35,426
I'm looking for two guys
who lived here about a year ago.

898
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:39,786
- Are you still looking at the postcards?
- Yes.

899
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:43,384
Every time he left,
he sent me a postcard.

900
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,153
The baker read them to me.

901
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:49,470
He was always talking about Marx.
I hardly knew him.

902
01:13:49,582 --> 01:13:53,667
He was always saying
Marx this, Marx that...

903
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:56,625
- There it is. It's open.
- Marx did this...

904
01:13:56,741 --> 01:14:00,791
<i>The last postcard the old lady
had received was from a city</i>

905
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:03,381
<i>flanked with its casino,
like a big meringue.</i>

906
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:07,473
<i>Simon turned it over,
and in a childlike scrawl it said:</i>

907
01:14:07,582 --> 01:14:10,108
<i>"I am well. I hope you are too.</i>

908
01:14:10,222 --> 01:14:14,147
<i>The weather is nice. Marx says hello.
All the best, Johnny."</i>

909
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:18,391
it's raining, an old guy is
watching them from a window.

910
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:21,072
He rests his brow against the window.

911
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:23,713
He's thinking.

912
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:35,271
<i>-Someone's at the door, Mr. Danata.
- I'll get it.</i>

913
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:39,629
<i>-I said, I'll go.
- Very well, sir.</i>

914
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:43,189
<i>Leave me for an hour.
If the phone rings, don't answer.</i>

915
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:37,189
I said right. Why are you going left?
Know where your right is?

916
01:16:37,299 --> 01:16:39,745
Your left hand. Know which one it is?

917
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:41,429
- It doesn't matter.
- Shit.

918
01:16:41,539 --> 01:16:44,588
- I'll turn down there
- We've been here ten times already!

919
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,384
Are you in a bad mood?

920
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:50,909
Is it because they haven't called?

921
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:57,341
- Have they called?
- No, they haven't!

922
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:04,581
You think we'll lose the job?

923
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,943
You call that work?
Afraid of unemployment?

924
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,427
Will you bloody well overtake?

925
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,582
Go on, he's signalling to you.

926
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,662
What an arsehole!

927
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,824
Arsehole!

928
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:04,707
You're good.

929
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:09,907
That's extra.

930
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:19,142
Peanut?

931
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:26,585
You're not very talkative, are you?

932
01:19:37,057 --> 01:19:39,059
Where are you headed?

933
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:44,978
- I have to go, things to do.
- That's OK. We'll go together.

934
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:49,107
- I can't.
- You have time, don't you? On holiday?

935
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,868
- No, not holidays.
- You here on business?

936
01:19:51,978 --> 01:19:53,980
- No, a holiday...
- Like me.

937
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:55,542
Let's grab a bite.

938
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:57,581
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

939
01:19:57,697 --> 01:20:00,143
Is it the conversation
you're worried about?

940
01:20:00,257 --> 01:20:02,419
I can take care of that.

941
01:20:02,538 --> 01:20:05,144
I can ask the questions
and answer them.

942
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,738
My friends say I'm gifted
at making conversation.

943
01:20:07,857 --> 01:20:10,906
Even my wife.
That's what she misses the most.

944
01:20:11,018 --> 01:20:15,580
It's just a thought, why don't we walk
a while? Eh? A walk?

945
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:20,024
Walking's not difficult.
Put one foot in front of the other

946
01:20:20,137 --> 01:20:23,186
One, two. One, two.

947
01:20:25,216 --> 01:20:26,661
One.

948
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:32,186
Staying here long?

949
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:34,467
Depends.

950
01:20:59,097 --> 01:21:00,508
You in?

951
01:21:04,377 --> 01:21:05,822
You in?

952
01:23:01,656 --> 01:23:03,863
What have you been up to?

953
01:23:03,975 --> 01:23:05,420
Nothing.

954
01:23:08,695 --> 01:23:12,177
- Went for a little wander?
- Yeah.

955
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:14,866
- You had a good time?
- Not bad.

956
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:19,145
- You didn't meet anyone unpleasant?
- No.

957
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:21,986
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

958
01:23:23,214 --> 01:23:26,218
- You didn't meet anyone?
- No.

959
01:23:28,014 --> 01:23:30,221
- You didn't talk to anyone?
- No.

960
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:34,776
Look at me!

961
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:39,863
I'm looking at you.

962
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,580
You didn't open your big mouth?

963
01:23:56,295 --> 01:23:59,742
- You want to fuck it up for us?
- No.

964
01:24:06,414 --> 01:24:08,576
Don't do this. I didn't do anything.

965
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:11,539
Who was that arsehole?

966
01:24:13,054 --> 01:24:15,421
- Stop! No!
- What did he tell you?

967
01:24:15,534 --> 01:24:20,176
And what were you telling him
with all that crap inside your brain?

968
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,096
All right?

969
01:24:51,373 --> 01:24:52,659
All right?

970
01:24:56,054 --> 01:25:00,662
I'm sorry...
I don't know what got into me.

971
01:25:04,374 --> 01:25:08,379
It drove me crazy to see you
with that guy. I'm sorry.

972
01:25:08,493 --> 01:25:10,416
I'm sorry.

973
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,060
For everything.
For this. For everything.

974
01:25:28,173 --> 01:25:30,221
I don't understand why you stay.

975
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:32,700
Sleep.

976
01:25:32,813 --> 01:25:34,941
They should've shot me.

977
01:25:35,053 --> 01:25:37,260
It would have been better for you.

978
01:25:37,373 --> 01:25:39,182
For me too.

979
01:25:42,534 --> 01:25:44,218
I love you, Marx.

980
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:47,577
Don't say that.

981
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:50,013
You don't know
what you're talking about.

982
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:55,814
I love you. I know.

983
01:25:57,493 --> 01:25:59,018
I love you too.

984
01:26:08,412 --> 01:26:12,133
Marx... can I sleep next to you?

985
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:13,936
If you want to, kid.

986
01:27:35,812 --> 01:27:37,701
You all right?

987
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:39,894
I'm all right.

988
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:58,420
What about the kid?

989
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:01,454
Don't worry, he's here.
I'll take care of him.

990
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:03,254
He's mine now.

991
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:13,494
I don't want to die. I'm scared.

992
01:30:16,089 --> 01:30:17,534
I know.

993
01:30:23,049 --> 01:30:24,619
Right.

994
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:27,778
The shows over for you now.
Time to go.

995
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:31,334
No point in hanging about.

996
01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:33,451
Time's up.

997
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:35,975
Sleep.

998
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,501
Stay still.

999
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:40,458
This one's better than the other one.
That one's...

1000
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:41,568
crap.

1001
01:32:45,367 --> 01:32:47,369
You coming? it's ready.

1002
01:32:50,848 --> 01:32:52,418
Want some wine?

1003
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:54,530
- Any Coke?
- In the fridge.

1004
01:32:55,808 --> 01:32:59,051
- By the way, is Johnny your real name?
- No.

1005
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:02,372
<i>- What's your real name?
- "Frédéric," said the young man.</i>

1006
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:04,489
<i>"I hate it. I hate Freddo too.</i>

1007
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:08,294
<i>Sounds like a dog's name." "And you
think Johnny's better?" asked Simon.</i>

1008
01:33:08,407 --> 01:33:11,297
<i>The young man just shrugged
and finished his glass.</i>

1009
01:33:11,408 --> 01:33:14,139
<i>Later, Simon felt a hand
on his shoulder.</i>

1010
01:33:14,247 --> 01:33:17,251
<i>"Are you asleep?"
It was the young man.</i>

1011
01:33:17,367 --> 01:33:19,938
<i>"Can I sleep next to you?"</i>

1012
01:33:20,048 --> 01:33:23,052
<i>"If you want, kid," said Simon,
and moved up.</i>
