1
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,878
I love you,

2
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,747
and I have a condom.

3
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,486
- Matt, I shouldn't be here.
- Come on, Anna.

4
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,423
- No. No.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

5
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,620
I really shouldn't be here.

6
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,289
Anna. Come on.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,695
I'm at a party,

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,805
but all I want to do is get home.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,245
Hey, where you going? Anna?

10
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,891
Don't go home.

11
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,670
And then I hear my mother's bell.

12
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,804
I go to find her.

13
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,645
When she got sick,
we moved her into the boathouse.

14
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,114
It's where she wanted to be.

15
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,289
She's alone.

16
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,018
She's not supposed to be alone.

17
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,566
Anna.

18
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,467
I run up to the house to find my dad.

19
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,116
There's something wrong.

20
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,352
It doesn't feel safe.

21
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,025
There's something evil in the house.

22
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,475
One way or another,
these dreams seem to be

23
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,175
about trying to get out of the woods
and back home.

24
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,512
Yeah.

25
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:50,522
And when I get there, it's like
Mom's trying to tell me something.

26
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,424
But I can't understand what it is,
what she's trying to say.

27
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,860
Well, we've talked about
the little redheaded girl,

28
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,228
but now there's a new detail,
the watering can.

29
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,200
Why do you think you were holding it?

30
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,461
I don't know.

31
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,038
I really don't remember.

32
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,908
Maybe you were trying
to put out the fire.

33
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:23,717
When my mom first got sick,
she said that she'd always be there.

34
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,722
Could be a stray cat,
or just the sound of the wind,

35
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,821
but it would always be her.
She'd always protect us, you know.

36
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,626
But...

37
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,034
But the night of the fire,
I couldn't protect her.

38
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,633
Smart girl.

39
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,670
If I'm so smart, why can't I remember
what happened that night?

40
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,852
Okay. Here's what I think.

41
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:02,425
We survive by remembering,
but sometimes we survive by forgetting.

42
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,888
You lost your mother in a tragic fire.

43
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:10,595
Your life was changed forever by,
what, a broken fuel valve?

44
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,036
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing to forget.

45
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,097
- But what about the dream?
- It's a dream.

46
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,200
You'll figure it out, or you won't.
That's how it all works.

47
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,336
It's a process, Anna.

48
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,907
What's it been? Ten months?
And you're almost finished.

49
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,283
But you're not gonna get there
in a place like this.

50
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,683
- Do you think I'm ready to leave?
- What else do you want from me?

51
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,393
Go home. Kiss a boy, get into trouble.

52
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,169
Finish what you started.

53
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,081
Hi.

54
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,025
One minute.

55
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,127
Pretty little Anna.
Going home, sweet home.

56
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,726
I'll be lonely.

57
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,769
I really gotta go.

58
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,075
There was so much blood,
wasn't there, Anna?

59
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,106
Do you really think they fixed you?

60
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,738
Come on, honey.
Let the girl pack her things.

61
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,215
What have we told you about
wandering in here all the time?

62
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,081
They couldn't fix me.

63
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,756
Who will I tell my stories to?

64
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,155
I've got a surprise for you.

65
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,222
- Look in the glove compartment.
- Tell me it's a cheeseburger.

66
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,698
Not quite.

67
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,695
- You finished it.
- Yeah. Look inside.

68
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,874
- Thank you, Dad.
- You're very welcome.

69
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,810
Is it any good?

70
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,819
Well, I don't know,
but I'm sure you'll tell me.

71
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,421
I know something that's good.

72
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,754
Oh, awesome. Thank you.

73
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,256
Yeah, Rachel made them.

74
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,069
She was gonna come today,
but I told her I wanted you all to myself.

75
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,162
She's been great, Anna.
Really, she has been.

76
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,265
I don't know what I would've...

77
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,935
- Dad. You got me to yourself.
- ... done without her.

78
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,698
Alex?

79
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,853
Anna. You're back.

80
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,260
You're early. I'd hug you, but I...
Welcome home.

81
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,860
You look great. You look so skinny.

82
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,498
I think I could use some time
at that place.

83
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,373
My first order of business
is fattening her up.

84
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,378
I've already started with him.

85
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,874
Yeah, she's been cooking all day.

86
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,386
- Making... Oh, what are you making?
- Beef Stroganoff. Your favorite.

87
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,751
So, you have a house
full of women now, Mr. Writer.

88
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,387
- Did your dad tell you my idea?
- No.

89
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,021
About the party.

90
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,793
We thought we could throw you
a "Welcome Home, Anna" bash.

91
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,266
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

92
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,303
Well, everybody's
been asking about you.

93
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,430
- We've got all summer. There's no rush.
- No.

94
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,769
Okay, I'm gonna go down to the water.

95
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,445
I blew it.

96
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,101
Anna.

97
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,769
Just like it never happened, huh?

98
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,939
Alex. Oh, I missed you so much.

99
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,954
So, what do you think?

100
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,790
You know, he had them
working weekends

101
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,588
so it'd be finished
by the time you got back.

102
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,855
Welcome to your new ward.

103
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,194
Better food, crazier people.

104
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,170
- When did she move in?
- Guess.

105
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,040
First, she was helping
with the accident inquiry,

106
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,134
and then she was helping
with the funeral.

107
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,681
Now, she's helping him cope.
Three times a night.

108
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,979
Whatever.

109
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,683
Hey, thanks a lot, by the way.

110
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,147
For what?

111
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,520
- Deserting me.
- Alex!

112
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,221
You know, I was stuck here
with those two

113
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,491
while you went off
searching for your inner psycho.

114
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,294
Alex, you don't know
what it was like in there.

115
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,426
She was my mother, too.

116
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,433
You know, you could've at least
written me back.

117
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,701
What are you talking about?

118
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,800
The playlists I made you,
the letters I wrote.

119
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,471
I didn't get anything, Alex. I swear.

120
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,042
Maybe Dr. Silberling
didn't want me to see them.

121
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,885
No, it wasn't Dr. Silberling.

122
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,946
Oh, he's such an asshole!

123
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,288
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

124
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,159
Those were my letters, Dad.

125
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,860
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell her
about your new little girlfriend?

126
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,837
Was that it?
T alk about all the dirty little secrets?

127
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,140
And it was a mistake for you
to move her in here,

128
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,644
and our whole stupid town
just loves talking about it.

129
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,978
You disgust me.

130
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,951
- Alex, where are you going?
- As if anybody cares.

131
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,869
You caught me.

132
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,143
Come here. You can hug me now.
I'm clean.

133
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,688
Listen, Anna, I know the rules state

134
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,590
that you're supposed to hate
Dad's new girlfriend,

135
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,061
but I'm really hoping that
we can be more original than that

136
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,063
and make this work.

137
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,266
- Sure.
- Yeah.

138
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,831
- Something's different.
- Oh, yeah, we painted.

139
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,309
I really love all the wallpaper
in the house,

140
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,142
but the kitchen just needed
some brightening up.

141
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,738
There used to be something here.

142
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,808
- Did there?
- Yeah, a chalkboard?

143
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,150
Oh, yeah, the chalkboard.

144
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,282
It must be up in the attic
with all the other old stuff.

145
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,293
I think I figured
we didn't need one anymore.

146
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,622
So, what do you think?
Do you wanna help set the table?

147
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,498
No, I'm okay.
I'm not really hungry anyway.

148
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,443
Alex?

149
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,837
What are you doing?

150
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:20,115
So, was that you or Nursie
in the throes of ecstasy?

151
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,619
- I don't know.
- Okay.

152
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,787
You drunk?

153
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,825
Well, I went to a party
and drinks were served.

154
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,396
- Where did you find that?
- Upstairs.

155
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,991
What the hell are you doing with it?

156
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:42,063
- I don't know. It was in the attic and...
- Okay. Well, that's where it should stay.

157
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,205
- I hate that bell.
- Why?

158
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,611
It reminds me of Mom.

159
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,438
We needed it, Alex.

160
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,643
That's how she'd call for help
after she got sick.

161
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,211
Anna, wake up. Rachel bought the bell.

162
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:58,980
What are you saying?

163
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,457
She went into a goddamn pet store,
bought a bell,

164
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,154
came home,
and tied it around Mom's wrist.

165
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,499
And do you know why?

166
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,971
So that she could hear Mom coming
while she was busy riding Dad.

167
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,100
- You're making that up.
- Okay. Why would I do that?

168
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,200
To get back at Dad.

169
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,441
Trust me, Anna,
I'm way past getting back at Dad.

170
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:29,681
You know, I might be drunk,
but at least I know what the truth is.

171
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,624
Oh, here comes the burrito.

172
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,937
Maybe try a sledgehammer next time.

173
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,745
- Sorry.
- Looks good to me.

174
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,977
Great, actually.
Just what our little kitchen needed.

175
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,277
Isn't it, though?

176
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,454
- I'm out of here.
- Cool.

177
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:11,462
You know, Anna, I remember when
I first came here to look after your mom.

178
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,095
I showed up at the house,

179
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,465
and Alex was doing
her bitchy teenager thing,

180
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,595
disrespecting your father.

181
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,072
But you were different.

182
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:28,337
Quiet, you know? Polite.
A proper little lady.

183
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,280
I remember thinking,

184
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:37,016
"Still waters run deep in this one.
She's the strong one. "

185
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,291
When I was your age,

186
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:48,322
I had to deal with some rough things,
like you, and I learned to be strong.

187
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,000
To be a girl nobody fucked with.

188
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,302
I am so glad to have you back.

189
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,435
I hope it works out so you can stay.

190
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,410
Thanks. I intend to.

191
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,318
Did you see her face?

192
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,822
It was like
you totally jacked her Barbie kitchen.

193
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,949
I was swinging the hammer
with my eyes closed.

194
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,117
That is so awesome.

195
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,161
It's our chalkboard. It should be there.

196
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,787
Remember Mom
would leave messages on it?

197
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,888
Soccer practices.

198
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,934
Oh, but her handwriting was so bad.

199
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,929
Pinkie pact?

200
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,672
Am I, like, really pale?

201
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,808
Yeah, you're pretty much,
like, see-through.

202
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,552
Well, hopefully your future husband
won't notice.

203
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,761
No, you are not leaving me here.

204
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,198
- What are sisters for?
- Alex, don't you dare!

205
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,182
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

206
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,318
- So how you been?
- Yeah. Okay.

207
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,021
You know, I really wanted to visit you
up there, but they wouldn't let me.

208
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,361
Well, you should've slit your wrists, too.
We could've been roommates.

209
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,794
She's back.

210
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,362
- So, listen, that night at the beach...
- No, no. Listen...

211
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,034
I was nervous, okay?
So I drank a bunch,

212
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,600
and no one has ever accused me
of being smart,

213
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,341
so I was dumb and drunk.

214
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,346
But I was worried about you.

215
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,682
I even went looking for you.

216
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,685
What do you mean?

217
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,621
I followed you home that night, Anna.

218
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,488
I was here. I saw everything.

219
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,592
Running a little late, aren't you, Matt?

220
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,076
- Thanks. That's all we need.
- Okay.

221
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,905
- I'll just... I'll see you around.
- Bye.

222
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,329
Why don't you bring these supplies
up to the generator room?

223
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,922
And then come up.
Your father's starved.

224
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,067
- Your agent called today.
- Really?

225
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,872
Yeah. I didn't know
he rents a house up here.

226
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,038
Yeah, the last five years.

227
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,240
He likes to pretend to fish.

228
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,181
I think he has the editor of
The Book Review as a houseguest.

229
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,880
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,287
So, I invited them for dinner
on Friday night.

231
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,817
- Really?
- Along with a few other people.

232
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,659
- Well, why not?
- Well...

233
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:44,259
We never have anyone to the house.
It'll be fun.

234
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,166
Please.

235
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,797
- Okay.
- Okay.

236
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,377
Murderer!

237
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,689
Murderer!

238
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,757
Anna?

239
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,164
What are you doing down here?

240
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,305
Hey. Are you okay?

241
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,074
It was Mom.

242
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,109
- What?
- I saw Mom!

243
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,411
What are you talking about?

244
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,779
Anna?

245
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,585
Anna!

246
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,583
She's been trying to tell me something.

247
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:59,689
- What?
- The fire wasn't an accident.

248
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,426
It was her.

249
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,051
Rachel just happened to
have the night off.

250
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,645
Yeah, right.

251
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,320
- Alex...
- No, it all makes sense now.

252
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,454
She left Mom,
parked her car down the street,

253
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,225
put on those little white shoes,

254
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,132
and walked back down
to the boathouse.

255
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,797
- Maybe we're jumping to conclusions.
- Excuse me,

256
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,271
I'm not the one that
saw our dead mother

257
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,332
point the finger
at Dad's creepy girlfriend.

258
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,345
Yeah, I think it was just a dream.

259
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,404
Anna, you were wide awake. I saw you.

260
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,541
Well, maybe it was all in my head.

261
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,051
Maybe so.

262
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,644
But it doesn't change
what both of us know.

263
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:01,555
That tap didn't leak. Rachel turned it on.

264
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,891
She killed Mom,
and she's not gonna get away with it.

265
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,089
Hello? Hello in there?

266
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,198
- Did she hear us?
- I don't know.

267
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,465
Listen, I'm going into town
to do some shopping for this party.

268
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,130
Would you like to come?

269
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,107
Have some retail therapy,
maybe grab lunch?

270
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,112
I'm totally hung over
and I'm expecting a headache later.

271
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,646
- But Anna wants to come.
- What? No.

272
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,653
What about Matt?
You could see him, talk to him.

273
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,212
I thought you said he came back
to the house that night.

274
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,121
- How about it, Anna?
- Come on.

275
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,458
You can go, and I can stay here
and dig through her stuff. Go on.

276
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,225
- You know, we can do it another time.
- No.

277
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,629
I'll be down in a minute.

278
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,929
I'm just gonna find
something cute to wear.

279
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,735
You little suck-up.

280
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,308
Your dad hates it when I drive fast.

281
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,010
- Our little secret, okay?
- Our little secret.

282
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,119
What happened to my mom's car?

283
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,887
Well, we discussed it,

284
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,420
and we just felt like
the family needed something more fun.

285
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,785
My one good piece of jewelry.

286
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,691
Where'd you get it?

287
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,959
Oh, there.
Someone gave them to me ages ago.

288
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,993
A boyfriend?

289
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,264
An old patient, actually.

290
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,535
Really? Sounds like a nice job.

291
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,036
I wiped old people's asses
for a living, Anna.

292
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,376
And let me assure you, they were
not all beautiful like your mom.

293
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,719
No, I mostly had to do things
that decrepit old ladies

294
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,917
with lots of money were either too
ashamed or weak to do for themselves.

295
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,563
Wanna know how I got through it?

296
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,091
It's terrible,

297
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,739
but no matter how condescending
they were,

298
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:38,172
how badly they treated me,
how badly they smelled,

299
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,017
I always told myself,

300
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:47,080
"They'll be dead very, very soon. "

301
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,960
You know, Anna, we all have things
in our past that we're ashamed of.

302
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,432
I think sometimes
it's best to just let it go.

303
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,077
Anna?

304
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,682
Anna, are you all right?

305
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,856
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

306
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,232
We have some shopping to do, right?

307
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,636
Beautiful marbling.
How long has it been aged?

308
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:46,081
- We sell everything fresh.
- Never mind.

309
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,717
- I'm gonna go grab the milk.
- Great, thanks.

310
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,069
- Matt.
- Anna. Hey.

311
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,209
What are you doing here?

312
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,413
Listen, I think... I think I know what
you were trying to tell me yesterday.

313
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,116
The fire wasn't an accident, was it?

314
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,385
- What did you see?
- Matt?

315
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,949
Those berries aren't getting any fresher.

316
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,222
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm coming.

317
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,100
- Will you help us, please?
- Yeah, okay. Just not here.

318
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,032
Okay, then can we meet tonight?

319
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,161
Matt!

320
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,698
- Yeah. 11:00. At the rock.
- Okay.

321
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,777
- Couldn't find the milk?
- Yeah.

322
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,281
- We should go.
- Okay.

323
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,684
Oh, and, Matt, you won't need to
make deliveries to the house anymore.

324
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,278
That's gonna be my job from now on.

325
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,103
- Have fun?
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,149
Been telling each other
all our secrets, right, Anna?

327
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,480
Yeah. Thanks for lunch.

328
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,955
- Was everything okay?
- I lost her for a little bit.

329
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,192
I mean, I just hope
this wasn't all too soon.

330
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,635
Alex?

331
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,338
Alex?

332
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,823
Jesus, you scared me.
I thought you were her.

333
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,224
- Did you talk to Matt?
- Yeah, we're meeting him tonight.

334
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,320
Cool. Look at this.

335
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,665
God, when are they bringing
in the stripper pole?

336
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,101
I know, she's like a crack whore
without the dignity.

337
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,437
P.S., look at this.

338
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,036
Come on. Look what I found.

339
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,209
- Meet Mr. Chubby.
- Oh, that's disgusting.

340
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,686
No, I'm not touching that.

341
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,567
Okay, that's enough
to tranquilize a horse.

342
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,130
Or you and me.

343
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,241
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait.

344
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,749
Party's over, Rach.

345
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,362
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.

346
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,529
Matt?

347
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,029
Matt?

348
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,969
This doesn't feel right.

349
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,707
What if something's happened?

350
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,054
It's okay, Anna.
We'll find him tomorrow.

351
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,055
Yeah.

352
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,385
I'm gonna go to bed.

353
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,294
No, please stay with me till I fall asleep.

354
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,760
If I had 10 bucks
for every time I heard that.

355
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,166
Thank you.

356
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,597
No funny stuff.

357
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,501
Anna, hey. Hey, don't be afraid.

358
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,268
I just didn't want to
wake your parents up.

359
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,106
Matt. Where were you?

360
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,871
We waited for you at the rock,
just like you said.

361
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,006
Yeah, I know, I...

362
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,108
What happened? You're soaked.

363
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,246
You know, I fell and hurt my back
or something.

364
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,620
Well, here, come sit down.

365
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:35,632
I'm sorry it's so late, but... It's just...

366
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,804
I think you need to know the truth
about what I saw that night.

367
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,735
Tell me.

368
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,410
You're shivering.

369
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,309
I can't feel anything.

370
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,852
- I'm scared, Anna.
- Don't be.

371
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,467
Matt, what happened to your back?

372
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:30,484
Your mother tried to warn me, Anna,
but I didn't listen.

373
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,792
Hold me. Anna.

374
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,097
Anna.

375
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:49,770
Please, hold me. Anna, please.

376
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,689
Anna? Hi, I'm Sheriff Emery.
I don't know if you remember me.

377
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,393
Listen, we're gonna do
a thorough investigation,

378
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,770
but he must have hit a patch of timber,

379
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,469
fell out of the boat and broke his back.

380
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,244
Were you supposed to meet him?

381
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,150
Listen, we all know
what you're going through.

382
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:50,353
Anything you need, anything at all,
you come see me.

383
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,951
You understand?

384
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,924
I'm deeply sorry.

385
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,914
It's just terrible.

386
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,481
I'm gonna make breakfast.
You should eat something.

387
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,855
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

388
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,326
- Dad, wait.
- What?

389
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,034
Matt wasn't just in the water last night.
He was coming to see me.

390
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,162
Anna, what happened to Matt
is not your fault.

391
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,070
Dad, that's not what she's trying to say.

392
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,109
One of you come help me.

393
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,605
- Dad.
- I'll go.

394
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,847
- What?
- I saw Matt in town yesterday.

395
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,879
He told me he saw what happened
the night of the fire.

396
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,288
Rachel overheard us.

397
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,225
She didn't want me
to talk to him anymore.

398
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,821
She didn't want him
to come here ever again.

399
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,628
Anna, why would Rachel
say something like that?

400
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,032
It's just...

401
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,101
What?

402
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,740
Is everything all right out there?

403
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,709
- We'll be right in.
- Okay.

404
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,785
Sweetheart, I know
this is difficult for you.

405
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:29,320
It's been hard for all of us,
but, please, don't do this.

406
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,393
Okay? Just don't do this.

407
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,322
- Come on, have some breakfast.
- I'll be there in a minute.

408
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,392
You okay?

409
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,399
No, I'm not okay.

410
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,003
I'm not crazy, Alex.

411
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:25,039
Matt was here, and I thought
that I was dreaming, but I wasn't.

412
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,006
- Anna, do you wanna sit...
- And he said

413
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,745
that Mom was trying to warn him.

414
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,548
- Okay, how can that be?
- And he was holding me.

415
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,486
- Anna, listen.
- Look!

416
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,654
Oh, my God.

417
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,863
- Okay, now I'm afraid.
- I'm not crazy.

418
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,702
They're not gonna send me back there.

419
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,936
No, I'm not afraid for you.
I'm afraid for us.

420
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,507
Anna, we're the last ones

421
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,639
standing between Rachel
and what she really wants.

422
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,716
Come on. Look,

423
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:06,722
last time I checked, you didn't become
some psycho serial killer overnight,

424
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,954
so we need to find out exactly
who Miss Rachel Summers really is.

425
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,136
Yes, hi, I'm trying to
get some information

426
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,010
about someone we hired
through your agency.

427
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,640
Her name's Summers.
Rachel Summers.

428
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:40,049
Hello, I'd like to get a reference
on one of your nurses, please.

429
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,458
I believe she was on your staff
at the hospital

430
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,019
between July and December of 2005.

431
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,864
Hi, I'm running a background check

432
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,028
on someone who worked for you
several years ago.

433
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:59,641
Summers. S-U-M-M...
Yeah, as in "mother. "

434
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,303
E- R-S, as in "Satan. "

435
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,512
What? No, that's impossible.

436
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,156
No, no, no, that's fine.

437
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,683
Okay, thanks very much. Bye.

438
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,019
We've got her.

439
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:32,408
Anna. Come in.

440
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,646
You know,
you have beautifully shaped lips.

441
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,681
You just don't know
what to do with them.

442
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:48,481
Men will go on about a woman's eyes,
but that's bullshit.

443
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:56,362
What they really want is
a girl with a pretty mouth.

444
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,463
There.

445
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,912
You seem very interested in these.

446
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,341
Would you like to wear them tonight?

447
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:19,486
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

448
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,259
There.

449
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,594
What's your real name, Rachel?

450
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,297
What did you say?

451
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,868
The State Nursing Association
has no record of a Rachel Summers.

452
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,967
Your social security number's
for someone named Rachel Summers,

453
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:44,070
but she's a school teacher
from New Orleans.

454
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,138
She died five years ago.

455
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:51,786
So, who are you, really?

456
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,031
You know what, Anna?

457
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,601
I don't think this is going to work out.

458
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,109
Where do you think you're going?

459
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,312
To talk to my father.

460
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,650
Well, there's really no need.

461
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,416
We've already discussed it
with Dr. Silberling.

462
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:32,356
- Discussed what?
- Well, your behavior.

463
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,125
Anna, he's very concerned.

464
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:43,002
He's beginning to think that
it was a mistake letting you out.

465
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,907
You won't take this away from me.
I won't allow it.

466
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,281
Now, get out. I have guests coming.

467
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,387
I can't believe she sold you out to Dad.

468
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:09,295
Maybe she can threaten you,
but what can they do to me?

469
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,527
- I'm gonna talk to Dad.
- No.

470
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,293
All she's gonna do is convince him

471
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,100
that we're lying
and that it's my fault, okay?

472
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,903
We just have to get through tonight,
and then tomorrow we go to the police

473
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,170
and tell them what's going on.

474
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,678
You're only gonna make it worse for me.

475
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:30,609
Fine. But this is gonna
take a lot of alcohol.

476
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,290
Hey. Look at you.

477
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,668
- What?
- You look terrific.

478
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,170
Thanks.

479
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:53,036
Well, I guess
you've grown up on me, haven't you?

480
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,973
Hey, if it's any consolation,
this is all pretty weird for me, too.

481
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,708
Book launch parties.

482
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,114
Might as well give everyone
a green light

483
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,914
to come into your house and judge you.

484
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:12,352
Can I ask you a favor?
Would you give Rachel a hand tonight?

485
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,896
The truth is, I don't think
she feels good enough for all of this,

486
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,232
and people here are judging her, too.

487
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,205
Sure.

488
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,181
What?

489
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,021
I just wanted to know
if you needed any help.

490
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,117
Really?

491
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,455
Sure. Open the oven.

492
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,530
Okay.

493
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:59,435
The key to a good roast is to
let it sit 10 minutes before carving.

494
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,810
It lets the blood flow back in.

495
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,510
Back to the fray.

496
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,984
Take out the garbage, will you?

497
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,165
You're next.

498
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:46,945
No. No. What did you do?
What did you do?

499
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,052
What are you trying to do to me?

500
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,348
What happened?

501
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,493
You leave her alone.

502
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,025
Just go to bed.

503
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:17,369
No, no. Listen, I'll be in New York
tomorrow and we can sort this all out.

504
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,712
Sorry about this. Travel safe.

505
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,827
Dad? Can I talk to you?

506
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,709
Tonight. There's a reason for
what happened.

507
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,243
It's Rachel.
She's not who you think she is.

508
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,305
Enough, Anna.

509
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,648
- What has she done this time?
- She's lied to you.

510
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,284
- About what?
- About everything. About her name.

511
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,717
Do you even know where she's from?

512
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:03,952
I'm not gonna dignify that
with an answer.

513
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,495
No, of course you're not, because
you only see what you wanna see.

514
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,361
All she is trying to do
is make this family work.

515
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,195
She's not trying to make it work.

516
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,599
- She wants you for herself.
- That is ridiculous.

517
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,467
God, if Mom could see you now,

518
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,996
siding with that bitch
who's trying to tear us apart!

519
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,080
Rachel isn't the one
who's tearing us apart.

520
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,818
Look, maybe we should talk
to Dr. Silberling about this.

521
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,583
Right, because I'm the one who's crazy.

522
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,887
- I didn't say that. You know I did...
- Dad.

523
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,891
You're not wearing your ring.

524
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,666
Are you gonna marry her?

525
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,840
- Tell me!
- Yes, Anna.

526
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,481
We're getting married
sometime this fall.

527
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:11,184
We talked about going away,
but I wanna have the wedding here,

528
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,785
for all of us.

529
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,430
I'm not ashamed, Anna.
I'm not ashamed to be happy again.

530
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,295
Bye, Daddy.

531
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,804
We shouldn't be late for Matt's service.
Wear something decent.

532
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,901
I wanna look like a family.

533
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,410
"In the Lord, I take refuge.

534
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,215
"How can you say to me,
'Flee like a bird to the mountains.

535
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:15,046

fit their arrows to the strings

00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,285

537
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:22,455
"'When foundations are being
destroyed, what can the upright do?'

538
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,826
"The Lord is in his holy temple.
The Lord's throne is in heaven.

539
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,306
"God's eyes keep careful watch. "

540
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:49,384
"The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Whom do I fear?

541
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:53,391
"The Lord is my life's refuge.
Of whom am I afraid?

542
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,863
"When evildoers come at me
to devour my flesh,

543
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:59,129
"these my enemies and foes
themselves stumble and fall. "

544
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,583
This is from April 11, 1996.

545
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,320
"Police have recovered the bodies
of three children

546
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,329
"from a shallow grave in the woods
less than 50 yards

physician Dr. Harrison Wright.

"who had been employed as the
Wright children's nanny since August. "

552
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,911
- Mildred Kemp?
- Holy shit. Listen to this.

553
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,783
"According to sources
close to the family,

554

in a car accident last February.

556

"Despite police efforts,
Kemp remains at large. "

557
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,355
Wait, what...

558
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,962
Look. Look what she's wearing.

559
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,335
The pearls.

560
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,708
Rachel said they were a gift
from an old patient.

561
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,977
She put them around my neck.
Like... Like she was proud of them.

562
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,351
Yeah, well, lucky for us,
now we have proof.

563
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,281
Yeah, if we can get our hands on them.

564
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,990
Don't worry about that.
This ends tonight.

565
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,122
Shit.

566
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,767
Hey, look.

567
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,416
- Alex, where are you going?
- Just go downstairs and get her keys.

568
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,717
- What are you gonna do?
- Just get her keys.

569
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,223
What are you looking for, Anna?

570
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,789
Is it these? Are you looking for these?

571
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,928
You should take them.

572
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,199
Please. They mean nothing to me.

573
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,039
We know, Rachel.

574
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,733
We know everything.

575
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,540
You caught me.

576
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,110
Here.

577
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,390
Alex!

578
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,356
Alex!

579
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:55,549
Anna.

580
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,220
I don't want to hurt you.

581
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,231
This isn't how I wanted it.

582
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,701
You can make this easy.

583
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,072
- Anna.
- Alex.

584
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:26,416
- What happened?
- She drugged me. She drugged me.

585
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,150
Anna? Open the door.

586
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,658
Anna, listen to me.

587
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:34,457
- You have to get that necklace.
- I did. I got it.

588
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,525
Anna! Open this goddamn door!

589
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,906
You gotta go to Emery, okay?

590
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,807
- No. No.
- Yes. He'll believe you.

591
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,072
- Anna!
- I can't leave you here.

592
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,345
Pinkie pact.

593
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,244
Anna!

594
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:58,549
- Okay.
- Okay.

595
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,050
I love you.

596
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,402
I'll come back for you, okay? I promise.

597
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,025
Anna!

598
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,249
So, you're alleging that
Miss Summers is actually a woman

599
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,807
- named Mildred Kemp?
- Yes.

600
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,581
And she was the one responsible
for the fire?

601
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,281
That's right. It wasn't an accident.

602
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,519
She murdered our mother,
and now she's after us.

603
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:17,089
- Listen, I know how this sounds, but...
- No. Mildred Kemp. I remember her.

604
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:22,262
Out west in Woolridge County,
years ago, wife died,

605
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,102
man hired some nanny
who killed all the children.

606
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,335
That's right, but they never caught her.

607
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,904
Okay, listen, Mrs. Wright
had a pearl necklace, three strands.

608
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,415
There are pictures of it
on the Internet if you wanna see.

609
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,973
And?

610
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,087
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

611
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,787
Okay? She's trying to kill us
and marry our father,

612
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,886
just like she did to them.

613
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,731
Listen, I want you to sit tight.

614
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,932
Jerry is right outside that door.

615
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,905
I'm gonna pull up Miss Summers
on the system.

616
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,740
No, there's no time for that.
You have to go to my house.

617
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:07,146
Alex is still there, and I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to her.

618
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,811
Nothing's gonna happen
to anybody, Anna. You wait here.

619
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,293
Mom?

620
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,402
Mom?

621
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,381
Don't be afraid. I'm a nurse.

622
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:19,581
No! No! Don't believe her! No! No!
Please! Don't believe her!

623
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,647
No! She's lying!
Don't believe her, please!

624
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:28,186
No! No! Don't believe her! No! She...

625
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,366
There we go. Thank you.

626
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,522
I remember her.

627
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:02,997
It was out west in Woolridge County,
years ago, wife died,

628
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,898
man hired some nanny
who killed all the children.

629
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,993
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

630
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:12,268
"Police have issued a warrant
for the arrest of Mildred Kemp, age 19,

631
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:16,004
"who had been employed as the
Wright children's nanny since August. "

632
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,512
"Forensics reveal the children
were heavily sedated

633
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,277
"before being stabbed repeatedly.

634
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,376
"Despite police efforts,
Kemp remains at large. "

635
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,288
You' re gonna sleep now.

636
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:50,635
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

637
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,144
I can't.

638
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,109
Did I ever tell you that?

639
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:06,686
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

640
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,331
But now you've taken that
away from me.

641
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,524
Careful.

642
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,597
You don't want to hurt yourself.

643
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,132
Anna?

644
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,407
We tried everything, Anna.
This was the only way.

645
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:13,871
What did you do?

646
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,949
What did you do?

647
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,012
I had to, Anna. Didn't I?

648
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,752
Didn't I have to?

649
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:34,159
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm always here.

650
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,670
Look at me. Look at me.

651
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,079
Be brave, okay? Okay.

652
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,552
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

653
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:54,350
It's Rachel, Dad. Rachel started the fire.

654
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,283
- What are you talking about?
- She killed Mom.

655
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:02,227
Dad, I know you never listen to me,
but you have to believe us!

656
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,061
She waited until you were out of town,

657
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,930
and she drugged me,
and she drugged Alex.

658
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,531
- What?
- She was gonna kill us.

659
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,800
Alex had to do it, Dad. She saved us.

660
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,708
- Alex?
- Alex, tell him.

661
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,247
Anna, what are you saying?

662
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,845
He can't see it, Anna. He never will.

663
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,779
Anna, you know what happened
to your sister.

664
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,948
- Tell him, Alex.
- Don't believe him.

665
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,151
- She died.
- No, don't believe him.

666
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,625
In the fire.

667
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,492
- It was a year ago.
- No! He's lying!

668
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,691
Alex is dead!

669
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,435
What have you done?

670
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,083
Alex?

671
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,656
Anna?

672
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,827
Anna, what do you mean
the fire wasn't an accident?

673
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,805
What happened that night?
Tell me what happened that night!

674
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:23,671
Get away from me. Get away from me.

675
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,770
Get away from me!

676
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,897
Hello? Dad?

677
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,823
The guys, they want to
come back to our house.

678
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,562
It's not our house anymore.

679
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,433
What are you doing?

680
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,300
They can burn in hell.

681
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,669
Anna. Anna!

682
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,679
Anna, what's wrong?

683
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,716
- Alex?
- Coming, Mom.

684
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:24,927
Alex!

685
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,152
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

686
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,059
Those were my letters, Dad.

687
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,725
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell
her about your new little girlfriend?

688
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:02,634
Was that it?
Talk about all the dirty little secrets?

689
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,233
Anna?

690
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,436
Listen, I'm going into town.
You wanna come?

691
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,970
I followed you home that night, Anna.

692
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,243
I saw everything.

693
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,512
Don't let go. Anna, hold me.

694
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:28,185
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

695
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,091
I can't.

696
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:35,799
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

697
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,968
But now you've taken that
away from me.

698
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,355
I'm sorry, Mr. Ivers.

699
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:06,026
I noticed the name
on Miss Summer's passport

700
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,229
doesn't match the name
on her driver's license.

701
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:13,764
She changed her name three years ago.
Had a boyfriend used to beat her up.

702
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,272
Her real name is Rachel Worshinsky.

703
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,450
Your daughter got it
in her mind somehow

704
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:27,386
that your fiance
was a woman named Mildred Kemp.

705
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:33,126
Why would she make all this up?

706
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,748
Hello, Anna.

707
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,710
Are you okay?

708
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,724
I did exactly what you asked.

709
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:40,084
Did what, Anna?

710
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,960
I finished what I started.

711
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:17,131
Welcome home.
