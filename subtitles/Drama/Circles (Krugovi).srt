Year 1993, the ethnic war between Serbs,
Muslims and Croats is raging in Bosnia.

2
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,473
Most of the Muslims civilians decided
to remain in the town of Trebinje,

3
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,161
which is on the territory
controlled by Serbian army.

- No, no. No, too early for me.
- I can.

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,936
- How long are you staying?
- Only for the weekend.

8
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:58,329
If the shooting starts,
I have to go back.

9
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,491
Easy, easy.

10
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,239
I'll suprise Nada.
I didn't tell her I was coming.

11
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,457
- She's not going anywhere,
don't you worry. - I don't.

12
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,431
She looks at you like you're
the only man in the world.

13
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:15,907
- Don't plan anything till all
this is over. - We won't.

14
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,634
- I'll wait for you for lunch.
- Alright. I'll be here.

15
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,240

I'll be right back.
Come here.

19
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,104
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

20
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,607
Whenever I do, shooting starts
and they don't let me go.

21
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,096
This is better, no bad luck.

22

- You're wearing it.
- What did you think?

23
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:23,467
It's war, you promise
yourself to one man,

24
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,580
- and leave with another...
Who could blame you? - Get off!

25
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:38,233
I'll be done in a hour.

26
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,904
Go, on, leave!

27
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,763
- What are you doing here?
- Come down.

28
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:13,396
What's up...

29
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,843
Great to see you man.

30
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:34,358
What? What?
What do you think you're doing?

31
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,381
Hi.

32
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,380
- What's up?
- Got "Drina" without filter?

33
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:02,988
- You're lucky, only two left.
- Thanks, cheers.

34
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,729
Take care.

35
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,478
What happened
the other night?

36
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,459
We heard explosions here.
I thought we are all finished.

37
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:26,049
They brought guys from your unit,
I was stiching them up.

38
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,142
Two days I didn't sleep.

39

Look what I got for you.

40
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,788
What is it?

41
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:37,835
You fool...
Where'd you get this?

42
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:41,019
Stole it from the captain.
For you to write prescriptions.

43
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,335
Thank you.

44
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,085
- Come on...
- Pissing, are you?

45
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,916
- Give it!
- I won't...

46
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:04,712
- What'll you have?
- "Drina", what else.

47
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,969
Give me two packs of
"Drina" without filter.

48
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,741
None left.

49

What do you mean, none left?

50
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,007
Just sold the last one.
You see I haven't got any.

51

None?
None left for me?

- Todor!
- What?

75
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,883
It's ok.

76
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:22,916

- Thank you for everything.
- Don't mention it.

Haris has explained
your situation.

95
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:27,055
I think you should
notify the police.

96
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,047
No, no... don't worry.

97
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,756
- You'd work the day shift.
You can't start tomorrow. - Thank you.

Don't thank me, when Haris
brings someone, that's it.

Did he really tell you
he needs a worker?

116
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,779
He did, two weeks ago.
But no one wants to work.

Great, I'm totally broke.

Take us to the station.

157

Hello.

162
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,606
No, I'm not coming home.

163
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,141
I'm at Nada's.

164
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:14,338
I can't explain now,
I need to stay here tonight.

165
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,751
I'll come in the morning.

166
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:21,590
Bye.

167
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:46,808
Is it true what
he said to Esad?

168
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:01,407
When that thing
happened with Marko...

169
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,784
I did not know what
to do with myself.

170
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:11,739
I just wanted to leave Trebinje.

171
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:15,579
When I came to Germany,

172
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:20,340
I got a job as a
waitress in his club.

173
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:24,661
And this is how I
met my husband.

174
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:30,365
Everything in my
life happened wrong.

175
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:42,886
I'm sorry.

176
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:48,123
I'm going to sleep.

177
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,821
What do you want?

178
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,738
To work.

179
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,846
You need work that badly?

180
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,658
No. But it's not fair.
That I can't stand.

181
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:22,415
And you know what's fair?

182
00:29:24,156 --> 00:29:25,937
I'm no worse than Petar.

183
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:02,537
Don't put so much load,
we will brake our back.

184
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,713
- Boss, don't!
- Show me the hand.

185
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:52,159
Bring some 'rakija'. (Serbian strong
baverage made from various fruits)

186
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,890
See what you've done?

187
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,869
There's no other like this one!

188
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,531
Clean it.

189
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:13,403
I told you I didn't need you.
Leave now and don't come back.

190
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,510
What are you looking at?

191
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,290
What?
Leave!

192
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:58,839
- What happened? - Nothing!
- Let me see that! - I'm alright!

193
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:01,208
- He wanted to hurt you?
- Leave me alone.

194
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:03,183
Don't you, "leave me alone".

195
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:05,317
- Don't you see he wants revenge?
- I hurt myself!

196
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:09,356
- You don't know anything!
- I know much more than you think.

197
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:14,442
- I can't bear to lose you too.
- You're totally out of your mind.

198
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:19,002
No! I won't let you leave the house!
I'll lock you in.

199
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:21,951
Do you hear me?
I'll lock you in!

200
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:45,086
- Todor, how are you?
- Better.

201
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,817
They told me...

202
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,151
you're the Doctor...
... who saved me.

203
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:00,996
Yes.
Unfortunately.

204
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,892
But you'll need
another surgery.

205
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:10,631
Your life depends on that one.

206
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:18,299
Why of all people I had
to fall into your hands?

207
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:22,932
Oh, fuck...

208
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,805
Do you believe in anything?

209
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:35,167
I go to church.

210
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,853
I believe in God.

211
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:56,187
Does your conscience bother you?

212
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,147
My conscience is clean.

213
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:14,786
What did you expect?

214
00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:20,549
Nothing.

215
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,305
You're not alive yet.

216
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:29,125
Your surgery's on Wednesday.

217
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:17,439
- What do you want?
- To work.

218
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:36,235
- Want something to eat?
- No.

219
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,607
- Want water?
- I'm fine.

220
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:35,957
Come tomorrow.
Just don't break anything.

221
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:48,731
Where are you going?
Wait, we'll go together.

222
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,102
What do you want?

223
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,773
Stay away from my son.

224
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,841
He's not guilty for anything.

225
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,024
Good morning.
Is Haris in?

226
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,401
No, he's not.
Can I help you?

227
00:40:18,388 --> 00:40:20,187
I'll wait for him.

228
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:22,993
Thanks.

229
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,364
Sorry, who are you?

230
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:32,183
Good morning.
Enjoy your meal.

231
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:44,620
May I sit down?

232
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,746
Haris, come at once.
There's a man here looking for you.

233
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:05,193
Straight to school.

234
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,753
Bye.

235
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,050
How old are the girls?

236
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,740
Seven and nine.

237
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,058
My Dusan is seven.

238
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:43,818
But I haven't managed
to preserve my family...

239
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,379
Where's my son?

240
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,484
With his mother.

241
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,609
And where is she?

242
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:06,863
I don't know.
I only helped her find the job.

243
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,204
- Don't lie to me.
- I don't.

244
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:14,206
I'm telling you the truth.

245
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,212
She's an alcoholic.

246
00:42:28,018 --> 00:42:30,193
Fucked up in the head.

247
00:42:30,553 --> 00:42:32,737
She's not a good mother.

248
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:35,385
Sorry, what is going on?

249
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:39,303
You realise I'll do
anything to get my son.

250
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:48,728
Do you realise?
Haris?

251
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,048
Let's go for a little ride.

252
00:42:57,515 --> 00:42:58,750
Let's go.

253
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:05,132
- Can I do something?
- No.

254
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,614
Have a nice day.

255
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:48,010
Is this the school your
daughters go to?

256
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,539
Look, there's Elke.

257
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:07,920
You have a nice family.

258
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,172
How would you feel if
someone took your child?

259
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:17,835
Huh?

260
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,198
I'm glad you understand me.

261
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,383
I'll come tomorrow
at noon to your place.

262
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:48,040
And you will give
me my son back.

263
00:45:00,084 --> 00:45:00,978
Elke?

264
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,194
Elke, where is Alma?

265
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:04,905
Where is Alma?

266
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,046
Alma?

267
00:45:10,149 --> 00:45:11,930
Alma, we have to go home.

268
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,779
- Why?
- Quickly.

269
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:58,068
I went to the court.
I asked them to renew the trial.

270
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:03,460
They said the
case is outdated.

271
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,474
That wasn't a trial,
that was nothing.

272
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:17,357
Only Rakita regreted...

273
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:21,549
...and got killed
immediately afterwards.

274
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,674
This guy didn't even
blink at the trial.

275
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,404
I'm supposed to
operate him again.

276
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:45,910
I don't know what to do.

277
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,456
I'm not interested
in that man at all.

278
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:59,563
It can't bring my Marko back.

279
00:47:08,718 --> 00:47:11,339
There's just one
thing bothering me...

280
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:16,421
Was it all for nothing?

281
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,567
A life, just like that...
You know?

282
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:28,955
It's not about that Haris.

283
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:31,646
He's a good man.

284
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:36,685
But it's like he thrown
his life away...

285
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,510
Into nothing.

286
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:54,183
When you throw a stone in
water something happens...

287
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,487
Those circles appear...

288
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:03,487
and spread...

289
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:10,025
And yet this...

290
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,216
That's what I fear...

291
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:24,235
...that when a man
does good thing...

292
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:34,354
It means nothing
to other people.

293
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:57,273
Don't, no...
I have to drive back.

294
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,490
I work in the morning.

295
00:50:55,546 --> 00:50:56,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:13,308
You have to go somewhere,
first thing in the morning.

297
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:19,583
If I had anywhere to go,
I would not come here.

298
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,707
Is there anywhere a place
where he can't get to you?

299
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,926
Nowhere except Trebinje.

300
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:32,307
He can't enter Bosnia,
there's a warrant on him.

301
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,078
Then you have
to go to Trebinje.

302
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:39,383
I don't have Dusan's passport.

303
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:53,502
He'll be at my place
at noon tomorrow.

304
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:57,710
If I don't bring him to you
he will kidnap my children.

305
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,150
You can't be on the
run al your life.

306
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,300
Hello?

307
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,927
Esad, hi...
I need that cousin of yours.

308
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:31,009
Who can get passports...

309
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:34,900
It doesn't matter
what it costs...

310
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,968
Alright. Yes...
Just a second.

311
00:52:41,148 --> 00:52:42,925
- Do you have the boy's picture?
- No.

312
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,900
Yes, she has it all.
Yes.

313
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:56,785
Alright.
I'll wait for you to call. Bye.

314
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,670
They're asleep.

315
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,927
Please Haris, call the police.

316
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,059
I'm scared.

317
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:19,301
That man is dangerous.

318
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:28,588
I'll call them, then.

319
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,296
We mustn't call the police!

320
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,507
In the morning you have
to go to your parents...

321
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:58,781
...to hide, for a while.

322
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:04,256
Why don't we go together?

323
00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:08,734
To get away.

324
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,234
Andrea...

325
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:17,477
You know why I'm doing all this.

326
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,437
I do.

327
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:34,641
Dad, I can't sleep.

328
00:54:44,332 --> 00:54:46,980
Let's go to bed.

329
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:54,830
Boss!
Are you alright?

330
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:58,976
You alright?

331
00:56:01,622 --> 00:56:04,945
Get water! Do you have
medications or something?

332
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:09,060
- We have to get him to the doctor.
- I'm not going anywhere.

333
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:18,796
Drive me home.
It's enough for today.

334
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:55,153
Should I stay with
you for a while?

335
00:56:58,735 --> 00:56:59,914
No need.

336
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,539
Come on.

337
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,848
Wait.

338
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:21,967
What do you want?

339
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:24,697
How are you?

340
00:58:26,155 --> 00:58:27,505
Alright.

341
00:58:28,554 --> 00:58:30,449
Can't eat, though.

342
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,578
I've asked for another doctor.

343
00:58:38,943 --> 00:58:41,095
They told me you're the best.

344
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:45,609
You're the only one
doing these operations.

345
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:48,749
Yes, that's why I came.

346
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:52,347
To tell you...

347
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,560
I can't operate on you.

348
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,291
You can't, huh?

349
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,292
No.

350
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:16,240
You want money, is that it?

351
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:20,762
I don't take money.

352
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,819
What do you want then?
To torture me?

353
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:31,260
I wanted to see...

354
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:36,311
...if you repent...

355
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,425
Why would I repent?
I don't understand.

356
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:43,065
That was an accident.

357
00:59:45,484 --> 00:59:48,673
If he hadn't interfered,
everything would've been alright.

358
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:53,048
But the idiot pops up in the middle
of the war to decide what is right.

359
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,828
Fuck him,
it was his own fault!

360
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:01,572
I don't owe anything to anyone...

361
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:03,437
...to anyone!

362
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,805
Was there a trial?
Huh?

363
01:00:07,824 --> 01:00:11,156
Was I sentenced to two years,
sent to the front line?

364
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:18,136
Digging trenches till the end of the war,
waiting for a grenade to hit me.

365
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:21,210
All because of an idiot.

366
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,614
You know what?

367
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:30,617
When I saw you on the table that day,
when you thought you're finished,

368
01:00:32,322 --> 01:00:34,803
you were not this cocky.

369
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:44,098
I thought there might be
something human in you.

370
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:49,561
That a man like
you might change.

371
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:52,942
Even if on his dying bed.

372
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,345
But a beast remains a beast.

373
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:10,562
And a pussy remains a pussy.

374
01:01:13,268 --> 01:01:16,551
Why didn't you step in,
to save your mate, huh?

375
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,153
That's what bothers you.

376
01:01:21,672 --> 01:01:25,514
I'm not your problem,
you're your own problem.

377
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:31,807
You want me to tell you I repent
to make you feel better.

378
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:36,769
You stood there watching.

379
01:01:39,399 --> 01:01:41,892
You didn't even move, hey!

380
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:09,641
We can't carry suitcases.

381
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:12,703
Pack their things in this...

382
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,743
Where are we going?

383
01:02:15,572 --> 01:02:19,801
You're going to your Granny and
Granddad's just for a couple of days.

384
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:30,902
Pack your things in this bag.

385
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:33,049
Alright, alright.

386
01:02:51,494 --> 01:02:54,797
One taxi, please.
The old shopping mall.

387
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:58,559
- Mum, can we take the flutes?
- Yes.

388
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:02,628
From the side street...
Yes, Hermanstrasse.

389
01:03:12,903 --> 01:03:15,639
- Where are we going now?
- Towards school.

390
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:38,852
To the train station.

391
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:42,602
- Dad...
- Yes.

392
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,982
Why aren't you
coming with us?

393
01:03:45,465 --> 01:03:46,683
I can't.

394
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:52,813
You'll be back soon.

395
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,788
Come on.

396
01:04:18,837 --> 01:04:21,300
I'll pick you up
when this is over.

397
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:54,710
You're early.
Come.

398
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:05,915
- Here, count the money.
- Here you go.

399
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:11,750
I wouldn't take the money,
but you know where it goes to.

400
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,385
My friend...

401
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:16,824
I don't mean to pry,
but I don't know why are you doing this.

402
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,543
- Thank you.
- You can go out this way.

403
01:06:07,266 --> 01:06:08,728
Hey.
Hi.

404
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,668
Go back to bed.

405
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:30,015
Why aren't
you getting ready?

406
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,835
Haris, I can't.

407
01:06:56,218 --> 01:06:57,801
I'm not well.

408
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:09,885
Come and wash your face.

409
01:07:43,324 --> 01:07:44,608
Here.

410
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:59,288
What do you want?
Huh?

411
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:09,751
To hide this child, keep him in a cage,
not beaing able to go out in street...

412
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:12,322
For how long?

413
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,921
Till he or the police finds him
and takes him from you forever.

414
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,667
And you're never allowed
to see him again.

415
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:50,190
Hey...

416
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,457
...Dusan.

417
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:02,839
Please get dressed.

418
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,062
Go on, hurry.

419
01:09:27,818 --> 01:09:29,252
I'll do it.

420
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,112
I made you a coffee.

421
01:12:15,268 --> 01:12:18,344
I'll replace those bars
in the cellar tomorrow.

422
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:26,402
Cats come in...

423
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,707
I saw some nets on the market.

424
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:47,265
I'm off.

425
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:57,324
In the fridge... I made food
for you to take to work.

426
01:12:58,093 --> 01:13:00,001
There's enough for Petar too.

427
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:13,208
Thank you.

428
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,623
- How late is he?
- Twenty minutes.

429
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,604
He's never been late before.

430
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:48,193
He's not answering.

431
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,879
We should've taken him to
the doctor's yesterday.

432
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:55,349
We should've...

433
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:58,035
I'll go up.

434
01:14:26,023 --> 01:14:28,637
What?
You thought I died?

435
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,386
We came to pick you up.

436
01:14:32,388 --> 01:14:35,438
We're not working today.
I told you.

437
01:14:35,852 --> 01:14:38,118
- You didn't.
- I didn't?

438
01:14:38,761 --> 01:14:40,952
I'm telling you now,
we're not working.

439
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:45,536
Are you alright?
Do you want to see a doctor?

440
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:49,705
No. I have something
else to do.

441
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:08,351
- We're not working today.
- Is he not well?

442
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:11,593
Don't know.
You go.

443
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,636
Can I give you a hand?

444
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:30,904
Dragan Rakita

445
01:17:36,974 --> 01:17:39,890
Marko Kovacevic

446
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:09,772
Come in.

447
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:16,867
Leave that there.

448
01:19:39,495 --> 01:19:40,891
Come here.

449
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:46,283
No, thank you.

450
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:54,066
- You don't drink? - I do...
but don't feel like it now.

451
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:56,844
I'd rather have some water.

452
01:19:58,312 --> 01:19:59,652
I'm thirsty.

453
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,082
Well, go get some.
Who's stopping you.

454
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,576
Open the blinds.

455
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:54,303
Over there too.

456
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,426
It's better like this.

457
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:28,068
Have a smoke if you like.

458
01:21:35,481 --> 01:21:37,149
Now have a drink.

459
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:22,202
You know what
day it is today?

460
01:22:30,942 --> 01:22:32,064
I do.

461
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,595
Don't be late tomorrow.

462
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:11,523
Cigarettes.
You forgot your cigarettes.

463
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,537
Hello?

464
01:23:43,747 --> 01:23:47,712
Ah...
It's you, Haris.

465
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:51,300
You remembered.

466
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:54,963
You're the only one
who never forgets.

467
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,267
I don't need anything,
don't worry.

468
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:09,011
How's your family?
How are the children?

469
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,594
Bless them! Thank God.
Bless them!

470
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:20,345
Go on, this is expensive.

471
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:28,619
Nice to hear you,
I'm glad you're all well...

472
01:24:29,572 --> 01:24:31,762
...and thank you, Haris.

473
01:24:32,298 --> 01:24:33,743
Bye.

474
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:23,011
Come in.

475
01:27:52,698 --> 01:27:55,568
Come on.
Let's go.

476
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,887
I'm not going anywhere.

477
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:38,105
- Where is my son?
- They left for Bosnia.

478
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:32,858
Ranko, hello...
It's Haris.

479
01:31:36,211 --> 01:31:38,806
I just thought I'd call...

480
01:31:47,551 --> 01:31:49,732
I will never forget that.

481
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:03,694
Do you need anything
from here?

482
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,665
Thanks for asking,
they're well.

483
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:17,522
Andrea is fine, the children...

484
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:20,664
They grow.

485
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:31,493
<i>It's not really expensive,
calls are cheaper from here.</i>

01:32:38,248 --> 01:32:40,279
<i>Goodbye, Ranko.</i>

<i>We'll stay in touch.</i>

488
01:34:17,204 --> 01:34:18,846
There...

489
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:22,289
You're alive.

490
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:15,040
Get down,
we have to wait for Petar.

491
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:18,044
He has to load the material,
he won't be here before dark.

492
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:21,767
- We can't do it ourselves, come down.
- I'll give it a try.

493
01:35:22,128 --> 01:35:26,230
We both have to lift it at the same time,
come down I'm telling you!

494
01:35:29,989 --> 01:35:31,308
Don't move!

495
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:34,420
- Fine, fine, I'm fine.
- You alright?

496
01:35:37,676 --> 01:35:39,664
Can you move the left one?

497
01:35:42,175 --> 01:35:44,860
When I tell you, you yell.
Yes, that's right, yell!

498
01:35:45,207 --> 01:35:47,709
That's it. Help me.
Come on, that's it.

499
01:36:05,026 --> 01:36:09,345
Why did you do it?
Why didn't you listen to me?

500
01:36:10,534 --> 01:36:12,994
You had to do it yourself.
Fool!

501
01:36:13,295 --> 01:36:16,108
Doing things no
one ask you to.

502
01:36:16,505 --> 01:36:19,299
What did you want to prove,
being so stuborn like that!

503
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,158
That you're brave? That you know
what's the right think to do?

504
01:36:22,436 --> 01:36:24,629
Now look where

505
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:29,505
Moan... so I know
you're alive. Moan!

506

Here.

507
01:36:36,369 --> 01:36:40,867
I'll lift you, and when I say so,
help me to move you.

508
01:36:43,355 --> 01:36:44,820
Good, that's it.

509
01:36:46,669 --> 01:36:48,145
That's it.

510
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:00,343
Moan...

511

01:39:41,087 --> 01:39:42,657
Is that your son?

517
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,293
Yes.
My son.

518
01:40:27,701 --> 01:40:29,188
