2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,799
I truly don't even know
why I'm here, Doctor.

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,759
Well, of course, it's difficult
running a large household by oneself,

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
and raising four children is exacting,
but they're wonderful, wonderful children,

5
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,999
and my husband,

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,679
he's a good man;
a very hard worker.

7
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:29,782
Uh...

8
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,441
There was just... one thing.

9
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,039
Sometimes at night,

10
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,959
and he comes to me,

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,959
I imagine myself

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,959
splitting his fat, bald head

13
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,919
with a great, large axe.

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,279
It's just a feeling that comes
over me many, many times a day.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,839
A feeling of, um,

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,399
expectation.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,679
Hungering.

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,359
How do you bear it,
this English weather?

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,999
I cannot sing from the sadness.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,799
I open my mouth...

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,799
You see?
Nothing.

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,877
Well, and with my dear Allister gone,
it's two years now I...

23
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:33,638
I should have thought I'm far,
far too old for these kinds of feelings,

24
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,519
but, well, there they are.

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,959
Nurse,

26
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:01,730
I asked you to clean this wound
and put on fresh bandages.

27
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,639
Dr. Richardson told me
not to waste supplies.

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,999
Is he mad?

29
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,159
No, we must keep the wound
clean to prevent sepsis.

30
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,439
- What 'sis'?
- Sepsis.

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,039
Infection. It's caused by
germs entering the wound.

32
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,639
Germs. They're tiny creatures
that invade the body,

33
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,679
causing pain, fever, infections.

34
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,759
I don't think I have those.

35
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,959
You can't see them.

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,439
They're invisible.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,855
Please, just fetch me a beaker of carbolic
acid solution and a fresh bandage.

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,959
Yes, Doctor.

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,839
Honestly...

40
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,268
If that oaf Richardson
had this way,

41
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,170
we'd perform surgery in the
sewer using rusty saws,

42
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,559
and it would be Beekman's
pills for everybody,

43
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,119
no matter the ailment...

44
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,082
- Granville.

45
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,863
Are you aware I specifically told the nurse
not to change these bandages?

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,679
Soiled bandages are
a haven for germs.

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,279
Germ theory is
poppycock, Granville.

48
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,879
Now, stop speaking of it.
You're frightening the patients.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,159
Poppycock? But Lister has proved it.
All the latest journals...

50
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,559
- Pipe, Granville.

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,519
No, we won't be needing those.
Thank you very much.

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,439
A steady air of calm reassurance
and regular bleeding.

53
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,319
These are the keys
to modern medicine.

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,942
Will you remain calm, when the leg
putrefies and become gangrenous?

55
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,999
When you amputate?

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,799
When the rot spreads
to her blood and kills her?

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
I've had quite
enough of your impertinence.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,049
Put back that bandage
and bleed a pint.

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,959
Look... look at her, man!
You'll get more blood out of a turnip.

60
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,759
Do as you're told,

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,559
and give her Beekman's pills
for insurance.

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,860
Beekman's pills are rubbish.

63
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,538
They will do nothing but
bring on stomach cramps.

64
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,839
I won't stand here and watch
you murder your patients,

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,839
just because you can't be bothered
to read the latest science.

66
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,304
(laughing)

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,799
At long last,

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,319
we agree, Granville.

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
Bloody dinosaur.

70
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,108
Whoa!

71
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,039
Good day, Mrs. Copeland.
Is Edmund in?

72
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,199
I wouldn't know, sir.

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,599
Guests at all hours. Mad parties.
Deliveries day and night.

74
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,901
If I didn't love his parents so,
I would never stay.

75
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:47,214
I'd pack my bags, and all
this electrical equipment.

76
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,681
It's a fire hazard, that's what it is.

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,039
I'll try the study.

78
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,519
You. Why have you stopped?

79
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,225
Ow!

80
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,400
Now, that is not what
you're supposed to do.

81
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,359
Hello.

82
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Ahhh...

83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,039
Oh no.

84
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,759
You haven't been sacked
again, have you?

85
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,959
I tell you, Edmund. The healing arts
in England are positively lethal.

86
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,519
It's no coincidence that the morgues
are placed adjacent to the hospitals.

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,327
I mean, this is the 1880s.

88
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,340
We're meant to be in the midst
of a medical revolution.

89
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,919
Is it asking too much to use just
a bit of what science has provided,

90
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,399
rather than go about,
indiscriminately killing people?

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,519
Well, if you put it like that.

92
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,759
What's all the fuss outside?

93
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,679
My new generator.

94
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,479
You purchased a generator
just last year.

95
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,559
Obsolete. This one is half the size
and delivers double the power.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
I never thought I'd say this, but,

97
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,959
I've lost hope.

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,959
Since I was a boy, all I wanted
was to practice medicine,

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,079
and to help people that
actually needed it,

100
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,479
but I'm beginning to fear
that the world is set against me.

101
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,559
Well, what are you going to do?

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,999
Private practice, I suppose.

103
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,759
I shall harness myself
to some greedy pill pusher,

104
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,759
shut my mouth, and pray that
it nets me a steady income.

105
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,467
Or, I could give you
ten thousand pounds,

106
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,479
and you could do
whatever you wish.

107
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,839
I've told you a thousand
times, Edmund.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,180
You and your family have done
quite enough for me already.

109
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,319
Oh, come on, Mortimer.
I'd hardly miss it.

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,999
That's not the point.

111
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,239
I simply must make
my own way in the world.

112
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,359
You are so wonderfully middle-class.

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,079
Thank you.

114
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,799
Oh, by the way, there
seems to be a young man

115
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,439
asleep on your stairs.

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,399
Really?

117
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,750
Ha!

118
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,439
Good morning.

119
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,999
Mortimer Granville to see
Dr. Dalrymple. I have an appointment.

120
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,159
He's with someone now.

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,559
I see. Very well,

122
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,079
I shall wait, then.

123
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,199
Ladies.

124
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,700
Ladies.

125
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,611
Umm...

126
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,240
Ahh...

127
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:39,873
It's lovely.

128
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,039
Japanese, I think.

129
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,639
You're a charlatan,

130
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,039
with no idea

131
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,524
of a woman's wants or needs than

132
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,519
of... of the moon's atmosphere!

133
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,055
Charlotte, I simply
want you to behave...

134
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:25,323
You may be unaware, but there is
a social revolution afoot!

135
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,761
Women will no longer
be denied our rightful place.

136
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,046
Try, as you might, to keep us in
the kitchen and the drawing room.

137
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,750
We will not rest

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,679
until we are welcomed
in the universities,

139
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,679
in the professions, and
in the voting booth.

140
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,679
What are you staring at?

141
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,319
Yes, I can see the wheels turning.
Pity I can't stay for the pronouncement.

142
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,285
Charlotte!

143
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,119
That woman was...

144
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,919
Hysterical.

145
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,879
Yes, quite.

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,639
It's a very difficult case,
that one.

147
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:06,474
Huh...

148
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,359
I have worked at a number
of hospitals in the past...

149
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,759
year.

150
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,776
Guy's, of course. Charing Cross.

151
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,199
The Westminster Hospital,
most recently,

152
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,381
Excellent.

153
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:17,759
- St. Thomas's,

154
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,559
Old St. Thomas's,

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,079
the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum...

156
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,799
Good. Impressive.

157
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,720
Brompton Hospital for Consumption
and Diseases of the Chest,

158
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:25,859
The Royal Sea Bathing
Infirmary...

159
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,119
Fine. Fine.

160
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,949
It's... It's a variety of experiences,

161
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,319
but, tell me, Doctor,

162
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,900
what do you know of hysteria?

163
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,823
Ah...

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,799
Nothing.

165
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,199
Nothing?

166
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,225
But it's a plague of our time.

167
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,719
I would venture to say that
half the women in London are affected.

168
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,999
It stems from an overactive uterus.

169
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,439
In its most severe forms,
it demands drastic measures.

170
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,839
Institutionalization. Surgery, even,

171
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,199
but in its milder manifestations:

172
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,519
nymphomania, frigidity,
melancholia, anxiety,

173
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,999
it's eminently treatable.

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,959
Interesting.

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,119
Look. I'll come straight
to the point, Doctor.

176
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,879
I'm keen for help.

177
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,159
Oh, you saw my waiting room.

178
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,719
Not enough hands to do
the work, so to speak.

179
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,279
Sir, I would be enormously grateful

180
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,576
for any position that allowed me
to offer relieve to my patients

181
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,639
with little chance of killing them.

182
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,199
I've treated thousands of cases,
and I've not lost a single patient,

183
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,599
but I won't lie to you, Granville.

184
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
It's tedious, tiring work.

185
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,159
Are you fit?

186
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,256
I have never shirked
from hard work

187
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:41,999
in the pursuit of helping
the most needy among us.

188
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,679
Jolly good.

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,679
Shall we say, umm...
three pounds a week?

190
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,938
Three pounds?

191
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,639
Four.
Plus board and lodging.

192
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,959
I accept.

193
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,479
We're going to do great things
together, Granville.

194
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,919
Good God, man.
What a grip.

195
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,119
So, breakfast at eight,
dinner at six.

196
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,099
Your room is up... Oh...

197
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,239
Emily.

198
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,919
I want you to meet my new assistant.

199
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

200
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,559
My daughter, Emily Dalrymple.

201
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,959
Your servant, ma'am.

202
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,039
So pleased to meet you, Dr. Granville.

203
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,559
Emily is the angel of the house.

204
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,999
Since my dear wife, Melodia, passed away,
Emily has run things in proper order.

205
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,879
Oh, and she's also quite
a scientist in her own right.

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,359
Don't boast, Father.

207
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,359
Let me guess.

208
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,159
Geology?

209
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,999
Botany?

210
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,039
Lepidopterology?

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
Phrenology.

212
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,253
(laughing)
- Phrenology, yes.

213
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,439
I can assure you, phrenology
is an accurate science, Doctor.

214
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,919
Yes, the size and relation of the bumps

215
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,719
on one's head's are a veritable
road map to the personality,

216
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,159
if one is properly trained
to read them.

217
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,439
I didn't mean to imply that--

218
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,599
I think a demonstration is in
order for our young skeptic.

219
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,039
It would be most convivial.

220
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,639
Please.

221
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:26,245
Why,

222
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,959
Dr. Granville, you have the most
perfectly-formed nimbus I've ever felt.

223
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,759
Nimbus?

224
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,399
He is a man of great wisdom.

225
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,319
I knew it. I knew it.

226
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,439
And your mastoid is...
is very well-pronounced.

227
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,479
Doctor, you're quite
sympathetic, aren't you?

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,719
Umm... well...

229
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,079
What else? What else?

230
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh!

231
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,100
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- What?

232
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
It's just...

233
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,999
Well, your... your
thrombus is so... rigid;

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
so jutting and prominent.
It startled me.

235
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,222
Rigid thrombus?

236
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,678
Sorry? Rigid thrombus?

237
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,599
It augurs fame.

238
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,696
No, no, no...

239
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,759
While I have the utmost respect
for your method, Miss Dalrymple,

240
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,999
I must complain that you've misread me.
I am but a simple doctor.

241
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,239
I have no ambition for notoriety.

242
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,879
And I can assure you, your
thrombus is the key to your future.

243
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,039
Whether you seek it or not,
Dr. Granville,

244
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,159
you are destined for fame.

245
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:16,847
Ahoy?

246
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:19,095
Ahoy?

247
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,239
Who is this?

248
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,319
Who is this, please?

249
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,000
Mr. Stanton, huh?

250
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,159
Can you hear me?

251
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,799
Can you hear me now?

252
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:32,718
Yes.

253
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,201
This is Edmund St. John Smythe.

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,079
No, I don't work at
the telephone exchange. You see,

255
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,141
I've installed this telephone
and I wanted to test it.

256
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,159
You're the only person
they could connect me to.

257
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,533
How are things going over there?

258
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,536
Sounds thrilling. Very well,
carry on, then. Goodbye.

259
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,719
Do you realize?
I have been speaking to a barrister

260
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,439
on the other side of London.

261
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,399
What about?

262
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,719
Nothing. I don't even know the chap.

263
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,479
Nothing to value if you
have nothing to speak about.

264
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,639
Here I am in Grosvenor Square;
he's miles away,

265
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,319
yet we're able to speak
to each other instantaneously.

266
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,556
Do you think they'll catch on?

267
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,785
I have no idea,
but imagine if everyone had one.

268
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:10,786
Right.

269
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,359
Well,

270
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,964
I have just been
offered a position

271
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,973
by London's leading specialist
in women's medicine.

272
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,039
Oh, God, how ghastly for you.

273
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,199
When do you start?

274
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,559
Tomorrow.

275
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,032
Quite looking forward
to it, actually.

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,079
Who is she?

277
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,079
What?

278
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,337
Hmm?

279
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,562
She's his daughter.

280
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,839
Emily Dalrymple.
I only met her briefly, but...

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,759
But what?

282
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,239
Oh, Edmund, she is magnificent.

283
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,159
The epitome of English virtue and...

284
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,319
womanliness.

285
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,239
I haven't a hope.

286
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,079
A handsome, young doctor.
What more could a woman ask?

287
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,639
Better income. Social equal.

288
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,679
Overrated.

289
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,439
A few laughs. Stiff prick.
That's all a girl wants.

290
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,999
And you know this, because?

291
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,199
Oh, I've read it in a magazine.

292
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,319
Oh, I see.

293
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,279
A toast, then. To the end of Dr. Mortimer
Granville, once a brilliant student,

294
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,719
most recently a visionary
doctor to the poor,

295
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,359
and now, hand-maid
to anxious, middle-aged women.

296
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,119
Edmund St. John Smythe:

297
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,359
bachelor,

298
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,439
benefactor, miserable student,

299
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,479
sometime drunkard,
full-time sexual deviant,

300
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,159
and supreme waster of time and money.

301
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,879
Especially if it has anything to do
with the science of electricity.

302
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,079
- To the telephone.
- To the Queen.

303
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,159
To calling the Queen
on the telephone.

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,399
Morning, Mrs. Parsons.

305
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,679
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

306
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,959
This is Dr. Granville.

307
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,599
He'll be assisting me this morning.

308
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,358
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Parsons.

309
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,012
Doctor.

310
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,079
Notice the general pallor.

311
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,439
And how are we
this morning, Mrs. Parsons?

312
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,759
Still feeling anxious?

313
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,639
Yes, quite anxious, Doctor.

314
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,999
I've been having those distracting
thoughts we discussed all week.

315
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,079
Yes.

316
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,159
Throughout history,

317
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,519
the medical establishment has
offered hysterical women

318
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,079
a veritable smorgasbord of treatments:

319
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,879
warm baths, ice baths, water jets,

320
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,439
mesmerisation,

321
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,719
horseback riding, even,

322
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,879
but I favour a more
direct approach.

323
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,045
Now, I like to begin

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,839
with a drop of musk oil,

325
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,519
followed by oil of lilies.

326
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:37,841
A good dollop.

327
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,679
Now, are you ready, Mrs. Parsons?

328
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,658
Yes. Yes, Doctor. Quite ready.

329
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,117
Ooh...

330
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,079
Now, you begin with
the index finger.

331
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,999
Applying gentle pressure,

332
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,679
and slowly,

333
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,479
slowly in a circular motion,

334
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,839
still pressing gently.

335
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,239
It's a bit like patting your head
and rubbing your tummy at the same time,

336
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,719
but you'll soon
get the hang of it.

337
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,399
Vulvar massage was popularized by
Pieter Van Foreest in the 16th century,

338
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,959
who prescribed it most
especially for widows

339
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,159
and women of religious orders.

340
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,199
- No offense, Mrs. Parsons.
- None taken, Doctor.

341
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,479
But, today, in a clinical
environment with a trained professional

342
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,719
this is the most direct,
most effective treatment we can offer.

343
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,479
Good steady pressure.
That's the key.

344
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,199
Oh... Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

345
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,839
Of course, reapply oil as needed.

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,239
Notice the effect, Doctor?

347
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,239
Shortness of breath,

348
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,039
blushing of the skin,

349
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,719
a fluttering of the eyelids,

350
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,799
twitching.

351
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,919
Come on! Crimson!

352
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,279
Vocalization.
All perfectly normal.

353
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,719
Merely an involuntary physiological
reaction to the treatment.

354
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,759
Oh... Oh, come on!

355
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,959
Come on, boy!

356
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,999
Up and over!

357
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,879
Steady on, Mrs. Parsons. Steady on.

358
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,919
Good steady pressure.

359
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,239
That's the key to it.

360
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,679
Tally-ho!

361
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:20,138
Tally-ho!

362
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,207
Steady as she goes, Mrs. Parsons.

363
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,559
Steady as she goes.

364
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,132
You see, by fierce
external stimulation,

365
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:29,039
we're able to elicit the
pain/pleasure reaction,

366
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,519
thereby inducing
the hysterical paroxysm,

367
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,079
and coaxing the uterus back
into its normal position.

368
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,519
Amazing.

369
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,719
The female organ is, as you know,

370
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,799
incapable of experiencing any
pleasurable sensation what so ever,

371
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,759
without actual penetration
of the male organ.

372
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,018
Arghhh...

373
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,679
As you can see, Granville,

374
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,239
a very satisfactory paroxysm.

375
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,235
Well, I think we can
judge this treatment

376
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,639
a great success, would
you say, Mrs. Parsons?

377
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,999
Startling, Dr. Dalrymple.

378
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,959
A powerful demonstration.

379
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,679
- And those nagging thoughts?
- Thank you.

380
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,799
Gone, Doctor.

381
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,959
Wonderful.

382
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:17,642
Wonderful.

383
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,777
So, same time next week.

384
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,279
Same time tomorrow, I should say.

385
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,290
Moderation in all things,
Mrs. Parsons.

386
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,200
Moderation in all things.

387
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,439
Is that you, Sarah?

388
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,959
Hello.

389
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,119
Oh! Missed me, Charlie!

390
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,319
Sauce, sir?

391
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,079
It's lovely with the fish.

392
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,119
Thank you.

393
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,519
And my father was Anglican
minister of Mortlake.

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,359
Unfortunately, he and mother
perished in the last cholera outbreak

395
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,919
when I was a boy.

396
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,959
After coming to London to volunteer,
they contracted the disease themselves.

397
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,519
Oh, how dreadful.

398
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,679
Oh, terrible.

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,999
No doubt, that's where you gained
your interest in medicine.

400
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,999
Lord St. John Smythe knew of my fate,
and without thought of the cost,

401
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,599
brought me into his own home and
provided for my welfare and education.

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,319
Just what you'd expect from
a man of his standing.

403
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,919
There is no greater charity
than the gift of education.

404
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
You read the book of Samuel Smiles?

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,519
Is there anyone more sensible?
More supremely British?

406
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,759
Quite.

407
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,279
Music. Philosophy.

408
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,319
Phrenology.

409
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,359
You're a woman of many
talents, Miss Dalrymple.

410
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,133
It's through generosity,
through compassion,

411
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,159
through simple Christian kindness,

412
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,559
that England's gospel is spread
to all those who hunger for...

413
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,279
Hello, Father.

414
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,239
I'm so sorry I'm late.

415
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,237
Charlotte...

416
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,239
Emily, hello. Love the earrings.

417
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,439
Good evening, Charlotte.

418
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,959
Molly! Hello!

419
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,319
Staying out of trouble, I hope?

420
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,959
Most days, miss. Wine?

421
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,159
Yes, please.

422
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,959
You remember my daughter?
Charlotte Dalrymple.

423
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,177
- Daughter?
- My new assistant, Dr. Mortimer Granville.

424
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,239
Oh, hello. Lovely
to meet you properly.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,029
Careful not to prick
yourself, Doctor.

426
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,030
What... oh!

427
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
You are aware that
dinner begins at six.

428
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,159
I'm so sorry.

429
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,519
Lizzie Burke had her
eighth baby today. A little girl.

430
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,359
She was turn the wrong way around,
it took forever to get her out.

431
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,799
It was unbelievable.

432
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,559
Must we speak of such
things at table?

433
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,919
Emily.

434
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,759
Dr. Granville.

435
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,239
How is your fish?

436
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,879
Very fresh and very flaky.
Thank you.

437
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,479
And Emily, are the parsnips
to your liking?

438
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,799
Oh, that's enough, Charlotte.

439
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,719
Only trying to make the
conversation sufficiently benign.

440
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,799
Dr. Granville,

441
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,959
what say you?

442
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,039
Childbirth. Nasty, uncomfortable
topic best avoided at supper,

443
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,279
or miracle of life suited
for any setting?

444
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,839
I believe that serious medical matters,
are best left to those who are trained.

445
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Hear, hear!

446
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,533
The lone doctor in
my neighborhood

447
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:24,679
can only steady his scalpel
with a quart of gin.

448
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,639
What say you, then?

449
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,807
Charlotte is the mistress
at the East End Settlement,

450
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:30,199
House of Haven for
the less-fortunate.

451
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,399
Yes, unfortunately, the experience
has left her without a sense of

452
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,999
punctuality or decorum.

453
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,759
Oh, that's probably true.

454
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,079
I suppose I should've said to Lizzie,
"Hold tight, darling,

455
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,679
won't be a minute. Just got to pop home.
Mustn't be late for supper"

456
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,599
I don't know why you bother
coming here at all,

457
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,919
if your sole intention is
to be disruptive.

458
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,679
It isn't my sole intention.

459
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,839
We're out of coal again
and I need ten pounds.

460
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,279
No, no, no, no.

461
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,964
I already told you yesterday,

462
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:56,908
I'm not giving you any further
support in that regard.

463
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,079
I know you did, but
I didn't think you mean it.

464
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,559
Well, if that what it takes to
bring to your senses, so be it.

465
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,519
I've induldged you too long.

466
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,559
I've allowed you to roam the
streets of London late at night.

467
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,719
Streets that I would be frightened
to go into in broad daylight.

468
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,239
I've taken into my own home
the employ of...

469
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,397
inexperienced maids at
your request, but no more.

470
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,439
Then, Father, please give me my dowry.

471
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:20,318
Haha...

472
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,326
Why, so you can waste it on
prostitutes and factory workers?

473
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:24,131
I don't think so.

474
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,119
No, no. Not until you marry.

475
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,439
I would rather offer myself
to a band of ravenous Cossacks.

476
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,439
The parsnips are delicious,
are they not?

477
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,079
I do find they work wonderfully
with the fish. Don't you think?

478
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,559
It's not the Middle Ages. She should
be able to marry whomever she pleases.

479
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,639
No! It's not proper.

480
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,319
Now, you give up this settlement house
and step up to your responsibility,

481
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,199
and until you do so,
I will not give you another penny.

482
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,559
Then I won't come here anymore,

483
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,639
not for charity or for company,

484
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,359
and you may threaten me with
privation, with bankruptcy,

485
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,799
with a life that knows
only hunger and squalor,

486
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,919
but I shall never veer
from what I know

487
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,279
to be my own true path.

488
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,439
And don't slam...

489
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,159
Does she slam every door?

490
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,159
Very difficult case, that one.

491
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,839
Good night, Doctor.

492
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,839
How is it, Miss Dalrymple,

493
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,079
tha you are so much the ideal,

494
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,719
and your sister is so...

495
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,599
so volatile?

496
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,399
well, I'm hardly ideal, Doctor.
And...

497
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,879
Charlotte, she just...

498
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,959
feels everything so strongly.

499
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,401
If you truly knew
her, you would see

500
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,999
she's terribly clever and
wonderfully charitable.

501
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,139
Well, if she's earned
such love and admiration

502
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,319
from one so kind and
gentle as yourself,

503
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,679
I shall never speak poorly of her.

504
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,159
Good night, Doctor.

505
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,999
Good night, Miss Dalrymple.

506
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,599
Go on, Frank.

507
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,679
How are you this morning?

508
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,599
We're doing fine.
He just misses his mum.

509
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,856
You know what? I was thinking
about you this morning.

510
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,374
Do you know what
we going to start with?

511
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,799
Drawing.

512
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,679
Pardon me.

513
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,799
It's quite alright, handsome.

514
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,857
- Molly, is it?
- That's right, sir.

515
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,199
But my friends call me
Molly the Lolly,

516
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,359
and I think that we can be friends.

517
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,199
Molly the Lolly.
That's an unusual nickname.

518
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,679
Fancy a lick?

519
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,759
No, no. Thank you.

520
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,519
Only six buck for
a gentlemen like yourself.

521
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,279
It won't take me a minute.

522
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
Well, that's a generous offer, I'm sure,
but I have a very busy day ahead of me,

523
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,104
so... so... so... perhaps
another time, okay?

524
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,371
No, no, no. What I mean to say is...

525
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,479
Well, if you'll excuse me.

526
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,079
Suit yourself.

527
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,239
You alright, Fannie?

528
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,159
Yeah...

529
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,999
It's nothing.

530
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,359
Fannie, what is it? What?

531
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,399
It's George.

532
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,039
Again.

533
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,359
I think he's gonna land us
on the street this time.

534
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,519
- Oh, no, no, miss. I can't.
- No, take it. Take it.

535
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,559
Straight to the landlord.

536
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,399
No stopping.

537
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,359
I'll see you tonight.

538
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,639
Mrs. Bellamy, is it?

539
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,719
I'm Dr. Granville, Dr. Dalrymple's
new associate. Good morning.

540
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,199
Very pleased to meet you, Doctor.

541
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,706
- You've been here before?
- Yes.

542
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,879
So you are aware of the procedure?

543
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,839
Indeed.

544
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,658
Going well?

545
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,039
Yes, quite. Thank you.

546
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,820
As I said before, I'm leaving you
in very good hands, Mrs. Bellamy.

547
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,127
Oh..hahaha...

548
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,399
Thank you, Doctor.

549
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,471
Good day.

550
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,359
Shall we begin?

551
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,079
Sorry about that.

552
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,799
- You alright, Doctor?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

553
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,039
Here we go, then.

554
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,252
Please let me know
if anything is uncomfortable.

555
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,439
That's very nice, Doctor. Thank you.

556
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,719
Very nice, indeed.

557
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,439
Can't you understand?
It's an emergency.

558
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,759
The situation is desperate.

559
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,439
It's completely impossible, madame.

560
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,759
I'll do anything.

561
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:41,353
Mille grazie.

562
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,799
You are very welcome, signora.

563
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,239
Next.

564
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,159
You know, they're turning
patients away.

565
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,839
Really? I hadn't noticed.

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,199
It's all because of you.

567
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,399
These may be broken.

568
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,519
Something wrong with your hand?

569
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,839
Just a twinge.

570
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,119
Allow me.

571
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,639
You seem to have settled in nicely,
Dr. Granville.

572
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,159
Now, you may have noticed that I'm
not getting any younger,

573
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,919
and with only two daughters,

574
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,239
I have no one
to carry on the practice.

575
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,199
I was wondering whether
you might like to consider

576
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,279
becoming a partner.

577
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,079
Father, that's a wonderful idea.

578
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,239
I...I'm speechless.

579
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,639
And, who knows, if things go well,
this practice may end up yours.

580
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,799
Since my dear wife Melodia,
passed away,

581
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,678
God rest her soul,

582
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,919
Emily has diligently and
professionally managed the household.

583
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,559
I've no doubt that one day
she would make a fine doctor's wife,

584
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,199
with that experience.

585
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,959
Lovely.

586
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,879
I do hope I'm not expected to stay
here until after supper everyday.

587
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,679
I'm very sorry, Miss Smalley. I'll
be on schedule tomorrow. I promise.

588
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,879
I do hope so.

589
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,519
Righto. Just in here.

590
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,639
We'll set you down.

591
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,839
Miss Dalrymple, what a surprise.
I'm afraid that your father isn't here.

592
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,599
Good.

593
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,479
Well, in that case I must tell you
that we work only to appointment.

594
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,479
Fannie has broken her ankle. I was
hoping to persuade you to treat it?

595
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,879
I'll have the fish 'n' chips.

596
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,319
That's the rum talking.
It's all I had to ease the pain.

597
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,466
Normally I don't recommend
extreme drunkenness,

598
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,039
but it's probably a
very good choice.

599
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,079
Let have a look at it.

600
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,079
I should tell you, we've no money.

601
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,039
Good night, Miss Smalley.

602
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,519
Oh... Good night.

603
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,786
- Let's take her inside.
- Thank you.

604
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,279
I'm not wearing any knickers.

605
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,439
Well, I'm sure it's
an honest mistake.

606
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,799
Want a look?

607
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,079
- What are these for?
- I'll explain later.

608
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,773
- There we go.
- Lie back.

609
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,719
Very good.

610
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,000
- Now, Fannie...
- Yes.

611
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,639
I want you to count to three for me.
Can you do that?

612
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,759
Yes, I think so.

613
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,279
One,

614
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,719
two,

615
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,079
Ow!

616
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,559
You said three! Bloody hell!

617
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,199
She's out, I think.

618
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,599
Forgive me. I wanted
her thoughts elsewhere.

619
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,519
I need some plaster
for her ankle.

620
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,759
I didn't know my father had any proper
medical supplies in here anymore.

621
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,159
Crimean War surplus, I imagine.

622
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,039
Is your hand alright?

623
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,679
A bit stiff actually.

624
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,559
Why are you so opposed
to your father?

625
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,479
My father.

626
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,639
You know, he's never been
to the settlement house.

627
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,559
I simply wish he helped people
like Fannie who really need it,

628
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,479
instead of the trivial
work he does here.

629
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,799
It's hardly trivial.

630
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,639
That one is a little bit sloppy.
Thank you, nurse.

631
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,919
I apologize.

632
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,239
Hysteria is a disabling condition
suffered by half the women in this city.

633
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,719
Keeps you busy, I see.

634
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,159
Does wonders for
disagreeable personalities.

635
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,599
Do you find me disagreeable?

636
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,559
I've only ever seen you shout
at people and slam doors.

637
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,759
At least I've got the
courage of my convictions.

638
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,639
And few friends, I would imagine?

639
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,319
Good.

640
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,397
Well, I'll need to see you
again in six weeks, Fannie,

641
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:50,239
to remove the cast.

642
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,479
Thank you, Doctor.

643
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,079
Yes, you've been a great help.

644
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,439
You're both very welcome.

645
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,759
If you ever get bored
of nervous housewives,

646
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,959
feel free to pay us a visit.

647
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,959
Hello, Mortimer.

648
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,039
Please, sit down.

649
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,100
Emily...

650
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,286
I've been... Oh, Emily...

651
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,559
I've been thinking.

652
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,879
Should things progress
as your father suggested,

653
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,959
and I one day
inherit the practice,

654
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,799
what would your
feelings be, about...

655
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,199
well, an arrangement?

656
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,679
Mortimer...

657
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,409
I should be honoured.

658
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,719
Most especially as it will
make father so happy.

659
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,599
Right... right.

660
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:55,727
Umm...

661
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,959
Oh, that's settled.

662
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,302
Duty first, as always, Emily.

663
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,719
Life is of little value unless
it be consecrated by duty.

664
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,159
Oh, quite, yes.

665
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,719
Granville.

666
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,199
A word?

667
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,639
I must insist that you give Charlotte
no further assistance of any sort.

668
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,479
It merely prolongs her relationship
with those people and that place.

669
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,199
The woman had a broken ankle.

670
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,679
Well, I admire your dedication, Doctor,

671
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,679
but we can't have day-labourers
traipsing through the office.

672
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,279
This is a very exclusive,

673
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,296
and, I might add, lucrative practice.
Appearances matter.

674
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,789
I have taken a solemn oath, sir.

675
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,060
I thought we had an
understanding, you and I,

676
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,212
about your future here.

677
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,239
That's the last of it, Miss.

678
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,159
Oh, Jack, thank you.

679
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,500
Now, then.
It's two hundred late today,

680
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,319
plus what's on account...

681
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,489
three, carry the one...

682
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,919
seven and six, I think.

683
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,800
Yes, that looks right.
May I pay you Friday next?

684
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,879
I'm sorry, miss,
but the gov was very clear.

685
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,208
Cash only, he said,
and get the balance.

686
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,759
Would you tell your employer,

687
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,599
that my father, Dr. Dalrymple,

688
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,167
has absolutely promised
a very large donation

689
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:45,279
to the settlement house
this coming Friday,

690
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,119
and I will bring him the money myself?

691
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,959
I'll make it stick, miss.

692
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,799
Nobody appreciates more
than me what you've done here.

693
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,439
My boy Frank says you're the
strawberries and the cream.

694
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,297
- Shush... Friday, then.
- Ta!

695
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,844
Mortimer, must you wear
that ghastly hand brace?

696
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,519
I must find some way to attend
to these women properly.

697
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,119
I believe the French have quite
a bit of luck using their tongues.

698
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,359
Please be serious.
We're speaking of my patients.

699
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,799
They need me.

700
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,359
Perhaps for the first time, I feel...

701
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,199
truly useful.

702
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,119
Aren't you a rainy day?

703
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,479
- Oh, don't worry, something will come along, simply...
- Oww!!

704
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,359
I wish I could
share your optimism.

705
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,439
Oh... Excuse me.

706
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:31,973
Just... just...

707
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,831
- Dr. Granville.
- Oh...

708
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,399
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I think so.

709
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:41,517
Thank you.

710
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,180
Are you quite finished, Doctor?

711
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,919
Edmund, this is Emily's
sister, Charlotte.

712
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,359
Charlotte Dalrymple,

713
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,519
Edmund St. John Smythe.

714
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh, Edmund Smythe from the papers.

715
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,919
Overblown, I assure you.

716
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,737
I attended that party only as
a favour to a dear friend,

717
00:41:59,738 --> 00:42:02,955
and I can swear that I never met
that horse before in my life.

718
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,239
Sounds as if you had a jolly good time.

719
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,539
Well, actually I did, rather.

720
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,359
What brings you
to the West End, Miss Dalrymple?

721
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,159
Begging for money,
unsuccessfully 'til now.

722
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,199
Ah, yes. Miss Dalrymple runs a
settlement house in the East End.

723
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,039
How fascinating.

724
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,959
I must be going.

725
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,399
Oh, it seems that
your hand is no better.

726
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,679
It must be difficult pleasuring
half the women in the city.

727
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,319
Madame, pleasure has nothing
to do with it. I can assure you.

728
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,399
Well, I suppose that depends on whether
you're over the table or on it.

729
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,439
Bye!

730
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,239
Isn't she a Chinese firecracker?

731
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,759
You know how much we admire
your spirit, Charlotte,

732
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,159
and we're lifelong
friends of your father,

733
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,279
but this element you work with
are nothing more than

734
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,679
the draught horses of society.
I don't see how charity will help.

735
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,560
If not charity, perhaps a loan.

736
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,279
A loan? How much?

737
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,239
Two hundred pounds.

738
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,099
Generally, a loan has
some security, dear.

739
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,999
They were my mother's.
They should cover the balance and more.

740
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,119
We will give you two hundred
pounds at eight percent interest.

741
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,719
Thank you.

742
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,974
Now I want you to be sure you understand
this is strictly business, Charlotte.

743
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:13,679
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

744
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,159
We won't hesitate to collect.

745
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,519
I understand.

746
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,919
Thank you.

747
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,319
Mr. Huddleston.

748
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,599
Thank you. Thank you for your
time and your generosity...

749
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,919
Mrs. Huddleston, thank you.

750
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,919
It means a great deal
to so many people.

751
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:29,350
Thank you! Thank you!

752
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,319
Scandalous.

753
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,999
Hello?

754
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,199
Dr. Granville.

755
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,319
Trawling for patients?

756
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,039
I'm afraid you'll find no
cases of hysteria here.

757
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,279
Women are all too busy trying
to find enough to eat.

758
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,479
Ah, Miss Dalrymple.
Always speaking out of turn.

759
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,412
No. I came to enquire about
Miss Fannie's broken ankle.

760
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,919
A house call?

761
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,239
Surely there's no harm in
following up with a patient?

762
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,799
None at all.

763
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,879
No pain?

764
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,039
No. Nothing.

765
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,279
I was going to take her
to see you on Friday.

766
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,039
There's no bother.
I was in the neighbourhood.

767
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,801
I was...
I was near the neighbourhood.

768
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,706
- How's that feel?
- Fine. Thank you, Doctor.

769
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,239
Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor?

770
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,079
Oh, no, thank you.

771
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,959
Dr. Granville, it's
the least we can offer.

772
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,959
Yes, alright, then.
A cup of tea would be lovely.

773
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,459
- Take it easy on that for a few days.
- Yes, Doctor.

774
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,079
Very good. I won't be a moment.
You can wait just through there.

775
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:52,358
Hello.

776
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,079
Hang on.

777
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,639
Just getting to the good bit.

778
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,976
Thank you. I wouldn't
have been able to sleep,

779
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:07,279
without knowing how
that turned out.

780
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,067
- Milk, Doctor?
- Please.

781
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,599
We use this room
mostly as a nursery.

782
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,879
We do fit in the odd
bit of teaching, now and then.

783
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,599
Promoting some aggressive
political agenda, no doubt.

784
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,959
Sums and letters mostly.

785
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,199
Occasionally, we sneak in
something slightly progressive.

786
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,519
Oh, you might like this.
Actually, look. For example,

787
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,279
this is where
the children wash their hands.

788
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,949
We use soap and boiled water.

789
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,197
We do our best to keep
the settlement sanitary,

790
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:36,759
but, you can't imagine
the filth and the germs.

791
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,159
You know about germs?

792
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,319
I do read, Doctor.

793
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,135
I spent years trying to convince
the medical establishment

794
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,559
that hand-washing
prevents disease,

795
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,679
unsuccessfully, and then here you
are teaching it to the children.

796
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,959
And with great success.

797
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,289
I know. With the parents
it's another story,

798
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,879
but, eventually, the children
will teach them themselves.

799
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:55,222
Bravo.

800
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,559
For the women, we're
trying to provide services

801
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,559
that will offer the
most direct result:

802
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,719
Good hot meal. Safe place for
their children and communal laundry.

803
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,798
I think that if we can ease
their work-load a bit,

804
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,439
we could get on to the important
work of changing their minds.

805
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,959
You, Madame, are a socialist.

806
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,319
A socialist?

807
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,439
What if I am?

808
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,139
Are there not eight oarsmen and crew?

809
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,559
Socialism, at its heart,

810
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,679
is nothing more than
a group pulling together.

811
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,759
If women pulled together,
if they weren't so frightened,

812
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,599
there's no telling what
we could accomplish.

813
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,999
And this revolution that you're planning,
will you achieve it all from here?

814
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,839
Drop a stone in a pond,
and it will make ripples.

815
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,439
It is a bit like a pond. It is true. I noticed.
- Yes.

816
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,239
The building adjacent,

817
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,385
and the one behind, are both
for sale for two thousand pounds.

818
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,100
Put them together, and we're
not just a classroom and a kitchen.

819
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,999
We're a centre for the
neighbourhood, with a garden,

820
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,999
a proper school;
maybe even a medical clinic.

821
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,679
Two thousand pounds is aiming
quite high, don't you think?

822
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,039
No, I don't think so.

823
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,879
I know, by the time I'm gone,
women will have the vote,

824
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,159
they'll have equal education
and rights over their own bodies,

825
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,359
and I'd like to play some small
part in making that happen.

826
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,257
Absolutely, and then,
you should teach them how to fly.

827
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,399
I would.

828
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,679
You just wait and see, Doctor.

829
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,479
I'd like to see your face.

830
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,559
Your passion, your devotion
to this work is admirable.

831
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,159
Honestly,

832
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,719
I get much more
out of it than they do.

833
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,519
They only get food and laundry,
and I'm given a useful life,

834
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,079
and I set my own hours.

835
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,479
You know,

836
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,079
I could really use the help of
an able doctor on a more regular basis.

837
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,519
Broken ankles are the least of it.

838
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,879
All the children suffer from
malnutrition, rickets, scurvy,

839
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,879
even cholera and typhus.

840
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,599
All preventable, as you know,

841
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,639
with knowledge and resources.

842
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,279
I'm afraid my patients
keep me very busy.

843
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,639
I only mean...
I only mean a weekend a month.

844
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,759
I don't believe
I would have the time.

845
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,800
Or even a few hours on a Sunday.
Anything would help.

846
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,879
I'm sorry.

847
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,685
- Please. Please.
- Miss Dalrymple.

848
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,679
I'm afraid I can't help.

849
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
You can't,

850
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,399
or you won't?

851
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,119
It's a bit more complex than that.

852
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,679
I know, I know. It's...

853
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,319
It's my father.
He wouldn't allow it, would he?

854
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,319
Is that why you came here?

855
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,319
To keep me from bringing Fannie
back to his posh little practice?

856
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,519
Thank you for the tea.

857
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,359
Run along, Doctor. Back to your...

858
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,799
silly, comfortable life.

859
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,639
Mrs. Castellari, Doctor.

860
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,661
- Send her in, Nurse.
- Mrs. Castellari?

861
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,239
Mrs. Castellari, how are you?

862
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,719
Sad, Dottore.

863
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,519
Very sad today.

864
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,679
Good, good.
Lie back, please.

865
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,471
Aii!!!

866
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,614
Your hand is so cold, Dottore.

867
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,319
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Castellari.
I forgot.

868
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:39,749
Yes.

869
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,519
Is that better?

870
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,439
I think that's enough
for today, Dottore.

871
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,359
Feeling better, then?

872
00:51:10,783 --> 00:51:11,783
Mrs. Castellari!

873
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,649
Mrs. Castellari!

874
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,309
I assure you Mrs. Castellari,
this has never happened to me before.

875
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,159
You have discredited
my entire practice.

876
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,199
I'm very sorry.

877
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,599
Sorry will hardly suffice.

878
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,119
Your disability is clearly far more
serious than you led me to believe.

879
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,079
Mrs. Castellari tells me you failed
to complete the treatment,

880
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,799
and now,

881
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,799
I discovered that Mrs. Parsons
has stopped coming altogether.

882
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,686
If you could only see your way
towards giving me one more chance,

883
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:44,439
I can assure you...

884
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,599
No.

885
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,839
I thought you were someone
I could trust,

886
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,039
with my business, my family,

887
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,159
my reputation,

888
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,134
but, clearly I was mistaken.

889
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,679
You're dismissed.

890
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,879
- Doctor...
- Dismissed!

891
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,359
I'm terribly sorry.

892
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,319
I'm finished, Edmund.

893
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,399
Completely buggered.

894
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,319
I had the perfect life within
reach, and I lost it.

895
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,159
All due to hand cramps.

896
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,599
God!

897
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,039
Someone is telephoning!

898
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,999
Ahoy!

899
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,919
I didn't know you had a telephone.

900
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,679
<i>I'm very, very flattered. Yeah.</i>

901
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,959
<i>Oh, yes, indeed.</i>

902
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:30,284
<i>I'm in my studio. Studio!</i>

903
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,199
My God!

904
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,239
No, I'm inventing a new cleaning tool.

905
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,919
Yes. Very good.

906
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:43,138
Yes.

907
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,359
Well, yes, do that. Stay...

908
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,622
Got to rush, actually, now.
Goodbye.

909
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,559
Don't stop.

910
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,159
I think you're enjoying
yourself too much.

911
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,519
It makes your hand feel all...
all warm and tingly.

912
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,999
I feel it right down to the bone.

913
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,039
Oh, really?

914
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,759
Turn it back on.

915
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,959
Please.

916
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,459
That's bloody marvelous!

917
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,559
Well, that's what I call
good, steady pressure!

918
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,759
Does it go any higher?

919
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,919
Go on!

920
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,479
That's it! That's the spot!

921
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,999
My feathers!

922
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,839
That is the spot, indeed!

923
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,839
Bugger.

924
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,519
Do you smell burning?

925
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,319
But, you said yourself that you could feel
the vibration deep inside your hand.

926
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,959
I know what I said,

927
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,719
but this is crude,
and rough, and inexact,

928
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,919
and nothing at all like
the motion and pressure that I use.

929
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,839
Well, it didn't seem that much at the time.

930
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,439
Well, I grant you.

931
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,959
If this works,

932
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,359
it could put you back in good
standing with Dr. Dalrymple and Emily.

933
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,479
Edmund, let me be perfectly
clear about this.

934
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,759
We are not going to take

935
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,599
a dangerous, explosive, and
untried electrical device

936
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,839
and press it against
a lady's most gentle areas.

937
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,919
That's it, then.

938
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,639
I believe I shall regret this
to the very end of my days.

939
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,879
Now, who should we try it on?

940
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,919
Ordinarily, for five pounds, I
wouldn't ask questions.

941
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,679
That's with a man.
This is a different kettle of fish.

942
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,079
I don't believe it will involve
any pain, but if it does,

943
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,359
we will stop immediately.

944
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,519
Think of it this way, Molly.

945
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,239
For one brief moment, you can be
a pioneer of technology,

946
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,639
a voyage of the British Empire,

947
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,982
and, quite possibly, the
vanguard of modern medical science.

948
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,479
And we pay up front.

949
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,319
Why not?

950
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:28,894
Ol.

951
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,679
Do your worst.

952
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,248
- Ooh!
- Are you hurt?

953
00:56:49,249 --> 00:56:50,119
No.

954
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,919
No, it just gave me a fright, that's all.

955
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,279
Never felt nothing like that before.

956
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,759
Shall I stop?

957
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,359
No, no. We'll try again.
I'll be ready this time.

958
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,919
Oh, right there, love.

959
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,279
Oh, that's lovely.

960
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,599
How do you feel, Molly?

961
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,639
Bloody marvellous. How do you think?

962
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,628
Would you say you had a paroxysm?

963
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,039
I'd say I had three from counting, boy.

964
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,959
It got a bit muddy in the middle.

965
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,719
It's astonishing.

966
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,479
What you call that little thing?

967
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,519
Well, I was calling
it the feather duster.

968
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,359
Well, then, think
of something quick,

969
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,319
so a girl knows what to ask for.

970
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,919
Horsefeathers.

971
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,279
I give you my word
as a gentleman, sir.

972
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,519
Three paroxysms in five minutes.

973
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,319
No harm came to the girl?

974
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,079
She was completely satisfied
with the result.

975
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,879
Yes, well, I can hardly take
the word of a trollop.

976
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,919
That's why we must try it here.

977
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,679
Medical science demands
a thorough investigation,

978
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,460
and what better place to
start than with these women,

979
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:42,079
whom we know suffer
so from hysteria?

980
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,359
Yes, well, in my opinion,
change is rarely beneficial.

981
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,639
I believe we are on the verge
of something revolutionary, sir.

982
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,079
If we achieve half
as much of your patients,

983
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,959
all credit goes to you.

984
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,679
Not just money, fame.

985
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,039
Three paroxysms
in five minutes, you say?

986
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,279
Very well.
One test case,

987
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,119
but if she comes to harm,
on your head be it.

988
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,399
<i>The Rubby-Nubby.</i>

989
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,119
- <i>The Vibratorium.</i>

990
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,799
<i>Jiggly-Wiggly?</i>

991
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,999
- <i>Paroxysmator.</i>

992
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,839
<i>Oh! The Sorcerer's Apprentice.</i>

993
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,119
<i>- The Excitetator.
- Mr. Wobble-neck.</i>

994
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,919
<i>What about "The Squealer"?</i>

995
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,759
You're going to need
a bigger appointment book.

996
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,519
Electric massage?

997
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,119
I don't know.

998
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,999
I have full confidence that the
machine will equal, if not better,

999
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,719
any treatment you've had before,

1000
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,039
and, since you were so
unsatisfied last time,

1001
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,359
I'm prepared to offer
you this gratis.

1002
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,919
I'll trust you, Dottore.

1003
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,519
This is Mr. Edmund St...

1004
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,399
That is, my electrical assistant.

1005
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,399
He'll be attending, as well,
if that's alright?

1006
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,559
It's a little surprising at first,
Mrs. Castellari, but don't be alarmed,

1007
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,439
you'll soon get used to it.

1008
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,679
Everything all right,
Mrs. Castellari?

1009
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:53,851
Bravo!

1010
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,399
Well done.

1011
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,239
So, don't forget to chain the gate,

1012
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,159
and, oh, I left a candle
lit in the kitchen.

1013
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,039
Go, and have a lovely evening.

1014
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,919
Do you know? I think I will.

1015
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,359
Bye.

1016
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,119
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1017
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,039
Oh, I'm sorry. We're closing.

1018
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,159
Get her out of there.

1019
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,759
Two hundred pounds, plus interest,
or we lock the gate.

1020
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,119
But I don't have it!

1021
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,639
Right. I'm locking the gate.

1022
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,359
Get of me!

1023
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,625
- No doubt, you're the luckiest man in all of London.
- Miss Dalrymple.

1024
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,159
Miss Charlotte Dalrymple.

1025
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,319
Will you excuse me, ladies?

1026
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,119
Miss Dalrymple.

1027
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,359
Dr. Granville, good evening.

1028
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,119
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll
make my sister very happy.

1029
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,199
Something wrong?

1030
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,359
No, no.

1031
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,999
I just never seen you so...

1032
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,999
Formally attired?

1033
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,319
I was going to say...

1034
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,839
clean.

1035
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,559
Dr. Granville, I can assure you

1036
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,644
that women enjoy physical pleasure
just as much as men,

1037
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:10,759
even if it can be
long to come by.

1038
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,319
Physical pleasure has
nothing to do with it.

1039
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,159
It is strictly a medical treatment
that stimulates the nervous system.

1040
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,319
Indeed it does, and it's
a bargain at a guinea,

1041
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,879
but my point is,

1042
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,279
according to your diagnosis,
hysteria seems to cover everything,

1043
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,439
from insomnia to toothache.

1044
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,420
- It's not my...
- It's nothing more than a catch-all

1045
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:28,420
for dissatisfied women.

1046
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,839
Women, forced to spend
their lives on domestic chores,

1047
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,639
and their prudish and
selfish husbands who are unwilling

1048
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,679
or unable to make love to them
properly, or often enough.

1049
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,359
You seem to have strong opinions on
husbands for a woman who doesn't have one.

1050
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,399
Look, if you don't believe me,

1051
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,319
ask your patients.

1052
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,879
Faintly ironic, don't you think,
to use my engagement party

1053
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,183
as an opportunity to deliver
your opinion on marriage?

1054
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:53,197
Yes, yes, and I apologize
for that, but you must admit,

1055
01:04:53,198 --> 01:04:55,359
you men really did get the
best side of the bargain.

1056
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,199
Bargain?

1057
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,639
For us, it's mindless housework
and doting on some halfwit.

1058
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,542
You can make some halfwit very happy.

1059
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:02,959
It's simply not enough for me,
or for most women.

1060
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,279
Would it be enough for you?

1061
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,119
Oh, I'm not most women.
Won't you be lonely?

1062
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,279
I would take a partner,
an equal,

1063
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,039
but, not for me a life of darning
socks, and doing chores

1064
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,759
until my mental faculties
become Sunday pudding.

1065
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,159
Does someone say Sunday pudding?

1066
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,839
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe,
may I present Miss Dalrymple.

1067
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,839
Miss Dalrymple, my guardians.
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe.

1068
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,719
Charlotte "Sunday pudding" Dalrymple.

1069
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,879
So pleased to meet you, my dear.

1070
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,319
I love a good Sunday pudding.

1071
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,319
We cannot be happier
for you, Mortimer.

1072
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,280
You make us proud
each and every day.

1073
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:36,999
Thank you.

1074
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,319
What lovely earrings.

1075
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,519
Oh, thank you. They were my mother's.

1076
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,558
And will your mother be
joining us this evening?

1077
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,239
No, my mother is, in
fact, dead, my Lord.

1078
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,858
I trust we didn't waste
an invitation on her.

1079
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,599
What about your father?

1080
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,799
Will he be here or
is he dead, as well?

1081
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,679
No, my father is quite well,
thank you.

1082
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,582
I've not seen him, but I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

1083
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,279
Oh, hurry up. Damn you.

1084
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,399
Get a move on!

1085
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,759
Don't want to keep the love of
your life waiting, my dear.

1086
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,119
A toast to the happy couple.

1087
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,839
You'll soon find that the key
to a happy marriage

1088
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,479
- is the ability to enjoy a good argument.
- Yes.

1089
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,608
Do remember to let him win
once in a while, my dear.

1090
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:29,599
Oh... Oh... no, no.

1091
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,239
There's a misunderstanding.

1092
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,373
I would rather marry Edmund
than Dr. Granville.

1093
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:34,639
Marry Edmund?

1094
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,519
By Jove, she's a live one.

1095
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,359
Who is this man?

1096
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,359
That's my father.

1097
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,740
I thought he was dead.

1098
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,879
May I present,
Dr. Robert Dalrymple.

1099
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,679
My Lord.

1100
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,024
And this is my fiance,
Emily Dalrymple.

1101
01:06:58,025 --> 01:06:59,199
Fiance? But I thought...

1102
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,126
Never mind, dear.

1103
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,399
- How very nice to meet you, Doctor.
- My Lady

1104
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,998
Miss Dalrymple.

1105
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,319
I do apologize for being so late.

1106
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,239
That's quite alright.

1107
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,244
Your hair is most
adventurous, Emily.

1108
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,159
Oh, do you think so?

1109
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,279
It took ever so long
to get it up there.

1110
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,639
Shall we do the once-around?

1111
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:21,351
- Oh, yes!
- Excuse us.

1112
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,399
Port, Doctor?

1113
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,199
Delightful.

1114
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,359
And tell me how you met
our young Mortimer.

1115
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,869
Lovely party.

1116
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,999
Yes. Yes, it is.

1117
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,199
What are your interests?

1118
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,719
Music, I enjoy reading,

1119
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,759
- Phrenology.
- My!

1120
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,239
Mortimer was so modest.

1121
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,479
He failed to tell us how widely
accomplished you are.

1122
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,210
Phrenology is a treasure
map to the personality,

1123
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,679
if one is properly trained.

1124
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,919
We are licensing this machine
to doctors all over London.

1125
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,439
For a very generous royalty,
of course.

1126
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,159
I despise business.

1127
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,325
So do I.

1128
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,672
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Huddleston!
Come, let me introduce you.

1129
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,599
Good evening, Mr. Huddleston.

1130
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,999
Mrs. Huddleston,
do you know Dr. Granville?

1131
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,118
Not personally.

1132
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,039
- Very nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

1133
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,359
Looks as though you are going to be
getting these earrings, after all.

1134
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,719
You'll have to excuse us.

1135
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,959
I'm sorry.

1136
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,239
That was a little odd.

1137
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,328
These earrings are security against
a loan for the settlement house

1138
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:41,319
which is due tomorrow.

1139
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,199
So this is my last
night with them.

1140
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,199
They were your mother's.

1141
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,159
Yes, they were.

1142
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,759
You do what you must.

1143
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,559
I'm sure she would have approved.

1144
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,039
Bugger.

1145
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,545
Throughout history,

1146
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,662
great English families
have gathered in halls such as these,

1147
01:09:34,663 --> 01:09:36,839
to celebrate the impending nuptials...

1148
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,174
Lord save us.

1149
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,179
- Charlotte! Miss Charlotte!
- Stop! You can't go in there!

1150
01:09:40,204 --> 01:09:41,404
Arrest her!

1151
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,079
Tell me! What happened?

1152
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,799
They came for the money.
I told them that I didn't have it...

1153
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,279
Mr. Huddleston, what's the meaning of this?
You gave us until Monday.

1154
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,679
I no longer hold the note, Charlotte.
Your father does.

1155
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,720
Father?

1156
01:09:55,721 --> 01:09:57,359
Charlotte, calm down.

1157
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,159
I'm simply doing what's best for you.

1158
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,359
What are you doing?

1159
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,199
I purchased the note
from Mr. Huddleston,

1160
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,319
and I'm closing down the settlement house.
You no longer have any debt...

1161
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,168
These are the actions of a villain.

1162
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,599
- Charlotte.
- Of a villain!

1163
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,480
This is your sister's
engagement party.

1164
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,679
Party? She's bruised and bleeding.
You want me to consider a party?

1165
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,159
<i>Make way, please.</i>

1166
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,184
<i>Excuse me. Thank you.
Coming through.</i>

1167
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,239
- Leave her.
- This is a private party.

1168
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,879
Do not manhandle her!

1169
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,919
Let me handle this.

1170
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,919
We've got this under control.

1171
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,079
I'm a doctor. I believe
this woman needs medical attention.

1172
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,399
I don't know that, sir, but I
do know she's not staying.

1173
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,519
I haven't done anything wrong.

1174
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,899
Please stop. She's hurt.

1175
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,999
Please, Charlotte!

1176
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,479
If we could just discuss
this like civilized men.

1177
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,759
Let me by!

1178
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,579
I said, let me by!

1179
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,679
Damn!
Did I miss something?

1180
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,119
I would never have imagined
it would come to this.

1181
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,439
But we have to help her.

1182
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,519
I've done nothing but, Emily.

1183
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,719
I've tried indulging her.
I've tried a firm hand.

1184
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,680
I'm at my wit's end.

1185
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:38,479
Mortimer.

1186
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,839
Please, she's my sister.

1187
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,407
What would you have me do?

1188
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:44,704
You must testify on her behalf.

1189
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,759
- And say what?
- The truth.

1190
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,319
That she's hysterical.

1191
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,959
Sir, they will send her
to a sanatorium.

1192
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,159
That is the only thing that
will keep her out of prison.

1193
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,800
Order!
Order!

1194
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,039
This court will come to order.

1195
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,959
The facts are these, Your Honour.

1196
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,599
One fortnight ago,
the defendant, Charlotte Dalrymple,

1197
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,425
in full view of witnesses,

1198
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,479
assaulted a police constable
carrying out his duty.

1199
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,239
If this were a first offense,

1200
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,439
then a short prison sentence
might suffice, but

1201
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,681
this isn't a first offence,
is it, Miss Dalrymple?

1202
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,959
You were arrested last April

1203
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,679
on public nuisance,

1204
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,134
and resisting arrest.

1205
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:20,695
Your Honour, I was handing out

1206
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,879
suffragette leaflets
in Trafalgar Square

1207
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,639
when two officers arrested me.

1208
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,679
The officers' sworn statements read:

1209
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,559
"Miss Dalrymple was asked
to leave the square,

1210
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,239
whereupon she started

1211
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,959
to shout and jump about."

1212
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,159
"When finally we did try
to place her in handcuffs,

1213
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,479
she resisted most violently."

1214
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,879
No. That is not true.

1215
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,359
You will speak only when
questioned, Miss Dalrymple.

1216
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,679
Well, how am I to defend myself against
his accusation if you won't let me speak?

1217
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,279
Is there more?

1218
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,799
I'm afraid there is, Your Honour.

1219
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,719
October 1879, solicitation.

1220
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,399
No, that was not me.

1221
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,519
My friend, Molly,

1222
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,511
she is a prostitute.
She was a prostitute.

1223
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,119
She has since found
gainful employment,

1224
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,239
as a maid, in my father's house.

1225
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,359
Anything else, Mr. Squyers?

1226
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,319
No, Your Honour.

1227
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,159
No? Nothing else?
What's of the crime

1228
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,079
of charity and compassion?

1229
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,159
Very admirable I'm sure.

1230
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,015
It seems that this help
included prostitution,

1231
01:14:25,016 --> 01:14:27,839
resisting arrest, and
assaulting police officers.

1232
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,240
One could only imagine
the cost to England,

1233
01:14:30,241 --> 01:14:32,719
should we extend a university
education to all her women.

1234
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,199
Yes, it's very easy, isn't it,

1235
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,239
to make fun of women's lives?

1236
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,639
I would like to see you walk
for one mile in our shoes.

1237
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,879
I imagine that your
mirth would turn first

1238
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,218
to sympathy and then to despair.

1239
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:50,519
Careful, Miss Dalrymple.
Your symptoms are showing.

1240
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,639
Until England fully recognizes

1241
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,159
the worth and contributions of women,

1242
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,919
will she be anything other
than a second-class country

1243
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,279
despite all her wealth.

1244
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,679
That's enough, Miss Dalrymple.

1245
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,759
Your Honour, Charlotte
Dalrymple clearly suffers from

1246
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,799
erratic, aggressive,
and violent emotions

1247
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,239
that are best described
as incurable hysteria.

1248
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,279
To buttress my opinion,
I would like to call

1249
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,199
an expert witness, Your Honour.

1250
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,039
Proceed, Mr. Squyers.

1251
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,878
I would like to call
Dr. Mortimer Granville,

1252
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,359
if it please the court.

1253
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,359
Mortimer Granville, please.

1254
01:15:42,259 --> 01:15:44,259
Dr. Mortimer Granville.

1255
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,319
Your Honour.

1256
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,119
The evidence you shall give
shall be the truth,

1257
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,959
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

1258
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,719
It will.

1259
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,479
State your name.

1260
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,839
Mortimer Granville.

1261
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,910
Now, I'm sure we all, are well aware
of your celebrity, Doctor.

1262
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:14,850
But, if you wouldn't
mind just telling us

1263
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:16,788
a little of your
professional experience.

1264
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,387
I'm a medical doctor
whose practice consists

1265
01:16:20,388 --> 01:16:22,439
of treating women
diagnosed with hysteria.

1266
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,919
And in this capacity, how
many women have you treated?

1267
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:26,719
Hundreds, certainly.

1268
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,239
And always good results, I trust?

1269
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,119
we've had few complaints of late.

1270
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,599
Is it true, Dr. Granville, that
incurable cases of hysteria

1271
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,157
demand institutionalization
and surgical hysterectomy?

1272
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,669
Please answer the question,
Dr. Granville.

1273
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,599
Well, yes.

1274
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,879
Traditionally, yes,

1275
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,839
but only in the most severe,
most persistent cases.

1276
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,279
Thank you, Doctor.

1277
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,239
We have already addressed the...

1278
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,011
the persistence of Miss
Dalrymple's problem.

1279
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,639
Now, in your professional opinion, Doctor,
as an expert in the field of hysteria,

1280
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,999
how would you describe
Miss Dalrymple's behaviour?

1281
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,839
Without a doubt,

1282
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,679
Charlotte Dalrymple is...

1283
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,159
erratic,

1284
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,559
and volatile,

1285
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,319
and, at times, physically aggressive.

1286
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,639
She is also the most vexing
woman I have ever met.

1287
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,079
Thank you, Doctor.

1288
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,400
Your Honour, based on this evidence,

1289
01:17:33,401 --> 01:17:35,679
I find that I must recommend

1290
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,561
that Charlotte
Dalrymple be remanded

1291
01:17:37,562 --> 01:17:40,119
to the Chelmsford Institute
for the Criminally Insane,

1292
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,799
with a further recommendation

1293
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,189
for immediate surgical hysterectomy.

1294
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,639
I wasn't quite finished.

1295
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,647
Miss Dalrymple is also
the most generous, compassionate,

1296
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,039
selfless, and truly Christian

1297
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,039
woman that I have ever met.

1298
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,759
Doctor, you have just sworn
that she is erratic,

1299
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,959
volatile,

1300
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,359
even physically aggressive.

1301
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,319
Would you not characterize
that as hysterical?

1302
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,679
Well, you see,

1303
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,639
after consulting with my patients

1304
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,319
and considerable reflection,

1305
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,159
it is my professional opinion

1306
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,091
that hysteria is a fiction.

1307
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,639
It's nothing but a...

1308
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,359
a catch-all diagnosis
for women without opportunity,

1309
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,719
forced to spend their life
tending to domestic chores

1310
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,959
and selfish, prudish
husbands who are

1311
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,279
unwilling or unable

1312
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,879
to make love to them properly.

1313
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,519
Or often enough.

1314
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,399
I beg your pardon, Doctor...

1315
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,399
Your Honour,

1316
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,199
the constable suffered
no grave injury,

1317
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,371
but great harm may still be done

1318
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,839
if Miss Dalrymple is
locked away and butchered,

1319
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,159
and England will lose a devoted
and singular woman

1320
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,963
she can ill afford to spare.

1321
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,040
I grant you, there may
not be room in the world

1322
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:12,239
for more than
one Charlotte Dalrymple.

1323
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,879
Fortunately for all of us,

1324
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,319
I think they must have
broken the mould.

1325
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,719
In the case of Charlotte Dalrymple,

1326
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,538
there are no easy answers.

1327
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,837
Mr. Squyers,

1328
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,839
I find your case for hysteria

1329
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,559
wanting.

1330
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,039
By your reasoning,
we should lock up every female in

1331
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,119
the whimsy in logic
collide, which would

1332
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,439
suggest to me most of
the women in England.

1333
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,327
My wife included.

1334
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,119
On the other matter, however,

1335
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,879
I am loathe to offer
precedent where

1336
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,199
a policeman's safety
is concerned.

1337
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,879
Miss Dalrymple,

1338
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,319
for striking a police officer
in the course of his duty,

1339
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,227
I sentence you to

1340
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,997
thirty days in prison,

1341
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,239
and I admonish you

1342
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,119
to think most carefully, and act
most cautiously in the future.

1343
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,679
Take her.

1344
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,519
Miss Dalrymple.

1345
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,239
Dr. Granville.

1346
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,718
I suppose I now owe you my uterus.

1347
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,679
That's an interesting offer.

1348
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,119
Something to meditate on while
I consider a new career.

1349
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,839
Mortimer Granville, you are a good
doctor, and you should remain one,

1350
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,199
instead of leeching and bleeding
people, and cutting them up to no purpose.

1351
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,519
You have invented a machine
that does harm to no one,

1352
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,399
and makes anyone had comes into
contact with it feel better.

1353
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,912
I should think there are
very few doctors in history

1354
01:21:03,913 --> 01:21:05,679
that could lay claim to
such an accomplishment.

1355
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:06,904
<i>Come on, miss.</i>

1356
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,239
You are a confounding woman.

1357
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,183
You're all fire and
brimstone one minute,

1358
01:21:12,184 --> 01:21:13,839
compliments and common
sense the next.

1359
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,772
I am a woman like any other.

1360
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,408
No, no. You're quite unlike
any women I've ever met.

1361
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,423
Will you be alright?

1362
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,165
I'm fine. I've got
lots of friends in prison.

1363
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,388
Mortimer.

1364
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,639
I thought I might find you here.

1365
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,439
I've been thinking
a lot about my future.

1366
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,119
And, well, actually,

1367
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,279
I was wondering if you might
give me a reading.

1368
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,279
I'm sorry. I've giving up phrenology.

1369
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,879
Oh, Emily, I'm...

1370
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,479
I'm so sorry.

1371
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,759
Don't be.

1372
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,519
Charlotte's trial was
a revelation for me as well.

1373
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,938
I realized I haven't been
living my life at all.

1374
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,720
I've been living my father's
idea of what my life should be

1375
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:12,639
Phrenology, Chopin,

1376
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,439
even you, Mortimer.

1377
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,479
You seem happy.

1378
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,879
I am.

1379
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,213
After all, life will always
be, to a large extent,

1380
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:25,639
what we ourselves make it.

1381
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,679
The inimitable Mr. Smiles.
I shall miss him.

1382
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,498
And I shall miss you.

1383
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,959
God, you're naughty.

1384
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,519
I should never send you anything.

1385
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,607
No, no. Not even for Christmas.

1386
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,399
<i>You must go out and
purchase one for yourself.</i>

1387
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,759
God bless you, Mum.

1388
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,559
It is a clever old woman who can
keep up with today's technology.

1389
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,680
Alright, then.

1390
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,119
Lovely chatting to you.

1391
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,239
Ring me anytime.
Goodbye.

1392
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,840
Any prospects?

1393
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,740
No, my name is mud.

1394
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,479
Open this.

1395
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,440
I told you before,
I don't want your money.

1396
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:21,399
It's not my money, it's yours.

1397
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,799
It's your share of the royalties

1398
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,799
from our manufacturers.

1399
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,519
The portable electric massager.

1400
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,879
The portable electric massager?

1401
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,958
Yes, I told you I was working
on something rather exciting.

1402
01:23:35,959 --> 01:23:38,719
You see, I made a very small motor,

1403
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,559
and it seemed to go really well,
so I showed it to a few firms,

1404
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,479
and they simply adored it,

1405
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,519
and apparently,

1406
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,679
they're selling it directly
to women for home use.

1407
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,519
I really have to admit, I never
thought it would go so high,

1408
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,479
but, it is a rather ingenious
device, even if I say so myself.

1409
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,815
Don't you understand, Mortimer?
You have your fortune now.

1410
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,719
You can have anything you want.

1411
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,399
Miss Dalrymple.

1412
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,999
Dr. Granville.

1413
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,039
Hello.

1414
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,079
Merry Christmas.

1415
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,839
I realize it's a day early, but
I thought you might need it.

1416
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,639
I don't know what to say.

1417
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,239
Apparently, there is
a first time for everything.

1418
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,719
Right.

1419
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:28,274
Oh...

1420
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,500
Yes!

1421
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,559
May I?

1422
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,479
That's lovely.

1423
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,239
Oh, that's very kind.

1424
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,679
Oh, there's something more.

1425
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,839
Think of it as a "getting
out of prison" present.

1426
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,919
You once said that with two thousand
pounds, you could change the world.

1427
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,239
You're not serious?

1428
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,679
Apparently, I'm rich,

1429
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,959
and the buildings are yet for sale.

1430
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,039
Well, I'm not too late, am I?
You are still interested?

1431
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,599
Yes, of course.
More than ever.

1432
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,342
Although, I should think
by the time I finished,

1433
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,279
a few thousand pounds will
not be nearly enough.

1434
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,519
Are you never satisfied, woman?

1435
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,959
It might be enough for a clinic.

1436
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,759
A clinic?

1437
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,559
Would it pay well?

1438
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,719
I'm afraid not.

1439
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,519
Would the cases be interesting?

1440
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,039
Routine, I should think.

1441
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,639
Broken bones,

1442
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,119
sick children,

1443
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,879
needy women.

1444
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,239
Sounds revolting.

1445
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,109
Perhaps something else.

1446
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,119
Perhaps something there.

1447
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,640
I wondered if you might
have an opening

1448
01:27:00,641 --> 01:27:03,039
for a partner, for an equal,
in a joint venture?

1449
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:04,999
Mortimer, if you think...

1450
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,959
Oh, damn it!

1451
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,639
Charlotte Dalrymple,

1452
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:10,630
I love you.

1453
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,900
Will you marry me?

1454
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,079
Please don't make me beg.
Not in the street.

1455
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,319
I'll need to kiss you first.

1456
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,719
Charlotte, I hardly think
that in the circumstance...

1457
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,759
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was rather nice, actually.

1458
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,706
Yourself?

1459
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,839
Not bad.
You'll get better.

1460
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,519
Who would have thought?

1461
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,399
Charlotte and Mortimer, together.

1462
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,119
Life often brings together
strange bedfellows.

1463
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,945
Yes, quite. Quite.

1464
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,679
Well, all's well that ends well.

1465
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,159
Ah, fresh air and perambulation.

1466
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,319
The key to mental accuity
and long life.

1467
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,279
If you say so, Doctor.

1468
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,759
Oh, look: ducks.

1469
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,239
You alright down there, Colonel?

1470
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:22,079
Patience, Eugenia. Patience.

1471
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,239
The empire was not
built in a day.

1472
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,817
That's very cagey of you.

1473
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,599
What are you wearing?

1474
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
THE JOLLY MOLLY PORTABLE MASSAGER
WILL POSITIVELY CURE:

1475
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:53,201
BLOOD CIRCULATION PROBLEMS,
MONTHLY DISCOMFORT, THE VAPOURS,

1476
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:53,899
HYSTERIA

1477
01:30:31,202 --> 01:30:37,199
