1
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,017
Once upon a time, children,

2
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,422
there was a history teacher

3
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:07,760
who came home after giving
a class on the French revolution

4
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,161
to find that his wife,

5
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,063
a woman he'd loved
since they were children,

6
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,666
had herself committed a revolutionary...

7
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,069
A miraculous act.

8
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,252
Mary?

9
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,792
Mary?

10
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,399
Mary?

11
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,869
Children, I should have seen it coming.

12
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,775
Three months before,
we'd been out walking.

13
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,978
Just one of our usual walks,

14
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,549
one of the many things we've enjoyed

15
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,318
in the new life we've built together...

16
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,588
Over the 20 years we've spent
in your country.

17
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,457
Yes, he was naughty, wasn't he?

18
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,458
Well, he wasn't that bad,
were you, paddy?

19
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,961
I mean, to be fair on him.

20
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,696
Tom, do you remember...

21
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,903
After the war...

22
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,039
You know, when we met again...

23
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,880
Do you remember me
telling you once that...

24
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:34,047
It would take a miracle
for me to have a baby?

25
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,418
Yeah, yep, I remember.

26
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,248
Well, it's happened.

27
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,456
The miracle's happened.

28
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,557
Love, you can't.

29
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,789
I mean, you...

30
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,928
I'm going to have a baby.

31
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,799
God has said that I will.

32
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,936
Wait.

33
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,137
You'll see.

34
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,339
Why can't you accept
that you can't have a baby?

35
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,642
You'll never be able to.

36
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,160
Face that.

37
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,681
I should tell them at work I'm leaving,

38
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,510
probably fairly soon.

39
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,615
What do you think?

40
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,778
<i>I was thinking...</i>

41
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,486
<i>I-I'm losing her.</i>

42
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,958
<i>She's slipping away from me,</i>

43
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,159
<i>away to where I most feared to follow.</i>

44
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,104
Mary...

45
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,159
<i>Back...</i>

46
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,226
Mary...

47
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,936
<i>Back into the past.</i>

48
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,397
What, are you scared?

49
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,666
Come on, Mary.

50
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,108
I don't like this.

51
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,169
We've done it before.

52
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,936
But we never had your brother watching.

53
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,076
What's wrong with him?

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
He's a potato head, isn't he?

55
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,532
So?

56
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,783
I don't like him seeing me.

57
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,145
You're such a wall, Shirley.

58
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,422
Now your... Your knickers.

59
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,190
Yeah. Your knickers.

60
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,191
We're equal now.

61
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,962
You've got to do something first.

62
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:57,196
Go on, Shirley. You
ain't scared, are you?

63
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,957
Go on.

64
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,725
You shut up, Freddie parr.

65
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,999
There.

66
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,643
You've had a feel.

67
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,467
Not bad, eh?

68
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,681
That's not like we used to play it.

69
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,437
Bugger off. Nothing worth seeing.

70
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,145
Yeah. Bugger off.

71
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,007
Get lost.

72
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,524
You coming, Mary?

73
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,357
Go you on, Mary.

74
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,188
You first.

75
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,262
There's four of us.

76
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:28,390
Do you want me to choose?

77
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,725
Anyway, there's five of you, really.

78
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,497
Come you on, then.

79
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,058
Well?

80
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,359
I don't know.

81
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,527
That ain't fair.

82
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,358
That ain't right. You promised.

83
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,999
Unless... Unless you pass a test.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,900
A test?

85
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,831
Swimming test.

86
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,096
Whoever swims the furthest underwater.

87
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,306
Underwater?

88
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,307
But I can't swim.

89
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,338
You'll just have to learn.

90
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,313
Come on.

91
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,461
Hurry up.

92
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,612
This ain't right. We made a bargain.

93
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,545
1... 2... 3...

94
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,521
Go!

95
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,649
Yaah!

96
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,567
I won!

97
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,736
Tom!

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,638
Come on.

99
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,565
Tom!

100
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,306
I'm coming.

101
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,109
Come on.

102
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,081
Hey, come on, Freddie.

103
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,552
Grab a hold.

104
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,349
You all right, Freddie?

105
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,158
Me swim, too?

106
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,459
Yes, dick. You can swim, too.

107
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,241
What is this...

108
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,703
Oh, no...

109
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,938
Dick!

110
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,069
Where is he?

111
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,243
Dick!

112
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,978
Dick?

113
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,579
He's gone.

114
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,047
Christ. Did you see?

115
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,750
Dick won, Mary.

116
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,251
He won the game.

117
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,253
So?

118
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,254
So?

119
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,665
So?

120
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,090
Well, you'll have to show him.

121
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,021
Go on, dick.

122
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,425
Ha ha. Mary's waiting.

123
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,257
Her knickers are going to come down.

124
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,964
Come on, dick.

125
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,496
She's got to show someone.

126
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,395
Here's your chance, Mary.

127
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,304
Ha ha ha.

128
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,636
Come on, Mary. Loosen up for dick.

129
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,483
Ha ha.

130
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:33,037
Come on, dick...

131
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,448
Ooh!

132
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,449
Aah!

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,030
Where you going, dick?

134
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,236
Dick?

135
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,737
Tom?

136
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,848
Hey.

137
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,916
Morning.

138
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,017
Morning, Lewis.

139
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,988
If a total stranger were
to look at these two cars,

140
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,519
which one would he say
belonged to the boss?

141
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,656
I don't know how you do it, tom.

142
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,403
No kids.

143
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,898
Oh, is that it?

144
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,600
You must be a lucky man then, huh?

145
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,538
How is Mary?

146
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,769
Oh, she's fine.

147
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:34,874
Ah, good, good, good.

148
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,635
Rebecca and I were just talking

149
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,946
about how long
it's been since we've seen her.

150
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,507
How about dinner next weekend?

151
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,415
Not Saturday. School board meeting.

152
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,047
How about Saturday after Saturday dinner?

153
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,687
What do you say?

154
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,318
That would be very... very nice, Lewis.
Thank you very much.

155
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,785
It's a date then. Good.

156
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,233
I'll look forward to that.

157
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,527
Maggie Ruth, light of my life.

158
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,130
Mr. Scott, keeper of my destiny.

159
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,231
Where were we last
Tuesday's school council meeting?

160
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,451
I had this history test.

161
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,671
Weren't we talking about how leadership
brings responsibility?

162
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,708
Remember, in the French revolution,

163
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,739
people were looking to the past

164
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,112
just as much as to the future.

165
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,853
And when they took up the cry,
"back to nature,"

166
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:19,479
whose cry was that... Originally?

167
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,316
Come on. Which famous thinker?

168
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,357
Oh. Price.

169
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,418
A surprise and a pleasure.

170
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,386
Who was it?

171
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,162
Well, what's the point?

172
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,763
You see, what,

173
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,155
you're talking about something

174
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,496
happening in France 200 years ago?

175
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,201
Thank you, price, but if you
don't know the answer,

176
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,695
just keep your hands...

177
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,036
No. I know the answer.

178
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,881
I'm just asking you what the point is.

179
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,145
The only thing interesting
I see about history

180
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,448
is that it's about to end.

181
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,319
But not today, price.

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,050
All right?

183
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,959
Um, Joe?

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
Vanessa?

185
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,331
Sorry.

186
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,059
Freddie?

187
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,331
I'm sorry. Stephen?

188
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>Somebody help Freddie!</i>

189
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,501
Um... O.K.

190
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,670
<i>For God's sake, somebody!</i>

191
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,571
Come on. Somebody.

192
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,583
All right, price.

193
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,768
Tell us...

194
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,049
How is history going to come to an end,

195
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,986
if you could be specific?

196
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,762
Well, take your choice.

197
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,667
Well, I like history.

198
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,236
I don't care if it's got no point.

199
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,937
You go ahead, Mr. crick.

200
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,169
Yes, sir. You don't...

201
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,375
You don't care.

202
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,046
Just the fucking
world's going to end, right?

203
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,047
And you don't...

204
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:04,386
Are we finished with the French
revolution, Mr. crick?

205
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,421
Yeah.

206
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,785
Yeah, Alison, I think, uh...

207
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,594
I think for today we are.

208
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:15,066
Wait a minute. We still
have 20 minutes left.

209
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,640
Yes.

210
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,746
So why don't I tell you another story?

211
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,377
Tell us a murder story, Mr. crick.

212
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:34,593
Yeah. There'll be murders in it.

213
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,036
Why don't I tell you
a story about the fens?

214
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,297
What's the fens?

215
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,935
Well, the fens are an area

216
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,409
on the east coast of england

217
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,910
reclaimed from the sea,

218
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,081
land that was once water

219
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:06,182
and which even today is not quite solid,

220
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,416
so that people can only live there

221
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:12,421
because they dig it and drain
it year after year,

222
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,585
century after century.

223
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,593
For the sea is always trying to return,

224
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,256
to break through the ditches and dikes

225
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,266
and cover the rich, flat earth again.

226
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,137
My brother dick

227
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,538
was one of those who dug and drained.

228
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,012
He worked on a dredger,

229
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:32,578
keeping the river nene free of mud.

230
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,079
It was a job he loved, a job he did well,

231
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:41,587
even though he was what the fen
folk call a potato head.

232
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,688
He was simple.

233
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,957
I didn't care.

234
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,758
In fact, I think it made
me love him even more.

235
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,927
My father, Henry crick,

236
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,900
took care of the sluice gate

237
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,601
on a branch of the river ouse.

238
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,439
That's where I was born.

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,140
I lived there with my father

240
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,312
and my brother dick.

241
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,347
Mother...

242
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,918
Oh, she was dead.

243
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,688
<i>This is the BBC home service program.</i>

244
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,787
<i>Here is the news. This
is Hugh tovey speaking.</i>

245
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,920
<i>Last night, the</i> luftwaffe's <i>main target</i>

246
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,056
<i>was again London.</i>

247
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,201
<i>Considerable damage was done
to residential and industrial areas.</i>

248
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,997
<i>It is feared the loss
of life will prove heavy.</i>

249
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,241
<i>Three enemy aircraft were destroyed.</i>

250
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,906
Yes, you're right, children.

251
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,208
When I was your age,

252
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,840
the second world war was raging,

253
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:43,916
and every night we'd hear
the bombers droning overhead

254
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,617
on their way to Germany.

255
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,349
You might say things were approaching

256
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,185
a bit of a climax.

257
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,291
But I have to tell you, children,

258
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,593
there were other climaxes
happening just then

259
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:00,766
that seemed far more important to me.

260
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,435
Hockwell!

261
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,339
Hockwell!

262
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,991
Newham, gildsey, and peterborough!

263
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,962
Newham and gildsey train!

264
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,016
¶¶

265
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,490
Come on.

266
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,857
Ahh...

267
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,725
Ohh...

268
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,307
Ohh... Ohh...

269
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:12,461
Why'd you have to do it in a train?

270
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,433
We didn't have a car.

271
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,336
Why didn't you go to a motel?

272
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,507
That's what I do.

273
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,938
Not a lot of motels in the fens, Joe.

274
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,675
Not a lot of anything.

275
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,250
Remember, it's flat country, open.

276
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:36,418
I once asked my father why
the fens were so flat.

277
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,723
He said to me,

278
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,994
"so... So God can have
a clear view of us."

279
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,031
However, we weren't hiding from God.

280
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,302
We were hiding
from our parents, friends...

281
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,336
Well, no...

282
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,497
One friend in particular

283
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,566
and his big mouth.

284
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,035
Freddie parr.

285
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:00,412
The one that put the eel down Mary's...

286
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,383
Yeah. That was Freddie.

287
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,480
Did I tell you about that?

288
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,516
Yeah.

289
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Huh.

290
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,556
I'd forgotten.

291
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,257
No. Anyway,

292
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,087
that was years before this.

293
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,993
By now, Freddie was into the big time.

294
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:16,985
He was a smuggler,

295
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:21,096
trading illegal bourbon
and camel cigarettes

296
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,668
with some of your lot,

297
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,569
the yanks who were stationed there.

298
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,971
You limeys always have a trick

299
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,743
up your sleeve, don't you?

300
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,157
I had a secret.

301
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,362
I had an appointment each afternoon

302
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,634
from 3:00 till 5:30.

303
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:57,369
I didn't want Freddie
finding out about that.

304
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,970
What?

305
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,542
Nothing.

306
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,743
Come on.

307
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,880
Well, I just think it's weird

308
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,716
that you keep telling us these stories

309
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,217
about you doing your girlfriend.

310
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,256
That is what you were going to tell us,

311
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,887
isn't it, Mr. crick?

312
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,322
But we were 16.

313
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,456
Well, I'm 16, and I'm not doing it.

314
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,797
That's for sure.

315
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,228
No, look. Come on.

316
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:31,603
You mustn't... You mustn't misunderstand.

317
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,940
Mary... my Mary... She wasn't like that.

318
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,141
She wasn't...

319
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,642
A slut?

320
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,446
Just that we were both...

321
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,477
We were both young...

322
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,683
And into everything.

323
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,452
Everything was so fresh and so new

324
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,563
and to be discovered.

325
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,689
What Mary mostly was was curious.

326
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,626
Yeah.

327
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,568
Yeah, about that,

328
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,527
but it wasn't just about sex.

329
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,635
She was... she was curious
about everything.

330
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,408
Like what?

331
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,838
Well, she was curious about dick.

332
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,149
My brother dick.

333
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,150
I'll tell you...

334
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,286
I'll tell you something she told me.

335
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,817
He follows you? Are you sure?

336
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,693
Wherever I go, just about.

337
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,911
I never seen him.

338
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,132
I'm telling you,
he's always hanging about.

339
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:33,231
What for?

340
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,573
Why do you think?

341
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,836
Not that.

342
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,837
Not dick.

343
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,569
He don't think that way.

344
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,205
Since when has he been following you?

345
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,946
Since that day when we went swimming,

346
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,807
when Freddie nearly drowned.

347
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,316
Don't you remember?

348
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,947
That were ages ago.

349
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,320
Do you mind?

350
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,821
He's only following.

351
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,691
Never tried to talk to me.

352
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,827
Remember what happened that day

353
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,028
when Freddie got the eel?

354
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,660
Big, wasn't it?

355
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,525
The eel?

356
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,599
No, not the eel.

357
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,740
Must have been twice as big as this.

358
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,395
What's he like?

359
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,266
What's it like living with him?

360
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,436
Take it off.

361
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,247
Don't you ever feel sorry for him?

362
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,028
Yes.

363
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,822
You don't have to worry about dick...

364
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:28,086
If he's following you.

365
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,347
Dick wouldn't hurt you.

366
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,056
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

367
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,588
I ain't worried.

368
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,295
I feel sad for him.

369
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,457
He's got nothing, has he?

370
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,725
Except that old motorbike.

371
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,369
He's got me...

372
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,339
And dad.

373
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,340
He hasn't got this, though,

374
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,083
has he?

375
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,957
If my brother keeps following you around,

376
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:14,166
maybe it'd be nice
if you did talk to him.

377
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,597
Then he'd know what girls are like.

378
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:20,242
Maybe it'd help him get his own girl.

379
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:34,047
Better watch yourself,
Mr. Freddie parr...

380
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,287
Hooey!

381
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,018
Potato head!

382
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,690
Thicky!

383
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,621
Thicky!

384
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,655
Potato head!

385
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,591
Thicky!

386
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,068
Freddie.

387
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,738
Hello, dick.

388
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,908
Hello.

389
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,816
Your brother told me you came down here

390
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,949
for the eels most evenings.

391
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,755
Caught many?

392
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,358
Many?

393
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,229
Eels.

394
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,126
Some.

395
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,838
My dad's fond of eels, you know.

396
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,206
So am I.

397
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,007
If you could spare us a couple...

398
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,210
Or one big one would do.

399
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,513
Look.

400
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,815
I brought something to take it home in.

401
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:45,093
Have you got a nice eel for me, dick?

402
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,457
Never mind.

403
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,732
Another time, maybe.

404
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,404
No!

405
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:03,136
Yes. Yes, that's a nice one.

406
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,812
You want?

407
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,584
Yes, I do, dick.

408
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,416
But how will you get it across to me?

409
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:16,747
It's not going to swim
to me by itself, is it?

410
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:23,892
You can swim with it,
though, dick, can't you?

411
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:27,526
I've seen you swim, haven't I?

412
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,935
Don't you remember...

413
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:35,338
How you went swimming...

414
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,411
How you showed me?

415
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,416
No.

416
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,187
But if you really want to know
what's going on here,

417
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,618
you have to come even further back.

418
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,485
We're still in the fens,

419
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,094
but it's 1911 now.

420
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:33,326
Just down the road is kessling hall...

421
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,870
Where I want to introduce

422
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,467
some other family members.

423
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,399
I know what you're doing.

424
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,642
What am I doing, price,

425
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,839
if you wouldn't mind being specific?

426
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,971
Just what you're doing.

427
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,075
You're telling us these dirty stories.

428
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,537
It's not just dirty...

429
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,606
Shut up, dobson.

430
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,083
All right, all right.

431
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:56,224
What do you think I'm doing, Judy?

432
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,758
It's like history, right?

433
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,589
Ha!

434
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,793
But you're showing us,

435
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,629
like, you were part of history, too,

436
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,399
like the French revolution...

437
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, bullshit.

438
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,601
Price, what do you think I'm doing?

439
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,937
You're trying to buy us off.

440
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,268
You're scared no one's listening
to your lousy history lessons,

441
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,943
so you're starting to make things up...

442
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,010
Schoolgirls fucking...

443
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:19,841
Thank you, price.

444
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:23,175
To keep us quiet to get in with us,

445
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:26,282
but you can't because you're
just a teacher.

446
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,085
That's all.

447
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,645
Am I right?

448
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,456
I'm right.

449
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,158
Might be.

450
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,330
So might you, Judy.

451
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:42,327
But I wasn't planning on telling
any dirty stories today.

452
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,465
A murder story, Mr. crick?

453
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,800
No. Not yet, Stephen.

454
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,536
No. Today, children,

455
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:52,781
I thought we'd talk about beer.

456
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:02,945
Now, this is where
my mother's been growing up.

457
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,245
Her father brews beer,

458
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:09,426
as did his father
and his grandfather before him.

459
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:10,925
Good morning, sir.

460
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,230
This is the house, built on beer.

461
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,567
Atkinson's ales...

462
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,998
Millions of bottles of the stuff.

463
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,974
Look at it.

464
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,308
Leave your things on the bus.

465
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,140
Take your notebooks with you.

466
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,606
Don't... Stay together.

467
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,175
Don't get lost.

468
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,153
And no smoking in the house.

469
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,355
This is cool.

470
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,329
Is this your mother's place?

471
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,463
Yeah.

472
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,896
It was built by... By her grandfather

473
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,937
George Atkinson.

474
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,868
You rich, Mr. crick?

475
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,874
No, I'm not rich.

476
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,136
But this place...

477
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,577
They'll get rid of it

478
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,446
long before I turn up.

479
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,307
Why?

480
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,716
Why? Well...

481
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,577
After the first world war...

482
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,746
Dates, somebody.

483
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,754
Uh, 1917 to 18.

484
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,556
No, we're in england.

485
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,358
Oh. 1914 to 18.

486
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,130
Good.

487
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:16,887
After the first world war,

488
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,096
it's going to become an asylum.

489
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:19,998
For crazies?

490
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,666
No. For soldiers.

491
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,397
Well...

492
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,270
Yes, crazies.

493
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:30,411
Soldiers that the war has driven mad.

494
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,276
My father was one for a time.

495
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,249
He was here.

496
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:40,345
There's my grandfather, Ernest Atkinson.

497
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,321
He doesn't look like a beer maker.

498
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,489
Brewer, bates.

499
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,190
Well, he was.

500
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,832
A hell of a good one.

501
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,558
In fact, he'll turn out

502
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,232
to be the best
of all the Atkinson brewers.

503
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,133
Today...

504
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,670
He's creating a special beer

505
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,371
designed for revenge.

506
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,507
What do you mean, revenge?

507
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,138
We'll get to that.

508
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,209
Who's the girl?

509
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:13,384
It's his daughter... Helen Atkinson.

510
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,945
My mother.

511
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,454
His only child.

512
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,515
His wife died when Helen was 12.

513
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,485
Let's go on.

514
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,841
Price, you'd like my grandfather.

515
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,143
He worries about the world, too.

516
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,076
Three months ago,

517
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,680
he stood for parliament as a pacifist,

518
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,982
but he got hardly a vote,

519
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:48,353
even here in his hometown, gildsey...
population 3,000...

520
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:52,724
But swollen today to over 6,000.

521
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:53,715
Why?

522
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:54,826
Because today,

523
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,257
a nation hungry for war,
glory, and profit

524
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,899
is crowning its new king... George v.

525
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,669
Mr. crick, they're all drunk.

526
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,928
So they are, bates.

527
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:07,266
It's my grandfather's revenge.

528
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,377
Remember the beer he was brewing?

529
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,708
He's giving it away today...

530
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,882
Thousands of bottles of the stuff.

531
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,551
Atkinson's coronation ale...

532
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:19,950
A beer so powerful,

533
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,351
it shows these people
up for what they really are...

534
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,094
Blind fools.

535
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,359
Just one bottle will do it.

536
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,560
¶ God save our gracious king ¶

537
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:35,034
I want you to remember something else.

538
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,018
Within three years,

539
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,399
these people are going to get
exactly what they want...

540
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:44,576
The war to end all wars.

541
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,478
All right, everybody,
back here in one hour.

542
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,852
Hey, don't get lost.

543
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,893
One hour exactly.

544
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,087
Are you listening in the back?

545
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,389
Back here in an hour.

546
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,285
Bates, did you hear that?

547
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,063
Heard you.

548
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,698
Now, Marshall, don't get lost, all right?

549
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,699
Do your best.

550
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,270
Uh...

551
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,139
Can they see us, Mr. crick?

552
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,840
¶ Land of... ow! Hope and glory ¶

553
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:22,247
I think some of them can't
see anything, Judy.

554
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,448
Come on, then, darling.

555
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,115
¶ 13 men went to the hole ¶

556
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,489
you said you're a friend.

557
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,658
Well, you've got an hour, price.

558
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:33,087
Go and enjoy yourself.

559
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,322
I'll stick with you.

560
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,156
I'm going in the pub.

561
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,741
O.K.

562
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:39,325
I'm sorry, price. You're underage.

563
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,795
May you all die, for God's sake!

564
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,340
¶ I'm running, and I can't... ¶

565
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,439
relax. See, I...

566
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,311
Get out of here. Get out.

567
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,212
What?

568
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,780
What's this?

569
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,148
Are you not open?

570
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,518
Have you drunk any of that bloody
coronation ale?

571
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,019
No.

572
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:04,145
Then I'm open.

573
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:07,086
Good. Well, I'll have a Brandy.

574
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,792
And, uh...

575
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,493
You'd better give the boy a lemonade.

576
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,356
I'll have a Brandy, too.

577
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,329
For God's sake. What's happening now?

578
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,095
Aah!

579
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,970
Better go and watch, price.

580
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,639
They've set the brewery on fire.

581
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,740
The brewery's on fire!

582
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,842
I promise you it'll be spectacular.

583
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,451
The whole place will burn to the ground.

584
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,777
Fire brigade won't be able to cope.

585
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,451
They're drunk like everybody else.

586
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:38,522
Oh. This will be the end
of the family firm.

587
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,791
All the stock will be destroyed,

588
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:45,163
including every single bottle of this...

589
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,932
Except for one crate,

590
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:52,673
which my grandfather
would rescue from the flames...

591
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,265
And one day...

592
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:59,844
Hand down to his... Son.

593
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,210
What son?

594
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,882
I thought he had a daughter.

595
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,123
...just have to say...

596
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:07,848
<i>Au revoir. Adios.</i>

597
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:12,163
Good night, everybody.

598
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:16,260
Very right you are. Here we go.

599
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,161
Yes. Go. No, I...

600
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,397
Can I have one of these, Bob?

601
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,528
Tom, I have parents who come to me

602
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:25,403
and say, "how is teaching
my son or daughter history

603
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:28,306
going to help them get a good job?"

604
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,407
What do I say?

605
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,808
You tell them the truth.

606
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,739
We're not just in the business

607
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:35,075
of turning out good job prospects.

608
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,410
That's what I say?

609
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,945
Just that simple?

610
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,920
Yeah.

611
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,317
Come on. Jump up.

612
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,249
Come on, tom.

613
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:44,253
You say that what really matters

614
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,856
is what we teach them about life

615
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,189
and how to live it.

616
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,993
They won't have a good life

617
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,925
if they can't get a good job. Right?

618
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:53,961
Yeah.

619
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:54,976
See?

620
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:56,003
Alex, it's time for bed.

621
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:57,871
Good night. Give me a kiss.

622
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,500
Have you got your monkey?

623
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,465
Go find your monkey.

624
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,942
Nobody's trying to eliminate history.

625
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:04,409
We're just trying a little merger thing

626
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,140
with social studies, that's all.

627
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,335
Something that might,

628
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,006
if you'd go along with it,

629
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:12,116
give what you're doing a shot in the...

630
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,377
Foot.

631
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,815
Couldn't it, really?

632
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,719
Here you go, fatso.

633
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,757
Thank you.

634
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,827
Uh, tom, give me a break, you know?

635
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:26,297
Give social studies a break.

636
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,358
You have to admit

637
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,866
there has been a steady decline

638
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,637
in the number of students
opting for history.

639
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,698
Frankly, you know,

640
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,535
they're voting with their feet.

641
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,108
That's not true.

642
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,139
In the last few weeks,

643
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:41,983
I've had six requests
to transfer to history.

644
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,376
I've got to be doing something right.

645
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:49,745
Yeah. Don't think I don't
know what it is.

646
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,355
What is that supposed to mean?

647
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,487
It means that you're not
teaching the curriculum.

648
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:56,734
You're telling these children stories...

649
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,897
Stories about eels and stories
about crazy brothers

650
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,566
and God knows what else.

651
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,227
Tom, what great news.

652
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,566
I...

653
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,601
Your wife just told me...

654
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,066
About the new arrival.

655
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,612
Ha ha ha!

656
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,610
I'm sorry. I was...

657
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,581
About the baby. About your new baby.

658
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,849
What?

659
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,080
What baby?

660
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,484
Oh, come on, tom.

661
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:24,046
I mean, why hide it? It's true, isn't it?

662
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:24,886
Actually,

663
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,190
we're lucky it didn't happen before.

664
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,630
We weren't really ready.

665
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,227
In fact, we're always late.

666
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:31,759
We're congenital latecomers.

667
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:35,473
But we get there in the end.

668
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,738
Paddy.

669
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,401
You're talking about paddy.

670
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,907
Our new puppy.

671
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,039
I... I didn't...

672
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,544
I'm sorry. Yes.

673
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:48,576
Um...

674
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,010
Golden retriever.

675
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,545
Uh-huh. Ah.

676
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,718
It's true. We, uh...

677
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,749
We thought for ages

678
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,488
it wouldn't be fair to have a dog.

679
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,719
We're always out at work

680
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,659
and don't want to leave him all day.

681
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,727
We found him,

682
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,798
and he's great. He's really great. Paddy.

683
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,666
Baby, she c... well,
we both call him that.

684
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,737
It's a... Private joke.

685
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:17,206
Was a private joke.

686
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,709
It didn't sound like a puppy.

687
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,848
No, it was... it was paddy.
Wasn't it, darling?

688
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,117
Yes. I was talking about the dog.

689
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:29,187
I'm sorry. Did I not make that clear?

690
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:29,988
Sorry.

691
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:31,288
Anyone for coffee?

692
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,757
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

693
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:33,818
We have a house rule...

694
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,125
When coffee's served,
we all change places.

695
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:40,097
In that case, I'd like to sit
next to Lewis.

696
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,358
Oh, Mary, I'm flattered.

697
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,066
Maybe we should get home, love. Uh...

698
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,237
Don't be silly, tom.

699
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,668
Because I want to ask him

700
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:52,009
why there's no place
in school assembly anymore

701
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,110
for the teachings
of our savior Jesus Christ.

702
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,154
Marie antoinette.

703
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:05,488
The bastille.

704
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,528
The tuileries palace,

705
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,998
the king's home

706
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,929
until he was dragged from it in '92

707
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,735
by the screaming mob.

708
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:25,076
The place de LA revolution,

709
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,837
the home of...

710
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,005
Of what?

711
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,648
Come on.

712
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,579
Dead easy.

713
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:33,881
Bates.

714
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,585
The guillotine?

715
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,389
The guillotine.

716
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:43,361
The great new invention.

717
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:47,202
A better way of putting people to death.

718
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,666
A kinder,

719
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,698
more humane way.

720
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:56,907
Just the thing for an enlightened age.

721
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,676
Was it more humane?

722
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:00,407
Than hanging?

723
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,212
Probably.

724
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:03,814
Than the ax?

725
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,275
Well, it was quicker.

726
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:10,219
Mind you, there are stories
of limbs moving

727
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,462
and eyes rolling, tongues lolling,

728
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:14,557
even after the blade...

729
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,428
Had severed the head from the body.

730
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,359
Eww!

731
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,304
So they were guessing
about the kindness, really.

732
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,900
You see, the... The trouble was

733
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:27,801
the only people who could
really tell them were dead.

734
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,143
Questions.

735
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,176
Price, you had a question.

736
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,481
No, I didn't.

737
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,647
Yes.

738
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,321
About a son.

739
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:47,792
In regard to my grandfather,
you asked that.

740
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,461
How was that possible?

741
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,428
Mr. crick.

742
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,431
Mr. crick?

743
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,436
Are we done with the guillotine for good

744
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,739
or just today?

745
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,946
I mean, are we going to...

746
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:10,808
Shut up.

747
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,146
I want to know...

748
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,180
Please drop it.

749
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,617
Yeah.

750
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,363
Yeah, sure. I asked that question
about your grandfather.

751
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:24,328
Well, how it happened...

752
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,159
You see, you've got to try to imagine...

753
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,867
When the first world war began...
dates, Judy.

754
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,400
I told you the dates.

755
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,065
Just give it to him.

756
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,673
Fuck you.

757
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,248
1914 to 18.

758
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,179
When it began,

759
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,652
the war that my grandfather had...

760
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,621
Predicted,

761
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,922
he became...

762
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,226
Melancholy, despairing,

763
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,557
despairing of...

764
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,732
Of the world.

765
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:04,725
All the slaughter and horror and...

766
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,371
He didn't go out from the hall at all.

767
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,344
He...

768
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:12,812
He was mad.

769
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,435
I th...

770
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,476
He...

771
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,649
The war... see, the war...

772
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,650
It made him...

773
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,915
And my mother...

774
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,825
His... Daughter...

775
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,925
Stayed there with... with him.

776
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,366
Looked... looked after him,

777
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:36,967
like a...

778
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,636
Like a mother.

779
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,070
You remember this?

780
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,574
Yeah. We were up there.

781
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:48,846
That's where your grandfather
and your mother live?

782
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,277
Not anymore.

783
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,082
They moved out to the gate lodge.

784
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,718
It's 1922, price.

785
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,819
They moved down there after the war,

786
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:59,922
and the hall became a home
for mental patients,

787
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,925
for soldiers that the war had driven mad.

788
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,358
It was my mother's idea,

789
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,462
but grandfather went along with it.

790
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,795
When she wanted to be a nurse,

791
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,770
he went along with that, too.

792
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,299
He doesn't want to confine her.

793
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,739
He doesn't want to hold
on to her for himself.

794
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,040
No matter what people are saying.

795
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,477
It's just rumors.

796
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,608
What rumors?

797
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,990
What's she doing?

798
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,827
She often stops there.

799
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,758
You see...

800
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:43,767
That's halfway between the lodge
and the hall.

801
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:50,472
Between her mad father
and her mad patients.

802
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,909
I think she stops to say to herself...

803
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:59,583
These are the only...

804
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,486
Sane moments...

805
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,317
In my life.

806
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,863
If this is sanity. Come on.

807
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:21,165
Four years since the end of the war.

808
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:24,208
For them it hasn't ended.

809
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:28,109
For some of them, it'll never end.

810
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,315
Ah.

811
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:50,729
Why don't you play something, sweetheart?

812
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,443
There, there, there.

813
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,647
What's she looking for?

814
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,318
My father.

815
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:11,956
Afternoon, boys.

816
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,317
Good afternoon, Helen.

817
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,812
And what did gramps think about that?

818
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,445
Oh, he was happy for them.

819
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:43,721
He still had a bit
of influence in the town,

820
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:49,032
so he got my dad a job here.

821
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,463
And, uh...

822
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,395
The cottage went with it.

823
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:01,168
So my mum and dad came to live here.

824
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,511
This is where she died.

825
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,678
Influenza.

826
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,346
Just plain flu.

827
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,259
This is the sluice gate.

828
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:27,832
Catches everything
that comes down the river.

829
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,699
Old clothes,

830
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,731
dead sheep,

831
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,736
branches,

832
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,168
bottles...

833
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:43,281
So what about those rumors?

834
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:46,116
What?

835
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,947
Oh.

836
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,275
Going out.

837
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,460
Must be a girl in gildsey.

838
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:33,330
That's been going on a couple weeks now.

839
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,601
Just shows. It just shows.

840
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,676
There's more to that dick

841
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:48,707
than people give him credit for.

842
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,383
Shit.

843
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:55,885
Tom.

844
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,729
What's the matter with him?

845
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,167
Oh, he's just jealous.

846
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:14,298
This is the room my mother died in.

847
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,505
Dad couldn't sleep in it after, so...

848
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:19,809
It became my room.

849
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:21,711
Didn't seem to bother me.

850
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:24,011
Holy shit.

851
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,515
Bombers.

852
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,016
Heading for Germany. It's 1943, price.

853
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,148
There's a war on.

854
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:34,924
I remember a night just
before my mother died.

855
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:38,263
She called Dickie.

856
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,865
Just him, not me.

857
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,567
And...

858
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:47,036
See, I was sleeping down here.

859
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,338
Dick was there.

860
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,239
I think they thought I was asleep.

861
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:56,205
But I heard.

862
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:02,718
This key belongs to you.

863
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,220
It's special.

864
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,390
A key?

865
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,458
Yeah. A key.

866
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,859
The day that my grandfather died...

867
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,933
This trunk appeared,

868
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:18,001
to be held in safekeeping

869
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,502
for her firstborn child.

870
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,905
You know what's inside of it?

871
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:23,937
I do now.

872
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:26,476
It's a letter from my grandfather

873
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,107
to my mother's firstborn,

874
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,848
to be opened on his 18th birthday,

875
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,179
and 11 bottles of beer.

876
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,418
He left beer?

877
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,379
Yeah. Special beer.

878
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,846
Oh, what, that, uh, the coronation ale

879
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,156
he got from the fire.

880
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:42,057
Right. 12 bottles of the stuff.

881
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,960
You said 11.

882
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,831
Well, there's... There are 11 now.

883
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:47,898
Dick's had one of them. Made him drunk.

884
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:49,229
Yeah, I bet.

885
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,704
Very drunk. I was watching.

886
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,306
There he is back from his date.

887
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,157
Already?

888
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,008
It's hard to keep track of time.

889
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,330
Where do babies come from?

890
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,837
Where do babies come from?

891
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,412
They come from love, dick.

892
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,675
They're made... With love.

893
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,020
Love?

894
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:45,389
Yes.

895
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,858
That's, uh, a feeling, dick.

896
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:51,859
That's a... Beautiful feeling.

897
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,097
Like the feeling you had

898
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,128
for your poor mum,

899
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:58,503
like the feeling she had for you.

900
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,678
Love.

901
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,819
Say it.

902
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,288
Go on.

903
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,419
You said it to him.

904
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:23,125
That's true, isn't it?

905
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,098
I'm...

906
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:33,501
I'm going to have a baby.

907
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:36,835
Oh, Christ.

908
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,177
It's dick's, isn't it?

909
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:41,678
It's his baby.

910
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,379
No.

911
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,080
You've been seeing him all these weeks.

912
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,116
I never...

913
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:47,917
You're lying.

914
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,516
We didn't do it.

915
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:04,002
We tried to.

916
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,402
I tried to show him.

917
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:09,974
It wasn't any use.

918
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:15,007
He was too big...

919
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,913
Down there.

920
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,716
You said...

921
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,147
You said to show him about girls.

922
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:25,322
I was sure you'd be pleased...

923
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,563
'Cause he's your brother

924
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:29,487
and you wanted him to know.

925
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:41,466
Why didn't you tell me?

926
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:48,312
'Cause I didn't know how.

927
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,210
Hoo-hoo!

928
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,481
Mary! Tom!

929
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,316
Make way for Freddie parr!

930
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,717
Mary! Tom!

931
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,420
Bye!

932
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,990
Freddie parr.

933
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,691
Where'd he get that?

934
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,327
Borrowed it off a yank, probably.

935
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:07,428
Bet he ain't got a license.

936
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,233
Everybody's doing it.

937
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,565
We got caught.

938
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:21,076
What are we going to do?

939
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,254
I don't know.

940
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:30,352
We're going to have a baby.

941
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:32,122
I'm 16!

942
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,263
So are you.

943
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,526
But we love each other.

944
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,097
That's all that matters.

945
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,901
What'll we tell dick?

946
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,803
He frightened me sometimes.

947
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:53,337
Sometimes, when I was telling him

948
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:57,814
and showing him about what people do...

949
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,245
He got upset.

950
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:04,152
I was scared of him.

951
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:09,526
You don't have to worry about dick.

952
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:12,427
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

953
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,898
A baby.

954
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,806
It's my baby.

955
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,607
Yes.

956
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:25,208
I'm sure it is.

957
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:26,179
I mean...

958
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,637
I<i> know</i> it is.

959
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,975
It has to be.

960
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,880
Mother of God!

961
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:36,016
Dick?

962
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,020
Dick!

963
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,722
Come here, boy!

964
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:42,492
Fetch the boat, dick!

965
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,093
Bring that boat down here!

966
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,525
Bring that boat over, dick!

967
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:50,901
That's it, boy.

968
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:53,402
Boy, there.

969
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,172
'Tis a boy, I tell you!

970
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:58,273
Bring her around, dick, bring her around!

971
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,976
That's it.

972
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,437
Lean into it!

973
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:03,145
Poor fellow.

974
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:05,879
Bring him in.

975
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,450
That's it, dick.

976
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,851
Steady, now.

977
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,854
Oh, Jesus Christ!

978
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:12,786
Easy.

979
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,760
That's it.

980
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:17,687
God!

981
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,025
Richard parr's lad?

982
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,102
Freddie parr.

983
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,466
It's young Freddie.

984
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,697
Freddie parr.

985
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,474
Dead.

986
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:28,701
Young Freddie parr.

987
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,666
Dead Freddie.

988
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,041
That's the boy.

989
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,076
Dead Freddie.

990
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,837
Freddie.

991
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:36,876
Make it.

992
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,417
Please, Freddie.

993
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:42,648
Freddie, come on.

994
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,396
Right you are.

995
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,686
Did anyone say anything?

996
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:21,858
About what?

997
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:24,959
About how he died.

998
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,362
He drowned.

999
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,725
How he drowned.

1000
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,869
He fell in the river.

1001
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,939
He was probably drunk.

1002
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,910
He couldn't swim, could he?

1003
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:46,917
Somebody made Freddie fall in.

1004
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,388
Dick made him.

1005
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:54,319
Why would dick...

1006
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,625
I told him.

1007
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,496
I thought he'd have to know in the end

1008
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,497
the baby couldn't be his

1009
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:05,168
'cause we hadn't really done it...

1010
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:08,099
So I said it was Freddie's.

1011
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:08,765
Freddie's?

1012
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:11,273
I don't know why I said it.

1013
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:12,505
I couldn't think.

1014
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,678
And dick... He scares me,

1015
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,649
so I said it was Freddie's.

1016
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:25,017
Dick killed Freddie parr 'cause
he thought it was him that made the baby,

1017
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,522
which means I killed Freddie, too.

1018
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,925
You don't know that.

1019
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:39,866
Mary!

1020
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,070
Everything's all right!

1021
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:44,490
Mary!

1022
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,111
The verdict's accidental death.

1023
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:47,710
Accidental!

1024
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,012
Do you hear me?

1025
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,313
At the inquest.

1026
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,214
At the court!

1027
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:53,615
They said it was all an accident.

1028
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:54,617
I heard you.

1029
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,388
They said Freddie was drunk.

1030
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,017
That's why he fell in.

1031
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:01,092
So it was an accident.

1032
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,327
Well, if it were an accident,

1033
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,758
then dick didn't...

1034
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:09,233
And Freddie, he's not your fault.

1035
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,343
Mary?

1036
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,407
What are you doing?

1037
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:19,908
Go away!

1038
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,410
You'll hurt yourself!

1039
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,348
Wait a minute.

1040
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,716
Go away!

1041
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,586
Mary?

1042
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,787
Mary!

1043
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:32,288
Uhh!

1044
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:33,893
That's dangerous.

1045
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,259
Leave me alone!

1046
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,526
Stop!

1047
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,787
That's dangerous for the baby.

1048
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,696
You're so stupid!

1049
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:41,728
Mary!

1050
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,232
Uhh!

1051
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,244
God forgive me.

1052
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:58,407
Didn't you think it would come up

1053
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,777
from the mud flats in the end,

1054
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:03,908
just like Freddie did?

1055
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:10,887
I saw the marks, dick.

1056
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:13,018
Freddie's face.

1057
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,491
Hook.

1058
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,762
That were the hook!

1059
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:22,099
It weren't the boat hook.

1060
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:28,071
The marks were there
before dad used the hook.

1061
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:30,836
It were you.

1062
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:35,406
You made Freddie drunk.

1063
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,948
You hit him with this.

1064
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,520
You pushed him in the river

1065
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,919
and threw the bottle
in after, didn't you?

1066
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:48,661
You stupid potato head.

1067
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,795
You hated Freddie because of the baby.

1068
00:58:57,268 --> 00:59:00,937
Well, it isn't Freddie's baby...

1069
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:04,238
Or yours.

1070
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:08,744
It's mine.

1071
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,053
Go on.

1072
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,421
Go on.

1073
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,562
Do it again.

1074
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,433
Uhh!

1075
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,325
What are you doing?

1076
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,061
Get off!

1077
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:10,169
Go on.

1078
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,574
Do it again, huh?

1079
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,087
You going to kill everybody?

1080
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:38,101
Is this what you did with Freddie?

1081
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,808
"To the firstborn of Mrs. Henry crick."

1082
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,481
It's for you, dick.

1083
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,750
You read it, tom.

1084
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,408
Oh, it's not important.

1085
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,083
Yeah.

1086
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,150
You don't have to know.

1087
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:30,186
Well, read it, tom.

1088
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,687
No. It's nothing, dick.

1089
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:35,019
No... Read it.

1090
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,755
Read it to me, tom.

1091
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,160
Dick...

1092
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,561
I ain't going to read it, dick.

1093
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:40,763
Oh, you'll read it.

1094
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,664
You read it.

1095
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:43,896
No.

1096
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,668
I said you read it!

1097
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,269
Tell me!

1098
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:50,241
You tell me!

1099
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:55,076
Now you tell me, tom.

1100
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,980
You want to know?

1101
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,681
Mmm.

1102
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,086
It's from granddad.

1103
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:06,247
Granddad Atkinson.

1104
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,456
Says you're going to be very special.

1105
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,390
He's made sure of it.

1106
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,356
You're going to be
the savior of the world.

1107
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,225
You're going to save the world

1108
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,034
from blood and war and horror.

1109
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:22,596
The reason he's so sure is 'cause, see...

1110
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,836
Dad...

1111
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:27,410
He ain't your dad.

1112
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:30,811
He's mine, but he's not yours.

1113
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:35,919
Granddad's your real dad.

1114
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,425
Dick!

1115
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,092
Easy! Tom...

1116
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,696
The letter... I read it.
Granddad's letter!

1117
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,366
And he killed Freddie!

1118
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,327
Killed who?

1119
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,695
Freddie parr!

1120
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:55,243
Dick!

1121
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:57,066
Dick!

1122
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,074
Tom!

1123
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,035
Tom!

1124
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,809
Dick!

1125
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,580
What did you say? Tom, come here!

1126
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:03,879
T...

1127
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,881
Dick!

1128
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:06,883
Dick!

1129
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:10,094
Ah-haaa...

1130
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,593
Ha ha ha ha!

1131
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,390
Must have got a boat.

1132
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,385
Dick!

1133
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,826
Come back here, boy!

1134
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,734
Dick!

1135
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,237
Dad, this way!

1136
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,377
Hey!

1137
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,238
Help!

1138
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:37,045
Help! Help us!

1139
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:39,107
Help! We need a boat!

1140
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,216
Heh...

1141
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,218
Gaah!

1142
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,649
Ha ha!

1143
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:47,594
Aw, I can't see nothing.

1144
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:49,925
Here you are, son.

1145
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,027
Have a look.

1146
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:52,258
Dick!

1147
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:54,562
We're going to help you, dick!

1148
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:56,495
We're going to take you home!

1149
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,070
How much bloody beer has he drunk?

1150
01:03:58,071 --> 01:04:01,637
Dick! Someone's going to get hurt, boy!

1151
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:02,698
Stop that!

1152
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:03,666
Dad...

1153
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,107
He's seen them.

1154
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,408
They're in uniform!

1155
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,478
That's all right, dick!

1156
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,647
Never you be afraid!

1157
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:15,117
It's only me... And tom...

1158
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,986
And Stan!

1159
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:19,217
These here men are nothing!

1160
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:20,489
Dick!

1161
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,340
Dick!

1162
01:04:22,341 --> 01:04:24,191
Blast it, stop fooling around!

1163
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,064
Dick!

1164
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,601
Dick!

1165
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,802
Dick!

1166
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,405
I'll be your father!

1167
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:40,037
I promise.

1168
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,443
Mummy!

1169
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:46,406
Help me, mummy!

1170
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,076
Raah!

1171
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,021
Mummy!

1172
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,133
Dick!

1173
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,373
Dick!

1174
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,011
No!

1175
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,146
Christ.

1176
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,552
He's gone?

1177
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:26,489
No.

1178
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,820
Dad, you don't know.

1179
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:31,925
He can swim so far.

1180
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:08,927
Mary?

1181
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,667
Mary?

1182
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,920
I said it would happen, didn't I?

1183
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:38,188
I told you.

1184
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:40,555
Ohh, look...

1185
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:42,104
Look.

1186
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,968
Come and look.

1187
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,578
Look at your son.

1188
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:18,125
Oh... Christ.

1189
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,105
Where did you get him?

1190
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,883
I got him from God.

1191
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:37,094
It's because we've been forgiven.

1192
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,889
Christ.

1193
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,357
Give him to me.

1194
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:43,218
No. He's my baby.

1195
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,426
Give him to me!

1196
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:45,588
No! He's my baby!

1197
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:47,296
God promised.

1198
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:50,866
He said I could have him.

1199
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,097
Mary, where did you get him?

1200
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:56,003
I got him from God.

1201
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,070
Where did you get him?

1202
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,036
God.

1203
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:01,310
Where?

1204
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:02,141
God.

1205
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,575
Mary... Where?

1206
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,111
God.

1207
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:07,076
God, from God...

1208
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:09,652
Where... where did God leave him?

1209
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,593
Shop 'n save.

1210
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,386
It was easy...

1211
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,126
Easy.

1212
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:24,900
She left the stroller by the turnstiles.

1213
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:26,771
That was risking it, wasn't it?

1214
01:08:26,772 --> 01:08:29,839
When I was at the check-out, I saw her.

1215
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,808
I saw her just leaving him there...

1216
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,309
Going off like that.

1217
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:37,512
Well, it was easy, wasn't it?

1218
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,881
Wasn't it, ba-ba?

1219
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,982
Shh, ba-ba.

1220
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,594
Come on.

1221
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,555
Uh, where's the officer in charge?

1222
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,931
Over there.

1223
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:29,532
Lieutenant...

1224
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,600
Um, we've found the baby.

1225
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:32,601
Is he here?

1226
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:35,337
Yes, um, my wife has him.

1227
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,538
Get the mother.

1228
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,840
Right away, sir.

1229
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:38,771
Francis?

1230
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:39,935
Ma? Mummy...

1231
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:44,413
Uh, my name's crick.

1232
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:46,348
Shh, baby.

1233
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,649
I'm a teacher at Franklin high.

1234
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:51,420
We...

1235
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,888
We found the baby

1236
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:55,157
outside the school.

1237
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:56,508
Uh...

1238
01:09:56,509 --> 01:09:57,859
Where is he? Is he all right?

1239
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,461
Oh, my g...

1240
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,062
He's all right. He's quite safe.

1241
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:02,431
Oh! My baby!

1242
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,099
Mary. Mary...

1243
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,970
Come to mommy! Thank God! Ohh!

1244
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:10,239
It's o.K.! Mommy's here.

1245
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,576
Oh... Oh, thank you.

1246
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,537
Oh!

1247
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,812
My baby.

1248
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:17,980
It's o.K.

1249
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:20,081
It's o.K.

1250
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,339
Oh... Oh!

1251
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:21,411
Oh... Oh!

1252
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,925
Mary...

1253
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:45,628
Look, I can't...

1254
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,535
Just... just talk...

1255
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:48,867
Just talk to me.

1256
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:49,972
Don't cry.

1257
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,573
Aah!

1258
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:57,111
Aah!

1259
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,313
Just... just talk to me, Mary.

1260
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,821
Just talk to me.

1261
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:13,126
Talk about what?

1262
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,090
I think...

1263
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:43,826
I think perhaps you should see someone,

1264
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:46,187
a counselor.

1265
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,596
We could both go.

1266
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:57,369
I just...

1267
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,474
I just think you need some help.

1268
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:00,906
You've just stolen a baby.

1269
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,910
What are you going to do next?

1270
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:05,912
Are you going to kill someone?

1271
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:08,550
I'm sorry.

1272
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,151
I didn't mean...

1273
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:11,687
I'm sorry.

1274
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:14,018
No. I've done that, haven't I?

1275
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:21,264
I wouldn't want to repeat myself.

1276
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:29,236
It was my fault.

1277
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:39,413
You're leaving me, aren't you?

1278
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,580
How could I leave you?

1279
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:50,692
Without much of a backward glance...

1280
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,763
I'd say.

1281
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:20,088
But she did leave me, children.

1282
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,919
A week later I came home

1283
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:26,085
to an empty house and a note.

1284
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,355
She said she'd left me,

1285
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:29,881
probably forever.

1286
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,402
<i>I know what I did was wrong.</i>

1287
01:14:31,403 --> 01:14:34,401
<i>I'll never forget...</i>

1288
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,403
<i>Or forgive myself for the look
on that mother's face,</i>

1289
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,807
<i>but I swear I knew no other way</i>

1290
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,379
<i>to break out of this prison.</i>

1291
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:45,107
<i>And we've been in it for so long, tom.</i>

1292
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:47,398
At the end,

1293
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,679
she asked me if I'd take
back her library book.

1294
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:52,916
It was two weeks overdue.

1295
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,757
I'll see you.

1296
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,588
Yeah, bye.

1297
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,956
Mr. crick?

1298
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:04,195
Mr. crick...

1299
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,130
Price.

1300
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,834
Yeah. Hi.

1301
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,866
What are you doing here?

1302
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:11,772
Uh... Extra math.

1303
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:14,910
Extra math?

1304
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,778
After school?

1305
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:19,679
What, voluntarily?

1306
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:24,192
Y-yeah. Just started.

1307
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:30,588
Oh.

1308
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,261
Bloody hell, price!

1309
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,862
Why do you make all that effort
for mathematics

1310
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,698
and nothing for history?

1311
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:40,099
'Cause math makes sense.

1312
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,035
45...

1313
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,313
45...

1314
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:53,081
Where's the 45 bus stop, price?

1315
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,882
What, don't you have your car?

1316
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,395
Oh, no.

1317
01:15:57,403 --> 01:15:58,923
I'm having a drink with Mr., um, Scott.

1318
01:15:58,924 --> 01:16:01,922
I thought it was best if I...

1319
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:03,555
Didn't, um...

1320
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,990
I didn't drink and, uh, you know.

1321
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,056
Did you get fired?

1322
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,404
Is everyone expecting me to get fired?

1323
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:15,144
Yes.

1324
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:16,638
Well, they're wrong!

1325
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:21,079
I've been retired.

1326
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:25,251
Sounds much better, doesn't it?

1327
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:35,488
Do you want a drink?

1328
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:39,561
Or have you got to go off somewhere?

1329
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:41,262
Well, I'm underage.

1330
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,004
Oh, hell, price, just a drink.

1331
01:16:43,005 --> 01:16:46,829
It's not as if it's the first
time, is it?

1332
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,666
I mean, you must have...

1333
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:52,041
Been to a bar before, haven't you?

1334
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:55,908
O.K., fella.

1335
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,646
It came as no surprise.

1336
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:01,516
Scott's been after my job for years.

1337
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:02,717
Just... Just, uh...

1338
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,189
You know, Mr. crick, I'm sorry.

1339
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,558
Oh, that's rather nice of you, price.

1340
01:17:09,559 --> 01:17:11,759
No, I'm sorry about what I did.

1341
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:15,931
Some of the kids were talking
about complaining to Scott,

1342
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:18,702
and I said, "go ahead."

1343
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,742
I'm sorry.

1344
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,407
Ohh...

1345
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,109
I've had it coming...

1346
01:17:28,111 --> 01:17:30,341
A long time.

1347
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:34,476
Well, some of those girls, they, uh...

1348
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:35,724
You can't really...

1349
01:17:35,725 --> 01:17:38,748
I mean, an eel down the panties?

1350
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,655
I know, it's absolutely right.

1351
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:44,257
Screwing on a train, it's disgusting.

1352
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:54,366
I mean, I should be
the one who apologizes.

1353
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,770
I was absolutely wrong.

1354
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,906
I shouldn't have done it.

1355
01:17:57,907 --> 01:18:00,737
It wasn't fair on you.

1356
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,251
Aw, I didn't mind.

1357
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:05,847
Didn't you?

1358
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,816
I thought you did mind.

1359
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:10,147
I seem to remember you didn't...

1360
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:13,793
You weren't very fond of my stories.

1361
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,620
No, I wasn't. Not at first.

1362
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:19,186
I thought you were telling them for us.

1363
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,025
I thought, "hey, give me a break."

1364
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,666
But then I figured you were
doing it for yourself,

1365
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,597
and I thought that's o.K.

1366
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:30,242
You know, I didn't mind then.

1367
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,273
Strange.

1368
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,675
I thought I was telling them for you.

1369
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:40,748
I mean, I thought you were scared.

1370
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:44,990
That's what you do for children
when they're scared, isn't it?

1371
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:48,287
You tell them stories. I'm sorry...
not children.

1372
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:01,899
Well...

1373
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,742
Have you...

1374
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:11,254
Have you heard from your wife?

1375
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,749
No.

1376
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:20,249
Do you know where she is?

1377
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:23,888
Yes.

1378
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:28,026
Come on.

1379
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,630
One for the road.

1380
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:31,432
Yeah. Sure.

1381
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:42,709
The kid, you sure he's 18?

1382
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:43,682
Yeah.

1383
01:19:43,683 --> 01:19:46,548
Yeah. Look...

1384
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:49,949
I mean, I know.

1385
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,252
He's my son.

1386
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:16,775
<i>I can brush my hair.</i>

1387
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,209
<i>Oh, what beautiful flowers.</i>

1388
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:23,515
<i>Jonah! Jonah! Come here!</i>

1389
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:26,988
<i>I mean, why aren't you at the school?</i>

1390
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:56,022
Today,
as many of you will already know,

1391
01:20:56,023 --> 01:21:00,988
it is my sad task to have
to say goodbye...

1392
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,660
To Mr. tom crick...

1393
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:10,057
Who, after 20 years
as a pillar of our school,

1394
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,426
is leaving us.

1395
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:17,235
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. tom crick.

1396
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:51,405
As...

1397
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:54,735
Uh, Mr. Scott has told you,

1398
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,612
I've been teaching here for...

1399
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:00,053
A long time.

1400
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:03,247
Probably much too long.

1401
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,959
Oh, maybe you'd be...

1402
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,598
Interested to learn...

1403
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,668
Why I chose...

1404
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:21,399
History.

1405
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:25,740
I was in Europe, uh, Germany,

1406
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:28,941
right at the end of the war...

1407
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:31,405
The second world war.

1408
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,150
I was about your age.

1409
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:44,220
And they were still digging the...

1410
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:46,626
Corpses out of the...

1411
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,729
The rubble.

1412
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,161
Um...

1413
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:53,626
Women and... and... Children.

1414
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,496
And, uh...

1415
01:22:56,272 --> 01:22:58,907
And of course babies, and...

1416
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:02,108
And the only way that I could cope

1417
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:03,941
with what I was seeing

1418
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:06,606
was to think of it...

1419
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:07,605
As history,

1420
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,516
as part of a...

1421
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:11,286
Part of a story...

1422
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:16,187
And not just those bits of meat.

1423
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:19,762
And that's what we've been doing.

1424
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,630
Telling stories...

1425
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,632
Children.

1426
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,100
But there's...

1427
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,106
One story...

1428
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:36,238
We never quite finished, isn't there?

1429
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:50,758
So, tom crick and Mary metcalf.

1430
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,830
So we did it together, did we?

1431
01:23:55,965 --> 01:23:57,765
We ain't got no money,

1432
01:23:57,767 --> 01:24:00,427
but we can get you something.

1433
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:02,236
Anything.

1434
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:27,391
You know, my old bill

1435
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:31,566
says young Freddie parr
don't come round no more...

1436
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,736
With his whiskey bottles and stuff.

1437
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:37,806
My bill's missing his bottles.

1438
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:40,207
Anything, Martha. Please.

1439
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:41,439
Martha?

1440
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,478
Mrs. Clay to you, boy.

1441
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:46,309
Where's your manners?

1442
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:53,188
Now, girl, you swallow some of this.

1443
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:56,089
Don't matter if you don't like it.

1444
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,762
Just swallow.

1445
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:02,861
It ain't going to be so
much fun getting it out

1446
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:05,495
as it were putting it in.

1447
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:07,901
Fetch the kettle.

1448
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:14,267
You're a pretty one, ain't you?

1449
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,736
Now, gal...

1450
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,580
Martha don't want to hurt you.

1451
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:19,551
But if she do,

1452
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:23,418
you just put your hand over the candle.

1453
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:26,249
Right over the flame.

1454
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,756
Put the kettle there.

1455
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:36,259
Martha's tool kit.

1456
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:39,425
You make yourself scarce, boy.

1457
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,941
Now then, girl,
turn to your side.

1458
01:25:44,942 --> 01:25:48,076
I want you to get up on there.
That's right.

1459
01:25:48,077 --> 01:25:50,577
Please don't hurt me, Martha.

1460
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:51,409
Please don't.

1461
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:53,181
Sit leaning forward.

1462
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:54,752
Please!

1463
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:58,245
That's right.

1464
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:05,160
That's right.

1465
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:06,828
Aah! Aah!

1466
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:09,059
Shh, shh! It's all right.

1467
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:10,164
It's all right.

1468
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,096
Shh, shh. Now keep still.

1469
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:23,011
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1470
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,046
Aah! Aah!

1471
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,078
Hush. Hush.

1472
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,351
Shh, shh, shh.

1473
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,252
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1474
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:34,856
All right. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1475
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:37,687
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1476
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:38,363
Oh, God.

1477
01:26:38,364 --> 01:26:40,428
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1478
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:43,629
Mother of God. Mother of God.

1479
01:26:43,632 --> 01:26:46,201
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1480
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,542
Aah!

1481
01:26:49,572 --> 01:26:50,738
Aah!

1482
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:51,869
Tom!

1483
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:54,242
Tom!

1484
01:26:54,243 --> 01:26:56,878
Tom!

1485
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,909
Tom!

1486
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:01,816
Aah!

1487
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:47,855
From that day,

1488
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:53,273
I discovered there are many ways
the world can end...

1489
01:27:54,136 --> 01:27:56,836
As many ways as there are people.

1490
01:27:56,839 --> 01:27:59,507
You've got to do it, boy.

1491
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:00,568
In the river, boy.

1492
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,836
And when you throws it, never you look.

1493
01:28:02,845 --> 01:28:04,275
It's bad luck if you do.

1494
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,150
Then you best get back here.

1495
01:28:06,151 --> 01:28:09,718
May have to take her to the hospital.

1496
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:23,496
And I think, too, that...

1497
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:28,399
In one life there can be
more than one ending.

1498
01:28:28,404 --> 01:28:30,244
Ohh!

1499
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:35,744
It's been like that in mine.

1500
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:42,546
But as for what...

1501
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:45,351
Really bothers some of you...

1502
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:47,454
The end of the future,

1503
01:28:47,456 --> 01:28:49,756
the final end...

1504
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,193
How can I help you?

1505
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:54,895
I can't.

1506
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:59,300
I'm the same as you now.

1507
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:00,668
I don't...

1508
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,339
Expect much from my future.

1509
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,106
I mean, I'm gone. I'm...

1510
01:29:05,107 --> 01:29:07,237
I'm history.

1511
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:13,752
But at your age, price...

1512
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:17,554
Ohh...

1513
01:29:17,986 --> 01:29:20,416
At your age...

1514
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:40,757
Do you know,

1515
01:29:40,758 --> 01:29:42,908
I sometimes think all this
story telling is a...

1516
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:45,079
Is a bit like a disease,

1517
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,417
a disease that I caught a long time ago.

1518
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:51,548
A disease of the fens...

1519
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,988
Like influenza.

1520
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:57,289
I caught it from my father,
he was a storyteller.

1521
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,962
He caught it from his father,

1522
01:29:58,963 --> 01:30:02,897
and he caught it from his...
Back, back it went.

1523
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:06,128
Goblins and sprites and...

1524
01:30:06,135 --> 01:30:08,265
Murders...

1525
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,270
Will-o'-the-wisps...

1526
01:30:10,272 --> 01:30:14,041
The headless ferryman...

1527
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:17,242
The madwoman of the marsh.

1528
01:30:17,546 --> 01:30:20,646
Still, it seemed to keep
my father going...

1529
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:24,579
Through his life, telling stories...

1530
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:27,588
Though they never ended well.

1531
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:32,759
And it was always blood and horror or...

1532
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:37,263
Just sadness and despair.

1533
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,476
I said to him once,

1534
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:43,295
"don't you know any stories
that have a happy ending?"

1535
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:45,735
He said no.

1536
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:46,611
No.

1537
01:30:46,612 --> 01:30:50,738
He said if I was to ever find one...

1538
01:30:52,214 --> 01:30:56,524
I should be sure to let him know.
