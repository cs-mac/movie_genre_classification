1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,831
.

2
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,020
Excuse me.

3
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,373
Good Morning.

4
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,804
Good Morning.

5
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,085
- Good Morning.
Hello, how are you?

6
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:24,244
Fine, thanks.

7
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,604
So, when are we going to the movies?

8
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,625
Tomorrow.

9
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,678
Right, tomorrow,
Always "tomorrow".

10
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,152
- Don't you believe me?
- No.

11
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,565
Never lose hope!

12
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,606
- Good morning.
- I'll call her.

13
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:56,047
Close the door, asshole.

14
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:57,567
Your friend is here.

15
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,609
I know.

16
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,409
Your father doesn't like
your doing that!

17
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,529
But you are not telling anything.

18
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,009
Why didn't you go to class today?

20
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,210
I didn't feel well.

21
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,091
Did you bring the psicology book?

22
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:22,288
No, it weighted a lot,
I'll bring it tomorrow.

23
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,151
I'm going to the bathroom.

24
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,257
Do you know what could happen if
my father comes and I'm not here?

25
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,178
Come on, stay.

26
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:24,258
Let's study together.

27
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,337
We have to go to the cinema.
Please, Caro.

28
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:30,257
Why we "have"?
What's up? What's up with you?

29
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:32,619
Please.

30
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,899
- Hello, daughter.
- Hi dad!

31
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,700
Are you tired?
- Yes, today I am.

32
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,380
- Oh! poor dad!
- Hello, Ana!

33
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:14,632
For example "party".

34
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,184
Do you know how to write "party"?

35
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:22,943
The "P" goes first. But you write it
small because it's not a proper noun.

36
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,344
Yes.

37
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,585
- The "A", that you already know
- Yes.

38
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,505
- Yes, like that.
- Like this.

39
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,276
- The "R"?
- Yes, I know that one.

40
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:32,508
- Do you know it?
- Yes.

41
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,951
- ¿Do you know how to write it?
- Yes.

42
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,477
That one is more like a "B".

43
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:43,506
- OK, remember to always draw
the "E" lower.

44
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:47,866
That way, you can tell this is a Capital
letter and these are small letters.

45
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,587
Try to follow the line.

46
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:54,145
- Do you see the lines?, do you want me to
mark them stronger?

47
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,646
No, I see them fine.

48
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:58,568
For example. That's a line.

49
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:03,388
"I went to see my daughter. I
took breakfast with my wife."

50
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,188
"Then we went to build
the walls of our house."

51
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:11,589
"Luckily, we are almost there.
The situation is not too good."

52
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,349
"But we are anxious to finish so we
can be with my wife and my daughter."

53
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,630
"Today my brother-in-law
help me to finish sooner."

54
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,550
"I think that in a couple of weeks
I'll finish it."

55
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,831
It's good. Very good.
Would you hand it to me so I can correct it?

56
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,911
Thank you.

57
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:38,913
- Hey, Ramón, what happened to you there?
- Well, I burnt it.

58
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:43,113
- What was it?
- A tattoo, some initials.

59
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,773
Whose?

60
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,053
A girlfriend that I had.

61
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,094
So?

62
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,794
Well, she left with other guy.

63
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,475
- And I buurnt it.
- Did it hurt?

64
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:01,915
Yes, it hurt me.

65
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:05,115
I burnt it with
ammoniac and dry ice.

66
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:07,836
Very good.

67
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,076
You already know how to
write your own name.

68
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,744
Yes. It's the first time I sign.

69
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:15,192
It's the first time I came to school.

70
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:19,557
If it was up to me, I would go elementary,
to know how to read.

71
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:22,236
I'll be coming here and teaching you.

72
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:23,557
Well. Thank you.

73
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,839
They're patrolling every night.
Checking house by house.

74
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,719
You shouldn't go to the suburbs.
It's very dangerous.

75
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,560
What could happen to me?.
Everybody knows me there.

76
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,360
I think that you shouldn't go anymore.

77
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,947
Stay put, We have a car next to us.

78
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,348
Open your eyes.
Four guys inside.

79
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:18,883
There. They're gone.

80
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:25,284
I know this neighbourhood.
I don't want to know where you live.

81
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,125
I'll see you at the stadium.

82
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,426
Felix!

83
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,567
Where did you get all these clothes?

84
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,806
It is almost new.

85
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,087
Where I work there are
a lot of rich people.

86
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,247
They use it once and then
they give it away.

87
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:59,048
There are have's and have-not's.
Thanks for your company.

88
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:41,712
Move your feet.
This is not your home.

89
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:01,055
Do you want to see a picture of my girlfriend?

90
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:08,075
What are you doing with that? Give it back to me!

91
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,856
¿Are you crazy?
¿What are you doing with my picture?

92
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:20,490
Let's do this. I keep your
picture and I give you one of mine.

93
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,518
You're cuter in the picture.

94
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:47,700
It doesn't amount to keeping a girl's picture in
your wallet for her to be your girlfriend, Felix.

95
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,020
And pay the rent. It's 15th already.

96
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,390
Mother!

97
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,671
Maria Fabiani?

98
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,151
Yes?

99
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,352
It's here.

100
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:51,999
Armed people in my house?

101
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,033
Who are you? Where is my daughter?

102
00:12:56,154 --> 00:13:02,194
Are you policemen?
Argentinian Army! What do you want?

103
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:06,275
We are going to take your daughter
to ask her some questions, madam.

104
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:14,276
Where are you taking her?
Sir! Where are you taking her?

105
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:18,235
If you cared so much about your daughter,
you should have started caring long before.

106
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:21,436
Get down. Come on.
Where are you going? Get up.

107
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:38,118
Get down, get up, down, up,
down, up, down, up.

108
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,519
We'll be alone, you and I.

109
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,240
He says he's a renter.
Look up his picture.

110
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
Why did you remove your moustache?
In order to confuse to us?

111
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,601
You look again and I kill you.

112
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:02,521
The year that I've got the ID
I wore a moustache.

113
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,881
- When were you born?
- March 3 of 1947.

114
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,081
And who lives next door?

115
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,002
It's the other renter.
It's two of us.

116
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:20,326
What does he do?
Does he steal?

117
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:24,363
He is a mechanic.
He works in a garage.

118
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,125
Walk, piece of shit.

119
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:57,287
We're done.
Let's get going.

120
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:03,248
So this is the famous little teacher?

121
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:08,208
Come on.

122
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,410
Get up. Come on.
Let her go.

123
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,010
Calm down, mom,
nothing is going to happen to me.

124
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,812
Where do you take her?

125
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:42,892
Where do you take her?

126
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:45,212
Where do you take her?

127
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,212
Please, where do you take her?

128
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,773
Police Station 23, madam.

129
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,258
Get off.

130
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,138
Tiger, this is the teacher.

131
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,718
Fine.

132
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:49,099
Look down.

133
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,520
She's going to be AO1.

134
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,879
Name?

135
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,260
Maria Fabiani.

136
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,901
War name?

137
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,981
War name?

138
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,901
Are you deaf?

139
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,981
Maria Fabiani.

140
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,000
Did you have a nickname when you were a kid?

141
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,001
Take her to the operating room.

142
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,502
Walk.

143
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,702
Texas, do you hear me? You have to go to
Pampa 20513G. It's a couple. They're unarmed.

144
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:32,224
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, come on. Move.

145
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:00,732
For you, this is the world of sounds.

146
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,890
From now on, you're not going
to see ever more. Never more.

147
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:07,988
And if you see something, I'm going to
remove your eyes with a spoon.

148
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,148
Take of your clothes, baby.

149
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:21,989
Take of your clothes, or I'll break
every one of your bones.

150
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,470
Everything.

151
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,982
So you are the poor's teacher?

152
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:28,156
- Commissioner.
- Yes, coming.

153
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:37,756
It could have been a lieutenant, or not.
Maybe he wasn't.

154
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:39,578
But they were from the army!

155
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,800
But they lie.
The rebels cand lie.

156
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,400
They were from the army!

157
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,558
And how do you know they were from the army?
Please, keep your voice down.

158
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,919
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

159
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,759
I brought clothes and food
for my husband...

160
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,278
No, madam! I 've already told you
that your husband is not here...

161
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,399
I am sure that they brought him here.

162
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,920
They told that they were
bringing him here...

163
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,759
Could you be so kind to
check your list again?

164
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,385
No, madam. I've already checked a
thousand times. Your husband is not here.

165
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,446
I remembered new things.

166
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:12,701
I want to file another report.

167
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,781
- Vasquez.
- Yes, Commisioner.

168
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,742
- Please, file another report for the lady
- Yes, sir.

169
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:24,962
If they've told you they were from the army
I suggest you go to the commando.

170
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,002
I want to file a report.

171
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:31,882
Pablo Gomez, metalurgic worker,
kidnapped on October 28th.

172
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:33,604
It was my house.

173
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:38,456
There were many of them,
and they were armed.

174
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,844
- How many?
- A lot.

175
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,505
They hit him. Taken him
They said they were from the army.

176
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:46,605
- How long ago did they take him?
- About 3 weeks and two days.

177
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:49,805
- What did they said?
- That they were bringing him to Police Station 23.

178
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,690
I'm going to try at the other ones.

179
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,706
Fuck!

180
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:02,247
Tiger! Tiger!
Emergency in the operating room.

181
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,690
Is she dead?

182
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:46,251
Untie her.

183
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,493
Get off.

184
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,336
What happened?

185
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:33,497
For 10 hours giving it to her
and she doesn't speak. Not a word.

186
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,897
What does the table says for 90 pounds?

187
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:40,817
15,000 volts.

188
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:45,098
15,000. And how many did you give her?

189
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:49,017
I was doing OK, I...
Well, she didn't speak... so I have to...

190
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:51,499
There's a reason for the table to be there.

191
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:03,220
OK. She's stable.
You can continue.

192
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,621
Don't give her water.

193
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,823
Big. It has two bedrooms.
But, it is old.

194
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:36,063
We'll have to repaint it.
You're going to like it. It has a big garden.

195
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:39,784
Didn't you wanted a swimming pool?
Well, we'll build a swimming pool.

196
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,824
Hey, Texas! Texas, do you hear me?

197
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:49,665
See what that asshole wants.
- Do you hear me?

198
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:50,905
Hello.

199
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:57,265
I hear you soldier. Luckily I don't see you,
but I hear you. What do you want?

200
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,625
Tell your boss that the
motherfucker...

201
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,425
...that you brought yesterday
swallowed a pill.

202
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,706
I'll call you later.

203
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:08,906
What are you saying?

204
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,026
Cyanide, Texas, cyanide!

205
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:14,468
Tell me, Texas...
Where do you have your eyes when you check them?

206
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,348
In your ass, right?

207
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,308
I've checked him, Texas. He must
had had it in his teeth.

208
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,788
Where did he have it?

209
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:22,989
In the neck of his shirt.

210
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:28,389
We'll have to star all over!
All over!

211
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:31,509
Come, come. Get closer that I want
to show you a little thing.

212
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,989
What the fuck do you want now?

213
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,490
I've made him spit it.

214
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,350
You are motherfucking asshole, Felix!

215
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,989
Here it is.

216
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,550
Hey, little bird!

217
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,751
You are not gong to die when you decide it.

218
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:47,191
We are the ones that decide when
it is time to die. Here we are God!

219
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:51,572
Hey, Félix, I've finished my shift.
Your turn now.

220
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,972
What did you leave me?

221
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:55,572
A chick that didn't said a word.
I was 10 hours working on her.

222
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:58,933
Not a shout. She retains air down here
I don't know how she does it.

223
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,953
Maybe yoga. Go.

224
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:20,815
What size are you?

225
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,215
10.

226
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:23,975
Take them off.

227
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:31,336
As if you are going to need them...

228
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,421
Water, water, water.

229
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:17,060
You can drink water now.
You're loaded as a battery.

230
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,421
Water.

231
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:30,522
Felix!

232
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:34,542
Maria, what are you doing here?

233
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,863
What did they do to you?

234
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,702
They've caught you too?

235
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:41,624
They brought us for a control check.
What did they do to you?

236
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:44,063
We have to go, Felix.
They are going to kill us.

237
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,503
We can't go.

238
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:48,104
They're going to kill us.
Did they do anything to you?

239
00:26:48,184 --> 00:26:51,851
No, I've already told you.
It's only a control check.

240
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:59,228
You have 15 minutes to make her talk.
Come to my office when you're finished.

241
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,587
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!

242
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,347
Stay put!

243
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,870
If you talk you're saved.

244
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:49,631
Tell me where you were going
to meet your friends.

245
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:57,472
If I bring here one of them,
you're saved.

246
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:05,999
I'm not going to talk.

247
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,579
It's a personal favor.

248
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,167
- What? Do you know her?
- Yes.

249
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:08,359
It's hard, isn't it?
When you know them.

250
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,599
But my shift is over.

251
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,920
Are you sure, sergeant?

252
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,641
Let's see who is this chick
that is worth so much!

253
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,361
Listen carefully!

254
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:30,524
One pause every quarter of hour.
The machine is already set up according to the table.

255
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:33,641
If you put one finger on her,
I fucking kill you.

256
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:36,723
Ok, calm down soldier! I am the one
doing the favor.

257
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,165
Who's next?

258
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:08,777
Literature professor.
Ideologic subversive.

259
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,907
This one, we know him.

260
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,183
Blanquita, militant.
She knows.

261
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:18,607
This one makes trouble at the suburbs.

262
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,388
Law student,
Blanquita's friend, militant.

263
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,969
I'm going to wash all those strange
ideas out of your head.

264
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,850
Parliament.

265
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,790
No. Again.

266
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:52,210
Colorado.

267
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:56,098
Good! It seems that you know them.

268
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,652
What's up? Are you thirsty?

269
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:14,564
Yes, I'm thirsty.

270
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:17,213
You can't drink yet.

271
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:21,782
If you drink right now, do you know what's going
to happen? You're going to end like a fried chicken.

272
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,572
Where is my mom?

273
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:34,935
That renter, that lives in your house and
has all that stuff in his room. Who is he?

274
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,748
I don't know.
Does my mom know that I am here?

275
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:43,377
- Your mom? Little frenchy?
- Yes.

276
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:46,999
What the fuck do I care about your mom.

277
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:56,651
- You are... ¿How old are you?
- 18.

278
00:31:56,858 --> 00:32:00,298
18. You finished high school, right?

279
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:05,332
- Do you speak french like your mom?
- No.

280
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:11,059
- So you don't speak french. What about italian?
- Yes. No.

281
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,000
How come? You do speak italian.
Say something in french.

282
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,781
So, sergeant?

283
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:24,999
Nothing. She doesn't want to speak, soldier.
Give 5 more minutes and I'll make her talk.

284
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:26,341
Go away.

285
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:32,624
This chick doesn't know anything
It doesn't have a single piece of info.

286
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,502
a pleasure, miss.

287
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:53,264
You have to collaborate more,
if you want me to help you.

288
00:32:55,144 --> 00:33:00,536
Do you know where I am going now?
Up. There we gather all of us.

289
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:05,806
We analyze the results, and see
who gave us useful information.

290
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:14,847
The one that gave us
useful info goes away.

291
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,567
Do you know where he goes?

292
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:31,956
I'm leaving.
It's over.

293
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,044
Felix! Do you want me to tell you something?

294
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:44,951
Do you want to know where we should've met?
At the stadium. Behind the goal.

295
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,637
That match you're listening
First half is over now.

296
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,405
We had to met at the starting whistle.

297
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:56,141
There's no one now.
Now I can tell you.

298
00:33:56,471 --> 00:34:00,348
I don't know their names. How
to find them. Where they live.

299
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,627
- That's not useful.
- I know.

300
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,313
Dress up. Quickly.
Let's see if I come back.

301
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:17,399
Come on.

302
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,254
Come on.

303
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,439
Prisoners, may I have you attention.

304
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,319
We've decided to legalize
all 20 of you.

305
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,079
All of you are at the disposal
of the national government.

306
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:15,320
To be judged by the
Federal Justice.

307
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,879
While you wait for your trial you're
going to be transferred to a penitentiary in Rawson.

308
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,801
Now, we are going to vaccinate you
as required by the penitentiary's regulations.

309
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:27,368
Once you're there you will be allowed to
see your family once a month. I am clear?

310
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:03,765
Sir, why doesn't my brother come with me?

311
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:07,585
Your has some little things to tell us.
You're going to see him later.

312
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,886
Careful!

313
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:36,209
I don't feel well!

314
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,929
Move!

315
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:03,010
Ah!

316
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,173
You were saved by him.

317
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:25,197
Put the bandage on. If you see the face
of any of them you're dead, understood?

318
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,914
Follow my orders.

319
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:44,136
How I was supposed to know
that he was still there?

320
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,815
After the initial whistle all had to leave.
Why did you stay?

321
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,537
I waited for you,
I wanted to see you.

322
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:53,457
How do you hook him up?

323
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,737
A01 sung the number.

324
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:00,657
Just in case you go out,
mi name is Francisco Hoffman.

325
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,418
I'm Maria Fabiani.

326
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:05,989
If I've listen to you again
I'm going to rip your tongue off.

327
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,541
Do you want me to kill you, son of a bitch?
Do you want me to kill you?

328
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,619
Interrogate him when the operating
room is free.

329
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,380
- After that, do all the paperwork, ok?
- Yes, sir.

330
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:33,901
- Did you find anything?
- No.

331
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,882
Take off the handcuffs.

332
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:40,901
Do you know where are we going? Down.
I'm going to plug 220v in your balls...

333
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,541
...till they are as small as raisins.

334
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,623
Stop it, stop it. Don't touch me.
I've got an address to give you.

335
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:50,264
- What address?
- 327 Falucho.

336
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,883
- Who is there?
- Four guys.

337
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:56,484
- And who assures me that they're still there?
- They are going to be there.

338
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:30,628
Who's there! Lower your weapon!
Lower your weapon!

339
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,188
Don't look! Against the wall!

340
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:36,788
Look down!

341
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:42,449
Nice group of terrorists!

342
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,949
- We are from Garage Olimpo!
- And I am Mario Kempes.

343
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,949
- Check it.
- Shut up, assholes.

344
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,830
- Where are you from?
- Garage Olimpo. GT4.

345
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,990
What are you lookin at!
Lower your head!.

346
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,510
Check them.

347
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,310
Do you read me, sir.

348
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,430
Give of a description of them.

349
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,631
- Name - Felix.
- Felix. - Felix.

350
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:00,831
Sideburns. White.

351
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:02,591
- 6 ft.
- 6 ft.

352
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:09,312
Afirmative. Apparently they didnt ask for
liberated zone. That created the confusion.

353
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:12,831
Where the fuck are you from?

354
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,777
Athletic Club. GT7.

355
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,513
Didn't they warn you?

356
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:19,666
- How many prisioners at charge?
- Two of them.

357
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:24,554
Francisco! No, no!

358
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,614
- This is the data?
- This was the data.

359
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,214
And the other.
The other comes with me.

360
00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:37,335
Ok, guys. It's over. Let's go.
Two days for nothing.

361
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:41,915
Let's go.

362
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,061
Go. Go. Pull a little.

363
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:08,844
- Go. Raise it.
- Slow. That's it.

364
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,487
I've brought you the beer that you like.

365
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:29,020
We have to celebrate that you're alive.

366
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:33,246
- Did you see my mom?
- Yes.

367
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:35,767
- How is she?
- Fine.

368
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:38,750
- does she know that I'm here?
- No.

369
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,970
I'm going to bring you something to hang.

370
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,291
I'm going to get you some blankets.

371
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,211
- Eh?
- Get up.

372
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,721
I'm dirty, Felix.

373
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:19,182
Do you realize that I'm the only one
you have in here?

374
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,016
Silence!

375
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,176
Quiet.

376
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:54,516
Silence!

377
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:56,937
What's the fucking matter?
Walk!

378
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,351
Sew it well.

379
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,743
Sew it as well as you can.

380
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:42,001
The most important thing
here is not to show your fear.

381
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:45,901
You have to fake it.
Fake it all the time.

382
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:50,142
Happiness. Despair. Sadness.
Fake it with the body.

383
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:57,742
Now, There is a problem.

384
00:44:57,743 --> 00:45:00,656
No, no, no.
Don't look at me.

385
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:04,544
The problem is the eyes.

386
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,624
You can fake it with your eyes
And they know it.

387
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:12,015
That's why they're always looking for
your glance. To know if you're lying.

388
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:39,188
I'm going to kill you all!

389
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,708
Get off me!

390
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:47,549
Get off me!
Fucking son of a bitch!

391
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,810
What the fuck did you do, Texas?

392
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,240
He's full of blood. Clean him up.

393
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:09,880
I've already did my job. I've brought
him alive. Now it's on you.

394
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:14,553
- You also tied him wrong. You're useless.
- Go fuck yourself!

395
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,983
Everybody get out.
Quickly.

396
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:19,999
Get out.

397
00:47:21,363 --> 00:47:22,923
You're going to work.

398
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:27,423
You're going to swill down the
corridor, the cell, everything.

399
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,897
Do not talk with anybody.
Make me look good.

400
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:33,206
I hear you.

401
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:36,567
You're the army's chaplain.
You have to help me.

402
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:40,127
The army took mi husband,
and I can't find him anywhere.

403
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:41,147
Name?

404
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:43,887
- Gloria de Gomez.
- No. Your husband's name.

405
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:46,732
Pablo Gomez, metalurgic worker.

406
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:49,688
Describe me what happened.

407
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,569
They took him from my house
on October 28th at 6PM...

408
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,048
...they messed up everything and
pushed me to the floor and hit me...

409
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:59,890
...and ask me questions...

410
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:03,170
...they hit me hard and made hard
questions...

411
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:08,194
...the only thing I wanted was to see my husband.
but they said don't look! don't look...

412
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,364
...but I saw everyone's face.

413
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:17,492
- Would you recognize them?
- Yes.

414
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:23,452
Look. I can't find him right now.

415
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:29,608
What you should do is make a list
of names of your husband's friends.

416
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:32,733
So we can find who saw him last...

417
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:34,333
...and help us locate him.

418
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:37,694
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

419
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:52,415
Don't say anything.
They ask for names.

420
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,416
- They ask for names.
- Next.

421
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:57,856
Don't say anything.
They ask for names.

422
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,740
Send Nene to the operating room.
Quickly!

423
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,820
What? You can't do it by yourself, fag?

424
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:51,822
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

425
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,406
It's ugly to be afraid, isn't it?

426
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:59,415
Have you suffered hunger?

427
00:51:00,303 --> 00:51:02,343
A few times.

428
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:06,383
- I've suffered it many times
- Is that right?

429
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:11,184
I don't want to suffer it again because
of people like you.

430
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:16,745
While we are here, you'll always have
something to eat, motherfucker.

431
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,725
- It broke up. Find what it has.
- I can't.

432
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:26,626
- How come you can't?
- I can't.

433
00:51:26,746 --> 00:51:30,505
I can fix an air conditioning, a car,
a dishwasher.

434
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:32,426
but I will not fix the machine.

435
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:36,267
I can't.

436
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:40,787
So you don't fix it?

437
00:51:40,788 --> 00:51:42,982
Do you want me to fix it?

438
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:49,028
With this, even the dead talk.

439
00:51:49,348 --> 00:51:52,191
Stop it, Felix.
Give it to me. I'll fix it.

440
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,789
Two minutes.

441
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,243
I'll start with this.

442
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:58,436
Take the clubs to the car.

443
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:00,636
If you want, we can have dinner together...

444
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:05,316
Another time.
I need you to do me a great favor.

445
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:10,037
You know that you can ask me anything.

446
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:15,317
I'm so happy to see you.
Do you need money?

447
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,718
No.

448
00:53:17,678 --> 00:53:21,558
They've broke in my house. They were many.
They were armed.

449
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,958
They have taken Maria...

450
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,039
...they make me see one
official from the army,..

451
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,599
...They told me they were taking her to
Police Station 23, but it's not true.

452
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,279
I've the right to know where she is,
if she needs me.

453
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:36,440
You knew that Maria was
into politics, right?

454
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:39,459
What's that have to do with anything?
They must tell me where she is!

455
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,620
- What politics have to do with this!
- And what can I do?

456
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,921
Look, Juan Carlos,
tell what to do,...

457
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:49,741
...tell me whom I must see,
and I'll will not bother you any longer.

458
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:56,766
Diana, didn't do anything,
she will be soon home.

459
00:53:58,762 --> 00:54:01,042
Do you realize what are you saying to me?

460
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:03,403
What if she did do something?

461
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,563
Are you telling me that if I don't
have any news, I will not see her again?

462
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,083
That's what you are telling me, Juan Carlos?

463
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:12,604
Tell whom I must talk to
and I will not bother you again,...

464
00:54:12,924 --> 00:54:14,204
...I promise.

465
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:16,764
But I do want to see you.

466
00:54:18,724 --> 00:54:20,365
Help me.

467
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,125
I can't help you, Diana.

468
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:58,595
- Which one?
- That one.

469
00:55:54,295 --> 00:56:02,176
Good appetite.
Get closer, you already know me.

470
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:10,217
No, keep eating, keep eating.

471
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:14,457
- Do you have any other relatives?
- No.

472
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,678
Your father?

473
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:20,518
He died.

474
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:27,661
So you mother is the only owner of the house.

475
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:40,164
You are cute.
Felix has good taste.

476
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:53,021
But you know what?
Here nobody is of a single person.

477
00:56:57,382 --> 00:57:00,822
And now that I think about it,
I never was with an italian.

478
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:27,110
Texas! Hurry up
You have a date.

479
00:57:27,225 --> 00:57:29,224
Right!, you stay eating chicken
with the chick...

480
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:31,145
..while I bet my head outside.
- So what's your problem?

481
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:33,426
we are Turkish and I. There's nobody else.
What are we going to do?

482
00:57:33,546 --> 00:57:35,986
Your problem.
You're one of the gang.

483
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,066
If you don't move, I'll write in the
report: ''Texas didn't went out...

484
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:43,227
...because he's lazy and it's afraid."
- Give me the address.

485
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,907
1948 Luis Maria Campo 8th 30.

486
00:57:46,147 --> 00:57:47,507
How many?

487
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,307
four, and they are armed.

488
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:52,148
You have 20 minutes
to solve it,...

489
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:54,028
...or else everyone will leave.

490
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,761
Felix.

491
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:02,172
Your italian is pretty.
Take care of her.

492
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:05,989
Turkish!

493
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,430
- What did he said?
- Nothing.

494
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:52,594
It's good.

495
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:59,995
- I like it more cooked.
- Me too.

496
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:21,437
Hello, Diana.
Please, forgive my delay.

497
00:59:21,957 --> 00:59:24,638
I've got to go,
I'm in a huurry, Gloria...

498
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:26,638
I've got some news, Diana.

499
00:59:26,678 --> 00:59:29,798
A foreign journalist wants to talk with us.

500
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:33,519
We have a date at 4 o'clock in
San Martin and Cordoba.

501
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,119
- I can't go. I can't go now.
- What's up with you?

502
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:39,799
Nothing, we'll talk tomorrow.
Bye.

503
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:53,521
- who washer?
- Nobody, a neighbour.

504
00:59:57,321 --> 01:00:03,722
Good. Please, sign here.

505
01:00:22,604 --> 01:00:23,924
This is yours.

506
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,725
Count it, please.

507
01:00:28,285 --> 01:00:29,605
It is not necessary.

508
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:33,605
We know each other for a long time,
there is trust.

509
01:00:34,085 --> 01:00:37,204
It's a house custom.
Please, count it.

510
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,928
Are you sure you want to sell it?
Your house is worth much more.

511
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:58,408
I need the money.

512
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:17,186
- Now I want to see my daughter.
- We're going.

513
01:01:36,732 --> 01:01:38,932
Good day.
Good day.

514
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:40,613
Remove your bandage.

515
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:46,573
You gave us Hoffman.
That gives you the right to a call.

516
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:49,093
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes.

517
01:01:54,254 --> 01:01:58,694
- What do you have there?
- I'm menstruating.

518
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:02,254
- No, no. What do you have there?
- Cotton.

519
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:04,495
Let's see. Give it to me.

520
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:19,017
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know. I was bandaged.

521
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:21,817
Here.

522
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:26,298
What's up?

523
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:29,898
Nobody answers.

524
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:31,399
Hang up.

525
01:02:34,138 --> 01:02:36,899
Bad luck. Some other time.

526
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,919
I don't like the talking ones.

527
01:02:43,419 --> 01:02:45,440
It's not good to talk.

528
01:03:30,745 --> 01:03:32,985
Please, give me the passport back.

529
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:36,505
We gave it to your daughter
Where are you going?

530
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:43,386
We are going back to Italy. I don't want
to have anything to do with this country.

531
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:47,066
you're doing right. You have to have guts
to live here.

532
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:51,107
Is very far from here?

533
01:03:52,107 --> 01:03:53,467
It's here.

534
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:57,948
Here is your daughter.

535
01:03:59,228 --> 01:04:03,348
- Where?
- I'll show you.

536
01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:19,796
I want to inform you that we
decided to legalize you.

537
01:05:19,876 --> 01:05:22,557
From now on, the 20 of you
will depend...

538
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:23,957
..on the national government.

539
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:25,970
While you wait for your trial...

540
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:27,916
...you'll be transferred
to a penitentiary in Rawson.

541
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:32,038
You will now be vaccinated according
to the penitentiary's requirements.

542
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,980
Let's see.

543
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:02,240
- Where is my mom?
- Working, she'll come later.

544
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,681
I don't believe you.

545
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:11,042
Do not touch me with your filthy hands!
Get off me.

546
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:13,642
Hey, Vibora.
You lost one.

547
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:16,843
Why did you went out without
permission?

548
01:06:16,923 --> 01:06:21,003
Send someone to cover me.
I can't take it anymore.

549
01:06:24,404 --> 01:06:26,844
So it's not true the thing
about the penitentiary.

550
01:06:27,204 --> 01:06:30,284
That's what they say, but I don't buy it.

551
01:06:30,524 --> 01:06:32,764
Where do they take them?

552
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,324
I don't know, but not to a penitentiary.

553
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,584
Nor their homes.

554
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,900
What's happening here? What are you
whispering like two rats?

555
01:06:46,286 --> 01:06:49,006
We are fixing the tubes that were burnt.

556
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:52,207
There are several that look new
but are burnt.

557
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:24,570
- What's up with him?
- I don't know.

558
01:07:24,571 --> 01:07:26,650
- Did he eat?
- Yes, he must have a belly ache.

559
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,651
If he cries too much we send him back.

560
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:31,411
- Edu!
- Put him in bed.

561
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:36,971
All right.

562
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:39,972
Look, Edu,
another bathroom!.

563
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:43,432
I've told you that the house was big.

564
01:07:45,412 --> 01:07:46,252
Edu!

565
01:07:46,332 --> 01:07:47,733
What?

566
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:48,813
My love.

567
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:50,313
What's up?

568
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:52,513
There is somebody.

569
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,482
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?...

570
01:07:57,517 --> 01:07:59,399
This is my house.

571
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:04,749
Is that right? I live here and have
never seen you before.

572
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:06,415
Wait for me downstairs.

573
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:10,415
The day I saw this room I knew
that it belonged to a thief.

574
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:13,690
Wait for me downstairs, please.

575
01:08:16,016 --> 01:08:19,216
I have all the papers.
This house is now mine.

576
01:08:20,616 --> 01:08:24,789
- What about the mother?
- You have till tomorrow to move out.

577
01:08:25,537 --> 01:08:26,896
Where did you take her?

578
01:08:26,897 --> 01:08:30,437
You can stay tonight if you want to.
But tomorrow I'll move in.

579
01:08:34,898 --> 01:08:38,098
And tomorrow, Felix,
I don't want you here.

580
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,701
N24, transfer.
Who is interrogating?

581
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,461
Hueso.

582
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:06,981
Hueso still?
OK, N04: Who has him?

583
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:10,342
It's not good anymore, N04.
He lost all contacts.

584
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:12,142
Transfer.

585
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,302
- N21, ¿éste es el cura, no? -
- Si, señor.

586
01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:19,783
Traslado.

587
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:22,783
And you what...
Leave his corpse in the suburbs.

588
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:29,984
B02 and A03. You can leave.
Felix, you stay.

589
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:39,945
Close the door, please.

590
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:44,225
Stand up, Felix.

591
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:48,543
Stand straight, Felix.

592
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:54,465
B02 and A03. B02
falls from the 6th floor...

593
01:09:54,466 --> 01:09:57,927
...and A03 dies pluugged to the
220v electrical network.

594
01:09:58,267 --> 01:10:01,467
Tell me something,
what for do we bring them here?

595
01:10:03,187 --> 01:10:06,308
- To interrogate them.
- To interrogate them. Very good.

596
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,707
What's the only thing we don't want
while we are interrogating them?

597
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,347
Kill them.

598
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:16,599
Understood? I don't want
personal initiatives. Am I clear?

599
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:17,969
Yes, sir.

600
01:10:18,209 --> 01:10:20,929
From today you're going
out to the street.

601
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,600
And if keep on like this, you know where
the girl is going to end. Am I clear?

602
01:10:25,247 --> 01:10:27,000
Yes, sir.

603
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:19,900
- Leave it open, Felix.
- I'll handle it.

604
01:11:22,676 --> 01:11:24,296
Remove your bandage.

605
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:26,916
I moved.

606
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:37,420
Your mother gave it to me,
she wanted me to have it as a souvenir.

607
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:43,918
I've already told you!
She can't know anything.

608
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,279
You know what?

609
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,440
They took me out to the street.
They say I made mistakes..

610
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,840
Now I go to seek people.

611
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:09,621
I'm going to be outside all day long.

612
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,202
Are you afraid of bein alone?

613
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:23,863
I'm afraid that something will happen to you.

614
01:12:25,963 --> 01:12:27,923
You know what?

615
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:32,804
If you were outside, you wouldn't be with me.

616
01:12:35,204 --> 01:12:36,984
Felix. Felix.

617
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:56,646
What can I do to get out of here?

618
01:12:58,647 --> 01:13:00,967
You have to behave.

619
01:14:30,177 --> 01:14:32,057
Bring me real flowers.

620
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:38,817
These plastic ones ore too sad.

621
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:44,578
What's with this one?, does it work or not?

622
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:48,098
The carburator must be changed
The rest is perfect.

623
01:14:48,338 --> 01:14:50,259
Change it, and paint it blue.

624
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:53,879
Hasta mañana.

625
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,779
Hey, Nene, do you have a cigarette?

626
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,860
No. But today I'll get some.

627
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,885
I'll get some for you.

628
01:15:09,061 --> 01:15:12,341
Are you too desperate?

629
01:16:08,587 --> 01:16:11,788
You wanted to escape?
Nobody escapes from here, little bird.

630
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:13,507
You're so wrong.

631
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:15,828
It's a shame that Felix will miss you.

632
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:19,588
Look who's back!
The little bird that wanted to fly.

633
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,549
Do you know where little birds like you go?

634
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,881
On your knees.
They go to heaven.

635
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:31,150
1.. 2.. 3..

636
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:36,039
4.. 5.. 6..

637
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,790
7.. 8.. 9..

638
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:49,352
Were you scared?

639
01:16:54,312 --> 01:17:06,033
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. 7.. 8..

640
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:17,395
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. 7..

641
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:25,716
My god!, my god!

642
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:29,523
Here are the flowers that you asked me.

643
01:18:34,603 --> 01:18:37,403
Why did you leave?
Why did you wanted to escape?

644
01:18:37,483 --> 01:18:40,204
Why did you wanted to escape?,
son of a bitch! Why?

645
01:18:40,284 --> 01:18:42,244
huh? Why?
You wanted to dump me.

646
01:18:45,644 --> 01:18:48,045
I'm doing everything I can to save you...

647
01:18:48,165 --> 01:18:50,285
...and you want to dump me, son of a bitch.

648
01:18:50,445 --> 01:18:52,685
Do you want to dump me?
Do you want to dump me?

649
01:18:53,005 --> 01:18:56,886
Why do you want to dump me?
Alone! You wanted to leave alone!

650
01:19:28,943 --> 01:19:33,031
You'll never leave this place
Never.

651
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:41,870
What can it cost to you, son of a bitch?
What cant it cost you to shoot me?

652
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:16,954
Tonight I'm asking you out.

653
01:20:44,817 --> 01:20:46,458
Come on, hurry.

654
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,780
What are you looking at?

655
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,721
Put this on.

656
01:21:25,682 --> 01:21:26,922
Let's go.

657
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,470
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

658
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,791
Good afternoon.

659
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:50,391
How it is going?

660
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,791
All right, sir.

661
01:22:54,431 --> 01:22:58,431
- Any news?
- yes, your daughter's friend came by.

662
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,399
- Ana?
- Yes, sir.

663
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:06,173
Sir.

664
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,673
- Hi, daughter.
- Hi, dad.

665
01:23:09,093 --> 01:23:11,813
- Are you tired?
- Yes, today I am...

666
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:14,014
- Poor dad.
- Hello, Ana.

667
01:23:15,014 --> 01:23:19,094
I promise you that if you
let me go to the movies...

668
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,100
...when I come back I will make
you a beautiful foot massage.

669
01:23:26,773 --> 01:23:28,354
- Come on, come on!
- No, the movies...

670
01:23:28,355 --> 01:23:30,875
Come on, come on. Please, please.

671
01:23:33,036 --> 01:23:35,915
Ok, go.
But you're here by 11,30.

672
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:39,000
- 11,30!
- 11,30.

673
01:23:39,002 --> 01:23:41,773
11,30 is already too late.

674
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:45,437
- Do you have money for the taxi?
- Yes.

675
01:23:46,397 --> 01:23:48,517
- See you later.
- Bye, Ana.

676
01:23:49,677 --> 01:23:51,358
What's for eating?

677
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:54,578
There's meat, chicken and a salad.

678
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:59,079
Keep the chicken.
Serve the rest.

679
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:00,959
I'll eat later

680
01:26:57,998 --> 01:26:59,918
Nobody's there.

681
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:28,728
What's hapening?

682
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:34,869
Go to see her, Felix.

683
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:39,999
She doesn't answer, go to see her.
I need to know if my mom is alright.

684
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:43,789
Tomorrow.

685
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,330
And what if tomorrow I'm dead?

686
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,530
No.

687
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:55,147
I told you I'm going to talk with Tiger.

688
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:02,472
Do you understand?

689
01:29:16,293 --> 01:29:18,753
We have to return in a while.

690
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:25,974
Let's stay outside, Felix.

691
01:29:30,015 --> 01:29:34,578
I can't, we have to return.

692
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:39,862
It's already too late.

693
01:31:06,825 --> 01:31:08,785
This group,...

694
01:31:09,065 --> 01:31:10,866
...put them here.

695
01:31:11,186 --> 01:31:12,906
Quickly, quickly.

696
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:19,667
Prisoners, please take attention.

697
01:31:19,787 --> 01:31:21,107
I'm informing you...

698
01:31:21,227 --> 01:31:23,947
...that your situation is going to be
legalized.

699
01:31:24,147 --> 01:31:29,426
From now on, you legally depend
on the national government.

700
01:31:29,628 --> 01:31:31,028
for that reason...

701
01:31:31,308 --> 01:31:36,333
...We are transferring you to
several nation's penintiaries.

702
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:44,469
Quickly.

703
01:31:44,589 --> 01:31:47,829
At due time, we will
inform your relatives.

704
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:49,990
- When?
- We will inform them.

705
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:53,150
For security reasons, we
can't telling anything now.

706
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:20,073
Quickly.

707
01:32:28,994 --> 01:32:32,235
The party is over, Felix.
Your baby is being transferred.

708
01:32:32,355 --> 01:32:35,155
- Who gave the order?
- The General.

709
01:32:35,315 --> 01:32:37,195
- Where is Tiger?
- He was blown up to shit.

710
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:40,355
Is this the soldier who went out
with a prisoner without authorizarion?

711
01:32:40,475 --> 01:32:41,947
Yes, my general.

712
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,096
- Wait in the office.
- Remove your shoes.

713
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,717
Snake, vaccinate her.

714
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:16,901
Didn't you hear me?
I've said to the office.

715
01:34:13,366 --> 01:34:14,926
Come in.

716
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:15,539
Between 1976 and 1982, during
Argentina's military dictatorship...

717
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,539
...thousands of citizens where thrown out,
alive, to the see.

718
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,540
Today, the persons responsible for these crime,
walk freely in the streets.

719
