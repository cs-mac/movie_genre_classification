1
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,194
I'm probably not going very far but

2
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,773
you're welcome to ride as
far as I'm going.

3
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,457
I bet this is one of the
roughest stretches

4
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,210
of hitch hiking you've
ever come across.

5
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,382
Yeah I've seen better.

6
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,587
There's two prisons right over the
horizon over there.

7
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,422
And folks around here are kind of
leery of hitch hikers.

8
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,133
Two prisons?

9
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,187
Yeah one for the ladies and one
for the gentlemen.

10
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,118
How'd you like to crawl in the back

11
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,295
and roll around with me for
a little while?

12
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,464
Beaver seven, Beaver
seven, come in Beaver seven.

13
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,133

14

15
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,422

16
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,554
to contact you for over
half an hour.

17
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,181
What's your present
position Beaver seven?

18
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,478
Headed east on highway 12

19
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,056
just west of cove number two.

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,641
Good going you got two

21
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,940
customers waiting at cove two.

22
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,145
They'll be sitting in the
corner to the left.

23
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,232
Gotcha Charlie, talk to you later.

24
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,367
Well you know it's business
before pleasure.

25
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,450
And I'm sure you're a real pleasure.

26
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,093
Well this is where we part.

27
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,300
But I have a feeling you and I

28
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,973
will be meeting again someplace.

29
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,737
Hey hurry up with that damn beer.

30
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,958
You two put in a call
to Charlie one?

31
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,712
Hey Hymie you put in a call
to Charlie one?

32
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,336
Who the hell's Charlie one?

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,511
I don't know.

34
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,677
But he aught to have more sense than

35
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,431
to send a filthy whore like this.

36
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,852
Listen funky mama better get your
little butt out of my face

37
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,143

dirty nigger.

39
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,116
Just who in the hell do you desert
rats think you are?

40
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,192
You better get back on

41
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,823
and go play in the sand.

42
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,746
'Cause after having a real man

43
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,450
I'd probably puke having a
couple of boys.

44
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,206
Hey I don't want any
trouble in here.

Don't push it.

133
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,230
Who the hell put you in my cell?

134

This place is full of fools.

153
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,815
If you don't handle the
fools they handle you.

Didn't I tell you huh, huh?

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,074
Sit down and pee, sit down and pee.

Check yourself the man's coming.

167
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,744
Come on.

168
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,624
What the hell's going on in here?

169
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,797
Break this shit up and sit down.

170
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,045
You mess with me the whole block

171
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,968
will be locked down for
six damn months.

172
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,386
You understand?

173
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,392
You want to watch TV sit down and be
quiet, cut the shit.

174
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,553
You know the day officer told me

175
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,934
you gave him a little
trouble already today.

176
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,769
He put you on the coal furnace
detail, among other things.

177
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,853
Watch your step Gordone.

178
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,699
Settle down and listen to TV

179
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,493
or I'll lock this whole block up.

180
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,448
What you want, what you want?

181
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,741
You got anymore Cracker Jacks?

182
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,070
Nah I ain't got no Cracker Jacks.

183
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,827
Bitch get all the money huh?

184
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,783
Man business is hard.

185
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,039
Look here Jesse I'm telling you

186
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,621
I can take this sissy by myself man.

187
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,251
I can feel it Jesse.

188
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,128
Ain't no bronc I can't bust Jesse.

189
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,584
I don't know Dead.

190
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,839
There's just something
about this dude

191
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,171
that tells me he ain't no push over.

192
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,598
Yeah Dead what if you
can't break him man?

193
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,970
You gonna blow the whole plan.

194
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,552
Look, relax Dead.

195
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,108
Wait a couple of days so we can set
the bootie up right.

196
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,562
Yeah man we can all
help break him in.

197
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,862
Ah man.

198
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,155
Alright look here Half Dead.

199
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,983
Are you sure you can bust
this young buck man?

200
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,409
Ah Jesse I don't even
know what all this

201
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,204
conversation is about man,
sure I can.

202
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,998
Jesse I'm the baddest in the
whole penitentiary.

203
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,203
Okay, okay okay I'll tell you what.

204
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,000
You try him out.

205
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,129
But if he backs off him,
you back off.

206
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:01,009
Hey Jesse, what does Dead know
about backing off man?

207
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,305
Shut up man.

208
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,724
You got anything you want Jesse.

209
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,222
But you watch in the morning.

210
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,098
Brother gonna ask for the
salt and pepper,

211
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,227
his voice gonna up five octaves.

212
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,058
Come on fellas enough of
this chomp chomp.

213
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,564
Amos you and the boys get
the line and wait.

214
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,021
I ain't got time for this shit.

215
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,152
Get in your cells it's count time.

216
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,949
I said move it.

217
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,117
Get the hell out of my way.

218
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,992
Get in your cells it's count time.

219
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,908
Move it Lightening.

220
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,369
Count time, in your
cell on your feet.

221
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,328
Count time.

222
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,513
Look here Gene.

223
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,847
I hate to have to do that shit I
had to do tonight.

224
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,979
But you bring all that
shit on yourself.

225
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,653
You can't stand up, I tell
you all the time.

226
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,781
And when you do shit like that

227
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,236
you bust my bubble and I
can't stand that.

228
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,718
You all I got Genie.

229
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,529
Hey man you want some Good Bar?

230
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,371
Hey man why don't you check
out one of these?

231
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,295
They'll get your shit long,
get some spirit.

232
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,338
What if Half Dead blows it?

233
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,425
Damn, can't you think
of nothing else?

234
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,009
It ain't that at all
but I hate to see

235
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,345
Half Dead blow a sale that we could
have easily handled.

236
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,056
Man be cool give Dead a chance.

237
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,393
We'll soon find out if he
blew it or not.

238
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,205
He just did it man.

239
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,382
Ride him Dead.

240
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,465
Ride him Dead, ride that old rascal.

241
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,510
Never heard Half Dead make no
sound like that before.

242
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,346
Me either man, I've heard Dead
make some weird sounds.

243
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,397
But I ain't never heard a
sound like that.

244
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,020
He's playing man.

245
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,441
Man that Dead done real
learned how to play.

246
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,738
I bet them yells is scaring that
yellow rascal crazy.

247
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,487

00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,408

I'm gonna bust you.

251
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,443

252
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,736

00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,560
You still want to ride me?

255
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,041
Now you finished playing that
cowboy shit for the night?

256
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,345
If not I can keep whooping on your
ugly ass all night long.

257
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,615
I'm talking to you.

258
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,832
That ain't gonna help you sucker.

259
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,433
Sounds like Half Dead got
himself another one.

260
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,653
Aren't your boys good enough to
see how it was huh?

261
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,528
No.

262
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,576
You don't want to disappoint your
boys out there do you?

263
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,498
You're gonna say something.

264
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,917
You're gonna say something.

265
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,880
Jesse.

266
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,502

00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,261
Say it.

272
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,013
Now.

273
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,772
The bronc, the bronc done
busted the buster.

274
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,518
Come on man.

275
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,276
Don't tell me that shit just run
it to me right Dead.

276
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,903
He's running it to you right.

277
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,860
This is Too Sweet talking.

278
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,039
And I'm riding your bronc
buster right now.

279
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,914
Now why don't you and your
boys just back off?

280
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,500
I told him.

281
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:05,835
Didn't I tell him?

282
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,216
Told him he was gonna
blow that stuff.

283
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,597
Told that nigger was gonna
burn that fine stuff.

284
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,976
I don't believe it.

285
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:20,892
Damn Dead.

286
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,149
What you laughing at sucker?

287
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,446
Get it fixed.

288
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,416
I said get it fixed.

289
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,703
Jesse I don't feel like.

290
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,586
Genie God damn it,
move it.

291
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,263
Mind if I squat?

292
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,980
It's a free prison isn't it?

293
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,276
But I happened to be
Jesse's property

294
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,696
as you gathered last night.

295
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,647
Property?

296
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,698
Is that what you think of yourself?

297
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,369
Somebody's property?

298
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,291
Ah come on you know
what's happening.

299
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,835
Everybody knows what's happening.

300
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,630
I been as they say tampered with.

301
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,044
Hey man that ain't my thing.

302
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,971
What five fingers can't get done,
don't get done.

303
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,676
The only thing these
fools know to do

304
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,933
with five fingers is make a fist.

305
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:07,017
And you saw what they can do
with it last night.

306
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:15,366
Come to think of it you put on quite
an exhibition yourself.

307
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:21,697
Hey.

308
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,876
Let me show you something.

309
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:30,835
You see?

310
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,009
You can make one too.

311
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:40,137
Now don't nobody have to be
nobody's property.

312
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,396
Keep going keep going, keep running.

313
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,103
Come on keep going keep going.

314
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,907
What was that all about?

315
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,086

00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,007
Well I ain't Half Dead boy.

319
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,006
I catch you bugging my
stuff one more time

320
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,929
I'm gonna send half your face
out of here on parole.

321
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,097
You got that?

322
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,021
Hey hey check it out.

323
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,520

14 days in the hole.

329
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,516
That should have been enough
time for you men

330
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,191
to find yourself and get
your shit straight.

331
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,230
And your act better damn
well be together.

332
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:21,238
'Cause one more ruckus out of
either one of you

333
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,997
and I'm gonna forget
I'm a gentleman.

334
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,163
And you.

335
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,121
I can't get over you Amos.

336
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,550
I apparently gave you more damn
credit than you deserve.

337
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:38,876
I went out on the limb and invited

338
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,131
my brother-in-law up here this year

339
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,805
just to catch your
boxing tournament.

340
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,598
And if he likes you I don't
have to tell you

341
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,141
what a word from me and him can

342
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,346
for your ass with the parole board.

343
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,433
Anymore fighting outside of
that damn ring,

344
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,270
if you so much as look cross
eyed at each other,

345
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,855
you're next trip to the
hole is gonna be

346
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,236
preceded by a thorough, efficient,

347
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,284
and otherwise
consistent ass whipping.

348
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,239
Do you understand me Gordone?

349
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,244
Amos?

350
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,586
Alright let's get in to
current things.

351
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,220
Now there's been a few changes
in the past 14 days.

352
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,218
Hezzikia Jackson has
taken over your job

353
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,346
as the trainer while you were
down in the hole.

354
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,349
It's alright with me Lieutenant
the old man's good.

355
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,523
I thought he vowed to never
train fighters again?

356
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,144
He did he surprised the
hell out of us

357
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,568
but he's doing it and he's
doing a good job of it.

358
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,860
As a matter of fact
we're gonna ask him

359
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:39,857
to stay on the team
after you rejoin.

360
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,030
We already asked him once he said

361
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,029
he might under one consideration.

362
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,075
What's that?

363
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,573
Hezzikia want a key to
the front gate?

364
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,654
No he don't want no key to
the front gate.

365
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,954
He just said that Gordone here

366
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,123
in his estimation is one
of the fastest

367
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,168
talented young fighters
that he's ever seen.

368
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,249
And he'll stay on as trainer if
Gordone joins the team.

369
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,299
And Gordone in respect to
joining the team

370
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,548
you heard what I mentioned to
Amos a few minutes ago.

371
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,881
The fringe benefits my
brother-in-law and the parole board.

372
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,218
Same thing holds true for you if
you're interested.

373
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,097
Sir I'm no fighter.

374
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,020
You're no fighter?

375
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,722
What the hell do you call
what you been doing

376
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,103
since you came through
that front gate?

377
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,232
Well I fight to defend myself
but I'm no boxer.

378
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,403
You're no boxer?

379
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,402
Neither is Eugene Lawson.

380
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,859
But he surprised the hell out of us,
he's joined the team.

381
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,034
Genie, I mean Eugene Lawson's
singed up for what?

382
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,283
The boxing team Amos what else?

383
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,707
Awe Lieutenant that boy
ain't no fighter.

384
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,329
Sir I think I'll join up after all.

385
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,754
That's good Gordone, good,
real good.

386
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,717
Wouldn't it be something if you two

387
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,340
were in the same weight class?

388
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,296
I'd give anything to
see you up there

389
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,347
toe to toe whacking at each other.

390
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,266
Wouldn't that be something?

391
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,266
Alright look you can head back now.

392
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,723
But remember no more fighting.

393
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,525
By the way Gordone you're cell

394
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,822
has been changed for
obvious reasons.

395
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,119
You'll be locked in with Hezzikia
Jackson your trainer.

396
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,253
Where do I put my stuff?

397
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,260
Up your ass.

398
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,886
They put me in here.

399
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,187
Soon as the matches are over
I'll be happy to leave.

400
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,228
You a winner?

401
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,399
I try hard.

402
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,197
With me you're gonna do
more than try.

403
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,523
You're gonna win.

404
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,536
Now put your stuff down there
and bring your bunk

405
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,535
up from down the block and put
it against the wall.

406
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,411
Right on.

407
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,165
Don't talk to me by that
hippy dippy shit.

408
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,088
I'm a man, I'm no hippy dippy fool.

409
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,843
And let's get one thing
straight right now.

410
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,763
I keep my stuff clean and I expect
you to do the same.

411
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,057
And I don't want nobody in here.

412
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:18,354
You want to talk, you want to visit,
you visit them.

413
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,317
I don't want no fools in my home.

414
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,564
This is my home.

415
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,522
And keep your ass clean.

416
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,322
I know fighting gets you
a little funky.

417
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,528
But soap and water will take
care of all of that so

418
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,455
keep your ass clean.

419
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,408
Are you gonna hold
inspection too sir?

420
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,367
A wise guy?

421
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,211
A wise guy.

422
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,882
Just do like I tell you and
everything will be alright.

423
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,459
And oh, no sissies.

424
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,735
Wait wait man let me show you.

425
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,563

00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,985
Go ahead jab it.

427
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,913
Oh no wait a minute.

428
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,785
Joey come on show him.

429
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,498
Left left left see, that's
the way to do it.

430
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,802
Alright man I got it, I got it.

431
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,992
Work quickly.

432
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,500
Hold it.

433
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,751
Hold it, hold it, take five.

434
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,427
Take five.

435
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,425
I want all you fighters to move in
closer to ring side.

436
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,427
You fighters come over here.

437
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,225
Got a couple of things to say.

438
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,473
First of all the winner in each...

439
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:04,553
Well hell first things first.

440
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,728
Men I may as well tell you.

441
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,522
I've invited some lady trustees

442
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,565
from the woman's prison next door

443
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,018
to come here tonight to
cheer you guys on.

444
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,691
Anybody mess up this whole thing

445
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,074
can go down the drain like that.

446
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,248
I'm trying, but it's
not positive yet.

447
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,496
But I'm trying to work out one week

448
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:30,705
of connubial visits for the
winner in each event.

449
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,092
Connubial visits you jackasses means

450
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,795
that the winner of each event will
get to spend one night

451
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,472
in a trailer in the
yard with a woman.

452
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,139
I'll tell you what hold it.

453
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,725
If you don't have a woman we'll
supply one for you okay.

454
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,814
Hey Eugene why don't you let me
take your place man?

455
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,945
I mean after all what

456
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,698

bugelie visits anyway?

Yeah you fellas can throw it
out of your minds.

461
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,882

462
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,560

00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,635
We all alone now baby.

475
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,639
Ain't that all that counts?

476
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,811
What you mean that's
all that counts?

477
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,514
What are doing in here?

478
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,939
If you didn't know what I
was doing in here

479
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:41,611

your voice by now.

480
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:42,734

486
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,349

541
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,816
You haven't won't the

545
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,444

546
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,073
I want some Good Bar.

547
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,154
I want a Good Bar.

548
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,488
I want a Good Bar.

549
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,040
You don't know your strength.

550
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,295
I'm not about to get too old
to get a little bold

551
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,999
and knock one of you
chumps out cold.

552
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,255
Well you damn near did Seldom.

553
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,054
You wouldn't really
hurt me would you?

554
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,176
Back up.

555
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,097
I joke and I laugh but
I don't touch.

556
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,349
Sometimes I can be tough.

557
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,605
Sometimes I get mean.

558
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,062
Why you think they call
me Seldom Seen?

559
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,147
You a poet and don't know it.

560
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,702
But you promised me a Good Bar so
please will you show it?

But I hope you get the cramps and
get knocked on your ass.

564
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,709
Shit, Ali ain't got

565
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,356
Hey looky here Gene.

566
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,025
Now you ain't got to put
yourself through this

567
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,774
'cause you ain't got nothing to
prove to these suckers.

568
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,525
You're right Jesse.

569
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:07,530
I don't have nothing to prove
to these suckers.

570
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,203
But I do have something to prove
to myself you know?

571
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:19,621
Hey Jesse?

572
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:20,580

Hey Eugene I heard some
good news man.

576
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,368
Half Dead ain't gonna
be here tonight.

577
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:59,210
Better watch out man,

chance call everybody

Oh 'cause you jumped out
of the ceiling

611
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,537
I'm supposed to drop my drawers huh?

612
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,135
For what I'm gonna just drop
it ain't necessary.

613
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,428
It isn't necessary at all.

614
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,772
Come on Eugene.

615
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,778
Slow down man.

00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,670
Oh baby.

Do to me as you will.

618
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,560
Slow down.

619
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,964
See Half Dead is tricky man.

620
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,232
Jive sucker.

621
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,356

00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,158
Quiet.

624
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,491
Knock it off, I said quiet.

625
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,625
What is you lost your mind?

626
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,835
Take these dumb broads back
where they come from.

627
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,387
You ain't got good sense.

628
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,588
Get out to your own hood.

629
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,014
This is Half Dead.

630
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,557
I ain't going nowhere
till these sissies

631
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,486
give me some respect and
name me the winner.

632
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,027
That some bull dog, we
wouldn't have you anyway.

633
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,109
Now wait a minute baby you
speak for yourself.

634
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,786
I don't turn down nothing
but my collar.

635
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,828
He's okay. Seldom?

I got knocked out.

641
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,716
You see me, you see, I'm alright.

642
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,514
I got knocked out and
I'm still here.

643
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,720
I got knocked out.

Got knocked out the next.

652
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,624
Come on brother, I got your
mother for you.

653
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,049
Come on sucker.

654
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,632
Look boy I'm tired of hearing about

655
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,013
how you got knocked out and how
you did this and that.

656
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,095
Ya ya ya, let's get
something straight.

657
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,101
You still my bitch boy.

658
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,775
You'll always be that, on Mars,
on Pluto,

659
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,233
on Earth, Heaven, Hell you
still my bitch.

660
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:29,701
And I better not catch your ass

661
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:33,247
standing at no toilet peeing either.

662
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,494
And you can forget about that truce

663
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,826
I made with the Lieutenant.

664
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,584
And your boy Too Sweet,
he's washed up.

665
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:41,710
Boy you better get
yourself together...

666
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:42,836
Or what?

667
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,754
You're gonna threaten me?

668
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,677
You're gonna kill me?

669
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,675
You gonna beat me up?

670
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,549
If I didn't learn nothing else
out ofjumping my

671
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,226
crazy ass up in that ring like
some depraved animal

672
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,303
I did learn one thing.

673
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,766
That you, Dead, Latney, nobody
can take anything

674
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,226
from me that I ain't ready to give.

675
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,562
And you got to bring ass to get ass.

676
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,192
And I done already got
knocked out once

677
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:07,865
so that ain't nothing new.

678
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,908
And furthermore I kicked a
little ass too.

679
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,156
Why you?

680
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,077
That's the last time you ever gonna

681
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,700
hit me and get away with it.

682
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,659
Your ass gotta sleep and you got
to turn your back.

683
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,381
You ain't worth it.

684
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:35,014
You ain't worth it, get
away from me.

685
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,639
Get away from me!

686
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,107
Lights out,
quiet on the block.

687
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,707
Seldom man do you hear me?

688
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,833
I mean this ain't no Mister Good
Bar I'm talking about.

689
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:07,008
This is some real live, hot, steamy,
hairy pussy.

690
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,514
So man, you ain't human.

691
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,146
I mean I'm talking about pussy

692
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,729
and here you are reading a book.

693
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,030
You been locked up for God
knows how long.

694
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:30,982
35 years.

695
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,076
That's right.

696
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,912
35 long years.

697
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,660
And 15 before that.

698
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,000
That's right I been in the pen 50

699
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,834
of the 65 years I been
on this Earth.

700
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,760
And I damn sure ain't
about to get myself

701
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:55,966
all worked up over no pussy
for a week contest.

702
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,303
Do you hear where I'm coming from?

703
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,137
Survival,

704
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,474
that's my first concern.

705
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,936
I faced myself a long time ago.

706
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,700
I'm nothing and I faced it.

707
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,786
35 years and I've learned
to be content.

708
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:26,003
I just deal with the me
that's in here.

709
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,800
I just lay back and relax and
keep my mind together.

710
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:35,301
'Cause I now believe that
I'm the one's free.

711
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,848
the freest man in the world.

712
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,221
The rest of the world is locked up.

713
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,599
They are locked out.

714
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,272
And Too Sweet once I quit
believing that

715
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,646
I might as well push a bunk up
against the wall,

716
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,151
tie a sheet around my
neck and jump off.

717
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,573
Or I'd go completely crazy.

718
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,328
They call that
institutionalized Too Sweet.

719
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,951
Institutionalized, and I'm it.

720
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,000
So keep your far fetched
dreams to yourself.

721
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,046
And if the Lieutenant and
his brother-in-law

722
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,969
by some miracle can convince the
board to turn you lose,

723
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,342
or is some young lady will come up
and lay you with you

724
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,846
for a week don't tell me
when you going.

725
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,062
Don't tell me when you coming back.

726
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:29,187
Don't bring no fucking drawers in
here for me to sniff.

727
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,019
Don't tell me a God damn thing.

728
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:37,241
'Cause if I can't have it all
I don't any of it.

729
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,242
Now I'm for real Too Sweet.

730
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,090
Already Daddy here go your girl.

731
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,178
Don't hit me on my ear no more.

732
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,477
You hit me on my ear again boy
I'll kill your ass.

733
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,395
Think I'm bullshitting, I
ain't bullshitting.

734
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:31,597
How's that?

735
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,058
That looks the nose to me, no ear.

736
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,151
Yeah let me tell you something

737
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,073
I wasn't jiving you about my ear.

738
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,491
Hit me on my ear again boy
I'll kick your...

739
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,115
No bro just because you ugly
don't mean you bad.

740
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,243
Besides I want the other
ear than that.

741
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,706

01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,627
No you done done it now.

01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,583
What I told your crazy ass?

745
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,088
I told your ass boy.

746
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,965
Don't say I didn't tell your ass.

747
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,389
Yeah you hit me on my God
damn ear again huh?

748
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,271

01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,195
five, six, seven, eight.

750

754
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,231
You ain't gonna never leave the
penitentiary alive.

755
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:01,436

765

01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,422
The winner of the first

797
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,634
connubial visit, Martel Gordone.

798
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:40,346
And do I have a beauty
picked out for you.

799
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,366
Hey Linda?

800
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,662
Yes?

801
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,500
You don't know who I am do you?

802
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:26,542
Yes.

803
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:30,547
You know who I am?

804
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,378
Yes, you're Martel Gordone.

805
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:42,180
And I know why they call
you Too Sweet.

806
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,893
You remember picking me up
on the highway?

807
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,524
You remember me
fighting to save you?

808
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:54,820
You remember me looking for you

809
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,364
when I got railroaded, got
this time, huh?

810
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:57,987
Yes I remember all of that.

811
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,363
God I wish I could forget.

812
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:00,569
Then what happened?

813
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,824
Why'd you run?

814
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,120
What difference does it make?

815
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,117
It makes a hell of a lot
of difference.

816
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,824
Too Sweet we got to live now.

817
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,125
Oh don't give me that
bullshit Linda.

818
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,170
Here I am doing time and I
don't even know why.

819
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,463
Why?

820
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,711
Why?

821
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,542
'Cause you're a man that's why.

822
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,343
And you fought like a man.

823
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,514
Oh Jesus.

824
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,470
After those bikers hit you and
you were out cold,

825
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,021
oh God I was there all alone and...

826
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,903
But nothing I could do.

827
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,409
There wasn't anything but...

828
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,108
And you just let them set me up,

829
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:19,739
and ran away.

830
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:20,816
Too Sweet,

831
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,739
I did what I had to do.

832
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,587
Oh please forgive me I'm sorry.

833
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,513
I'm sorry Too Sweet.

834
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,719
Let me make it up.

835
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:51,805
Let me make it up Sweet.

836
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,354
Too Sweet please.

837
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,483
I'm begging you please here.

838
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:03,113
Please somebody.

839
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:27,700
This is Linda.

840
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:33,244
Tell the Lieutenant he can
send in another one.

841
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,807
He's a good man, gonna be
a good fighter.

842
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:55,887
Yeah we'll see.

843
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,939
This is our control center.

844
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,437
There's your man now.

845
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,612
Gordone I was just
talking about you.

846
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,234
Come on that little chippy out
there in the trailer

847
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,110
too much for you to handle huh?

848
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,783
Yeah something like that.

849
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:12,237
Yeah Gordone, damn good
showing the other night.

850
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,665
But me and Henry here
have been talking.

851
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,162
We feel that you need
another year or so

852
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,416
to kind of polish up your style.

853
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:21,291
Fine.

854
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,627
Gordone, Sam has decided to go
with Amos this year.

855
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,509
Now it's nothing you can't overcome.

856
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,215
Especially with a little more
time with Hezzikia.

857
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:33,845
Fine Lieutenant.

858
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,552
Okay.

859
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,353
You got those passes cleared?

860
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,022
Yeah they're all cleared.

861
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,896
Alright you men can go
back to your cell.

862
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,853
Now look any more trouble
with this set,

863
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:48,440
I got a technician coming up for the
third time this week.

864
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,368
I want him to fix it
and fix it right.

865
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,786
How about that third set?

866
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,113
It's working right.

867
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,664
The camera in the
yard working right?

868
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,583
Pretty boy's here.

869
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,622
He make me sick with that bullshit.

870
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:04,922
Hey man hey.

871
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:06,916

move with y'all.

872
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,843
Now I gonna blow this
damn road check.

873
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,670
You get my meaning?

874
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,928
Shit Jesse you ain't said nothing.

01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:15,224
You know I been waiting for you

876
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,974

01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,504
Coming across the yard.

01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,764
You die mother fucker.

890
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,967
Too Sweet, Too Sweet, Too Sweet,

891
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,690
Let it go, you don't need that.

892
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:11,521
Okay.

893
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:15,943

894
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,045
Too Sweet.

895
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,433
Somebody get a doctor.

896
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,102
Will somebody get a damn doctor?

897
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,768
I'm sorry brother man.

898
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,650

899
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,491
No you haven't let me down.

900
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,154
You haven't let anybody down.

901
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,282
You've won Eugene.

902
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,744
Eugene you've won.

903
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,922
Eugene you can't...

904
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,329
Too Sweet I know what
you're thinking.

905
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,630
But you ain't thinking at all.

906
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,050
You got a chance to get out
of this insanity.

907
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:00,297
Don't blow it.

908
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:04,179
Use your head and fight no more.

909
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:11,933
You.

910
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:16,317
You set this whole thing up.

911
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,986
And then like the coward you
are you stood back

912
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:22,657
and let your crazy fools do
your dirty work.

913
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,036
Well now I'm gonna show
you where it's at.

914
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,739
Seldom you call the Lieutenant

915
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,328
and you tell him if he wants rumble

916
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,085

917
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:42,505
Yeah.

918
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:03,715
I'm gonna kill you.

919
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,259
I'm gonna kill you.

920
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,802

921
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:07,799
I'm gonna kill you.

922
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:18,189
He's 50 pounds heavier than you so
stay away from him.

923
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:21,108
Alright you cover up that
left rib you hear me.

924
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:22,652
If you don't get

925
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:23,728
Get him Jesse.

926
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,188
Get his ass Jesse.

927
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:41,954

928
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:34,973

Sweet tonight.

rib might be crushed.

931
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,229

940
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:26,429
You got it, you've worked for it.

941
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:29,311
Too Sweet, Too Sweet,

945
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,581
But I know you're gonna
be a champion.

946
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:49,627
Yeah baby you're the greatest,
you're the greatest.

947
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,249
Got to sign
for this money.

948
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,925
You got it my man.

949
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,892
I want to wish
you good luck man.

950
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:07,470
Good news Gordone.

951
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,476
I got a memo this morning
from the parole board

952
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,899
and it stated that if Jackson shows

953
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:14,067
a sincere desire to get out of here

954
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,487
and function in society he'll be

955
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:19,782
by your side training
you if he wants.

956
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:21,484
Hey Lieutenant that's really decent.

957
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:22,443
The way it should be.

958
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:23,493
Lieutenant.

959
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,286
Yeah.

960
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:25,078
Here's Jackson.

961
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:26,496
Okay.

962
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,745
Now look by the way I want you to

963
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,667
really whip ass for my
brother-in-law.

964
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:32,586
I want you to make him
a lot of money

965
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:36,040
so that he'll get my sister and his
ass out of my house.

966
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,591
I'll do best.

967
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,008
Don't let me down.

968
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,461
Now look I know you two
want to be together

969
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,467
so why don't you take a
couple of minutes

970
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:47,222
outside the gate here and say
your goodbyes, okay.

971
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,178
Guard open up the gate.

972
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:52,523
Okay it's all yours.

973
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:58,563
Now is there something you
want to see me about?

974
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,823
You know don't you?

975
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:08,580
You know I'm afraid?

976
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,663
I'm afraid of streets.

977
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:14,624
When I first went to jail TV was

978
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,456
just begun to be talked about.

979
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:20,919
The jet age wasn't even
thought about.

980
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,844
Now it just scares me to think about

981
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:26,345
going back out there and
being a nobody.

982
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:28,975
What can I do?

983
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:31,728
Who wants me?

984
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:35,524
Who even would pay attention to

985
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,193
an old out of date fool like me?

986
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,817
In here I am somebody.

987
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,775
I got my own TV, my own stereo,

988
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,701
my own home, three hots and a cot.

989
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:54,751
And more than that I mean
something in here.

990
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,379
I got respect.

991
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:06,597
There's only one thing wrong Seldom.

992
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,555
You ain't got no hope.

993
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:17,100
Seldom we could make out there man.

994
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,819
Me and you, we could do it.

995
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,735
You got to at least try.

996
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:32,744
Okay?

997
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:35,705
Okay.

998
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,252
Okay Gordone let's go.

999
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:45,552
What do we got to do get a writ

1000
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,300
to get your ass out of this place?

1001
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,475
No sir all you gotta do is
open up those gates.

1002
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:53,844
Okay guard.

1003
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:57,185
Seldom, I'll see you soon.

1004
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,061
Bye Too.
