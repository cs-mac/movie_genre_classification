1
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,457
Out of the way, a beggar!

2
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,354
With caution.

Dole?

00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:27,586
How dare you touch me,
filthy beggar?

6
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,880
Ruoskikaa him, Captain.

7
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:51,238
The host is certainly satisfied.
His expectation is finished.

8
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:09,001
This is attractive to you, El Sharif?

9
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,751
Katsina, Katsina ...

10
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,145
Your tongue.

11
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:31,940
How does it move at all.
What it can not.

U.S. chain store king -

00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,006
the only daughter and heir.

Inger Lindström, actress.

According to Western press
"Scandinavian goddess of love."

Jumping the European champion.

Prepare the antidote.
Their time has come to wake up.

Someday
for you to Samarkand -

23
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,291
and you seem sulojasi
under the stars.

24
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:10,797
Tomorrow, El Sharif?
You have promised it for a long time.

25
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:16,467
Tomorrow does not work. But soon as possible.

26
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,927
Tomorrow will be an important guest.
-Sheikh Umar?

27
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,348
Sheikh Umar?

28
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,642
No, but the Kaiser
United States -

29
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:35,404
will persuade me.

30
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:48,669
The answer has always been the same.
-He gives us only the droplets.

31
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,798
Its small aavikkopläntin
below is a bottomless well, Adam.

32
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,718
Oil is a huge
and we need it.

33
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,682
We drop by drop
but a huge torrent.

34
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,309
I know, Doctor.

35
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,268
We tightened
a ruthless son of a bitch -

36
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:13,025
who happens to own
over one hundred hectares of sand.

37
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:16,736
American companies helped
to the building.

38
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:22,240
Roads, refineries,
oil pipelines, military.

39
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:28,166
Kuunteleekohan he
to reason at this time?

40
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:34,996
I believe in a personal
diplomacy into force -

41
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:41,090
and I believe I can say
I'm usually right.

42
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:54,057
Welcome to the.

43

<i> My name is ILSA.
I am Sheikh harem khadin. </ I>

44
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:05,198
These are the assistant -

45
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,582
Satin and Velvet.

46
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:11,664
Harem? Not!

47
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,414
Why is it so terrible?

48
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:18,338
You will come to life
easy and luxurious life.

49
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:23,713
You are beautiful
than you dared imagine.

50
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:28,057
You will be spoiled
and each of your wishes are met.

51
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:32,020
We were kidnapped in order ..?
-Exactly.

52
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:36,895
You are crazy! You will not survive this.
We have friends and relatives!

53
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:41,861
What are they looking for you?

54
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:49,906
They find only
that you have lost.

55
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:58,958
You have only one task:
to serve a master without question.

56
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,086
Not! Not!

57
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:07,219
We have our means to make
obedient to you. Velvet.

58
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:15,732
So beautiful.

59
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:23,947
We have a cage for it.
It penetrates between the feet.

60
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:35,832
It is looking for moisture.

61
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:43,004
Then it selects the
what goes into the hole.

62
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,263
And then -

63
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:55,850
its sharp teeth -

64
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,820
begin to chew on
your flesh from the inside out.

65
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,828
His name is ILSA.

66
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,532
What do we know about him?

67
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,629
We will not change.

68
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,626
I would not want that kind of woman
to meet a dark alley.

69
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:23,382
So I hear.

70
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:28,006
Watch out when we get there.

71
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,059
I do not want you fair poorly.

72
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:36,810
I am only his adjutant.

73
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:41,988
Papers to prove it.
He does not know who I am.

74
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:47,075
Counter intelligence?
Their best-husbands.

75
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,917
Dr. deceive me -

76
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,045
even before arriving.

77
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,044
He did not see anything, El Sharif.
I take care of it.

78
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:14,311
Maybe he will,
as it is heard the rumors.

79
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:17,275
It's impossible.

80
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,401
We can not take the risk.

81
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,737
He may find
kidnapped girls.

82
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,945
The risk is too great.

83
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,294
Do you want to
that they are eliminated?

84
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,417
There is a better way.

85
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,763
Sold them to a slave auction.

86
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,887
They have come to expect
scum of the earth cuisine.

87
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:55,094
Of these, they pay well.

88
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:00,025
Think of the Arab, ILSA.

89
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,273
My job is to serve you.
-Excellent.

90
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:11,741
But not for new entrants.

91
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:15,658
I like them under lock and key.

92
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:20,338
They become the harem
magnificent jewels.

93
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:30,931
But first -

94
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:35,891
I need to take care of
one disciplinary matter.

95
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:54,532
This man is guilty of
an offense against the El Sharif.

96
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:01,253
He entered the harem as the animal
and lying on one with the girl.

97
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:05,000
He claims the girl's vietelleen,
but it is not important.

98
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,507
The girl has been punished.

99
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:11,589
He demands their rights as a soldier.

100
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:15,393
Martial trial.

101
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:20,101
We agree to his request.

102
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:24,399
If he wins,
he was pardoned.

103
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,780
He is struggling with his bare hands -

104
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:33,910
against them.

105
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,618
Let him go free.

106
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,875
Maybe.

107
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,377
Let's see.

108
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,839
Begin.

109
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:10,797
Hoidelkaa it!

110
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,043
Welcome eunukkieni set.

111
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,972
Anoint him properly.

112
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:44,730
His skin should
be smooth for the host.

113
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:54,489
This will cause further problems.

114
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,695
Does not cause.

115
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:02,540
He remembers,
that the rat is hungry.

116
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,422
Ajelkaa he was smooth.

117
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:16,634
El Sharif to keep hair
only between the legs.

118
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:32,404
Kidnapped and held for one man
enters the next.

119
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:37,696
Blonde hair, blue eyes -

120
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:43,573
and the divine body.
The man just for you.

121
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:49,084
Men do not need to drag
to me as a slave.

122
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:55,800
Yes bother to wait.

123
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,758
First we need to try to push.

124
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:05,639
A little blackmail.
But in the end -

125
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:09,522
need to find a
Sheikh skeleton closet.

126
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,521
Something he does not want to
Arab friends to know about.

127
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,990
Or the rest of the world.

128
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,452
Harder!

129
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:29,413
Language is his favorite tool of choice.
You have to learn to use it.

130
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,248
Downward. Between the legs.

131
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,793
Lick, bitch!

132
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,361
Good.

133
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,900
Lower!

134
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:01,284
Use the language.
I do not command a second time.

135
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:06,533
You have a lot to learn.

136
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:31,016
Do not turn your eyes!

137
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:36,942
This is what is left
haaremitytöstä and eunukista.

138
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,774
They were very stupid.

139
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:43,244
Tried to escape from the desert.

140
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:46,375
They do not come very far.

141
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,914
If you exhaust your mind juolahtaisi -

142
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,333
remember this sight.

143
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:03,799
Why did not he eat? -He
were fed two hours ago.

144
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:07,932
It is not enough. He is progressing
too slowly. Eunuch!

145
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,889
At your service.
-Give him up. Now!

146
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:31,375
No, no, no ...

147
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:34,080
Shut up, bitch!

148
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,832
Feed him every hour.

149
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:10,209
He is progressing nicely. He
get a good price at auction.

150
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:31,721
You make a village
very happy, Jasmin.

151
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,953
Add wine to my friends!

152
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,000
Take more, Kalam.

153
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,370
Women, Sharif?

154
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:40,877
Where are the women,
we came to see?

155
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,170
To buy, Kalam.

156
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:49,636
Since
Buyer shall not -

157
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:53,854
access to the goods in advance?

158
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:57,855
Patience, my friend.

159
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,445
Products are being prepared
for tomorrow's auction.

160
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:08,487
Host must tend to
destroy their beauty.

161
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:13,202
He can do for them what they want.
He got off easy.

162
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:39,735
<i> Khadin? </ i>

163
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,280
Excellent.
-This way.

164
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:53,701
Buyers want to flesh on the bones
around it. Use of silicone.

165
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:42,713
Unbelievable. El Sharif called you
little white neitsyekseen -

166
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,713
seeing your pictures.

167
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:49,929
Even then, you were spoiled by the disease.

168
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:52,893
It must not be hidden.

169
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:57,689
You underestimate my skills.

170
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,750
They do not do not see any -

171
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:21,169
before it is too late.

172
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:26,874
Amazing that you got an agent
inside the fortress.

173
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:31,349
It was not easy -

174
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,223
but I found a very
determined young woman.

175
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:38,643
And very patient.

176
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:44,316
When he was a child, El Sharif
tortured to death in his family.

177
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:49,239
All these years he has
waiting for the opportunity to take revenge.

178
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:53,200
I do not understand how he
could get anything out.

179
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:57,079
Simple as that.
He has a bugging device.

180
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:59,618
They will find it.

181
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:02,245
Do this.

182
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:16,723
I designed it myself.

183
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:48,171
<i> Maybe he will,
as it is heard the rumors. </ i>

184
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:28,423
<i> is a better way. </ i>

185
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:34,015
He remembered,
that you have not been entered.

186
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,320
I wonder ...

187
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,916
I wonder where he gets hupinsa.

188
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:05,204
There is no mention of lovers.

189
00:28:05,423 --> 00:28:08,923
Maybe he has a different taste.

190
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,178
Not to my knowledge,.

191
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:17,015
Have you thought of approaching
through the back door?

192
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,681
Kingdoms have in the past
captured between the sheets.

193
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:41,494
Brilliant! Add to wine buyers.
This work will be thirsty men.

194
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,915
Sheikh Kalam? Here he is.
Girl where you liked.

195
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:50,090
What do you offer?

196
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:54,086
5000.
-Such a gem?

197
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:57,094
Offered to 6000?
-6000!

198
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,061
Be offered more?
-7000!

199
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:06,687
These alone are worth it.
These buttocks worth looking at.

200
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:10,279
Try your own hand, Kalam.

201
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:16,073
She will enchant you.
You feel a stallion again.

202
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:28,706
11 000!
-Which Fish Sold 11 000, respectively.

203
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:45,055
This girl is a Risala. His
the body gets the sap to flow.

204
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:49,610
He is perfect.

205
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:57,319
Offered to 10 000?
Offered to 11 000?

206
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:00,822
11 000! Does a 12 000?
-12 000!

207
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:05,366
Offered to 14 000? 20 000?

208
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:09,415
Do you beat your brother, Mahmoud?

209
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:11,589
I offer 50 000!

210
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:15,300
What do you say 50 000 C, Ahmed?
-Do not run out of women for this.

211
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,725
Sold Sheikh
Mahmud 50000 respectively.

212
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:32,898
Next, an exotic
and the beautiful Erika.

213
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,741
Remember his special skills.

214
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:44,073
If you buy him,
you get 20 women.

215
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:47,376
What this
Multi-woman is offered?

216
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:53,467
Offered to 40 000?
Been offered. Be offered more?

217
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:57,342
60 000 have been offered.
65000. Be offered more?

218
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:02,597
70 000 patients receive a one-woman.
Buy this, you do not need another.

219
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,218
100 000 dinars.

220
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:09,388
This is your choice?
-Offered to more?

221
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,063
Sold Sheikh Ahmed. 100 000
TD, has today the highest price.

222
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:21,948
Something must be done first.
-Whatever. The woman is yours.

223
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:30,332
I do not like grinding of the teeth.

224
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,219
A friend of mine,
something exceptional -

225
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:47,930
they have a different taste.

226
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:54,569
Look at what the body.
Cast skinny son to go.

227
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:58,564
I offer you the right man.

228
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,702
Come closer.

229
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,828
Give it a try on his muscles.

230
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,037
Experiment with how heavy
stuff he has on offer.

231
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:42,741
<i> counter-intelligence?
-One of their best men. </ I>

232
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:49,042
<i> He did not see anything.
I take care of it. </ I>

233
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:54,586
<i> We can not risk anything.
He can not find the abducted girls. </ I>

234
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:06,594
Not <i>. Sold them
a slave auction. </ i>

235
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:20,279
Expensive toys dancing girl.

236
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,660
Who gave it to you?

237
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,579
I found it.

238
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:34,080
Did you find koneenkin?

239
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,508
I stole it.

240
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:48,059
Who these interesting
toys are?

241
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:54,943
It was Dulciman. A girl,
a soldier who was caught with.

242
00:33:55,695 --> 00:34:00,072
I found them to her room
after his death.

243
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:06,492
He was a good spread her legs.

244
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:09,244
But that these things?

245
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:13,459
I do not think so.

246
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:18,300
I swear that it is the truth.
What else do you want to hear?

247
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,668
The truth.

248
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:25,970
I could have
escape from this trip.

249
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:31,940
If we pay what he asks,
we have to go bankrupt.

250
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:37,107
Unless the Sheik Umar
not spoken to him makes sense.

251
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:43,736
Sheikh Umar is too stupid
to come up with anything like this.

252
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:48,495
Who was it?
-I have told everything I know.

253
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:58,298
Who is your contact?
What do they want to know?

254
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:02,884
Stop it. Please.

255
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:08,468
You will feel the pain.
Listen carefully, bitch.

256
00:35:08,894 --> 00:35:13,770
You will feel a lot worse pain,
if you do not tell the truth.

257
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:23,651
Each of the screw turning ...

258
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:31,907
Each of the screw rotation
cause more pain -

259
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:37,084
until every nerve
screaming in pain.

260
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:39,999
Until the end -

261
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:45,545
breasts ruptured and detached.
Is that what you want?

262
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:49,309
It was Dulcima!

263
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:54,730
Jopas occurred. Dulcima is dead.

264
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:03,238
If the crease
does not get him to talk about -

265
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:07,990
ten thousand
friend will receive.

266
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,492
How can he dance,
if he does not have legs?

267
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:19,247
Please indicate the
when he agrees to talk.

268
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:00,044
Come closer.

269
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:15,355
The skin is so smooth.

270
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:38,283
They are incredibly beautiful.

271
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,502
One is still
unchecked, El Sharif.

272
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,770
Yes!

273
00:37:55,979 --> 00:38:00,523
I promised that unohtaisitte
other toy.

274
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,157
More ants.

275
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,056
Are you ready to talk about?

276
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:41,944
I am!

277
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:55,530
My expectations are terminated.

278
00:38:55,749 --> 00:39:01,206
Your guests will soon arrive.
They do not fit odotuttaa.

279
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,218
Tell me that I
a business meeting.

280
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,183
I'll leave you to manage asioitanne.

281
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,354
<i> Khadin! </ i>

282
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,771
You have done a good job.

283
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,521
Whose payroll are you?

284
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,569
N. ..

285
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,363
S. ..

286
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,079
A ca

287
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,745
Who is your contact?

288
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,673
His name is ...

289
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:40,094
I just hope that I do not have to
eat sheep eyes.

290
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,772
Sheep eyes?

291
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:48,938
They are considered a delicacy.
Served only to guests of honor.

292
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:57,406
I have eaten them
throughout the Arab world.

293
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,113
I can not eat any more.

294
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,804
Are you sure?

295
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,765
He was involved in the plot.

296
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:26,973
To kill me?
-He does not know the reason.

297
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:31,649
He knows only that his
was to gather information.

298
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,200
That man should be
a visitors come here -

299
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,708
but for him to keep -

300
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:44,332
to give a lesson.

301
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:34,627
Your presence is a credit to low
majalleni, Dr. Kaiser.

302
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:39,923
Friendly, your Lordship.
Adjutant, Commander Scott.

303
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:44,686
This is the ILSA,
housekeeper.

304
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:51,776
Does the Commander's first name?
-Adam, Your Excellency.

305
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:55,571
You'll probably want to start
discussions as soon as -

306
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,906
but today is a celebration dinner.

307
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,186
It's beautiful.

308
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:27,439
I am spared the
such an occasion.

309
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:31,018
The American is handsome.

310
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,692
He is our enemy.

311
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:40,240
He became just as
said, without shackles.

312
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,911
He is a deceitful bastard.

313
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:58,176
But we have a whole evening time.

314
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:01,011
If I want to ...

315
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,346
Requirements do not ever met.

316
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:07,397
Then the oil taps are closed.

317
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:10,561
Stubbornness is not
in honor of the Arab world.

318
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:14,276
The reason is simply greed.

319
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:19,200
I have oil, 'Umar.
Not you.

320
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,411
Gives rise to jealousy
strange alliances, is not it?

321
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,999
Choose whether or not my friend.

322
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:40,967
I am married.

323
00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:43,590
But, far from home.

324
00:45:17,636 --> 00:45:22,464
Looking for something?
Someone might be?

325
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,020
Maybe.
-I?

326
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:36,769
But in your country
needs money, El Sharif.

327
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:41,566
Needs? Look around you.

328
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:44,527
What about your people?

329
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:49,409
They do not know anything about
wealth of the feet.

330
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:53,838
They do not live in
in the past forever.

331
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:57,550
Why not?

332
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:02,388
For them, the only black kultanne
Curse of the ruin of their niittynsä.

333
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:07,059
But one day,
they get to know the truth.

334
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:11,477
What then?

335
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:16,229
Are not you afraid
rebellion or revolution?

336
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:21,069
Afraid of the lion jackal?

337
00:46:21,284 --> 00:46:25,282
Jackals can bite, El Sharif.

338
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:31,208
Not if it is
removed from the teeth.

339
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:36,253
My application right
is a quick and final.

340
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:55,939
Do you see this man?

341
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:59,570
He is a servant.

342
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:03,738
He is a servant
position of trust.

343
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:06,573
Is it not?

344
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:12,624
But he decided to
confidence to use incorrectly.

345
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:17,375
He was caught for theft.
Tell me, Doctor -

346
00:47:17,716 --> 00:47:22,508
what is your country
are thieves?

347
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:28,049
Depends on
what he stole.

348
00:47:29,937 --> 00:47:33,140
Here, it is not important.

349
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:35,895
When a man has tasted
something new -

350
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:39,609
He may want to drink again.

351
00:47:40,197 --> 00:47:44,147
The next time more.

352
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:51,160
Do not, El Sharif!

353
00:47:58,382 --> 00:48:01,253
El Sharif, do not!

354
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:26,316
My apologies, but the right to use my
is a quick and final.

355
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:29,788
Do you agree with this?

356
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:33,453
What is he stealing?

357
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,497
Let me show you.

358
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,397
It is very beautiful.

359
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:01,689
It's not just a rock.
Look at the detail.

360
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:10,067
The microphone.

361
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,957
Ingenious man
Designed by an ingenious device.

362
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:28,759
A friend of mine, tonight -

363
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,267
we celebrate a very
special guests -

364
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:36,682
traditional sacrificial ceremonies -

365
00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:40,814
to show how
with great respect -

366
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:44,395
we feel towards him.

367
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:50,446
His own beloved sheep eye.

368
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:39,829
Such a representation
excite most of the men.

369
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:43,996
Yes, most of the.
-But you are different?

370
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:48,217
It is a genuine issue
a poor substitute.

371
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:08,313
I like a woman who does not
afraid of uncharted waters.

372
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,534
Teistäkö shall I fear?

373
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:15,079
You could be overwhelmed.
-Imartelette yourselves.

374
00:51:42,693 --> 00:51:47,402
They did not quit yet.
Will you look at that?

375
00:51:48,032 --> 00:51:49,360
No thank you.

376
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:01,368
My back ...

377
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:09,885
Is my guest eunuch?

378
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:13,760
Shows that you do not have.

379
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,769
How do I?

380
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:24,895
Thou dare!

381
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:29,440
What's the matter, ILSA? Are you
have forgotten what is the right man?

382
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:33,275
Do you think me a whore?
Go to your room. This is over.

383
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:36,531
Not on my part.

384
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:42,461
I say to the guards to help me.
They take you out.

385
00:52:56,226 --> 00:52:58,468
Are you crazy?

386
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:02,102
They come running when I shout.

387
00:53:02,315 --> 00:53:07,736
Why do not you do it?
Let it go. Scream.

388
00:53:13,285 --> 00:53:15,858
Or are you curious?

389
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,455
Small teränne takiako?

390
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:26,088
You have not yet seen it.

391
00:53:26,298 --> 00:53:29,631
But it is waiting for you.

392
00:53:39,603 --> 00:53:42,058
What will you do?

393
00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:45,223
First of all this.

394
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:50,155
Sheep eyes, Sharif.

395
00:53:50,155 --> 00:54:00,207
Sheep eyes, Sharif.

396
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:04,620
Hassan I, your Excellency.
El Sharif has sent me.

397
00:54:04,837 --> 00:54:09,997
Why is that?
-To serve you.

398
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:14,882
I do not need anything.
I'm going to bed.

399
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:18,924
Serve with you there.

400
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:22,185
I do not need help
going to bed.

401
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,857
In bed.
I do what you want.

402
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,734
In bed?

403
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,528
El Sharif said,
that you do not want a woman.

404
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:39,693
You want a son.
Here I am.

405
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:42,662
He said ..?

406
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:47,164
I want to ..?
It is miserable ...

407
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:51,049
Do not take it away!

408
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,988
And then this.

409
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:16,283
Only one stitch.

410
00:55:17,745 --> 00:55:19,702
Now.

411
00:55:22,082 --> 00:55:24,538
I do not understand.

412
00:55:24,752 --> 00:55:27,872
Spread your feet.

413
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:31,500
Relax.

414
00:55:33,344 --> 00:55:36,049
Just about.

415
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,094
That is no longer needed.

416
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:45,635
We need a second,
a stronger weapon.

417
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,405
I am married!
-I will please you.

418
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:02,783
Not!
-I get a penalty if I do not do it.

419
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:06,534
Need to do you happy.
-I am happy.

420
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:09,326
My throat is cut.

421
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:18,471
Cut off ..?
Would he do it?

422
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:23,637
Let me stay here;
Your Excellency.

423
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,108
What is your name was?

424
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:44,197
This is not possible ...

425
00:56:45,959 --> 00:56:48,580
Do not say anything.

426
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:52,997
Feeling, and just listen.

427
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:10,682
The upper.

428
00:57:11,526 --> 00:57:13,852
The upper.

429
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:18,152
Do your job, whore.

430
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:27,290
Please you, El Sharif?

431
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:30,727
Get out of my sight.

432
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,823
I have never felt
sinunlaistasi man, Adam.

433
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,401
I would hope -

434
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:48,363
that I do not
need to leave in the morning.

435
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:54,375
You can stay here.

436
00:58:56,257 --> 00:58:59,009
I would like to stay.

437
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:09,226
But what I say
Dr. Kaiser?

438
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,064
Say you're sick.

439
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:20,022
Say that you come from the stern.

440
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:24,992
Say anything that we can
have a couple of days together.

441
00:59:45,936 --> 00:59:49,518
I have to go back to Washington.

442
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:56,856
Wedding day is coming.

443
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:02,734
I have been asked to stay
for a few days.

444
01:00:02,953 --> 01:00:05,408
Be careful that your neck does not break.

445
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:09,122
He did not suspect anything.
He just wants to make love.

446
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:12,121
He may do something carelessly.

447
01:00:12,337 --> 01:00:15,338
No trace of the agent?

448
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,800
No. I am afraid,
that we have lost him.

449
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:33,399
Do not underestimate him, Adam.
-No, sir.

450
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:38,402
See you soon. Good luck.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

451
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:58,132
He is still alive.
-It is enough observation performance.

452
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,762
Plastic explosive.

453
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:09,225
It is a new type.
Safe until you turn on the power.

454
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,472
Velvet.

455
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:39,541
Look at the El Sharif.

456
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:46,800
It is placed in his sisälleen.

457
01:01:51,146 --> 01:01:58,442
Rakastelukone show
exactly what happens.

458
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:04,193
Come back sermin.
There, you will be safe.

459
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:36,607
More quickly.

460
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,901
More quickly.

461
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,153
Deeper.

462
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:04,425
What is the way to a man to die!

463
01:03:09,392 --> 01:03:12,263
Passion for excellence at the time.

464
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:24,030
It is the enemy,
deceitful to a neighbor.

465
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:32,748
Sheikh Umar?

466
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:37,159
He does not suspect anything.

467
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:45,136
But what do we girls?

468
01:03:46,763 --> 01:03:48,555
Katsina.

469
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:53,559
I give you, Sheikh Umar
a gift of peace.

470
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:58,100
Legacy soon?
-A couple of days later.

471
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:02,234
When <i> khadin has prepared you. </ i>

472
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,775
Must be very careful.

473
01:04:24,218 --> 01:04:27,338
Does he feel anything when you wake up?

474
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,515
He did not know anything.

475
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,437
Guarded him carefully.

476
01:04:47,908 --> 01:04:51,609
I gave those orders.

477
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:05,005
What about American?

478
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:09,465
He is a joy to me.

479
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,630
But only so far.

480
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:15,467
He is just a toy.

481
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:26,561
He may not live as long
that sees orjakaravaanin.

482
01:05:26,781 --> 01:05:29,153
He does not live.

483
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:37,826
And kunniavieraammekaan.

484
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,583
Not even he.

485
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:48,298
Arrange an unfortunate accident.

486
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:51,428
It can easily be arranged.

487
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:56,559
I do not interfere in affairs.
You can enjoy him.

488
01:05:59,565 --> 01:06:04,856
But watch out.
Toys can become precious.

489
01:06:05,113 --> 01:06:07,983
I have already
tired of him.

490
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:17,363
Adam ...

491
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:22,871
I thought ...

492
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:26,205
At first I thought -

493
01:06:26,426 --> 01:06:30,424
that we have only one
one enjoyable night.

494
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:36,678
But you are different.

495
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:08,357
Point ...

496
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,568
It hardens.

497
01:08:11,782 --> 01:08:14,700
Yes, El Sharif.

498
01:08:23,252 --> 01:08:26,621
And my tongue will taste of sweetness.

499
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:30,715
I am here to serve
roads, El Sharif.

500
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:43,304
Stand up.

501
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:54,443
Tarib!

502
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:57,235
Captain Tarib!

503
01:08:58,454 --> 01:09:00,079
Tarib!

504
01:09:10,884 --> 01:09:14,335
A couple of hours yet, and he's talking about.
-You are interrogated throughout the night.

505
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:19,465
Tarib is an amateur in these matters.
I know how she breaks down.

506
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:26,434
You say you're a freedom fighter.
-I will not tell any more.

507
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:30,811
I'm getting the truth out of him.

508
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,983
No.

509
01:09:37,577 --> 01:09:40,448
We do not receive any more information about him.

510
01:09:48,046 --> 01:09:51,000
He dies before.

511
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:56,417
You do not practice it?

512
01:09:57,264 --> 01:10:01,593
You want to give it
more oil? Okay.

513
01:10:02,519 --> 01:10:05,520
For that you want.

514
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,190
Öljyäni.

515
01:10:21,872 --> 01:10:23,781
Mr. Scott -

516
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,324
why are you so silent?

517
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:29,877
He has not been
the trial.

518
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:35,208
He was caught in the act.
What else is needed?

519
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:41,260
In my country, man has the right to
to be heard and defend himself.

520
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:44,468
Oh, yeah.

521
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:47,771
Ye ye might learn
how to save a lot of time.

522
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:38,691
As you can see,
punishment is a crime with.

523
01:11:50,463 --> 01:11:54,875
I do not want to see him
alive in the morning.

524
01:11:55,968 --> 01:12:00,547
You have delayed enough.

525
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:07,598
It is the commandment, ILSA.

526
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:11,014
Yes, El Sharif.

527
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:17,696
Why is telling me this?

528
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:20,861
Since I do not want to die.

529
01:12:22,078 --> 01:12:24,783
You wanted it sooner.

530
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:28,326
When you were my enemy.

531
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,201
What about now?

532
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:39,005
Say it, ILSA.

533
01:12:44,434 --> 01:12:47,139
You are my lover.

534
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:12,786
I look like when you wear.

535
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:16,837
You have reason to dress himself.

536
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:32,639
This man has seduced you.

537
01:13:36,486 --> 01:13:37,815
Capture them.

538
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:48,488
Let go!

539
01:14:44,222 --> 01:14:47,341
Do a good job.

540
01:14:48,476 --> 01:14:51,512
But you are too independent.

541
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:56,771
You have to learn obedience.

542
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,317
You need to remind -

543
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:05,324
who you serve.

544
01:15:08,913 --> 01:15:11,831
Your body has betrayed you.

545
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:17,161
It needed love.

546
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,383
It is your thirst.

547
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:26,546
It must be cultivated -

548
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,892
in order to eliminate the need.

549
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:56,886
Good.

550
01:16:57,982 --> 01:17:02,145
I think that you've learned your lesson yet.

551
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:06,523
So I am.

552
01:17:07,284 --> 01:17:10,368
I consider myself kyttyräselän.

553
01:17:11,413 --> 01:17:14,165
If you are not obedient -

554
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:18,582
you get to experience this again.

555
01:17:19,129 --> 01:17:23,423
The next time
it is done publicly.

556
01:17:24,009 --> 01:17:28,636
In the middle of the market square,
all the people to see.

557
01:17:29,264 --> 01:17:32,930
For the first time should not be.

558
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:36,723
Forget it American.

559
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:42,352
Half an hour, and he is dead.

560
01:17:58,878 --> 01:18:00,751
I need to get to her.

561
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:03,335
What we say to them?

562
01:18:03,549 --> 01:18:06,301
Promise of freedom, gold,
whatever they ask.

563
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:11,089
Satin, the guards treat the area.

564
01:18:12,058 --> 01:18:16,554
Velvet, treat harem
until I return.

565
01:18:28,866 --> 01:18:31,488
Hurry! Take the gun!

566
01:18:32,787 --> 01:18:35,704
Do not haaskatko time! Eunuch!

567
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:54,674
Stop.

568
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:07,942
I came to see it
pig dies. Where is he?

569
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:10,066
There.

570
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:50,440
Suddenly. There is not much.

571
01:19:55,662 --> 01:19:58,747
Fight, if you want to live.

572
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:03,912
Wait a minute.

573
01:20:04,129 --> 01:20:07,463
Why do you want to throw him to power?

574
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:11,589
We can manage one.
With the Son.

575
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:14,046
What is the boy?

576
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,681
Come, I will show.

577
01:20:21,564 --> 01:20:23,390
Come on now.

578
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:45,455
Prince Selim, Sheikh's nephew.
The last rightful heir.

579
01:20:53,888 --> 01:20:57,423
The battle has begun. Let's go.
He is safer here.

580
01:20:58,059 --> 01:21:01,060
You are right. Let's go.

581
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:42,152
Now it's my turn to.

582
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,906
You gave me a gift.

583
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:27,739
Kyttyräselän.
I'll give you a gift.

584
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:31,582
Katsina.

585
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:35,503
He will be tomorrow
Sheikh Umar -

586
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:39,962
but she must perform
yet one mission here.

587
01:25:41,263 --> 01:25:45,557
Katsina,
El Sharif has been promised for -

588
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:48,721
The last wish -

589
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:52,057
before he was executed.

590
01:25:52,274 --> 01:25:53,851
<i> Yes, khadin. </ i>

591
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:59,062
He wants to make love
the last time with you.

592
01:25:59,281 --> 01:26:01,986
Valitsiko he me?

593
01:26:11,752 --> 01:26:15,370
Then you can go.

594
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:18,162
Oh <i> khadin ...</ i>

595
01:26:28,435 --> 01:26:30,761
Use your tongue.

596
01:26:35,442 --> 01:26:38,230
Kiihota him best.

597
01:26:38,445 --> 01:26:43,273
Help him to Within
and to reach the final ecstasy.

598
01:26:43,492 --> 01:26:47,442
Let him die
happily, Katsina -

599
01:26:47,663 --> 01:26:51,531
so you get your freedom.

600
01:27:18,486 --> 01:27:20,811
<i> khadin Where is it? </ i>

601
01:27:27,829 --> 01:27:30,616
Excuse me,
your Highness.

602
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:44,000
That's right, Katsina.
Do you see how strong you make him?

603
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:51,185
Let him go deeper.

604
01:27:56,733 --> 01:28:01,360
Help him. Louder.

605
01:28:30,184 --> 01:28:34,099
A suitable end to a man who had
fleshly pleasures.

606
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:37,398
What about Katsina?

607
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:41,525
Why, what evil he had done?
-He had no significance.

608
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:46,569
You even filthy bitch.

609
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:52,863
Is your lover become cold?
-Frigid.

610
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:56,078
I introduce myself to the prince.

611
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:11,176
I am commanded to kill him.

612
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:16,638
My job is to protect you
unpalatable decisions.

613
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:22,397
You managed to do it well.
-I just want to serve you.

614
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:28,740
As the server enoanne.
-This is your home if you so desire.

615
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:43,456
American need to leave,
so that you can manage alone.

616
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:47,044
I need him.
-You do not need. I will help you.

617
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:52,601
I would advise you, negotiate
on your behalf. Opastan you.

618
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:56,765
I am the right hands.

619
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:01,689
You clicked on your loyalty,
when the server enoani.

620
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:07,733
Until then, when he behaved
as a monster. Then I decided to strike.

621
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:13,614
For you to come to power and
perintöoikeutenne get back.

622
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:17,876
He saved your life.
-I agree to your request.

623
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:24,542
Kingdom is a place for you.
-Thank you, your Highness.

624
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:29,255
Until his death.

625
01:30:40,024 --> 01:30:43,060
Let me out!

626
01:30:44,403 --> 01:30:47,440
This is not my doing.

627
01:30:47,657 --> 01:30:51,405
Goodbye, ILSA.
-Son of a bitch!

628
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:02,625
Let me out, you bastard!
