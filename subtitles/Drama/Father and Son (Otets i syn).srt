1
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,441
It's over. It's over.

2
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,006
Easy, easy.

3
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,143
Calm down.

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,289
It's over. It's over.

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,670
It's over.

6
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,217
You saved me again.

7
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,622
If not, they would have killed me.

8
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,993
Killed me.

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,633
Scream louder next time.

10
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,830
If I don't hear you, they'll kill you.

11
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,509
Weren't you asleep?

12
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,575
Not anymore.

13
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,209
I love you.

14
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,344
Yes.

15
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,138
Where are you now?

16
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,442
I see trees.

17
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,810
There's a road.

18
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,714
Are you over there again?

19
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,161
The sun.

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,696
Where is it?

21
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,858
It's beautiful.

22
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,136
Am I over there too?

23
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,407
No.

24
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,510
I'm all alone.

25
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,276
All alone.

26
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,417
- It's raining.
- Don't catch a cold.

27
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,161
It's warm.

28
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,994
You should have dressed.

29
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,328
I see the road too.

30
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,006
Yes.

31
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,744
Now I see you.

32
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,153
We'd better go.

33
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,795
They're coming this way.

34
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,622
Come here.

35
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,219
You know Alexei? He's second year.
Send him over here.

36
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,995
- Just send him over.
- All right.

37
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:53,403
Come on, do it. It's okay.
Tell him his father is here.

38
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,672
- Hi there.
- Hello.

39
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,650
Go on! One, two!

40
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,654
Show some spirit!

41
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,590
Don't stop!

42
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,916
What's up?

43
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,915
Nothing.

44
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,392
He's going to get it.

45
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,858
Hey, Dad.

46
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,625
Sorry, it took so long.
They keep close watch.

47
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,327
- I understand.
- They could kick us out.

48
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,434
- Something wrong happened?
- No.

49
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,129
I just wanted to see you.
Nothing more.

50
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,442
I like your smile.

51
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,114
You don't look well.

52
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:17,148
-I'm fine. Just your imagination.
- My imagination?

53
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,261
Go on. I don't want to bother you.

54
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,162
Don't you want to watch practice?

55
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,132
- Let's go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,802
By the way, I saw your x-rays.

57
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,605
You don't have any spots in your
lungs.

58
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,205
You're in good health.
Aren't you glad?

59
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,610
I thought you'd be happy.

60
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,016
lam.

61
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:56,651
You know that they teach us
how to read x-rays.

62
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,602
Go to practice.
I'll come and watch.

63
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,168
In 10 minutes, okay?

64
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,949
- Have you seen Andrei Danilov?
- He's on duty in the barracks.

65
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,655
What are you doing here?

66
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,059
You can't stay here!

67
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,059
You can't stay here!

68
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,359
What?

69
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,832
- You saw and heard everything?
- I heard your father.

70
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,168
- So you saw him?
- Yes.

71
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,505
- The exam's on Monday.
- Today is Saturday.

72
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,608
Exactly.

73
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,516
You could have come to see me.

74
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,176
You're on duty.
I didn't want to bother you.

75
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,686
That never stopped you before.

76
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,124
I don't understand.
I asked you to forgive me.

77
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,487
It's forgotten.
I just needed to be alone.

78
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,269
So why didn't you tell me?

79
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,506
Why not?

80
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:30,583
You always move ahead alone,
without me.

81
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,823
Without me.

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,463
I understand now.

83
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,495
You're afraid of something else.

84
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,774
You're afraid that your father
will think that he is a bother.

85
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,177
You take his side.

86
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,482
Why can't I love both of you?

87
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,649
Why?

88
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,757
I really need to go.

89
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,764
You are seeing someone else.

90
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,998
Think what you like.

91
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,152
Is he better than me?

92
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,784
It's not the same.

93
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,428
He's older. You're still a boy.

94
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,659
You and I are the same age.

95
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,233
Women are always older.

96
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,533
Who?

97
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,504
Women.

98
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,864
I want to see him.

99
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,868
What are you saying?

100
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,611
What for?

101
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,344
That's enough. I'm leaving.

102
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,580
Watch your take downs.

103
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,348
Cut the distance.

104
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,488
Alexei, pay attention!

105
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:06,198
Alexei, I don't like you today.
Pay more attention.

106
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,404
Watch your falls.

107
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,576
Bend your legs.

108
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,771
Watch your stands.

109
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:23,277
Grabs should be higher,
at the shoulder level.

110
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,289
Here we go. Good.

111
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,790
Once more.

112
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:31,888
Punch him.

113
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,588
Throw him down.

114
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,760
Finish up. Finish up.

115
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,202
Where is your finish up?
Concentrate.

116
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,976
Dad.

117
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,342
Dad!

118
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,679
Here is my laundry bag.

119
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,384
Good evening.

120
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,182
Good evening.

121
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,818
- Are you hungry?
- I ate at the canteen.

122
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,022
Was it good?

123
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,603
I guess it was.

124
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,621
- What's that?
- Your portrait.

125
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
It's for scaring children.

126
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,132
Why is that?

127
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,866
It's still a photo.

128
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:40,910
Just a little more revealing.
You're not hiding behind clothes.

129
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,213
Nor your muscles.

130
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,550
Yes, of course.

131
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,960
I think muscles are an exaggeration.

132
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:08,701
Why is that? You admit
you worked out, lifted weights.

133
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,241
- Where are you going?
- That was when I was your age.

134
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,346
All right!

135
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,815
Where's my ball?

136
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,056
Why didn't you change?

137
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,356
- Don't stay in your uniform!
- I don't feel like changing.

138
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,954
You're beautiful.
You're like a tree.

139
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,260
Your legs are the roots.

140
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,760
Your chest is like a trunk.

141
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:43,111
- Sasha, have you eaten?
- Yes, thanks.

142
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,216
- Looking for something?
- I found it and ate it. Got to go.

143
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:54,189
Are you leaving?
Wait, where are you going?

144
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,516
Got something to say?

145
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,153
You didn't come by school today
for nothing.

146
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,733
I don't want to talk about that now.

147
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,142
Wait! Wait! Wait!

148
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,801
Wait a second.

149
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,333
Tchaikovsky.

150
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,960
You like Tchaikovsky, don't you?

151
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,436
Yes.

152
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,039
We're so different.

153
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,382
You're the next in line.

154
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,912
I'm behind you.

155
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,149
So?

156
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,153
That's your answer
to all my questions?

157
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,939
Not all questions have answers.

158
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,510
You know what the saints say?

159
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,351
- About a father's love?
- The saints? About love?

160
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,222
Where did you read that?

161
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,585
Where?

162
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:22,632
A father's love crucifies.

163
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:28,171
A loving son
lets himself be crucified.

164
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:35,343
I don't even get
the meaning of that.

165
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,587
Go to bed. Enough.

166
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,556
And change clothes, please.

167
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,562
Just don't die.

168
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,362
Kolya.

169
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,935
Kolya!

170
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,937
Kolya!

171
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:12,133
Can you hear me, Kolya?

172
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:19,580
If your son comes here again
tomorrow, what should I tell him?

173
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,376
Can I...

174
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,050
...show him these photos?

175
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,388
Maybe give him this one?

176
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,258
Dad.

177
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,301
I start to forget your face.

178
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,227
Dad.

179
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,828
Dad!

180
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,400
Dad!

181
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,619
What?

182
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,455
Where's Mom?

183
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,620
Where's Mom?

184
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,714
They gave us new uniforms.

185
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:37,685
- What about the tie?
- I have it.

186
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,588
I had this dream today.
I almost killed you.

187
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,421
Again?

188
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,985
Well, it means that somebody
wished us bad luck.

189
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,531
Now I'm scared to sleep.

190
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,500
Scared to sleep?

191
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,899
Go whisper to the water.

192
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,237
- As if it were that simple.
- Try it.

193
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,973
Okay, I'll try.

194
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:13,651
Troubles wash away with water

195
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,653
Like the night goes away with dreams

196
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,164
- Dad! Water's boiling.
- Turn it off!

197
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,650
Like the night goes away with dreams

198
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:50,420
Troubles wash away with water

199
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,459
Alexei!

200
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:57,155
Your dreams are getting out of hand.

201
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,771
I whispered to the water.

202
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,246
Don't turn on the light.

203
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,327
How old were you when I was born?

204
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,835
20.

205
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,905
How old?

206
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,973
Almost 20.

207
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,883
Feeling better?

208
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,283
What do you mean?

209
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,894
- You argued with her.
- Why do you say that?

210
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,998
Does it show that much?

211
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,011
Come on, get up.

212
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,541
Yes, I need to get up.

213
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,280
Back to the barracks on Monday?
Do you have duty?

214
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,219
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,921
- When are you coming back home?
- I don't know myself.

216
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,125
Come on, get up!

217
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,859
Or go sleep in your bed.

218
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,664
Come on, Dad. Get up.

219
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,638
Come on.

220
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,670
Remember I said
I had an opportunity to leave?

221
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,643
That the pay would be better?

222
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:04,379
But I won't let you leave.

223
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:21,267
I want you to be happy.

224
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:32,507
You think that I'll be happy
if you leave?

225
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:18,115
- Dad, catch up!
- Run, run!

226
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,000
Dad, someone's at the door!

227
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,736
Open it!

228
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,414
Can't you hear?

229
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,950
Open it yourself.

230
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,679
I'm covered with soap!

231
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,987
What's that? Dew?

232
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,061
- The roof is all wet.
- Yes, it's dew.

233
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,394
The sun's coming out
from behind the clouds.

234
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,531
It won't rain today.

235
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,496
You sleep too late, soldier.

236
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,239
Just go open the door.

237
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,201
Alexei, who could be dropping by?

238
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,542
Did you recognize me?
ls it too early?

239
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,379
Come in, come in.
Of course, I recognized you.

240
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,760
- Put your things there.
- Thank you.

241
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,758
I don't have much.

242
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,159
Open again?

243
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,199
Alexei, keep the doors closed!

244
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,837
I was wondering if you would stop by.

245
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:20,307
I've been waiting.
Don't just stand there. Come in.

246
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,901
Alexei, keep the doors closed.

247
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,875
I wanted you to drop by.

248
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,281
Really? Actually,
I'm leaving with my Mom today.

249
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,216
Already?

250
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,721
Well, our three days
of sightseeing are done.

251
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:37,384
This city's beautiful.
But living here must be tough.

252
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,826
Come on, come on.

253
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,664
- I woke you up.
- No, don't worry.

254
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,466
- Come on in. Are you afraid?
- No.

255
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,269
Where do you want to sit?
At the table?

256
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,207
Sit down.

257
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,711
- My same seat as yesterday.
- That's it.

258
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,543
- With the photos.
- Go ahead.

259
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:05,588
- I'll be right back. Are you hungry?
- No, thanks. I ate at the hotel.

260
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,384
- I have to dress.
- Of course.

261
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,950
If you remembered anything, tell me.
Be right back.

262
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,949
I didn't see this one before.

263
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:44,015
Oh, yes, the helicopter.
I saw it. Did it crash?

264
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,698
I don't know
if it's important, but...

265
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,231
- Can I sit down here?
- Sure.

266
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,137
Thank you.

267
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:04,343
I don't know if it's important or not.

268
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,909
I asked my father once
why he and my mother divorced.

269
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:14,979
I asked my mother before.
But she told me to ask my father.

270
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,153
He told me he had become
a different man after the war.

271
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,562
- True. Me too.
- And that no one understood him.

272
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,295
I asked him to explain to me
what he meant by "a different man."

273
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,270
He said I didn't need to know.
That it didn't matter.

274
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,713
I don't see a connection
to what happened.

275
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,051
Pity. I'm just trying to figure out
why he disappeared.

276
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:50,352
Nothing is simple.
Maybe he killed someone.

277
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,254
- Nonsense.
- Then where is he?

278
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,932
Your father is a good man.

279
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,807
A good man.

280
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,914
So he didn't kill anyone.

281
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,056
Even if he had, I'd stick by him.

282
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,992
- Do you have a cold?
- No.

283
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,894
- You've got a cold.
- No.

284
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,571
He didn't do anything wrong.
I'm sure.

285
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:41,007
Yes. I know, I know.
But there must be a reason.

286
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,238
You must have some theory.

287
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,475
Some idea.

288
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,984
Some idea...

289
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,277
You know, don't you?

290
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,619
Meet, you two!
He came by last night.

291
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,393
He's the son of my friend whom
I visited last summer, remember?

292
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,522
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,296
- My friend disappeared last winter.
- I didn't know that.

294
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,200
I was in the military.

295
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:14,502
When someone disappeared,
we looked, we didn't write him off.

296
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,708
But he left the military by that time.
You left the military too.

297
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,650
Now it's my turn to talk to you.
Let's go and talk.

298
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,312
- You didn't disappear.
- Don't bother my Dad.

299
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,220
- Hey, hands off!
- This way!

300
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,759
- Where?
- In my room. I want to talk to you.

301
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,853
- Maybe I don't want to.
- Go on, move.

302
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,300
- Don't be stubborn.
- Why are you closing the door?

303
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,859
Come on! This is my room.

304
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,600
- Don't bother my Dad!
- Stop pushing me.

305
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,437
- Come on!
- Stop it!

306
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,381
Is that your bed?

307
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,247
Yes.

308
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,217
- Look at this.
- Are those ribs?

309
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,084
It's called a thoracic cage.

310
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,925
- My father's thoracic cage.
- Those could be anyone's.

311
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:14,367
Very funny!
Look at the lungs, not the ribs.

312
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:19,237
- He had a lung wound.
- I can't breathe!

313
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:23,443
Can't breathe?
What are you looking at?

314
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:37,019
I guess you don't know
that I came by here last night.

315
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,060
No.

316
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,965
Strange.
Why didn't he tell you?

317
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,725
He didn't have time.

318
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,065
Are you really studying medicine?

319
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,464
- Yes, in the military.
- Military?

320
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,066
Yes, I'll be a military trainer.

321
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,840
Why the military?

322
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,577
It's in the family.

323
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,847
- My father was in the military.
- That's beyond me.

324
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,514
Too bad.

325
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,250
There's my friend, wait.

326
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,420
Sasha, what's that music?

327
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:17,089
- Get out of the house!
- Don't blind me.

328
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,532
- Alexei, come out here!
- Okay, I'm coming out.

329
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,668
Dad's home.

330
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,668
I know, it's Next.

331
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,196
You kidding!
I don't listen to that.

332
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,605
I'll knock you down!

333
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,108
Give me that CD!

334
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,339
Don't be afraid!

335
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,510
What is this, then?

336
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,176
Sit down!

337
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,417
Hey, Alexei!

338
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,921
Alexei, stop it!

339
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,659
I give up! I give up!

340
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,762
Come on, get up!

341
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,493
Who's that?

342
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,537
A guy looking for his father.
I can't get rid of him.

343
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,630
Bring him out here. Go on.

344
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:06,546
- Then leave. Go on!
- Alexei, don't or I'll fall!

345
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,048
Come here.

346
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,250
Come on!

347
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,787
- Come on.
- What for?

348
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:16,754
Come on!

349
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,084
Careful.

350
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,332
Come on.

351
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,902
Hold on.

352
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,303
That's it.

353
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:40,742
-I'm standing.
- Don't hold on to me!

354
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,287
Hold on, hold on.

355
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,387
Nothing compares to
my father's disappearance.

356
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,622
I know you don't care much.

357
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,760
Hold him!

358
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:03,705
It's good not to be afraid.
So don't be afraid.

359
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:10,443
I have no pity for those who fear.

360
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:28,363
Listen to me.
Never be afraid of anything.

361
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,369
Never be afraid of anything.

362
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,331
Got that?

363
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,169
Alexei!

364
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,765
Alexei!

365
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,769
What do you want?

366
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:48,544
Why did you make him go out there?
Tell me!

367
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,348
Come back in, you two!

368
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,917
Come on!

369
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,424
And you, why did you go out there?

370
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,890
NOW, you. Hurry!

371
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,465
Did you hear me?

372
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,799
-I'm coming. No need to shout.
- Hurry up!

373
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,264
- Haven't I warned you?
- Yes.

374
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,773
- So?
- So what?

375
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,471
- Why are you mocking me?
- Excuse me.

376
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,504
Just because.

377
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,777
Just because, right?
Then you get what you deserve.

378
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,979
- What are you doing?
- There are consequences!

379
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:31,321
I'll teach you once and for all.
Next time, I'll beat you!

380
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,120
What?

381
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,026
Alexei!

382
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,689
Don't just stand there!

383
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,789
So you're here too?

384
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,234
You like playing acrobat?

385
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,736
I've got him, Alexei!

386
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,909
Don't just stand there!

387
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,340
All right, I'm coming.

388
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,509
I'll help you!

389
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,156
Will you go back out there?

390
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,224
- I can't breathe, Dad.
- Do you give up?

391
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,065
- No.
- Will you go out there again?

392
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,538
- Yes, I will.
- ldiot!

393
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:23,512
Come on, guys. Stop it!

394
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:32,785
What?

395
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,514
You tore my tank top.

396
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,559
- Go back to your nest.
- Fix it!

397
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,389
Go, go!

398
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,493
Go, defender.

399
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,363
- You tore my tank top.
- Yeah, sure.

400
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,762
I'll get a needle and thread.

401
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:55,435
- You'll fix it!
- Just throw it out!

402
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,945
- What are you up to today?
- Why?

403
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,048
I need to talk to you.

404
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,560
- Today?
- l'm leaving tomorrow.

405
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,756
A little later, then.

406
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,460
- I have an appointment.
- How about in an hour?

407
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,467
Okay.

408
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,531
Tell your father I said bye.

409
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,776
In an hour.

410
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,789
Keep it quiet!

411
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:28,426
Alexei, where's your cat?

412
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:33,406
I already told you.
Get off my back!

413
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,602
I'm not interested in you.

414
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,214
I'm interested in your cat.

415
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,978
Dad.

416
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,286
I'm sorry.

417
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,789
Sorry.

418
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,022
You knew about his father,
didn't you?

419
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,430
You lied to him.

420
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:08,438
- You can't hide it. Tell me.
- It's true. I can't hide.

421
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,015
In 1998, my friend received orders.

422
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,218
A dangerous mission.

423
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,995
All his soldiers were killed.

424
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,860
Only he survived.

425
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,502
He came up with this crazy idea
to kill the guy who gave the orders.

426
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:46,808
Actually, it's not crazy at all.

427
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,309
I know exactly how it feels.

428
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,816
It's not crazy at all.

429
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:59,187
He wanted to kill the guy
who gave the orders?

430
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,996
Who was he after?

431
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,762
Do you know?

432
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,096
He didn't say.

433
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:16,004
It's the man at the top.
The one who decides.

434
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:21,844
You two were tight. You saw him.
You kept his secret.

435
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,712
He chose you.

436
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:28,085
He knows we have a place,
where he's always welcome.

437
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,384
We fought together,
but he won't come here.

438
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,052
Why not?

439
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,791
I'd really like to meet him.

440
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,800
See what he looks like.

441
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,603
Really.

442
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,037
Well, should I make something to eat?

443
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:53,740
- Not now. I'm late.
- Late? On Sunday?

444
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,520
- I promised him.
- Who? Our guest?

445
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,317
All right, go on.

446
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:12,325
- That's where you hid the ball!
- Bad hiding place, I guess.

447
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,067
Over here!

448
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:22,801
I already told you,
don't play ball here!

449
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,278
Do you hear me?

450
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,284
Hey, do you hear me?

451
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,020
Dear soldiers!
Want some soup?

452
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:51,036
Go or you'll be late.
Get dressed.

453
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,871
Careful with him.
Don't say too much.

454
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,255
Alexei!

455
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,730
Do you hear me?

456
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,397
Don't come home too late.

457
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,103
I'll cook for us.

458
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,673
Do you hear me?

459
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,321
Hi.

460
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:55,727
- You're late. Where are we going?
- This way.

461
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:01,101
I played ball with my father.
I'm training him.

462
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,101
You training him?

463
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,332
This city is all hills.
We'll have to go up after.

464
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:10,003
- Look at this.
- This way.

465
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:15,480
That dog has barked from that balcony
since I was a kid.

466
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,779
Nothing changes here.

467
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:21,251
Let's hope it stays that way.
Great door.

468
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,984
It's just old. Come on.

469
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,157
Look, a plane!

470
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,400
I wanted to talk.

471
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:42,875
All we're doing is walking.
What's that over there?

472
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,843
Come back and see us next summer.

473
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,075
- Next summer?
- Look, a street car.

474
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,311
Let's stop it.

475
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:55,083
- Hey, stop!
- It's quicker this way.

476
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,489
No need to shout.
It has to stop.

477
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,698
- How much is it?
- More expensive now.

478
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,908
- Thanks. I went to that school.
- I know, I know.

479
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:25,647
- Let's go to the back.
- Okay.

480
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,998
Where are you?
Come back here.

481
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:05,083
- I want to speak about my father.
- Your father? Okay.

482
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,527
Hi, Alexei!

483
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:10,927
Hi.

484
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,042
Tell me.

485
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,410
Well, where do I begin?

486
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,530
He gave me a key.

487
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,497
So I could see him whenever I want.

488
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,664
So I would be there
when he came home.

489
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,707
He wanted me to.

490
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:58,343
But I never used that key.

491
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,041
Now I realize how he needed me.

492
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:05,311
I don't get it.
Didn't he live with you?

493
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,989
Mom chased him away.

494
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:12,149
He started drinking after the war.

495
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,303
Why did you let her
chase him away?

496
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,601
How is a man chased
from his home?

497
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,854
This is a strange city.

498
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:53,401
Where are you taking me?
To the past?

499
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,972
Let's get off. Okay?

500
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,318
Fine.

501
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,220
I'll call you, Alexei.

502
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:20,460
Stop, please!
We're getting off.

503
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,555
It's dangerous to get off here.
I don't recommend it.

504
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,632
Hope he won't run us over.

505
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,436
- Hey!
- Hello there!

506
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,245
- Where are we? Where now?
- Down there, to the right.

507
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,187
Going over there, right?

508
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,894
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

509
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,905
What does your mom say?

510
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:10,307
About my father?
She doesn't love him anymore.

511
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,973
Too bad we don't live
in the same city.

512
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,878
Look.

513
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,145
That bird is looking for someone.

514
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,388
You know the parable
about the prodigal son?

515
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,425
Rembrandt.

516
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,086
Painting in the Hermitage. Yes.

517
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,495
Why the son? Fathers
are more often on the run.

518
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,898
The son always knows
where he has to go.

519
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,662
And why does he know?

520
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,934
Because he only has
one path in front of him.

521
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,401
If you say so.

522
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:24,079
We are always with somebody.
But the father is ultimately all alone.

523
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,212
Everybody will outlive him.

524
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:41,700
Those aren't your words,
or your ideas.

525
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:47,673
You have a father.
But I don't even envy you.

526
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:13,925
All right, go home.
I'll get to the station on my own.

527
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,682
So that's it.

528
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,192
You're late.

529
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,453
What?

530
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,699
We didn't have a date.

531
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,801
I can't take it anymore.
Tell me who he is.

532
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,671
Does it matter?

533
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,717
- But...
- But what?

534
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,983
I had no choice but to leave home.

535
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,556
So I did.

536
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,590
- You never told me that.
- Yes.

537
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:31,759
No.

538
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,798
Yes, I did.

539
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:34,931
No.

540
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,264
Yes, I did.

541
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,769
Take off your necklace.

542
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,671
What?

543
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:50,615
- Take it off. Throw it here.
- What for?

544
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,638
It's warm.

545
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,339
That's all that remains.

546
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:21,138
I had so many dreams last night.

547
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,707
All of them strange.

548
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,219
First I dreamed about my father.

549
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,990
Then about our son.

550
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,795
Our son?

551
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,697
Yes. Really.

552
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,527
What did he look like?

553
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,502
I didn't see him.

554
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,677
I only heard him.

555
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,043
I felt him moving about.

556
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:03,551
You didn't want a baby, did you?
You were always so careful.

557
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,557
It's not a reproach.
Your time hasn't come yet.

558
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,441
Your time hasn't come yet.

559
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,042
- A father's love crucifies.
- Yes.

560
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,381
A loving son lets himself
be crucified.

561
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,385
Yes.

562
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,894
Give me back my necklace.

563
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,992
Come on, come on.

564
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,562
Come on, come on.

565
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,125
Poor crucified boy.

566
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:55,006
Crucified love means
you can't be equal.

567
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:05,509
You're not brothers.
No, you are not.

568
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,746
- Are you hungry?
- No.

569
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,252
It's all ready.

570
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,483
You eat.

571
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,217
You eat!

572
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,760
I waited for you.

573
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:52,131
lam not hungry.
l saw him.

574
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,964
- And?
- I showed him the city.

575
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,470
What did you tell him?

576
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,472
- I invited him for next summer.
-ls that all?

577
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,170
Yes.

578
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:11,450
He thinks his father is alive.
He loves his father.

579
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,178
Do you have a headache?

580
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,653
Do you think he's alive?

581
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:23,126
- Of course.
- It's your intuition.

582
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,630
- That's a new one.
- l'm serious.

583
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,201
- When you were 4--
- Stop it!

584
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,862
My childhood
doesn't really interest me.

585
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,737
I didn't need my own life then.

586
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:39,142
Everything was about you.
Without you, I was nothing.

587
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:43,706
Every story has two sides.
Now I'm just a bother to you.

588
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,447
Don't say that.

589
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,455
It's what I think.

590
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,219
Then don't think.

591
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:01,397
Dinner's ready.
You might as well eat.

592
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,463
Let's go outside.
It's better outside.

593
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,065
But I made your favorite.

594
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,479
Where are you?
Come out, Dad!

595
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,753
Come out here!
Come on! It's better out here.

596
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,850
I'm coming.

597
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:34,428
She said we built a fortress.
That we don't let anyone inside.

598
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:40,303
- Does this look like a fortress?
- Yes, this is our fortress.

599
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,774
I don't remember
what grade you were in.

600
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:46,335
Your friends hardly ever came by.
That worried me.

601
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:52,647
- You seemed bored.
- But I never felt alone. I had you.

602
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:56,383
She said she's tired of
banging on our door.

603
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,358
I see everything differently now.

604
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,827
What she thinks, what she wants.

605
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,831
I'm not interested.

606
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:11,603
She never understood me.
So I don't need her.

607
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,142
I've almost forgotten her already.

608
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,312
- Do you believe me?
- If you believe, so do I.

609
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,576
- Come here, Dad.
- Why?

610
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,675
- Stop it, you're not a kid.
- Squat down.

611
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,051
You're not a kid anymore.

612
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,281
When I graduate, I'll leave here.

613
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:36,955
If ever I see her,
I won't recognize her.

614
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:41,934
You'll leave here?
I wonder how I'll feel alone.

615
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,797
You won't be alone.

616
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,774
- You'll get married.
- Alexei!

617
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:53,313
- Sasha, not now!
- Let's fly!

618
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:56,539
- Higher!
- The army doesn't feed you.

619
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,244
Careful!

620
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,050
Again!

621
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,987
Next time.

622
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,364
Next time.

623
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,872
Right?

624
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:36,585
You won't be alone.
You'll get married.

625
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,823
I'm glad you said that.

626
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,561
Sad about something?

627
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:55,041
Did it really mean that much to you,
what I said?

628
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:03,977
You are so much like your mother.

629
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,086
God sent you to me.

630
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,524
Everything about you is important.

631
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,943
Sasha, come here.

632
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,410
- Come here.
- Me?

633
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,347
- Come here!
- Okay, I'm coming.

634
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,012
Sasha, come here.

635
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:47,293
- Hi.
- This is my father.

636
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:53,728
And he is my friend.

637
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,734
I love him very much.

638
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:05,174
I love him very much.

639
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,140
Can I be with you, guys?

640
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,515
I'm a nice guy.

641
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,586
Yes, Sasha. You're really nice.

642
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:33,831
Do you want to stay with us?

643
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:43,242
Don't be sad.

644
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:48,281
You live right next door.
We're already together.

645
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,112
Together.

646
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,350
But next door.

647
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:10,001
It's cold. Very cold.

648
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:16,238
I should go.

649
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,173
Where are you going?

650
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,444
You know very well.

651
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,913
Where are you going?

652
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:06,356
For a walk. I can't sleep.

653
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,257
I'll go with you.

654
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:18,095
- No, I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.

655
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,703
I feel bad.

656
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,323
Yes, I can tell.

657
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,856
I feel bad.

658
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:47,559
Something hurts here.

659
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,864
Help yourself.

660
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:25,161
You'll work it out on your own.

661
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,407
Will this happen often?

662
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,389
I don't know.

663
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:52,222
I don't know how it will be with you.

664
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,561
If you're human,
it hurts all your life.

665
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,178
I got it.

666
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,711
Very clear.

667
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,948
Very clear.

668
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,059
Well, good.

669
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,445
It's snowing.

670
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,098
You.

671
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,226
Where are you?

672
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,668
I'm not far away.

673
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,634
And me?

674
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,808
- Am I there too?
- No.

675
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,474
I'm alone here.
