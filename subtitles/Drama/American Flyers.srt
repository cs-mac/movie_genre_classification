1
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,098
You've got to be quick.

2
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:09,905
What?

3
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,975
Let's move, Bill.

4
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:50,371
Wait. Hold the door.

5
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,212
Could you hit five please?

6
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,284
She told me she was majoring
in political science.

7
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:01,345
<i>You've reached the Sommers' residence.</i>

8
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:06,152
<i>Leave your name and the time you called.
We'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

9
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,990
<i>Hi, Mom. It's Marcus.</i>

10
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,150
Marcus!

11
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:13,220
<i>I figured it was time
we saw each other again.</i>

12
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,532
<i>I'm on the road right now.</i>

13
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,563
<i>I should be in St. Louis by dinnertime.</i>

14
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:20,460
<i>'Bye.</i>

15
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:37,420
Good afternoon. Sommers Talent Agency.

16
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:38,717
Oh, hi, David.

17
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,390
Mrs. Sommers, it's David for you.

18
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,159
Hi, Davie.

19
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,028
Mom, guess who's coming home
for dinner.

20
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:50,525
Marcus.

21
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,733
Of course I'm happy, darling.

22
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:58,071
Mom, think peace. Okay?

23
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,939
Okay. Talk to you later.

24
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,552
I think I'm beginning
to like Brussels sprouts.

25
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,890
I'll get it.

26
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,234
Yes? Can I help you?

27
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:43,947
- You bastard.
- Son of a bitch.

28
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:52,586
- You've lost weight.
- No. You've lost touch. I got taller.

29
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,420
Who poured ugly all over the walls?

30
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:03,558
Mom just wallpapered half the apartment.
Tell her you like it, please.

31
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,024
No.

32
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:09,535
- He's here!
- Hi.

33
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,936
Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

34
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,176
Welcome home.

35
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:19,544
New wallpaper.

36
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,650
It's really nice.

37
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,611
I'm glad you like it.

38
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,122
I think the fish is still warm.
Come on, sit down.

39
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:32,491
I already ate on the road.

40
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,229
In that case, I might as well...

41
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,269
I'll take those, Mom. I got them.

42
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,167
Why don't you two...

43
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,499
I got it.

44
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:51,073
I came home because I'm worried
about Davie.

45
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,078
He should go away to college, Mom.

46
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:00,188
Look, I'm willing to help pay
if that's a problem.

47
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:04,852
- Come on, Marcus. Let's not start again.
- I know you don't want to talk about this.

48
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,097
He is really old enough
to be out on his own.

49
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,467
He's doing just fine where he is.

50
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,026
He's not doing fine.

51
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,030
He's almost flunking out.

52
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:19,575
I have friends on the faculty.
He is not doing well at all.

53
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,168
- He could've if...
- Could've.

54
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:22,713
He's had a very rough year.

55
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:26,581
That's our motto. That's our family motto:
"The Sommers Could've."

56
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:31,118
I could've. You could've. Daddy could've.
Now it's Davie's turn.

57
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,248
We're always looking for excuses.

58
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,792
I'll tell you about "could."
I could be crazy about you, but I'm not.

59
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:43,099
And you could've made
Dad's last few weeks a lot easier.

60
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:46,100
But you didn't.

61
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:49,764
I know that.

62
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:53,340
I got your pictures, Vera.

63
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,277
No, they're nice.

64
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,541
But I am a little disappointed.

65
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:08,250
I never thought it was true love,
you and me, but I did think it was true sex.

66
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,789
Now you're telling me it was true,
but it wasn't free.

67
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,766
I'm not in the modeling business, Vera.
My mother is.

68
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,769
If you want an interview,
you really should call her.

69
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,897
I don't want to fight with you.
I'm too worried about Davie.

70
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:25,568
He's a smart kid, Mom.
He just needs to get out of here.

71
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,940
Didn't you look at him
when you walked through that door?

72
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,013
You're a doctor. Couldn't you tell?

73
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,108
Tell what? What's the matter with him?

74
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,597
<i>Kids lose weight for all kinds of reasons.</i>

75
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,567
<i>You can get dizzy spells
from an ear infection or even a bad diet.</i>

76
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,196
<i>Have you taken him to a hospital
to have him checked?</i>

77
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,638
Have you forgotten
he's terrified of hospitals?

78
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,142
Well, I'm a doctor. Why didn't you call me?

79
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:01,477
Because I couldn't.

80
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,611
My God, Marcus.
The way things have been between us...

81
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,743
...you're the last person in the world
I could turn to.

82
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,712
I was hoping the symptoms
would go away.

83
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:15,486
They are not gonna go away
if it's what Dad had.

84
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,163
Why don't I take him back with me
to Wisconsin? We'll do a CAT scan.

85
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,526
I'll have him checked and I'll call you.

86
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:01,872
Your rear wheel's not true.

87
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,067
It's better than the front one.

88
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:07,401
Got a spoke wrench?

89
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,846
Yes.

90
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,918
Got to take care of your equipment, Davie.

91
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,122
I heard you dropped out of pre-med.

92
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,285
I've dropped out of pre-law, too.

93
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,329
So what are you studying now?

94
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,227
I have a double major.

95
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,858
Eastern philosophy and cowboy movies.

96
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:33,669
The Yin, the Yang and the bang-bang.

97
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,897
Think we can get serious for a while?

98
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:40,269
Marcus, what're you trying to do,
be a one-minute brother?

99
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:44,406
After a year and a half of phony
phone calls, you finally show up here.

100
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,109
You're late for dinner and now...

101
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,718
Now you want to hassle me.

102
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:55,859
If you're still concerned,
you can hassle me in the morning.

103
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,293
I have to get back to Madison tomorrow.

104
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,890
Why the hell did you bother coming then?

105
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,693
There.

106
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,735
Why don't you come with me?

107
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:12,365
Bring your bike. We'll ride around.

108
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,508
Just the two of us. How about it?

109
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,411
I would love to. I just...

110
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:20,114
I shouldn't leave Mom alone.

111
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:22,277
Mom thinks it's a pretty good idea.

112
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:23,445
What? With you?

113
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,890
- Ask her yourself.
- I will.

114
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,828
'Cause either you drugged her senseless
or you'll be up for the Nobel Peace Prize.

115
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:34,287
Mom?

116
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:59,549
<i>Mom says you've been riding
the bike a lot.</i>

117
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:02,218
<i>Yeah, a little bit, 30, 40 miles a day.</i>

118
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,424
- Ever done any racing?
- Yeah.

119
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,028
- Really?
- Well, not really.

120
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:10,830
I go on these long rides by myself
and I sort of pretend I'm in a race.

121
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,693
I'm trying to get away
and the pack's chasing me...

122
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:17,138
...and then when they get me,
we sprint, you know.

123
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,235
It makes the miles go faster.
Keeps my mind off of things.

124
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,241
Do you ever race against me?

125
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,613
Yeah. We had a good one last week.

126
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,151
We did?

127
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,584
- How did I do?
- I nipped you at the finish line.

128
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:33,455
That's bullshit.

129
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,788
Are you gonna try out
for the Olympics again?

130
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,788
No. I'm getting a little too old for that.

131
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,558
At least you made the team once.

132
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:42,098
Really? That's funny.

133
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,724
I thought I was an alternate.

134
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,429
- Well, it's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

135
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:49,234
- You could've...
- No more "could've." I didn't.

136
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,610
There are decisive moments in bike racing.

137
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:03,953
When the moment came, I gave up.

138
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:38,182
Just set it anywhere.

139
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,852
- Want something to eat?
- No, I'm just sleepy.

140
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:46,623
If you do, the fridge is full.

141
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,099
- You like this sofa?
- Yeah.

142
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:54,328
Good.

143
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:55,872
It's all yours.

144
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:00,538
This really doesn't look like
a doctor's house.

145
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,672
Whenever the newspapers wrote
about "bombed-out Beirut"...

146
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,218
...this is what I imagined it looked like.

147
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:16,024
Oh, Sarah, this is David.

148
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,251
Davie, Sarah.

149
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,861
Nice to meet you.

150
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:22,923
"Bombed-out Beirut," eh?

151
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:32,642
If you hear strange noises
coming from the bedroom, don't worry.

152
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:37,611
It's just Sarah and I in the grips
of a wild sexual frenzy.

153
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,473
Yeah, sure.

154
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,142
You think he's joking?

155
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,749
No, ma'am.

156
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:48,023
You sleep tight.

157
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,292
Good night, Dave.

158
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,454
Where are you going to ride?

159
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,761
I thought we'd do a few sprints with Eddy.

160
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,166
Be careful, David.
Eddy's a real son of a bitch.

161
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:41,999
- See you guys later.
- See you.

162
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,062
Bye-bye.

163
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,168
Who's Eddy?

164
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,402
Sarah's right. He's a real son of a bitch.

165
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,505
Then why are we going to ride with him?

166
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:54,517
He's a good sprinter
and I need to work on my sprint.

167
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,382
I got a big race coming up.

168
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,657
I'm not in yet.

169
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,598
Good morning, Denis.

170
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:15,571
Good morning, Sarah. How are you?

171
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,301
- Fine. And you?
- Fine.

172
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,740
Want some juice?

173
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,945
Marcus came back last night.

174
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,538
I thought he'd be gone for a few days.
What happened?

175
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,584
It's his brother, David.
You know the family history.

176
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:28,676
Yeah?

177
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,480
There's a chance his brother
might have it now.

178
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:32,852
Oh, Christ.

179
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,817
That family's got a curse on it, hasn't it?

180
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:41,131
Sarah's Apache? She's really Apache?

181
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:44,462
Yes, among other things.
She's also Black, Scotch-lrish, Chinese.

182
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:47,800
I've met all of those before,
but I've never met an Apache.

183
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,609
Where does this guy Eddy live anyway?
Minnesota?

184
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,972
No. Right up there in this house.

185
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:58,847
Hey, Eddy!

186
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:01,481
Are you coming?

187
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,747
Aren't we going to wait?

188
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,121
He'll catch us.

189
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:12,521
Here he comes.

190
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:14,591
That's Eddy?

191
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:15,921
That's him.

192
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,467
You son of a bitch!

193
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:24,572
You better pump.

194
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,146
He likes you.

195
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,425
He hasn't eaten, Dave.

196
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,037
You son of a bitch!

197
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,096
Look out!

198
00:19:59,009 --> 00:19:59,976
Get away.

199
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:01,341
Get away. Go.

200
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,377
Get out of here, dog.

201
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:08,783
He took the shoe.

202
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,085
He ate my shoe.

203
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,349
I got to go back.

204
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:17,453
On second thought,
do you want to go back?

205
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,369
- Wait for me out here.
- All right.

206
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,735
I got someone I want you to meet.

207
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:07,640
I took him for a ride with Eddy today.

208
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,773
He got his ass chewed off.

209
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:12,645
This is Dr. Dennis Conrad,
the founder of this place.

210
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,183
- How are you doing?
- Good. You?

211
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,049
Fine. Let me give you the ten-cent tour.

212
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:21,915
In sports medicine, we try to determine
what the potential of an athlete is...

213
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:25,120
...and then do all we can
to help him or her achieve it.

214
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,687
We analyze, theorize, proselytize...

215
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,532
...sometimes we even sympathize...

216
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:34,129
...but we never, never rationalize.

217
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,172
Never.

218
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,474
What do you think of all this?

219
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:39,701
There's our motto:

220
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:42,470
<i>"Res firma mitescere nescit"...</i>

221
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,312
...which roughly translated means:
"Once you've got it up, keep it up."

222
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:48,509
- Right?
- Right.

223
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:56,558
Are you ready for the torture test?
I love to torture guys your age.

224
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:59,619
We just finished a hard ride.
I think he needs a rest. Right?

225
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:00,686
Yes.

226
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:01,788
Maybe tomorrow.

227
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,527
- You free tomorrow?
- No.

228
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,999
Well, maybe...

229
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,538
Tomorrow it is. Nice meeting you, David.

230
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:12,473
I told you about those damn dogs, didn't I?

231
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:15,034
You didn't die yet, so die or do something!

232
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:21,879
Can I ask you something?

233
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,317
Does anyone ever say no to that question?

234
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:25,613
Go ahead.

235
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,354
Can you speak Apache?

236
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:31,561
No. Your mother's half French.
Can you speak French?

237
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,493
No.

238
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,421
I can.

239
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,998
- We're here.
- Hi.

240
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,105
- Dinner ready?
- Just about.

241
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:44,496
Good.

242
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:47,901
This is Leslie. Leslie, David.

243
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:49,479
I saw her.

244
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,408
I saw you today, didn't I?

245
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:53,507
Yes, at the institute. I saw you, too.

246
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,549
Nice to see you again.

247
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:58,784
You, too.

248
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,416
Butter.

249
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:04,657
I never expected Dr. Sommers' place
to look like this.

250
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:07,355
You've never been here before?

251
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:08,898
It's my first time.

252
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,602
I wonder who the occasion is?

253
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,495
Big mistake.

254
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:18,598
Why don't we sit down?
Leslie, take the spot right here.

255
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,443
Davie's taking our famous
torture test tomorrow.

256
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:27,882
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

257
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:31,183
And I have a feeling
you're taking yours tonight, Leslie.

258
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:38,083
Salad. I love salad.

259
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:40,925
Tomatoes.

260
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,329
Great.

261
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:52,174
Dr. Sommers tells me
you're into Eastern philosophy.

262
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:55,137
Yes, I'm sure Dr. Sommers told you that.

263
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,680
When Dr. Sommers tells you
to come to his house...

264
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:00,615
...to meet his brother
who's into Eastern philosophy...

265
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,312
...you really don't have much choice,
do you?

266
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:05,814
You're being very inconsiderate, Davie.

267
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,481
My name is David.

268
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,686
And I'm not being inconsiderate.

269
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,464
- I'd better...
- It's all right.

270
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:18,023
Sit down. Eat your dinner.
Don't mind him.

271
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,769
You don't have to take orders from him.

272
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:23,864
You can tell him to go to hell.
You can tell me to go to hell.

273
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:26,808
- I didn't come here to tell...
- I know how you feel.

274
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:33,347
You seem like a really nice girl.

275
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:38,214
But for once I'd like to meet a girl
who doesn't know my mother or brother.

276
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:39,880
The world's full of them.

277
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,515
You have to leave home first.

278
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,686
That's great. "Dr. Considerate" speaks.

279
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,887
Father dies and you take off the same day.

280
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,426
What was I supposed to do?

281
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:54,130
This isn't the time to bring up
family problems.

282
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:55,228
I'd better...

283
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:58,468
It's all right, Leslie.
I'm not ashamed of my family.

284
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:02,671
You probably have a mother. You wouldn't
turn your back on her in a crisis.

285
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:04,543
She created the goddamn crisis.

286
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,810
I don't care who created it!

287
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:16,221
She was crazy about you, Marcus.

288
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:19,157
Bragging about her brilliant son.
Everything you did.

289
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,493
I know. Everything I did was great.

290
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:24,295
When I lost, she convinced me
I could've won.

291
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,801
That there's no difference.

292
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:28,531
I don't think that's so terrible.
Do you, Leslie?

293
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:29,902
I think it's terrible.

294
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,838
Many people would call it support.

295
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:35,072
When Dad needed support
when he was dying, where was she?

296
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,210
Where the hell was she?

297
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:40,978
You know where she was.
She was right there in the apartment.

298
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,609
Hiding out in the guest room.

299
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:45,678
She fell apart, okay? People do!

300
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,587
Goddamn it! You were there!

301
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,416
You didn't fall apart.

302
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:55,627
You heard him calling for her at night.
I had to plead with her to go to him.

303
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:59,863
Tell me, Dr. Sommers, when people aren't
as strong as you'd like them to be...

304
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:03,065
...and they let you down,
have you ever considered forgiving them?

305
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:17,213
I'm sorry, Leslie.

306
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,982
Perfect. Just perfect.

307
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:24,355
It's okay.

308
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:27,663
- I'll take you home.
- I brought her, I'll take her.

309
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:30,427
This whole thing was my idea!
I'll take her home.

310
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,868
No, thank you. I'll take myself home.

311
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:37,135
I've got to call my mother.

312
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:09,032
You never answered my question.

313
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:11,438
I don't have to answer your damn question.

314
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:15,000
I've considered forgiving Mother
many times. I almost did many times.

315
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:16,579
"Almost" isn't good enough.

316
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,274
Why the hell not?

317
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:22,645
"Almost" is good enough for everything
else in this family, isn't it, Davie?

318
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,311
Excuse me, David.

319
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:40,197
It's all computerized.

320
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:43,602
The speed will increase.
The grade will increase.

321
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,736
You'll go into oxygen debt.

322
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:48,801
If you last long enough,
you'll go into oxygen bankruptcy.

323
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,346
Don't worry about it.

324
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:53,110
I just want to go one second longer
than Marcus.

325
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,116
You do? Marcus holds the institute record
with 25 minutes...

326
00:27:58,322 --> 00:27:59,880
...and 14 seconds.

327
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,184
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

328
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,520
There's your clock.

329
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:03,958
Have a good trip.

330
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,635
This is the torture test?

331
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,299
He's going for 25.

332
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,581
Come on, David!

333
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,204
Come on, David. Keep it up!

334
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:13,483
Keep it up! Keep it up!

335
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,421
Come on, David! Push harder!

336
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,629
Come on, David! Keep it up!

337
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:10,040
Turn it off.

338
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,983
<i>It's like Star Wars down here.</i>

339
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,289
Warp speed.

340
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,036
I can't believe you're still planning
to go to Colorado.

341
00:33:24,114 --> 00:33:28,107
I'll go if David wants to go with me.
He's always wanted to see the West.

342
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:30,478
- You've got to tell him.
- I can't.

343
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:35,083
Not now.

344
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,926
Not after what he did today.
I don't want to ruin it for him.

345
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,830
I love him too much for that.

346
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:43,597
I understand.

347
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,895
I got to run, buddy.

348
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:48,431
Wait up, I'll walk out with you.

349
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:14,923
No big deal.

350
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:39,545
What are you doing out here?

351
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,215
I just needed some fresh air.

352
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,919
I've been looking all over the place for you.

353
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:47,855
- Want to hear the results?
- I know the results.

354
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:49,965
You do? Who told you?

355
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:51,625
Nobody has to tell me.

356
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,030
I'm fine, right?

357
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,139
Physically, you're fine.

358
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,672
You have the cardiovascular system
of King Kong's first cousin.

359
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,440
Just emotionally, you're a mess.

360
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:07,440
Frankly, anybody who wastes
the potential you've got pisses me off.

361
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:09,178
Well, it pisses me off, too.

362
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:13,220
- What are you going to do about it?
- I don't know.

363
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:20,424
Shinto philosophy teaches you
to accept life as a seasonal occupation.

364
00:35:20,563 --> 00:35:22,861
Sounds like bull Shinto to me.

365
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,635
I burned your ass on the treadmill.

366
00:35:26,703 --> 00:35:29,001
Sure, you also beat my SAT scores.

367
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:32,132
You're great at taking tests
every few years.

368
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:38,939
Here's the thing, Shinto.

369
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,275
There's this bike race in Colorado...

370
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:44,945
The Hell of the West.

371
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:50,019
- It's the last time I'll race in it and I'd like...
- I'd love to.

372
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,820
- What?
- Race.

373
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:54,653
Give me a break.
I'm trying to talk you into it.

374
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:57,859
I had a speech prepared
about how we've never raced together...

375
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:01,165
...and this might be our last chance,
the Sommers team...

376
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,196
- There's just one thing.
- What?

377
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,242
I'm not shaving my legs.

378
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,143
We'll talk about it.

379
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:17,014
I think we should give Mom a call.
What do you think?

380
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:19,455
Okay.

381
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,497
Marcus? How is he?

382
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,562
<i>- He's just fine.
- He is?</i>

383
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:31,964
Clean as a whistle.

384
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:33,161
Oh, God!

385
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:37,470
Oh, darling.

386
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,633
Enough already.
You're supposed to be celebrating.

387
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:44,009
Oh, darling, I am celebrating.

388
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:48,406
It's just that I have lived with this
for so long and he's all I've got.

389
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,345
I thought you had two sons.

390
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:53,922
Marcus, of course I do.

391
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:58,493
<i>That's not what I was going to say.
Marcus, come on.</i>

392
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,994
That's all right.

393
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:03,063
This whole conversation is probably not
what I meant to say.

394
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,161
What does that mean?

395
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,260
Davie's all right, isn't he?

396
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:10,966
Davie's just fine. He sends his love.

397
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:13,266
I've got to go.

398
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:16,437
Marcus, I want you to know...
Please understand, I love...

399
00:37:16,513 --> 00:37:17,980
I've got to go.

400
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,181
'Bye.

401
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:25,718
How's Mom?

402
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:28,518
- She's fine.
- You told her I was okay, right?

403
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:30,793
Is this a fish burger in here?

404
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:34,430
No. I told her you got hit by a bus.
What do you think I told her?

405
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:36,965
- I want to show you something.
- Where are we going?

406
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,171
Remember this?

407
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,370
This is the first of three stages in this race.

408
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:50,139
The field gets cut in half here.
If you don't finish in the top half...

409
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:51,708
...you're out.

410
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,887
- Pretty fast, huh?
- Yeah.

411
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:05,016
Well, it gets faster.

412
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:08,325
Coming in the back,
some guys will hit 60 miles an hour.

413
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:11,494
It can get really dangerous.

414
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:16,064
There's me and Muzzin going at it.

415
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,671
That's the guy on the poster in the kitchen.

416
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:24,710
That's Barry Muzzin.
He was my teammate. My best friend.

417
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:30,545
He's affectionately known
as "the Cannibal."

418
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,780
You know him?

419
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,982
Yes. I was married to him.

420
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,285
Did you see that?

421
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,349
See what?

422
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:48,860
Right there.

423
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,040
Did you see that? The race is over.

424
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:55,941
I quit.

425
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:57,680
You didn't.

426
00:38:57,747 --> 00:39:01,183
Shows you how good I am at it.
Nobody can even tell anymore.

427
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:08,555
That's what it looks like when you win.

428
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:15,193
This is what it sounds like.

429
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,001
Two points.

430
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,505
Good shot.

431
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,914
I'm starved. What have you got?

432
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:19,978
- Give her one of these. They're great.
- Here, Beck.

433
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,655
I'm tired of granola and sesame seeds.

434
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:27,795
Sesame seeds are great. Pure protein
and energy. It's just what you need.

435
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:31,698
I need a chocolate shake and french fries.
And a Quarter Pounder with cheese.

436
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:33,531
Becky, that's flesh.

437
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:36,502
Have you ever looked in a cow's eyes
when it's killed?

438
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:39,541
You're eating fear, Becky.
You're becoming one with fear.

439
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:41,770
We were going to live off the land.

440
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:46,474
I don't see how eating generic nuts
from the supermarket is living off the land.

441
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:47,982
We made a vow.

442
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:52,378
Look into the crystal light
and release meat.

443
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:56,354
I can't believe this.

444
00:41:58,061 --> 00:41:59,289
What the hell's that?

445
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,421
The Pony Express?

446
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,072
<i>I was wondering...</i>

447
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,084
<i>If Dad were alive today...</i>

448
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,176
<i>Yeah?</i>

449
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,020
Well, they didn't have any cure
for a berry aneurysm two years ago...

450
00:42:29,158 --> 00:42:31,683
- I was wondering...
- They still don't.

451
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:36,229
If there's a weak blood vessel
and it's located deep inside the brain...

452
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:40,429
...you can't get to it without destroying
the patient's vital brain functions.

453
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:43,734
Meaning the patient could become
a chef's salad.

454
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,506
It's like a heart attack of the head.

455
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:51,741
Even if you're in the best shape,
it can still hit you right out of the blue.

456
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:56,749
The thing is, you know,
you read those stories...

457
00:42:57,386 --> 00:43:01,345
Some bald guy grows hair again.
Now he needs a haircut once a week.

458
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:05,049
People doing things through willpower.
What do you think of that stuff?

459
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:21,003
Good night.

460
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:23,010
Good night, David.

461
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,625
I always wanted to do that.

462
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,581
Don't forget the napkins.

463
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:11,719
Can I take your order, please?

464
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:16,424
I'd like a Quarter Pounder,
large fries and a chocolate shake, please.

465
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:20,702
It'll be a minute for your Quarter Pounder.
How about a Big Mac?

466
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,668
Okay.

467
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:24,037
Wait. No.

468
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:27,105
I'll wait.

469
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,328
Where are you headed?

470
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:54,661
California maybe.

471
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:58,003
- You?
- Colorado.

472
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,302
Where are your friends?

473
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:04,812
It didn't work out. I split.

474
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:09,918
It isn't right, Marcus.

475
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:11,015
What?

476
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:13,647
You should tell him the truth, that's what.

477
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:17,592
We wouldn't be making this trip
if he knew the truth.

478
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,221
- I think you underestimate him.
- Do you mind? He's my brother!

479
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,995
Maybe I know some things about him
you don't.

480
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:30,129
Maybe so, but don't use
that tone of voice with me.

481
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:37,406
- You never heard of bike racing?
- No. Is that what you were doing today?

482
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,711
No, that? We were just training
for this big race in Colorado.

483
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:44,776
We'll ride to the top of the Rockies
and back. It's very dangerous stuff.

484
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:48,847
One wrong move and you're just
another statistic in the Hell of the West.

485
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,820
I hope you come out of it alive.

486
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:54,960
Good luck.

487
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:56,357
You, too.

488
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,436
Would you like a ride?

489
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,768
Where, on your handlebars?

490
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:13,906
Marcus, look.

491
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:15,449
How fast do you go?

492
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,086
Sixty. Sometimes faster.

493
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:23,924
Hope she's the quiet type.

494
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:26,985
Not a chance. She even walks loudly.

495
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:31,990
What did she do to her hair? What is that?

496
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,430
This is Becky Chandler.

497
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,467
Becky, this is my brother, Marcus.

498
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:38,530
- This is Sarah.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

499
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,006
How's your finger?

500
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:43,501
Sorry about that.

501
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:47,070
Thanks for the ride. Hell of the West, huh?
Sounds great.

502
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:10,702
How far are you planning to go with us?

503
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,207
Tell you what, Doc.
I'll go pretty far if it feels good.

504
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:18,004
All right.

505
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:54,340
Ready? I'll get you on a machine
and have you buffed up in no time.

506
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:57,012
I don't like this place. It smells bad.

507
00:47:57,086 --> 00:48:00,351
That's sweat, Randolph.
And it does not smell bad.

508
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:03,089
Mama said I didn't have to do this.

509
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:05,826
You're in Daddy's sinister clutches now.

510
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:09,887
And Daddy wants to see his beloved son
Randolph sweat his ass off.

511
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:11,694
<i>Dr. Conrad, Line 3.</i>

512
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,667
I'll put you on this bike.

513
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,199
Use this one, Randolph.

514
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:20,132
Hello?

515
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,106
Who is this, please?

516
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,179
How do you do?

517
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:30,045
It's just that I called his house last night
and then again this morning...

518
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,212
...and no one answered, so...

519
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:35,289
...being a hysterical person,
I started to worry.

520
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:37,689
There's nothing to worry about,
Mrs. Sommers.

521
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,662
The three of them went on a camping trip.
Marcus, David and Sarah.

522
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:43,324
Who is Sarah?

523
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:45,333
<i>The girl he lives with.</i>

524
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,933
I wanted to tell him something...

525
00:48:50,906 --> 00:48:52,066
<i>... but it can wait.</i>

526
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,971
Come on, Randolph. Move it.

527
00:48:57,346 --> 00:48:59,473
I'll have him call you when he gets back.

528
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:02,613
You can go faster than that, damn it.

529
00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:05,813
It was nice "meeting you," Mrs. Sommers.

530
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:11,959
You're supposed to be picking a sport.
So, pick a sport.

531
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:13,218
I like bowling.

532
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:18,255
Bowling? Bowling is not a sport.
Bowling is just a big video game.

533
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:20,094
Don't get all defrosted, Dad.

534
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:21,861
Don't do what?

535
00:49:21,937 --> 00:49:24,269
You heard me. Don't get all defrosted.

536
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,205
How does your mother put up with you?

537
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:30,439
Now, look, Dad. The way I see it,
there are no black bowlers.

538
00:49:31,113 --> 00:49:34,947
Basketball, yes. Football, yes.
Golf, we got one guy.

539
00:49:35,751 --> 00:49:38,549
But bowling, we got zip. Think about it.

540
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:44,022
Boy, bring your ass over here.

541
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:48,786
We stayed in this same place
two years ago. Remember?

542
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:51,363
- What do you think?
- I think you better remember.

543
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:54,664
I think you ought to use
a different tone of voice with me.

544
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:57,205
It's just the way my parents are.
They're too nice.

545
00:49:57,306 --> 00:50:00,070
I bring a guy home
and they fall in love with him.

546
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:03,737
So there were three guys I broke up with,
hanging around my house...

547
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:07,304
...watching TV with my dad,
eating my mom's cookies...

548
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,248
So I freaked out.

549
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:12,511
That's what I do.
When in doubt, I freak out.

550
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,316
You must fall in love easily. Three guys?

551
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:17,916
Oh, that wasn't love.

552
00:50:18,694 --> 00:50:20,184
Not love love.

553
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,695
I knew it was going to be like that.

554
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,194
I think she's kind of nice.

555
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:28,463
What does it say on that T-shirt?

556
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:33,240
- That's Latin.
- Latin? What does it say?

557
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,407
"Once you've got it up, keep it up."

558
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:42,612
All right! Where can I get one?

559
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:57,532
- Let's do it like they do it in the Olympics.
- How do they do it?

560
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,828
You know, exchange T-shirts.

561
00:51:08,677 --> 00:51:09,837
What are you doing?

562
00:51:10,245 --> 00:51:13,612
If it's the Olympics,
you have to play the national anthem.

563
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:17,909
Only if you win.

564
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:21,880
Excuse me. You're not going to see that.

565
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,134
So, about that tone of voice...

566
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:00,120
<i>What's going on?</i>

567
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:01,219
Shake and break.

568
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:02,263
What's that?

569
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:06,061
If you're making a solo breakaway
and you've got a wheel sucker hangin' on...

570
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:08,695
...you shake and break to shake him off.

571
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,938
<i>Wheel sucker? What's a wheel sucker?</i>

572
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,837
<i>Someone who drafts all the time...</i>

573
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:15,206
...and won't take his turn up front.

574
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:23,278
Hey, you wheel sucker!

575
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:24,613
Get up there!

576
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:33,692
You want to get them?

577
00:53:06,328 --> 00:53:08,057
We got them! We got them!

578
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:23,642
Watch this, Dave.

579
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,445
Give it a race, guys.

580
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:28,845
You boys ought to get yourselves a horse.

581
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:40,852
Oldest trick in the book, Dave.

582
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:53,104
That was great.

583
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:02,012
Second oldest trick in the book.

584
00:54:03,218 --> 00:54:04,685
Look at those buns.

585
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:12,554
<i>What is that?</i>

586
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:14,928
<i>Looks like we've got a flat.</i>

587
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,318
We've got to stop.

588
00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:51,391
It's okay.

589
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:52,932
Sarah!

590
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:53,933
Jerome!

591
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:56,334
- Look at you.
- How are you doing?

592
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,931
- It's good to see you.
- It's good seeing you.

593
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:04,172
I said to Jerome, "Jerome,
that sure looks like Marcus's van."

594
00:55:04,913 --> 00:55:06,505
Our old team van.

595
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:10,083
- Hello, Geronimo.
- Hello, Muzzin.

596
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,709
Where is he?

597
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,344
Riding.

598
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:18,489
He's great when it comes to training,
but what's he like in the clutch?

599
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,460
You said you wouldn't start nothing.

600
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:23,293
You know, Jerome,
women are a real mystery.

601
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:27,000
In bike racing, the best man always wins.

602
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:31,973
But what is it about some women that
makes them fall for quitters like Marcus?

603
00:55:32,307 --> 00:55:34,241
You know the bigger mystery, Jerome...

604
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:38,871
...is what makes "some" women ever fall
for a rabid dog like you, Muzzin.

605
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:44,047
Hey, come on, you two. Cut it out.

606
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,518
You tell him, Sarah.

607
00:55:49,157 --> 00:55:50,556
He knows I'll win.

608
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:54,460
But you tell him that I'll make him bleed
before I beat him.

609
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,157
I don't deliver messages.
Sometimes I don't even hear them.

610
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:01,264
He'll quit.

611
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:07,198
I'll make sure of that.
I'll make him die in the mountains.

612
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:13,613
Jerome, I consider you a friend.

613
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,950
Would you take this damn Cannibal
out of my face before I kill him?

614
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:22,587
I'm Jerome. You're a damn Cannibal.
That's a big rock.

615
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:25,822
Let's get out of here.
We got a race to win.

616
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:30,954
'Bye, Sarah.

617
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:37,862
Well, I'll be a Fig Newton!
I'm standing next to a lady with a past.

618
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:46,705
<i>Then Jerome says:</i>

619
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,018
"I'm Jerome.
You're the goddamn Cannibal...

620
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:53,611
"...and this is a big rock." So they left.

621
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:57,387
Sarah was so tough. So cool.
You missed it all.

622
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:00,921
I'm keeping this rock.

623
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,624
I'm taking this rock to college.

624
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:36,928
<i>We're seven minutes to the start...</i>

625
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:39,991
<i>... of the famous Morgul Bismarck stage
of the Hell of the West.</i>

626
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:42,866
<i>We're getting the race caravan organized
and ready to begin.</i>

627
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:44,735
<i>Here come some of the press people.</i>

628
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:48,537
<i>More vehicles coming through.
Team cars, let's keep the roadway clear.</i>

629
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:53,172
<i>Mexico, Great Britain, Italy,
Norway team cars coming through.</i>

630
00:57:53,248 --> 00:57:56,547
<i>Press people, please report
to your vehicles immediately.</i>

631
00:57:58,286 --> 00:58:00,618
<i>We'd like to introduce to you
some of the riders...</i>

632
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:05,353
<i>... who will participate in today's event,
beginning with the U.S. National Team.</i>

633
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:12,292
<i>And ladies and gentlemen,
the Soviet National Team...</i>

634
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:15,996
<i>... led by the defending Olympic champion,
Sergei Belov.</i>

635
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,774
<i>And finally, ladies and gentlemen,
the 7-Eleven team...</i>

636
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:25,870
<i>... led by our own 1980 Olympian and
winner of the Hell of the West last year...</i>

637
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:28,108
<i>... Barry "the Cannibal" Muzzin.</i>

638
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:40,188
Shake that, Belov.

639
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:48,102
<i>And now, our honorary starter for today's
Hell of the West, Stage No. 1...</i>

640
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:52,796
<i>... ladies and gentlemen, the greatest
racing cyclist in the history of the sport...</i>

641
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:54,637
<i>... Mr. Eddie Merckx.</i>

642
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:00,643
<i>We will be starting
on the sound of the pistol.</i>

643
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:02,249
<i>Riders, ready?</i>

644
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:04,751
<i>Timers, ready?</i>

645
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:13,559
<i>We're under way,
the Hell of the West, Stage No. 1.</i>

646
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,723
<i>Let's hear it for a big sendoff.</i>

647
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,601
<i>The Hell of the West, Stage No. 1.
We are under way.</i>

648
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:31,902
<i>This first circuit of the Hell of the West
is the dreaded Morgul Bismarck.</i>

649
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,547
<i>It's a world championship court
which offers little shade...</i>

650
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,175
<i>... steep hills, fast descents...</i>

651
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,257
<i>... and the gut-wrenching climb to the finish
that sits here, atop the devastating Wall.</i>

652
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:47,156
<i>Riders who have raced here before
seldom look forward to coming back.</i>

653
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:51,426
<i>And newcomers to a race of this stature,
unused to riding in a large pack...</i>

654
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:53,325
<i>... will soon find out why.</i>

655
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:57,201
<i>This is a race of seven laps,
totaling 91 miles.</i>

656
00:59:57,372 --> 00:59:59,602
<i>A grueling test for any rider.</i>

657
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:01,574
Sommers, look out!

658
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:03,300
Watch your line!

659
01:00:07,582 --> 01:00:09,573
Move over, Sommers! Move over!

660
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:24,058
Here we go, Dave.

661
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:27,296
Enough of this Sunday stroll.

662
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,432
Let's hurt a little bit.

663
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,991
10-4. We are rolling in
an ambulance right now.

664
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,072
<i>Three laps down and four to go.</i>

665
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:13,699
<i>Four to go, four laps yet to go.</i>

666
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:17,871
<i>Barry Muzzin in the 7-Eleven team
followed closely by the Soviet team...</i>

667
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:20,072
<i>... and Marcus Sommers of ShaverSport.</i>

668
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:24,414
<i>Each lap yet to come on this grueling
course will take its toll on the riders.</i>

669
01:02:24,552 --> 01:02:27,248
<i>Only the toughest will be
among the first 48...</i>

670
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:31,416
<i>... who will go on to contest Stages 2 and 3
of the Hell of the West.</i>

671
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:40,635
Shit!

672
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:42,163
Tough break, Marcus!

673
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:45,364
Marcus has got a flat. Pull up. Quick.

674
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,669
Okay, pull up. Slow up. Come on.

675
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,174
Come on, Sarah.

676
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:00,087
Come on, baby, they're leaving us behind.

677
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:02,620
Come on, honey.

678
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:07,595
You got it. Good. Good girl. Now, push.

679
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,419
Push.

680
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:11,587
Look.

681
01:03:17,105 --> 01:03:18,504
Move it! Move it!

682
01:03:18,973 --> 01:03:20,634
Come on! Pick it up!

683
01:03:23,078 --> 01:03:26,275
You want back in this race!
Pick it up! Come on!

684
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:29,340
<i>One lap to go! Bell lap coming up.</i>

685
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,885
<i>One lap to go! One lap to go!</i>

686
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,749
Here we are!

687
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:44,161
Here you go!

688
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:46,699
Marcus, water! You need this.

689
01:03:54,442 --> 01:03:55,704
Water! Water!

690
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:59,406
You're 52, David. You've got to move up.
You've got to move up!

691
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:09,146
<i>The caravan is in sight,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

692
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:12,159
<i>They are around the corner,
at the bottom of the Wall.</i>

693
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:13,385
<i>Here they come.</i>

694
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:17,454
<i>And in a remarkable recovery,
Marcus Sommers has regained position...</i>

695
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:22,060
<i>... near the front of the lead group
after a flat tire way out on the course.</i>

696
01:04:27,442 --> 01:04:31,378
<i>Muzzin, Sommers and the Soviet, Belov,
fighting it out as they come up the Wall.</i>

697
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:34,411
<i>A real neck-and-neck battle
as they come through.</i>

698
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,552
<i>It will be a three-way sprint for the first.</i>

699
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:49,119
<i>The Americans, Sommers and Muzzin,
and the Soviet, Belov.</i>

700
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:53,192
<i>Right now it's Muzzin in front,
Sommers, second.</i>

701
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,567
<i>Sergei Belov of the Soviet team
charging up in third.</i>

702
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,012
<i>And it's Marcus Sommers, the winner!</i>

703
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:13,982
<i>Muzzin, second. Sergei Belov, third place.</i>

704
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,052
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a tremendous finish!</i>

705
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:21,788
<i>Sommers, Muzzin and the Soviet, Belov.</i>

706
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:43,548
<i>Fourteen, 15, 16 riders across the line.</i>

707
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:48,045
<i>The winners are already in.
We're counting the last riders to qualify.</i>

708
01:05:48,223 --> 01:05:52,387
<i>Only the first 48 finishers today
will be able to race tomorrow.</i>

709
01:05:54,562 --> 01:05:56,826
- Where's David? How far back?
- I don't know.

710
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:02,630
<i>Only three more riders will stay
in the race.</i>

711
01:06:03,805 --> 01:06:06,365
<i>The rest will have to wait until next year.</i>

712
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:12,769
- Is that him?
- It is.

713
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:26,692
<i>With the field closing in fast behind them...</i>

714
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,491
<i>... two riders, the final two
that will qualify...</i>

715
01:06:29,564 --> 01:06:32,260
<i>... and the field is eating them up
coming up the Wall.</i>

716
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:37,604
<i>Struggling up the Wall for the final time
in this grueling Hell of the West.</i>

717
01:06:37,672 --> 01:06:39,105
<i>And they're down!</i>

718
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:46,745
<i>One rider is back up.
He's on his bike and he's going to finish.</i>

719
01:06:58,126 --> 01:06:59,115
Run with it!

720
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:01,228
Get going! Pick it up!

721
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,371
- Can he do that?
- I don't know.

722
01:07:10,538 --> 01:07:11,630
That's it. Run!

723
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:18,779
Come on, David! A little more!

724
01:07:26,888 --> 01:07:32,758
<i>And in a remarkable finish, David Sommers
crosses the line 48, carrying his bicycle.</i>

725
01:07:33,328 --> 01:07:35,319
- Can he do that?
- Is that legal?

726
01:07:35,797 --> 01:07:37,424
I think I screwed up.

727
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:40,831
It's okay.

728
01:07:40,902 --> 01:07:42,767
<i>It's official, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

729
01:07:42,837 --> 01:07:46,329
<i>... David Sommers becomes the 48th
and final qualifier...</i>

730
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:49,274
<i>... to ride Stages 2 and 3
of the Hell of the West.</i>

731
01:07:51,245 --> 01:07:53,873
- Two more stages.
- It was a real close race, wasn't it?

732
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:54,846
No shit!

733
01:07:55,116 --> 01:07:58,108
<i>Tell us what it was like
to have ridden 90 miles.</i>

734
01:07:58,186 --> 01:08:02,213
It's a big day for American cycling to have
two Americans beat an Olympic champ.

735
01:08:02,357 --> 01:08:04,086
You must feel some pride?

736
01:08:04,525 --> 01:08:06,789
- Come on, walk it off.
- I'm all right.

737
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:13,327
I'm not riding for America, lady.
I tried riding for America.

738
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:17,301
I spent four years working at shitty jobs
so I could train...

739
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:21,066
...and make the Olympic team
and ride for America and look at me.

740
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:24,743
Then some fat-asses in Washington
started having opinions.

741
01:08:24,812 --> 01:08:27,076
The Olympic Committee started
having opinions.

742
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:30,948
You, you bitch, I know you.
You started writing your opinions.

743
01:08:31,452 --> 01:08:33,215
So we boycott the Olympics.

744
01:08:33,388 --> 01:08:36,221
I was in the best shape of my life
in the summer of 1980...

745
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,087
...and I got beat by opinions.

746
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,559
Is that why you're boycotting
the victory ceremony?

747
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:42,858
What victory? There's two stages left.

748
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:44,420
Still, the fact remains...

749
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:48,663
Bitch, you wouldn't know a fact
if it banged you all night long.

750
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:53,969
<i>In first place, the leader of
the ShaverSport team, Marcus Sommers.</i>

751
01:09:19,734 --> 01:09:21,201
<i>Okay. I got one.</i>

752
01:09:21,302 --> 01:09:23,202
<i>I got one. It's about David.</i>

753
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,368
David was only 10 at the time.

754
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:31,808
He comes into my bedroom
looking real serious.

755
01:09:32,313 --> 01:09:35,680
Remember this? He wants to know
what's oral sex.

756
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,813
Nobody wants to hear this.

757
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,310
Yes, I want to hear it. Go on.

758
01:09:41,656 --> 01:09:44,181
You say things about me,
I can say things about you.

759
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:47,193
So he says, "What's oral sex?" I tell him:

760
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,422
"Oral sex is the opposite of written sex.

761
01:09:49,497 --> 01:09:53,297
"If you read about it, it's written sex.
If you talk about it, it's..."

762
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:54,925
Oral sex!

763
01:09:58,139 --> 01:10:00,630
Three weeks later,
he goes to a birthday party...

764
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,972
...up on the third floor for Sheila Fletcher.

765
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:04,443
Who's Sheila Fletcher?

766
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:06,877
Comes back in 15 minutes.

767
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,650
Mom and Dad want to know
why he came back so quickly.

768
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:12,549
"Because", he said, "it was boring.

769
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,418
"Everybody was just standing around
having oral sex."

770
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,920
You got to know my mom.
She flew out of the apartment.

771
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:51,220
- Is your name there?
- Yeah, somewhere.

772
01:10:52,393 --> 01:10:53,553
- David!
- What?

773
01:10:53,628 --> 01:10:57,086
You're only two minutes and 11 seconds
behind in the standings.

774
01:10:57,265 --> 01:10:58,857
- Is that all?
- That's good.

775
01:10:58,933 --> 01:11:01,026
Marcus, how many rooms for the leader?

776
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:02,626
One for us, Tom.

777
01:11:03,271 --> 01:11:04,932
David, how many rooms do you need?

778
01:11:05,006 --> 01:11:05,995
Two.

779
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:17,714
And one for us.

780
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,658
- How is your leg?
- It's fine.

781
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,860
Remember, we are racing tomorrow.

782
01:11:32,266 --> 01:11:33,665
See you then.

783
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:37,197
We are going to win.

784
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:45,941
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

785
01:12:15,576 --> 01:12:18,204
You know,
I think this whole thing was destiny.

786
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,303
What whole thing?

787
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,940
You and me. This trip. Everything.

788
01:12:22,617 --> 01:12:24,744
I mean, there I was at McDonald's.

789
01:12:25,453 --> 01:12:27,444
And I wanted a Quarter Pounder.

790
01:12:28,022 --> 01:12:30,217
The girl goes, "We're out.

791
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,255
"You'll have to wait.
Do you want a Big Mac?"

792
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:39,264
Just think. If I hadn't waited
for that Quarter Pounder...

793
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,568
...I wouldn't be here with you.

794
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:51,601
That's destiny.

795
01:12:56,884 --> 01:13:00,251
There's really something
you should know about me, Becky.

796
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:05,324
You don't have a girl back home, do you?

797
01:13:05,626 --> 01:13:06,490
No.

798
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:10,489
- You're not gay, are you?
- No. Hell, no. It's just the opposite.

799
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:13,059
Then what?

800
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:16,427
I probably shouldn't be telling you this...

801
01:13:18,806 --> 01:13:20,239
I think I'm going to die.

802
01:13:26,847 --> 01:13:28,838
Thank God I'm not the only one.

803
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,818
I think I'm going to die too
if we don't do something really quick.

804
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:37,424
I'll be right back.

805
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:40,418
Stay right here. Promise?

806
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:13,817
They're playing our song.

807
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,906
- David, are you all right?
- It's just my knee.

808
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:31,035
We don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

809
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:32,409
Yes, we do.

810
01:15:36,844 --> 01:15:38,539
Where are you going?

811
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:41,947
I want to go over the course with David.

812
01:15:42,616 --> 01:15:46,143
Come back to bed.
The race isn't until noon.

813
01:15:52,259 --> 01:15:54,284
What a beautiful morning.

814
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:02,331
I love you, Marcus, so much.

815
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:35,130
You're out early!

816
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:39,536
Look, they got four of these flags
scattered around the course.

817
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:43,771
<i>Each time you win a sprint to one of them,
you gain 30 seconds on your time.</i>

818
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:46,473
Do you understand?

819
01:16:46,614 --> 01:16:48,275
I'm not an idiot, you know.

820
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:52,181
- I don't want you to ride like an idiot.
- What do you mean?

821
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,220
You're two minutes and 11 seconds down.

822
01:16:55,322 --> 01:16:59,088
If you win all four of these sprints,
you'll be only 11 seconds back.

823
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,688
Because nobody knows you, if you do
something stupid like take off by yourself...

824
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:05,723
...they'll let you go.

825
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:09,566
What's the big deal?
You don't need me. You're winning.

826
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,661
The big deal is we're brothers.

827
01:17:20,514 --> 01:17:21,344
How is he?

828
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:24,282
He won the first stage.
You should've seen him.

829
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:29,653
<i>The son of a bitch told me I couldn't come.
He didn't want me there. He did it, eh?</i>

830
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:31,521
I think it's begun.

831
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:41,433
I don't suppose he'd consider
not racing today.

832
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:46,262
I know he's against it but his mother...

833
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:48,498
<i>Somebody should call her.</i>

834
01:18:08,996 --> 01:18:10,054
Shit.

835
01:18:13,334 --> 01:18:15,461
I had a bitch of a workout, Dad.

836
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:18,895
You okay, Dad?

837
01:18:19,773 --> 01:18:20,637
No.

838
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:24,173
Come on, Dad. Cheer up.
It's not your fault.

839
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:27,340
Every black man can't have a son
who's Julius Erving.

840
01:18:31,318 --> 01:18:32,683
You're soaking wet.

841
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:33,977
I sweat.

842
01:18:34,121 --> 01:18:35,816
Funny, doesn't smell like sweat.

843
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,457
I used a deodorant.

844
01:18:37,858 --> 01:18:40,725
Go take a shower.
I have to make a phone call.

845
01:18:40,794 --> 01:18:41,783
Good.

846
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:43,787
Then can we get something to eat?

847
01:18:43,864 --> 01:18:46,731
Yeah, Randolph,
then we can get something to eat.

848
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:59,269
<i>One look at the lunarscape of the
spectacular Colorado National Monument...</i>

849
01:18:59,346 --> 01:19:03,442
<i>... and you understand why it has come
to be known as "The Tour of the Moon."</i>

850
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:15,050
<i>The view and terrain are like nothing
on earth, with bright red rock formations...</i>

851
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:18,825
<i>... tunnels, numerous sheer cliff drop-offs,
and rapid descents.</i>

852
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:21,225
<i>The race totals 83 miles...</i>

853
01:19:21,402 --> 01:19:25,395
<i>... and in 1984 was won by
America's Olympic Champions...</i>

854
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:28,006
<i>... Tommy Carpenter and Alexi Grewal.</i>

855
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:37,682
Okay, get ready.

856
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:46,723
Do it, David.

857
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:52,261
Okay, here we go.

858
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:53,698
- Oh, God!
- It's the breakaway.

859
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:54,859
David, no!

860
01:19:55,269 --> 01:19:57,134
Goddamn it! It's too early.

861
01:20:00,908 --> 01:20:02,637
No. David, you dumbbell.

862
01:20:10,017 --> 01:20:13,475
Let them go, Tommy. They're nobodies.
They'll die on the hill.

863
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:15,686
Let them go!

864
01:20:29,536 --> 01:20:31,697
<i>Here comes the breakaway group
up the hill.</i>

865
01:20:31,772 --> 01:20:35,765
<i>The first rider past the flag will gain
30 seconds on his time.</i>

866
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,642
<i>There goes No. 7, Ulie, of the Kelly's team,
starting the sprint for the flag.</i>

867
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:41,772
<i>But here comes David Sommers
of ShaverSport.</i>

868
01:20:41,849 --> 01:20:44,579
<i>It looks like these two are both
going for that 30 seconds.</i>

869
01:20:44,651 --> 01:20:45,913
<i>Ulie's in the lead.</i>

870
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:48,044
<i>But Sommers is coming up hard of breath.</i>

871
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:52,855
<i>And it's Sommers who wins that
very valuable 30-second time advantage.</i>

872
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,537
Let's reel them in.

873
01:22:46,673 --> 01:22:49,141
<i>The breakaway group's coming up
to the second flag.</i>

874
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:53,475
<i>David Sommers, who took the first one,
riding very strongly at the front again.</i>

875
01:22:55,282 --> 01:22:58,183
<i>And David Sommers indeed takes
the second time flag.</i>

876
01:22:58,252 --> 01:23:00,982
<i>And it looks like he's going
to keep right on going.</i>

877
01:23:01,088 --> 01:23:03,716
<i>The way the chase group is coming up
hard behind them...</i>

878
01:23:03,924 --> 01:23:07,360
<i>... he's going to need all these time bonuses
that he can take.</i>

879
01:23:08,128 --> 01:23:09,425
We got them.

880
01:23:23,544 --> 01:23:25,842
Where's Sommers?
Where's the other one?

881
01:23:30,651 --> 01:23:32,118
You son of a bitch!

882
01:23:32,386 --> 01:23:34,183
Marcus, I taught you that move.

883
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:36,017
We got us a race, Muzzin.

884
01:23:39,826 --> 01:23:42,124
Tommy, Jerome, come on, let's move it!

885
01:24:53,967 --> 01:24:56,697
Hold your line!
What's the matter with you, man?

886
01:25:08,181 --> 01:25:10,945
Hey, Marcus, look out!
What are you doing?

887
01:25:15,288 --> 01:25:16,346
Oh, no.

888
01:25:23,864 --> 01:25:26,025
Marcus, I'm right here.

889
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:35,566
Marcus, I'm right here.
Okay, here I am, Marcus.

890
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,011
Sarah, what's wrong?

891
01:25:44,317 --> 01:25:46,080
Hang on. Hang on.

892
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,578
Oh, God, Marcus.

893
01:25:56,763 --> 01:25:58,287
Becky, help me!

894
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:01,927
We're here.

895
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:03,625
Hold on!

896
01:26:04,304 --> 01:26:06,602
Oh, God, Marcus!

897
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:10,301
Becky, hold the wheel.

898
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,872
I got him!

899
01:27:19,246 --> 01:27:20,611
Watch your line!

900
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,657
Hold it against his mouth.
Make sure he can breathe.

901
01:28:17,504 --> 01:28:19,096
What is he doing?

902
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:12,619
<i>They're coming down to the finish line,
and David Sommers is still the lead.</i>

903
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:16,992
<i>But the chase group is breathing down
his neck and getting closer every second.</i>

904
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:36,375
<i>The field's in sight,
coming down to the finish.</i>

905
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:38,644
<i>David Sommers is still out in front.</i>

906
01:29:39,185 --> 01:29:41,517
<i>But the pack is coming hard on his heels.</i>

907
01:29:41,588 --> 01:29:44,921
<i>It's going to be a miracle if he can hold on.
No, they've got him!</i>

908
01:29:44,991 --> 01:29:48,825
<i>David Sommers has been swallowed up
by the chase group. Here they go.</i>

909
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:53,522
<i>They're getting ready to begin the sprint.</i>

910
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,331
<i>Muzzin makes the move on one side,
Belov on the other. They're neck and neck.</i>

911
01:29:57,404 --> 01:30:01,340
<i>Muzzin and Belov, Belov and Muzzin.
It's going to be a fantastic sprint.</i>

912
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,907
<i>And it's going to be... It looks like Muzzin.</i>

913
01:30:03,977 --> 01:30:05,911
<i>Barry Muzzin and Sergei Belov.</i>

914
01:30:06,212 --> 01:30:08,544
<i>And its going to be Muzzin, Barry Muzzin.</i>

915
01:30:08,615 --> 01:30:11,675
<i>Sergei Belov, second.
David Sommers holds on for third.</i>

916
01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:14,585
<i>The rest of the field coming through...</i>

917
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:32,595
David, you uncorked the big one today.

918
01:30:32,672 --> 01:30:33,764
Where's Marcus?

919
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:35,636
Please, get out of my way!

920
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:40,342
It's Marcus. We've got to go!

921
01:30:56,563 --> 01:30:58,690
So, how much time did you make up?

922
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:02,027
Two minutes.

923
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:06,034
We did it, huh? You did it.

924
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:10,768
Marcus, what the hell is going on?

925
01:31:26,259 --> 01:31:28,454
Remember when we were
out front, talking?

926
01:31:28,528 --> 01:31:30,792
I told you that you were free of diseases.

927
01:31:30,864 --> 01:31:33,162
But you never told me anything
about yourself.

928
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,494
I wanted you to come with me.
I wanted us...

929
01:31:36,603 --> 01:31:38,798
Remember, the two of us,
the Sommers team...

930
01:31:38,872 --> 01:31:41,306
Did it ever occur to you
that you could've told me?

931
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:43,740
That maybe I might pull through for you?

932
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:47,505
How many goddamn brothers
do you think I have anyway?

933
01:31:50,116 --> 01:31:51,413
Son of a bitch.

934
01:31:55,355 --> 01:31:58,415
It's a good thing you dropped out
of pre-med.

935
01:31:58,558 --> 01:32:00,549
Your bedside manners are atrocious.

936
01:32:03,063 --> 01:32:04,826
How can you be sick anyway?

937
01:32:07,767 --> 01:32:12,170
Look at yourself, what you've got...
You have a moustache and everything.

938
01:32:17,043 --> 01:32:19,170
I had this all figured out.

939
01:32:19,512 --> 01:32:24,074
How to handle this, if it's me. But not you.
I don't know what to feel, Marcus.

940
01:32:24,451 --> 01:32:27,909
Am I supposed to feel happy
it's you and not me? Is that what?

941
01:32:28,054 --> 01:32:29,282
Then what?

942
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:54,843
Be strong, now, okay?

943
01:32:55,548 --> 01:32:56,515
Okay.

944
01:33:05,391 --> 01:33:06,983
Thank you, Becky.

945
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,197
You have to finish the race.

946
01:33:16,603 --> 01:33:20,369
You're crazy, you know that.
I think you've eaten too many bananas.

947
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:25,205
- It's not over.
- It's over for me. Don't you understand?

948
01:33:25,278 --> 01:33:27,644
The race isn't important now. It's you.

949
01:33:27,714 --> 01:33:29,011
What will you do for me?

950
01:33:29,082 --> 01:33:30,845
We'll take you to a hospital...

951
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:33,283
I don't know how much time I have left.

952
01:33:33,386 --> 01:33:37,584
Maybe a few days, maybe more,
but there's nothing they can do for me.

953
01:33:37,757 --> 01:33:40,021
Come on. Help me with this.

954
01:33:41,661 --> 01:33:42,855
I want to sit up.

955
01:33:44,297 --> 01:33:47,198
I'm not trying to be a hero, you know that.

956
01:33:51,204 --> 01:33:54,469
It's just that I won't let them turn me
into a chef's salad, either.

957
01:33:56,643 --> 01:33:58,873
Then I'll stay here with you.

958
01:33:59,179 --> 01:34:00,578
But I can't race tomorrow.

959
01:34:00,647 --> 01:34:03,639
That's just great. Years from now,
you'll tell your kids:

960
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:06,909
"There was this race in Colorado
and I could've done great...

961
01:34:06,986 --> 01:34:10,683
"...if my brother hadn't gotten sick."
You won't use me as an excuse.

962
01:34:10,757 --> 01:34:12,418
I'm not listening to you anymore.

963
01:34:12,492 --> 01:34:14,153
Goddamn it, David!

964
01:34:19,766 --> 01:34:22,701
I'm still alive, so don't ignore me.

965
01:34:34,214 --> 01:34:35,909
What happened to Marcus?

966
01:34:36,482 --> 01:34:37,972
He had some trouble.

967
01:34:46,926 --> 01:34:49,292
I hope he feels better, Geronimo.

968
01:34:50,396 --> 01:34:51,920
Thanks, Cannibal.

969
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:56,400
Are you okay?

970
01:34:56,669 --> 01:34:57,931
I'm fine. Why?

971
01:34:58,004 --> 01:34:59,904
You sound half-human.

972
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,864
I am half-human.

973
01:35:05,578 --> 01:35:09,571
I was in your office when you
and Dr. Conrad were talking.

974
01:35:14,287 --> 01:35:15,879
Do you remember what you said?

975
01:35:16,756 --> 01:35:19,190
"I don't want to ruin it for him," you said.

976
01:35:22,095 --> 01:35:24,461
"I love him too much for that."

977
01:35:26,099 --> 01:35:27,088
You remember?

978
01:35:28,368 --> 01:35:29,232
No.

979
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:36,868
I swore that one day
I was going to say it to your face.

980
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:44,714
Come on, you have to look at me.

981
01:35:46,853 --> 01:35:49,253
Are we going to do this the hard way?

982
01:35:58,665 --> 01:36:00,462
I love you, too, Marcus.

983
01:36:15,948 --> 01:36:17,472
What's our plan?

984
01:36:32,932 --> 01:36:34,263
<i>Stage 3.</i>

985
01:36:44,043 --> 01:36:47,535
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to Golden, Colorado...</i>

986
01:36:47,613 --> 01:36:52,050
<i>... site of the third and final stage
of a race they call the Hell of the West.</i>

987
01:36:52,185 --> 01:36:54,881
<i>Looks like we're in
for a great day here today.</i>

988
01:37:06,132 --> 01:37:11,160
<i>Before we get started, I'd like to introduce
the main contenders in this competition.</i>

989
01:37:11,237 --> 01:37:13,797
<i>Beginning with the rider
in third place overall...</i>

990
01:37:13,873 --> 01:37:17,673
<i>... 11 seconds behind the leader,
David Sommers.</i>

991
01:37:19,879 --> 01:37:22,746
<i>In second place overall,
from the Soviet Union...</i>

992
01:37:22,815 --> 01:37:26,216
<i>... only two seconds behind the leader,
Sergei Belov.</i>

993
01:37:29,055 --> 01:37:33,185
<i>And ladies and gentlemen,
last year's winner of the Hell of the West...</i>

994
01:37:33,259 --> 01:37:36,786
<i>... the race leader today going into
the third and final stage...</i>

995
01:37:37,163 --> 01:37:39,222
<i>... Barry "the Cannibal" Muzzin.</i>

996
01:37:44,303 --> 01:37:46,897
<i>We'rejust minutes from the start
of the competition.</i>

997
01:37:46,973 --> 01:37:49,999
<i>All caravan drivers,
please report to your vehicles.</i>

998
01:37:50,076 --> 01:37:52,874
<i>All officials, please report to your vehicles.</i>

999
01:38:57,443 --> 01:39:00,606
<i>Here's a surprise.
The Russians are starting things early.</i>

1000
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,980
<i>Belov is sending a teammate up the road,
forcing the others to do the chasing.</i>

1001
01:39:05,051 --> 01:39:08,919
<i>That will take some of the sap out of them
if they're not able to hold the pace.</i>

1002
01:39:08,988 --> 01:39:13,186
<i>The weaker ones will get burned off and
won't be able to make the climbs.</i>

1003
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:15,557
<i>Over 100 miles to go and the Russians...</i>

1004
01:39:15,628 --> 01:39:18,461
<i>... are really making things pop
right off the bat.</i>

1005
01:39:18,865 --> 01:39:23,302
<i>Belov must have a lot of confidence in
his ability to start a breakaway so early...</i>

1006
01:39:23,402 --> 01:39:25,063
<i>... in a race like this.</i>

1007
01:39:30,877 --> 01:39:33,107
It's no fun up front, is it?

1008
01:39:45,124 --> 01:39:47,092
I must be hallucinating.

1009
01:39:48,895 --> 01:39:50,590
That looks like Randolph.

1010
01:39:52,565 --> 01:39:53,793
It is Randolph.

1011
01:39:53,866 --> 01:39:55,356
Who's Randolph?

1012
01:40:00,139 --> 01:40:01,504
Sarah, pull over.

1013
01:40:11,684 --> 01:40:13,117
Mr. Sommers, don't!

1014
01:40:29,035 --> 01:40:31,060
Do you want to go with us?

1015
01:40:36,509 --> 01:40:37,601
Go around.

1016
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:40,504
We'll follow you.
Come on, let's go, Randolph.

1017
01:40:43,516 --> 01:40:44,608
You must be Sarah.

1018
01:40:44,684 --> 01:40:46,811
- Yes. Mrs. Sommers.
- How do you do?

1019
01:40:47,587 --> 01:40:49,282
- Hi, I'm Becky.
- Hi.

1020
01:40:51,457 --> 01:40:52,947
Okay, let's go.

1021
01:41:06,072 --> 01:41:10,008
<i>Golden to Mount Evans race is the third
and final stage of the Hell of the West.</i>

1022
01:41:10,076 --> 01:41:14,740
<i>It's also the most difficult. It starts at
the Coors Brewery in Golden, Colorado...</i>

1023
01:41:14,814 --> 01:41:18,944
<i>... and begins a spectacular climb
over 6,000 feet into the Rocky Mountains...</i>

1024
01:41:19,085 --> 01:41:21,713
<i>... finishing nearly 12,000 feet
above sea level.</i>

1025
01:41:21,787 --> 01:41:25,348
<i>And that's over the highest paved road
in North America.</i>

1026
01:41:25,691 --> 01:41:28,660
<i>Not many of these cyclists
have ever raced at this altitude.</i>

1027
01:41:28,728 --> 01:41:32,027
<i>In Europe, for instance, the courses
through the Alps are much lower.</i>

1028
01:41:32,098 --> 01:41:33,497
<i>It's a torturous course.</i>

1029
01:41:33,566 --> 01:41:37,434
<i>Even the fittest athletes can't get
enough air to maintain a normal speed.</i>

1030
01:41:44,276 --> 01:41:46,676
Notice anything unusual, Randolph?

1031
01:41:47,413 --> 01:41:49,108
Yeah, I have jet lag.

1032
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,918
Hardly any black riders out there.

1033
01:41:53,586 --> 01:41:54,644
Think about it.

1034
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,415
I don't have a bicycle, Dad.

1035
01:41:56,489 --> 01:41:58,218
Your birthday's coming up.

1036
01:42:01,994 --> 01:42:03,859
I want a bowling ball.

1037
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,130
I'm still here, Belov.

1038
01:42:10,202 --> 01:42:11,965
Right on your red ass.

1039
01:42:12,038 --> 01:42:13,767
Think about this, Belov:

1040
01:42:13,839 --> 01:42:17,104
I'm behind you,
but I'm really two seconds ahead.

1041
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:19,605
Are you nuts?
He doesn't understand English.

1042
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:20,703
He understands.

1043
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,577
Don't you, Belov?

1044
01:42:23,182 --> 01:42:26,549
You know why you won the Olympics?
Because I wasn't there.

1045
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,985
Well, now I'm here.

1046
01:42:29,255 --> 01:42:31,416
Only I'm not here. I'm two seconds ahead.

1047
01:42:33,759 --> 01:42:35,852
He does understand English.

1048
01:42:56,348 --> 01:42:57,542
Up, Dave. Up.

1049
01:42:59,385 --> 01:43:00,374
Up, Dave.

1050
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:01,945
That a boy.

1051
01:43:29,849 --> 01:43:31,009
Get him, Belov.

1052
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:32,914
You go get him.

1053
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:51,399
<i>Ten miles to go and David Sommers
is trying to steal this race from them.</i>

1054
01:43:51,537 --> 01:43:55,633
<i>He's been very aggressive this last mile,
forcing them to chase very hard.</i>

1055
01:43:55,708 --> 01:44:00,702
<i>These last few miles many riders will drop
as the lack of oxygen grows more severe.</i>

1056
01:44:00,913 --> 01:44:02,346
He's going all out early.

1057
01:44:02,414 --> 01:44:03,745
Should I pull over and wait?

1058
01:44:03,816 --> 01:44:07,445
No. Let's go up to the finish line.
It's his race, let him ride it.

1059
01:44:21,967 --> 01:44:23,730
Here we go, Sommers.

1060
01:44:54,767 --> 01:44:56,359
Okay, we got him.

1061
01:44:58,404 --> 01:45:01,737
Just sit back and you've got second
locked up. Okay?

1062
01:45:02,508 --> 01:45:03,532
Okay.

1063
01:45:21,126 --> 01:45:22,058
Shit!

1064
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:39,943
I gave you a chance, Sommers.
Now all bets are off.

1065
01:46:19,919 --> 01:46:23,013
<i>It's David Sommers in the lead,
coming around the corner.</i>

1066
01:46:23,088 --> 01:46:25,147
<i>But even if he crosses the line first...</i>

1067
01:46:25,224 --> 01:46:28,751
<i>... Muzzin still has
an 11-second time advantage overall.</i>

1068
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:32,388
<i>If Muzzin crosses the line
less than 11 seconds after Sommers...</i>

1069
01:46:32,498 --> 01:46:35,729
<i>... Muzzin will still be the winner
of the Hell of the West.</i>

1070
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:24,481
<i>Sommers is finished.
He'll become the overall winner...</i>

1071
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:28,145
<i>... if Muzzin doesn't cross the finish line
in the next 11 seconds.</i>

1072
01:47:44,903 --> 01:47:46,370
<i>Muzzin didn't make it.</i>

1073
01:47:46,438 --> 01:47:48,770
<i>David Sommers wins the final stage...</i>

1074
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:52,268
<i>... and clinches the overall victory
in the Hell of the West.</i>

1075
01:47:52,344 --> 01:47:54,938
<i>A fantastic performance
by this young newcomer.</i>

1076
01:47:55,014 --> 01:47:58,575
<i>He has beaten the veterans this year
and made quite a name for himself.</i>

1077
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,118
<i>Young David Sommers, a fantasticjob!</i>

1078
01:48:01,186 --> 01:48:04,417
<i>Let's give all these riders
a big round of applause as they come in.</i>

1079
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:06,219
<i>What a finish here today!</i>

1080
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:15,499
Mrs. Sommers, would you come up?

1081
01:48:15,567 --> 01:48:17,159
How about some smiles?

1082
01:48:22,674 --> 01:48:23,663
Next year.

1083
01:49:08,554 --> 01:49:09,953
Come on, look over here.

1084
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:13,988
Come on, give us a smile.
Over here. Look out.

1085
