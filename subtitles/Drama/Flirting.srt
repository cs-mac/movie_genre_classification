1
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,031
I remember the smells most.

2
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,060
Stale lockers with fruitcakes
rotting into the wood.

3
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,299
Crusty shoe polish.

4
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,604
Damp towels.

5
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,440
Quink ink for fountain pens.

6
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,538
Disinfectant on the floors
of the shower block.

7
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,207
Fresh chalk.

8
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,617
Moldy oranges blue with mildew.

9
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,814
And on a rainy day...

10
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:35,555
the deep, rank, wild smell
of discarded football boots.

11
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,298
And I remember pain.

12
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,129
But... only vaguely.

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,398
I had a thick hide by then.

14
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,804
They'd sent me
to boarding school...

15
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,308
so I wouldn't become
a delinquent.

16
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,937
Don't wet yourself, Embling.

17
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,878
- For some reason...
- Next.

18
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,749
this caused the letters "H"
as in Heaven...

19
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,414
- and "W" as in...
- Psychopath.

20
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,325
And "W" as in women
to sometimes be unsayable.

21
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,102
Bend over.

22
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,677
Next.

23
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,097
Take a look at Backa's,
will you?

24
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,604
What about Embling?

25
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,642
Show us your stripes, Embling.

26
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,710
He's probably bawling.

27
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,805
- What about Desert Head?
- Keep it quiet.

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,913
Where's your camera?

29
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,515
Come on. Fair go.

30
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,218
- Take one.
- Don't piss around.

31
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,863
- Chrome dome.
- Get out!

32
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,182
If I hear anything more,
it'll be six for the lot of you.

33
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,252
One thing
about boarding school...

34
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,787
twenty-four hours a day,
you were surrounded.

35
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,326
Bird.

36
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,799
Either you abandoned yourself
and became a herd animal...

37
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,891
or you dug a cave
deep into your head...

38
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,528
and skulked inside...

39
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,834
peering through
your eye sockets.

40
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,776
At the source of major
solace and inspiration...

41
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,112
our sister seat of learning...

42
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,142
Cirencester Ladies College.

43
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,815
The two schools stared across
the lake at each other...

44
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,485
like brooding volcanoes.

45
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,208
When I was asleep...

46
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,711
I used to leave my body...

47
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,183
and drift the cold currents
to the Cirencester grounds...

48
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,947
where I hovered
like a dark angel.

49
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,574
Anyone got a banana?

50
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,619
Jock.

51
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,293
How's it going?

52
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,130
Good.

53
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,102
We'll run all over them
in the second half.

54
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,105
Will you be around after?

55
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,038
Probably.

56
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,473
See you then.

57
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,143
Send him to the knackery.

58
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,809
Bandits at seven o'clock.

59
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,616
- How about those two?
- A bit young.

60
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,853
- They're our age.
- Like I said, a bit young.

61
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,225
I go for the mature male.

62
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,825
When the devil rings a bell...

63
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,391
all the cat-eyes go to hell.
Yeah!

64
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,835
We need another stretcher.

65
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:59,071
- Good match?
- Yeah.

66
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,204
Three badly injured so far.

67
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,271
You don't sound very patriotic.

68
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,907
No, I'm not.

69
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,508
Aren't you interested
in football?

70
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,147
Only from
an anthropological viewpoint.

71
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,884
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,052
It's a form of mating ritual.

73
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,617
What?

74
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,857
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

75
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,694
You're deranged.

76
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,927
You're incredibly rude,
did you know that?

77
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,799
That's why
I haven't got friends.

78
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,169
- I'm not surprised.
- I take pity on him.

79
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,970
I'd say it's wasted.
Come on.

80
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,183
Brilliant.

81
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:46,516
From Greenland's icy mountains

82
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,461
From India's coral strand

83
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:57,401
Where Africa's sunny fountains

84
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,407
Roll down their golden sand

85
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:07,913
From many an ancient river

86
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,282
From many a balmy plain

87
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:19,291
They call us to deliver

88
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:24,819
Their land from error's shame

89
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,668
United States Marines...

90
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,213
began landing yesterday
north of Da Nang...

91
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:46,012
to take up security duties
around the large jet airfield.

92
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,519
They are the first
U.S. ground combat troops...

93
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,070
- Excuse me.
- Do you mind?

94
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,441
There are other things
going on in the world...

95
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,810
besides skinny rock 'n' roll
singers jumping around.

96
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,109
Yes, of course.

97
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,344
Little Miss Sophistication
can tell us all about it.

98
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,249
It might actually concern you.

99
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,981
I doubt if it'll concern you.

100
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,114
They're certainly not
going to mention Uganda.

101
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,385
I never heard it mentioned ever.

102
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,893
They're not even
in the Olympic games.

103
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,053
Probably not eligible.

104
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,563
They would be

105
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,060
You bitch!

106
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,071
Sorry. Slipped on a banana.

107
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,226
Do you see what I see?

108
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,033
Australia's answer
to Ursula Andress.

109
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,876
She folds her legs.

110
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,576
In doing so, I glimpse Xanadu.

111
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,757
Good afternoon.

112
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,195
The subject
of today's debate is...

113
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,893
that this house agrees
with Bertrand Russell...

114
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,366
that intellectual pursuits...

115
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,564
are the highest form
of human endeavor.

116
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,800
And it'll be ladies first.

117
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,707
Speaking for the affirmative...

118
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,213
Miss Nicola Radcliffe.

119
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,653
Professor Barbour,
Reverend Nicholson...

120
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,819
members of
the adjudicating panel...

121
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,919
ladies and gentlemen.

122
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,227
And others.

123
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,261
The central thrust
of our argument...

124
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,999
will be that the pleasures
of the intellect...

125
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,064
are of a higher order
altogether...

126
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,578
as opposed to the other
simple pleasures of life.

127
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,875
And, to this end,
we will be citing evidence...

128
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,439
from such
illustrious sources...

129
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,918
as William Shakespeare,
Immanuel Kant...

130
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,420
Alfred, Lord Tennyson...

131
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,980
Bishop Barclay,
Samuel Pepys...

132
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,050
Sir Robert Menzies,
Aristotle...

133
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,789
and the Duke of Edinburgh.

134
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:48,197
Firstly, to begin
with William Shakespeare...

135
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:54,172
I'd like to suggest
that rugby football...

136
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,199
is the highest form...

137
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,744
of...

138
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,115
Highest form of...

139
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,154
human endeavor.

140
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,290
How can one go past...

141
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:18,126
the fluid inspiration
of Jock Blair...

142
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,293
sprinting down the wing
for a brilliant try?

143
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,132
How can one not
be moved to tears...

144
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,196
by the naked courage
of a smaller player...

145
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,141
hurling himself
at a much larger opponent...

146
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,873
bouncing off, but picking
himself up again and again...

147
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,074
in a frenzy
of guts and determination?

148
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,218
Rugby football embodies...

149
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,722
all the noblest virtues...

150
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,089
enshrined
in a school like ours- -

151
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,221
teamwork, bravery...

152
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,732
pride, school spirit...

153
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,759
creativity, intelligence...

154
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:04,105
love of one's fellow man- -

155
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,440
surely the virtues...

156
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,503
which distinguish
human beings...

157
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,881
from brute animals.

158
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,000
- The final speaker...
- Good stuff.

159
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,063
for the affirmative side
is Miss Thandiwe Adjewa.

160
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,281
Having listened carefully
to the speakers of both sides...

161
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,587
and wishing to be
totally impartial...

162
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,785
I feel the position...

163
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,987
for which my team
is arguing is untenable...

164
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,189
though not for
the tedious reasons...

165
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,459
given by our opponents...

166
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,295
the last speaker excepted.

167
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,928
My colleagues have quoted...

168
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,837
many poets and philosophers
to support our case...

169
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,307
that intellectual pursuits
are the highest form...

170
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,401
of human endeavor...

171
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,811
but most contemporary artists...

172
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,408
seem more interested
in bodily functions.

173
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,818
For example...

174
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:27,222
"I don't want you
toast my bread.

175
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,386
"I don't want you make my bed."

176
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,327
"I don't want your money, too.

177
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,368
"I just want
to make love to you."

178
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,639
"Tutti frutti, au rutti."

179
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,877
"A- wop- bop a- loom- op
a- lop bam boom."

180
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,048
If these philosopher- poets
are any guide...

181
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,818
the so- called animal side
of human beings...

182
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,486
leaves the intellectual side
for dead.

183
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,995
Is this just
a recent development...

184
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,625
or are we only now
becoming mature enough...

185
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,068
to reveal our dirty washing?

186
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,369
Time?

187
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,677
About one minute.

188
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,187
You were not only totally
disloyal to the school...

189
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,279
by deliberately
throwing away the debate...

190
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,815
but you reduced the occasion
to a gutter level.

191
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,485
I can't imagine
that you were encouraged...

192
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,723
to get away with that
at school in England...

193
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,425
but I can certainly guarantee
you won't be given...

194
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,525
the opportunity
to repeat such behavior here.

195
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,162
She didn't mean to be offensive.

196
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,399
She made a mockery
of the whole debate.

197
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,034
If you believe rock 'n' roll
songs are equal to poetry...

198
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,044
then I wonder what they teach
you over there at all.

199
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,579
At any rate,
I shall be speaking...

200
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,546
to the headmistress
in the morning.

201
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,650
She was really
wetting her pants.

202
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,725
I saw you getting blasted.

203
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,786
I wanted to congratulate you.
It was terrific.

204
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,298
I loved your rugby speech.

205
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,924
Are you going
to the boarders' dance?

206
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,467
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.

207
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,269
Aren't fifth formers allowed?

208
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,539
Yeah, but not many go.

209
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,639
I'm not.
They always play terrible music.

210
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,377
Frightful.

211
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,476
Yes. I prefer jazz to rock.

212
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,886
The bus is here, girls.
Hurry up, please.

213
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,095
I might see you there...

214
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,258
at the dance.

215
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,823
Right.

216
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,163
Super.

217
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,838
- What's the time?
- 7:30.

218
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,206
Sir?

219
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,643
- Yes, Bourke?
- It's 7:30, sir.

220
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,236
All right.

221
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,578
Those going to the dance
can go and get changed.

222
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,742
Quietly.

223
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,185
Backa, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

224
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,246
Doesn't leave me
much room to maneuver.

225
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,191
- Who's Embling going with?
- Who'd have him?

226
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,820
Quiet.

227
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,832
Who've you got lined up,
Embling?

228
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
Didn't think you'd ever
manage to finish...

229
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,803
asking someone out.

230
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,903
People wonder how Hitler
managed...

231
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,738
to get so many followers?

232
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,472
It's never surprised me.

233
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,645
You're certainly getting around.

234
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,878
Just trying to lead
a balanced life.

235
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,902
- How's the hamstring?
- Good, sir.

236
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,532
Remember you got
a football match tomorrow.

237
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,735
Yes, sir.

238
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,782
Did I not tell you
to get a haircut?

239
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,648
I did, sir.

240
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,782
You're not going to go
looking like this, are you?

241
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,760
Yes, sir.

242
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,319
I beg your pardon?

243
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,301
I could put water on it, sir.

244
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,030
No, you're not going at all.

245
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,969
You didn't get a haircut,
did you?

246
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,802
Yes, sir.

247
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,570
Are you contradicting me?

248
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,442
No, sir.
I just had a trim, sir.

249
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,708
The rest of you can go.

250
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,084
What about
the girl I asked, sir?

251
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,383
You should have
thought of that before.

252
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,687
Report to the prefect's room
and get your hair tidied up...

253
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,319
then you can go back to prep.

254
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,885
But, sir...

255
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,694
You want a thrashing as well?

256
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,866
No, sir.

257
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,979
They're here.

258
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,149
I want to see Nicola Radcliffe.
I'm desperate.

259
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,385
I'm a desperate man!

260
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,121
- Hey, mate. No pushing.
- Stop it.

261
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,040
Stop pushing.

262
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,919
All right, gentlemen.
Back to your desks.

263
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,081
- Oh, sir!
- Fair crack of the whip.

264
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,022
You'll get your go next year.

265
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,423
That's next year, though, sir.

266
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,586
It'll shrivel up and die.

267
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,061
What was that, Green?

268
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,428
I said
we'll die of starvation, sir.

269
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,434
Come on.
Back to your desks.

270
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,218
They're here.

271
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,705
Remember that
you're all young ladies.

272
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,821
The tall one.

273
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,662
The one in the yellow.
We'll see.

274
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,347
- That one's mine.
- In the back?

275
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,146
Handsome, isn't he?

276
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,663
I'm proud of you, girls.
Have a nice night.

277
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,759
What's she like, the boong?

278
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,765
Really stuck- up.
Reckons she knows everything.

279
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,323
Who is she supposed
to be here with?

280
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,130
Some kid called Danny somebody.

281
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,296
- Danny Embling?
- That's right.

282
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,863
Bird Embling?
She won't be doing much dancing.

283
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,341
How's your old man?

284
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,909
It'll be a great match
next week.

285
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,279
Don't you ever think about
anything besides football?

286
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,284
I thought you liked it.

287
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,014
No. Not really.

288
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,424
There's an Abo at the window.

289
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,067
Excuse me, sir.

290
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,662
- Can I go to the toilet, sir?
- Yep.

291
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,557
- Hello.
- Good evening.

292
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,032
What's going on now?

293
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,875
Who's out there?

294
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,625
Me, sir.
I've just been sick, sir.

295
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,060
Are you all right?

296
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,963
I'm not feeling too good, sir.

297
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,002
Pop over and see matron
and get something.

298
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,434
Yes, sir.

299
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,778
Come on, it's clear.

300
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,682
Well done. Where will we go?

301
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,482
Well, if we hang around here,
we'll get caught for sure.

302
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,750
How about your dormitory?

303
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,286
There'll be no one there
for awhile.

304
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,487
It's all right.

305
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,757
Just thinking
of somewhere we can talk.

306
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,059
OK.

307
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,309
- Clear.
- Who'd be around?

308
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,435
Third formers
will be in bed by now.

309
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,445
Elliott will be in his study.

310
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,210
Fourth formers come through
in half an hour.

311
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,581
Why were they making
bird noises at you?

312
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,921
It's an Australian form
of admiration.

313
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,165
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

314
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,236
So where you from?

315
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,742
My father's Ugandan.
My mother was from Kenya.

316
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,538
She was half- English.

317
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,078
How come you're here?

318
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,980
Dad's lecturing at university
in Canberra for a year.

319
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,984
I met Sartre.

320
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,021
Really? Where?

321
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,555
Paris.

322
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,653
Who's this?

323
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,996
A friend from home.

324
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,594
Where's that?

325
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,737
Out in the boondocks.

326
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,105
These schools are like prisons,
aren't they?

327
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,805
Yeah. Run by
former Gestapo operatives.

328
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,485
What did you say to Sartre?

329
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,419
I suggested marriage
was a doomed institution.

330
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,219
What did he say?

331
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,590
He agreed most people marry
to please their parents...

332
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,595
or society.

333
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,756
Not keen on marriage yourself?

334
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,393
I see so many terrible ones.

335
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,562
People just stop communicating.

336
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,972
My father and stepmother
are brilliant communicators.

337
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,476
They hardly ever talk
to each other these days...

338
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,944
except in public.

339
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,916
Anyway, I doubt
whether I'll find anyone...

340
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,648
complex enough
to keep me interested.

341
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,556
I lose interest in people.

342
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:52,324
I imagine they're far more
fascinating than they are...

343
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,558
so I'm always disappointed.

344
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,402
Hard life.

345
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,943
Where's the bathroom?

346
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,884
Let me escort you.

347
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,955
I wonder what would happen
if someone saw us?

348
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,657
First, they'd extract
our fingernails...

349
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,166
sexual organs next.

350
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,965
You sound like
you'd like to watch.

351
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,504
I'll stand guard.

352
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,211
I would have asked
Jean- Paul about anguish.

353
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,777
Seemed like a pretty romantic
concept at the time.

354
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,059
- Where's Desert Head?
- In his office.

355
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,159
Shit!

356
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,505
My watch stopped.

357
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,273
The fourth formers
are coming in for their showers.

358
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,779
Better get out, then.

359
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,782
Can't. They'll see you.

360
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,249
How about the window?

361
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,309
It's too high.

362
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,446
Look, I'm really sorry.

363
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,921
Go and have another look.

364
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:35,926
Thank you, boys!

365
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,673
We're buggered completely.
Desert Head's out there.

366
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,979
One... two... three... four.

367
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,981
She had a ruby on her tummy

368
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,983
And a diamond big as Texas

369
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,713
On her toe- whoa- whoa

370
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,113
She a put a hat on

371
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,953
And she did
the hootchy- kootchy

372
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,754
Real slow- whoa- whoa

373
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,022
This is romantic.

374
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,724
Sing it again, yes

375
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,569
Did you see
that prefect woman again?

376
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,730
Nicola Radcliffe?

377
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,934
- Incredible legs.
- Great knockers, too.

378
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,603
You wouldn't know
what knockers were.

379
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,940
He's got a good set himself.

380
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,218
Small boys are so charming.

381
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,449
Hurry up, will you?
Who's in there?

382
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,456
Whoever it is
has been there for ages.

383
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,492
Come on, you constipated
or something?

384
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,414
Fucking hell!

385
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,784
I told you before that if you
slide around in your socks...

386
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,755
you'll get splinters.

387
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,518
Now, is there any reason
I shouldn't cane you?

388
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,686
No, sir- - Yes, sir.

389
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,390
That was great.

390
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,798
Yeah. Good fun.

391
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,963
I suppose I'd better
get back to the dance...

392
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,270
in case they notice I've gone.

393
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,072
God knows what they'd think
I was up to.

394
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,909
So, when do
we see each other again?

395
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,954
Very soon, hopefully.

396
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,181
I'd like that.

397
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,814
For a kid,
you've got some class.

398
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,121
Gosh.

399
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,661
- Thandiwe!
- Miss Macready.

400
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,665
If she wanted to wee- wee
she would have asked me first.

401
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,667
There's a ladies'
under the stairs...

402
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,566
but I've already checked
in there.

403
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,239
You'll be for it.

404
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,672
Too bad.

405
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,639
I'll expect a letter.

406
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,916
Where have you been?

407
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,921
It was a call of nature,
Miss Macready.

408
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,925
How dare you leave the hall
without telling me!

409
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,518
Do you know the trouble
you've caused?

410
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,029
I don't see
anything to laugh at.

411
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:24,467
You've put into jeopardy
the whole future of the dances.

412
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,526
It's been a great worry
to us both.

413
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,935
To both of us!

414
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,237
So I hope you're satisfied.

415
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,405
Now, you'll spend the rest
of the evening in the bus...

416
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,914
and I've already told
the prefects...

417
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:42,248
we're leaving half an hour
earlier because of you.

418
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,587
What did she taste like?

419
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,251
A girl.

420
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,262
Jesus.

421
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,629
Then you didn't actually
get any further?

422
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,192
It's only
our first encounter, Gil.

423
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,795
But she suggested
you go back to the dormitory.

424
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,239
Could well have been
expecting you to make a move.

425
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,866
She's a bit up herself.

426
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,570
So what?

427
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,706
No one's obsessed with
Ursula Andress' personality.

428
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:16,220
Look, I know body language,
and hers says, "Give me."

429
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,223
They can be pretty, you know,
desperate, these black women.

430
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,724
Look at "National Geographic."

431
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,728
- Here he is.
- How'd you go, Danny?

432
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,390
- She's not bad.
- Licorice Allsort.

433
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,229
- She the one you invited?
- Yeah.

434
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,529
Good one.

435
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,399
Bloody Embling
brought his woman over...

436
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,904
and had a shower with her.

437
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,406
- Fair dinkum.
- She was nude. Starkers.

438
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,568
Half of fourth form saw her.

439
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,339
What?

440
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,279
- What was he like? Shy?
- Or retarded?

441
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,282
We just talked.

442
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,614
Pretty daft, letting him
take you to his dormitory.

443
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,778
I suggested it.

444
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,788
God, did you sit on his bed?

445
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,949
- Yeah.
- And?

446
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,492
Will you three shut up?

447
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,187
- Get...
- Stuffed.

448
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,860
Well.

449
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:06,028
It's not just you, Thandiwe.
The whole school suffers.

450
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,504
I'm going to have
to think seriously...

451
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,564
whether I allow
any Cirencester girls...

452
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,610
to attend any future dances.

453
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,345
And you're not just
letting yourself down.

454
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,315
There's your parents,
as well...

455
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,181
and your country.

456
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,288
And so I certainly hope...

457
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,051
I don't have to see you
in my office...

458
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,719
under such circumstances again.

459
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,659
And when you finish that...

460
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,821
you can pick up
all the litter...

461
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,764
in the quadrangle
and the tennis courts.

462
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,358
And if I find
even an icy- pop stick...

463
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,631
you can do them again
next weekend.

464
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,797
There's that guy.

465
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,341
He's very good- looking.

466
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,003
- Pity he's a tradesman.
- I thought you liked him.

467
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,912
- Pardon?
- I've seen you looking at him.

468
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,052
Don't judge people by
your sordid standards, Fiona.

469
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,533
When I started thinking
about Africa...

470
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,332
I realized
the only images I knew...

471
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,270
were from old annuals...

472
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,140
Tarzan comics,
and Hollywood movies.

473
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,647
Cannibals with bones
through their noses...

474
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,241
lions tearing the throats
out of antelopes...

475
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,516
and a lot of
wondrous oozing words...

476
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,821
like Limpopo...

477
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,327
Zambezi...

478
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,796
Mombasa...

479
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,992
Tanganyika.

480
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,057
Embling's got a letter
from his girlfriend.

481
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,755
- Lubra lips.
- Good on you, Bird.

482
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,297
Don't peck her eyes out.

483
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,774
Say please.

484
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,442
- Open it, Fedder.
- Fair go.

485
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,778
Let's see what she's got to say.

486
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,250
Don't be an idiot, Bourke.

487
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,344
"Dear Danny..."

488
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,522
"Signing your letter
with a 'Yours'...

489
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,082
"was a bit demure, wasn't it?"

490
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,896
"I thought after our episode
in the showers...

491
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,990
"I deserved something
a little warmer."

492
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,499
"I'm told your nickname
is Bird."

493
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,641
"Well, I like long noses.

494
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,198
"It means
you're well- endowed..."

495
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,144
"with brains, of course."

496
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,718
People like to have someone
to look down on.

497
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:12,313
Makes them feel better
about themselves.

498
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,358
No one realized what
a great community service...

499
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,724
I was performing
by being the school dag.

500
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,262
I didn't care.

501
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,265
I'd met this girl.

502
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,136
Come in.

503
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,773
I'd like
to report something, sir.

504
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,775
Something that
I think isn't fair, sir.

505
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,983
Well?

506
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,424
Some of the boys
have been opening letters...

507
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,122
and reading them to everyone.

508
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,198
I see.

509
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,933
A very nice pipe, sir.

510
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,643
Mr. Elliott wants to see Bourke
in his office, sir.

511
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,746
All right, Bourke, off you go.

512
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,776
"Yours faithfully"
was a little bit demure.

513
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,836
It's so funny.
Everyone was rolling around.

514
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,006
Then she said...

515
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,245
"Big noses do mean
you're well-endowed."

516
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,946
- She's so pretentious.
- Really?

517
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:27,081
I don't think it's funny
reading people's letters.

518
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,792
No. I had it down.

519
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,735
- OK.
- Try "Dearest Gilby."

520
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,466
It's not dearest.
I hardly know him.

521
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,871
- Yet.
- "Dear Gilby."

522
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,841
- It's not even "Dear."
- Looks like a deer.

523
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,743
An old dear. One of
those people who was born old.

524
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,838
- About fifty.
- He's not that bad.

525
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,280
At least
he's brave enough to write.

526
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,839
No accounting for taste.

527
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,943
Lights.

528
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,391
Glad to know your boyfriend's
well- endowed, Adjewa.

529
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,784
Pardon?

530
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,796
Your St. Albans friend.

531
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,902
- God, it stinks.
- Is it moving?

532
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,838
Of course it is.
It's Danish blue.

533
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,536
Excuse me, Miss Macready.

534
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,738
Phone call for Thandiwe- -
her father.

535
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,371
Off you go.

536
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,756
Can I go to the toilet,
please, Miss Macready?

537
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,489
You may go to the bathroom,
Melissa, yes.

538
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,348
To whom am I speaking?

539
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,042
Milton Adjewa here.

540
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,244
May I speak
to my daughter, please?

541
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,720
Milton, Thandiwe doesn't
want to speak to you anymore.

542
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,587
- Why?
- Why do you think?

543
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,422
You've been showing her letters
to everyone.

544
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,462
You're an absolute pill.

545
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,929
The letter was stolen.

546
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,990
You should have looked after it.

547
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,133
Thanks.

548
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,434
This year's musical
is called "Proserpina"...

549
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,499
the dramatic story
of the rape of Persephone...

550
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,772
as she was called
by the Greeks- -

551
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,646
a beautiful goddess
who was kidnapped by Pluto...

552
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,276
the God of the Underworld.

553
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,753
Ultimately, it's a tale
of birth, death, and renewal...

554
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,815
embodying the myth
of the origins of the seasons- -

555
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,260
spring, summer,
autumn, and winter.

556
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,820
Who's the author, Mrs. Archer?

557
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,661
It's something I wrote myself.

558
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,758
An adaptation from the German.

559
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:59,565
Some more volunteers.
Nice to have you with us.

560
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,617
I want you to form up in pairs.

561
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,255
I don't think
we're a very good match.

562
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:24,529
- Have you got anyone?
- No, I suppose not.

563
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,899
Good.

564
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,808
Has anyone not got a partner?

565
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,806
Don't be shy, you two.

566
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:58,034
- I'm Thandiwe Adjewa.
- Jock Blair.

567
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,503
- Where are you from?
- Uganda.

568
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,733
You speak really good English.

569
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,775
So do you.

570
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,744
Where are you from?

571
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,212
Near Cootamundra.
My father's a grazier.

572
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,749
I wanted to see
four steamrollers...

573
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,217
attached to Jock Blair's
arms and legs...

574
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,754
driving in
opposite directions...

575
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:23,850
leaving only a twitching torso
flailing blood like a live hose.

576
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,886
And sheep. My father's
a man for all seasons.

577
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,230
And I wanted even worse things
to happen to her.

578
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:35,567
In the meantime, I'd make her
ferociously jealous...

579
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,766
by pulling off
the seduction of the century...

580
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,308
with Nicola Radcliffe.

581
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,448
What's wrong with you now,
Embling?

582
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,014
He's feeling crook, sir.

583
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,186
Your health's becoming
a constant source of concern.

584
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,230
It's the elephant dick.
It's rank.

585
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:01,993
It's going to walk out of here.

586
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,226
Shut up, Green.

587
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,061
I think
I'm going to be sick, sir.

588
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,936
Go down and get something
from matron.

589
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,241
I'm feeling
a bit crook myself, sir.

590
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,747
Green...

591
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,405
Sultry.

592
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,254
Smolder.

593
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,383
Good.

594
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,231
I think we should swap partners
in the musical.

595
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,459
Why?

596
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,729
You're writing to him,
aren't you?

597
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,498
Not anymore.

598
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,570
- What happened?
- He showed one of them around.

599
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,735
That wasn't him.

600
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,678
One of the other kids stole it
and read it out aloud.

601
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,238
Challenge one another.

602
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,296
Puss, puss, puss.

603
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:50,030
I'm just going to feed the cat
and then check up on the girls.

604
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,802
I'll put the kettle on.

605
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,805
Rastus, Rastus.

606
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,258
Shit.

607
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,161
You coming or not?

608
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,532
It's delicious
liver and kidney.

609
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,121
Don't meow, Rastus.

610
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,766
- Quiet!
- It's a man!

611
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,931
Shut up.
It's a St. Albans kid.

612
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,403
I'm stuck.

613
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,416
- Why did you come?
- To see a girl.

614
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,286
Come on.

615
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:22,162
- Thanks.
- One, two, three.

616
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,236
Someone's coming!

617
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,275
What is going on up there?

618
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,737
What's all this noise?

619
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,145
Come on, what is it?

620
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,649
It was the window,
Miss Macready.

621
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,617
It came down and woke us all up.

622
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,449
We thought it could
be a murderer...

623
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,783
Or a raper.

624
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,619
Rapist.

625
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,751
It's a pity you don't put
that imagination to work...

626
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,193
on your compositions, Jean.

627
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,289
Back to sleep now, girls.
Good night.

628
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,629
Who did you want to see?

629
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,535
Thandiwe Adjewa.

630
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,198
We'll take you.

631
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,574
Come on, Stace.

632
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,237
We'll take you there.

633
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,750
Have a nice time.

634
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,752
You go and wait.

635
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,412
In the bushes.

636
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,812
Your father's on the telephone.

637
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,290
I do karate.

638
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,757
It's me.

639
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,581
Where's Embling?

640
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,650
He had a terrible attack
of the trots, sir.

641
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,958
- Again?
- It's the elephant, sir.

642
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,396
I was in the toilet for an hour.

643
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,263
What are you talking about?

644
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,298
He means the elephant dick, sir.

645
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,512
And...

646
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,114
what is elephant dick, Green?

647
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,619
Meat loaf with
egg in the middle, sir.

648
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,284
I'll see you
in my office after prep.

649
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,761
Yes, sir.

650
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,027
You think it's funny?

651
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,967
No, sir.

652
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,252
I better go.

653
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,413
Probably been missed already.

654
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,922
What will happen?

655
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,254
I'll get caned.

656
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,793
I feel terrible.

657
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,387
I didn't trust you.

658
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,625
I won't let you down again.

659
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,137
I mean it.

660
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,607
Stop it.

661
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,309
Miss Anderson's
asking where you are.

662
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:45,324
You could be expelled
for being in these grounds.

663
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,163
Well, I'm not actually here.
This is a dream.

664
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:57,471
Get back to bed before
it turns into a nightmare.

665
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:01,272
If I do catch you again,
that's it.

666
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,287
Good night, Nicola.

667
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,371
Thandiwe started telling me
about Africa as she knew it.

668
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:38,103
How her mother was killed in
the Mau- Mau period in Kenya...

669
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,844
how her father wrote books
about African nationalism...

670
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,010
and the problems created...

671
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:46,317
as the colonial governments
scrambled to get out.

672
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,789
There had been terrible times
the last few years- -

673
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,796
the Belgian Congo...

674
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,798
Zanzibar...

675
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,834
Angola, Kenya.

676
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,504
Places I'd barely heard of.

677
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,042
What's happening?

678
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,806
We're just flirting.

679
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,124
Often I never really heard
what she said.

680
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,796
I'd be staring at her legs.

681
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,929
They were very comforting.

682
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:38,740
Sometimes there would be
little bruises...

683
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:43,472
or marks around her ankles
from the elastic in her socks.

684
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,817
That's how I knew she was real.

685
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,502
What's happening?

686
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,039
I'm cracking a monstrous fat.

687
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,472
What can you see?

688
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,702
Everything.

689
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,244
Don't cream yourself, Cheddar.

690
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,009
God, there's Nicola Radcliffe.

691
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,515
What is she doing?

692
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,813
Sitting down.

693
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,081
Taking off her shoes...

694
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,352
unfastening her zip.

695
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,324
Would you keep it down?

696
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,232
What's happening now?

697
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,668
God.

698
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,434
Has she taken it all off?

699
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,907
There's Embling's girlfriend.

700
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,773
Not bad.

701
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,107
Great set.

702
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,508
Get a picture.

703
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,575
Don't take a picture, Bourke.

704
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,381
Tasty.

705
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,759
Jesus!

706
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,455
Fight! Fight! Fight!

707
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,867
You want to fight,
do it in the ring with gloves.

708
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,635
Friday, Embling.

709
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,704
You're lucky
Nicholson didn't come down.

710
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:28,444
You'd both be out of the show
altogether.

711
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,248
Finish getting dressed
and get up onstage.

712
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,917
Feeling OK?

713
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,061
Friday at five.

714
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,998
It was you, was it?

715
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,239
- Who with?
- The ham in the dress.

716
00:56:56,312 --> 00:57:00,009
Don't worry about him.
He's probably a fairy.

717
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,281
Don't turn up on Friday.

718
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,446
To what?

719
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,422
They're supposed
to finish it in the gym.

720
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,923
You're stupid if you do.

721
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,357
He's the top boxer
in the school.

722
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,226
I wondered if my old friend
Jean- Paul Sartre...

723
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,791
would have fought
in a situation like this.

724
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,100
I know Cassius would have.

725
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,663
I liked big Cassius.

726
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,209
I liked his poems.

727
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,246
He wasn't
built like Twiggy, though.

728
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,508
Every morning at the mine

729
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,016
You could see him arrive

730
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:39,350
He stood 6'6", weighed 245

731
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,688
Kind of broad at the shoulders

732
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,892
And narrow at the hip

733
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,664
Everybody knew
you didn't give no lip

734
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,671
To Big John

735
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,546
Telephone for Embling.

736
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,487
Go west, young man.

737
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:21,995
Big John

738
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,291
Big Bad John

739
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,933
If you go ahead with this...

740
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,236
I won't have any respect
for your intelligence at all.

741
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,776
Don't worry.
I'll see you on the weekend.

742
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,277
Good night.

743
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,447
In the red corner...

744
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,926
weighing in at 192 pounds...

745
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,293
Barry "Backa" Bourke.

746
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,932
Where is Bird?

747
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,469
He's probably chickened out.

748
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,767
No. Here he is.

749
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,775
Weighing in at 51/2 ounces...

750
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:10,279
the flea- weight champion
of the world...

751
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,814
Danny "Poofter" Embling.

752
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,093
Shut up.

753
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,500
Come on. There's only
half an hour till tea.

754
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,597
Embling will fall in one.

755
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:39,937
- You all right?
- Yeah.

756
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,172
- Shake hands.
- Good luck.

757
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:48,707
Back to your corners
and come out fighting.

758
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,912
It's not worth
risking brain damage.

759
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,716
Just kick him in the cods.

760
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,723
Honor will be satisfied.

761
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,394
Round one!

762
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,558
Come on, Backa! Come on!

763
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,206
Drop him!

764
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,376
Come on, Bird,
don't push him to the ground.

765
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,445
That's it. Come on, Backa.

766
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:54,978
Start jabbing to the right.
He'll go down.

767
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,541
Watch this.

768
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,611
You've put on a good show.
You're still on your feet.

769
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,919
- We'll pull out now.
- No.

770
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,618
Think of the brain cells.

771
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,661
You'll end up
a bloody jellyhead like him.

772
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,253
You're supposed to inspire me,
not demoralize me completely.

773
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,027
Round two!

774
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,240
Bourke, what are you doing?

775
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,333
Go. Come on, Backa!

776
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,190
Sonny Liston! Sonny Liston!

777
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,728
One... two...

778
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,931
three... four...

779
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,567
Want to call it a day?

780
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,203
Come on, Backa,
in for the kill!

781
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,096
One...

782
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,596
two...

783
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,293
three...

784
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,062
four...

785
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,104
five...

786
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,798
six...

787
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,204
seven...

788
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,208
eight...

789
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,579
Jean- Paul.

790
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,624
- Cigarette?
- No.

791
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,754
One... two...

792
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,813
three... four...

793
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,824
five... six...

794
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,860
seven... eight...

795
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,396
Stop it!

796
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,077
How can you do that?
Stand there and watch?

797
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,377
Come on.
He'll be all right.

798
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,120
OK, everyone. Off to tea.

799
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,357
You're dead, Backa.

800
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,893
Done like dinner.

801
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,902
We'll take him
to the dispensary.

802
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,734
Got a stretcher?

803
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,273
He'll be all right.

804
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,738
I tried to talk him out of it.

805
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,681
I know.

806
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,413
He's a trifle unstable
at times.

807
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,820
I try and be
the voice of reason.

808
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,756
You're a bit more sane...

809
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,384
like me, I think.

810
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,361
Aren't you?

811
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,727
I can be
pretty pig- headed, too.

812
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:05,995
So can I.
Big lapses I have sometimes.

813
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,401
I better go. Give him my love.

814
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,633
All right.

815
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,186
Just been
to the dispensary, sir.

816
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,746
What happened to you, Embling?

817
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,759
Get caught on
the wrong side of a bus?

818
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,261
Sort of like a bus, sir.

819
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,306
Certainly was different.

820
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,309
We thoroughly enjoyed it.

821
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,346
I've got some people
I'd like you to meet.

822
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,607
Mum, Dad,
this is Thandiwe Adjewa.

823
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,983
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

824
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,022
My parents, Danny Embling.

825
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,649
Solomon Adjewa,
my wife Letitia.

826
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,817
How do you do?

827
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:14,829
- Bruce and Sheila.
- Hello.

828
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,091
Marvelous music.

829
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,759
Yes. Sort of African,
isn't it?

830
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,462
Program says German.

831
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,906
The rhythms remind me
of that sort of thing.

832
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,411
Mr. Adjewa's lecturing
at the university in Canberra.

833
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,038
Do you know Canberra much?

834
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:35,914
I went to Parliament House
when I was a girl.

835
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:39,580
It still hasn't quite
found its feet as a city.

836
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,747
It's like Brasilia- -

837
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,087
built for politicians
more than people.

838
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,024
They built it there
because it was halfway...

839
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,527
between Melbourne and Sydney.

840
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:50,429
I've always thought
Brazil must be very interesting.

841
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,127
The furthest I've been
is New Guinea.

842
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,137
My husband fought there
during the war.

843
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,264
He never talks about it.

844
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,001
I'm not surprised.

845
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,204
It must be hard for
anyone else to understand...

846
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,906
how tough it was.

847
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,117
That's true.

848
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,222
We better make a move.

849
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,283
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

850
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,659
- Look after Thandiwe for us.
- We keep an eye on each other.

851
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,164
So we hear. Good- bye.

852
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,929
- Good- bye.
- Nice to meet you.

853
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:36,868
They seem nice.

854
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,005
What did you do to your eye?

855
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,709
- Football.
- You playing?

856
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,809
- What position?
- Wing.

857
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:47,515
Good one. I'll have to have
a talk to Tom Alcock.

858
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,957
Let him know he might
have a new recruit.

859
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,692
I'll just say good- bye
to Thandiwe.

860
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,964
- Can I see you tonight?
- Definitely.

861
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,165
What time?

862
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,234
One- thirty?

863
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,141
Nice girl.

864
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,185
Don't go beyond six.

865
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,951
You haven't known him
that long.

866
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:25,152
I'd say eight.

867
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,718
If you're going to risk
a midnight rendezvous...

868
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,457
might as well
make it worthwhile.

869
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,965
What's eight?

870
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,433
Top off, hands below.

871
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,436
Blissful.

872
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:39,270
Just don't get caught
with tissues down your bra.

873
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,309
You didn't tell me about that.

874
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,674
What did you say?

875
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,475
I said I had a cold
and didn't have any pockets.

876
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:46,708
Janet.

877
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:52,345
Can he be trusted, though...

878
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,481
not to go into No Man's Land?

879
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,219
No man can.

880
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,386
She can control him...

881
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,396
but can she control herself?

882
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:25,048
It's as cold as a concrete cot.

883
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,452
There's no way she'll turn up
if it's this cold.

884
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,385
You made any preparations?

885
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,793
- What do you mean?
- Don't be naive.

886
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:38,629
Think she'll risk meeting you
just for a chat?

887
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,261
She'll expect you
to have precautions.

888
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,929
Probably wants to reward you...

889
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,338
for taking a stand
in her self- defense.

890
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,769
One thing...

891
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,645
remember her needs
as well as yours.

892
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,311
In the long run,
they're more important.

893
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,752
If you can give her pleasure...

894
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,847
she'll be back for more.

895
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,360
See you, Gilbert.

896
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,028
Oh, God!

897
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,898
My parents
are going back to Uganda.

898
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,132
Some kind of crisis.

899
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,041
They want me
to finish the year here.

900
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,973
I'm worried for them.

901
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,577
My father has so many enemies.

902
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,347
So much corruption
he's always writing about.

903
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,089
Sad.

904
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,227
There was real hope
in our country.

905
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,460
Do you mind if we just
kiss and touch a bit...

906
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:47,756
and leave it at that?

907
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,956
Sure.

908
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,784
Welcome.

909
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,096
Women's clothes...

910
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,434
are much better designed
for this sort of thing.

911
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,166
You must get
all squashed up in there.

912
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,153
It can get...

913
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,291
pretty tricky sometimes.

914
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,951
When it's big?

915
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,431
Yeah, if it's like...

916
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,161
when you're in church
or something.

917
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,260
Does it happen there?

918
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,570
It can happen anywhere.

919
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,009
Aren't bodies strange?

920
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,080
You'd better stop.

921
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,621
Why?

922
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,825
Sorry.

923
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,386
I don't mind.

924
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,870
I couldn't stop it.

925
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:41,034
Sorry, I'm so...

926
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,272
Sticky?

927
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,813
We both are.

928
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,156
You're beautiful.

929
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,328
I think you are, too.

930
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:35,994
Where have you been?

931
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,424
To the bathroom.

932
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,833
Do you always
get dressed to do that?

933
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:44,930
It was cold.

934
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,771
I looked in before,
and your bed was empty.

935
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,674
Where have you been?

936
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,305
I went for a walk.
I couldn't sleep.

937
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,214
Turn around.

938
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,549
Your back is filthy.

939
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,192
Follow me.

940
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,300
You want a milk drink
or something?

941
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,302
No, thank you.

942
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,735
Sit down.

943
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,345
Were you seeing Danny Embling?

944
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,318
I heard about his fight.

945
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,479
It sounded awful.

946
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:37,184
Told Jock Blair what I thought
of him for letting it happen.

947
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,251
I told another friend
to keep an eye on Danny.

948
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,661
He can look after himself.

949
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,756
Anyway,
you shouldn't be running off...

950
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,858
in the middle of the night
to see him.

951
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,130
You could be picked up
by the police...

952
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,035
end up being expelled.

953
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,934
So...

954
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,545
what did you
actually do together?

955
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:05,750
I beg your pardon?

956
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,725
No. It's all right.

957
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,726
You don't have to tell me.

958
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,861
I think,
if I liked somebody enough...

959
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,870
I'd want to.

960
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,573
Have you ever?

961
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,071
Of course not.

962
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:35,710
Almost?

963
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,421
Well...

964
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:46,088
do you remember the young guy
who was fixing the bell tower?

965
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:55,693
I took him a cup of tea
each morning before assembly.

966
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:59,207
I liked him,
even though he never said much.

967
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:04,378
I used to...

968
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,310
close my eyes...

969
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:11,113
and sit on a chair...

970
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,719
and let him touch me all over.

971
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,819
As long as he promised
not to take anything off.

972
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:26,894
I thought I was so exquisitely
daring I'd almost faint.

973
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:28,333
I'd have to sit down.

974
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:31,600
I'd be trembling so much,
my legs would've given way.

975
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,766
Afterwards,
I'd be reading the lesson...

976
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,777
convinced
all the teachers must know...

977
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,278
because I was so...

978
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,582
so shivery delicious all over.

979
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,749
I'm amazed.

980
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,821
So am I when I think of it...

981
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:58,798
which I do most of the time,
especially in maths.

982
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:03,934
So...

983
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,766
here's to risks.

984
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,609
Not again.
We had it on Friday, sir.

985
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,114
Come on, boys.
It's good food.

986
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,548
Good to make you
constipated, sir.

987
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,109
An expert, are you, Green?

988
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,018
He broke the record
at Cadet camp, sir.

989
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,556
What record?

990
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,921
Ten days without going
to the toilet, sir.

991
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,584
It was the latrines, sir.
They were putrid.

992
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,753
- Thank you, Green.
- Even the flies were fainting.

993
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:04,697
That's enough.
This is good energy food.

994
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,233
That's what Embling needs.
Give him heaps.

995
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,532
- Why is that, Embling?
- Don't know, sir.

996
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,538
Looks a bit tired,
don't you reckon, sir?

997
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,973
Looks all right to me,
apart from his black eye.

998
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:17,841
- What are you reading, Green?
- Nothing, sir.

999
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,814
- Give us a look.
- It's a note from my mother.

1000
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:22,873
- Come on.
- It's intensely personal.

1001
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,519
What's this about?

1002
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:39,431
"Embling scored last night
with Lubra lips."

1003
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,934
Who's Lubra lips?

1004
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,670
Don't know, sir.

1005
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,330
What are you burning for,
Embling?

1006
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,500
Shut up. You wouldn't know
what scoring was.

1007
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:51,512
Perhaps you can tell us
what it is, Bourke.

1008
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,845
Lubra lips
is what we call Fedderson.

1009
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,885
Played Embling at table tennis.
Lost 21- love.

1010
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:02,453
That's very ingenious for you,
Bourke.

1011
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,634
I'll see you
in my office, Green.

1012
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:28,177
I had the longest letter yet
today from Gilby.

1013
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,877
Twenty- three pages.

1014
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,782
It's like "Wuthering Heights."

1015
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,878
I'll bet Heathcliff
had a long tongue.

1016
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,387
Miss Anderson wants to see you
in her office right away!

1017
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:45,732
This is Dr. Pierce...

1018
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,735
a colleague of your father's
from the university.

1019
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:50,737
Apparently,
your father was arrested...

1020
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:52,864
shortly after he arrived.

1021
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,499
What's happened to him?

1022
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,942
I spoke briefly
to your mother this morning.

1023
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,172
The line was very bad.

1024
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,807
The situation's confused,
but we think he's all right.

1025
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,976
I have to go back.

1026
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:07,112
There's nothing to be gained
by doing that.

1027
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,351
You'll only be
putting yourself in danger.

1028
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,859
My stepmother
could also be arrested.

1029
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,862
She's a writer, too.

1030
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,864
And there's
my brother and sister.

1031
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,365
They're nine and ten.

1032
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,867
We've requested the Department
of Foreign Affairs...

1033
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,404
to inquire into
your father's safety.

1034
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,466
I have to go.

1035
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,275
I can't get a flight
until the day after...

1036
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,443
but I'm not telling them that.

1037
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,316
Miss Anderson thinks
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1038
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,821
Yeah, I understand.

1039
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,072
Come on, girls!

1040
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,439
Hold it!

1041
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,475
That's good!

1042
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,412
We'll miss you terribly.

1043
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,848
You have to write
at least every week.

1044
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,948
Hurry up, Thandiwe. The train
leaves in half an hour.

1045
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,856
You know you're leaving
against my advice.

1046
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,266
We have no embassy
in your country.

1047
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,769
The Foreign Affairs
Department...

1048
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,772
says you can contact
the British Legation...

1049
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,273
if you need any help.

1050
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,672
Thank you.

1051
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,473
We do wish you a safe journey.

1052
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:53,292
I don't think Fate
is a creature or a lady...

1053
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,762
like some people say.

1054
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:59,231
It's a tide of events
sweeping us along.

1055
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,962
But I'm not a fatalist...

1056
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,939
because I believe
you can swim against it...

1057
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,341
and sometimes grasp
the hands of the clock face...

1058
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,040
and steal
a few precious minutes.

1059
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,248
If you don't...

1060
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,617
you're just cartwheeled along.

1061
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:24,920
Before you know it,
the magic opportunity's lost.

1062
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:27,587
And for the rest of your life...

1063
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:29,027
it lingers on
in that part of your mind...

1064
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:33,397
which dreams
the very best dreams...

1065
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:36,369
taunting and tantalizing you
with what might have been.

1066
01:24:58,726 --> 01:24:59,852
Name?

1067
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,158
Camus.

1068
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:05,495
- Huh?
- C- a- m- u- s.

1069
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:11,332
Room for one night
with a double bed.

1070
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,271
That's right.

1071
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,549
Number 306.

1072
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,250
Thanks.

1073
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,217
Should keep the world out.

1074
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,620
Here we are.

1075
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,235
Guess what I've got.

1076
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,603
Nicola made herself
look about twenty- five...

1077
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,336
went out and got it for me.

1078
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,968
Nicola Radcliffe?

1079
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:44,228
I often think how all of us...

1080
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,631
were going through
the normal grubby business...

1081
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,192
of school and growing up...

1082
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,466
while
the most incredible things...

1083
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,700
were happening in her world...

1084
01:26:55,877 --> 01:27:00,246
but she liked me enough
to do this...

1085
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,942
to say good- bye.

1086
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,856
It's Dr. Pierce from
the university on the phone.

1087
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,721
She wants to speak to Thandiwe.

1088
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,092
I told her she'd gone, and
now she wants to talk to you.

1089
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,803
But she's not leaving tomorrow.

1090
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:30,241
She left on the train
this afternoon.

1091
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,939
So much for
this food- poisoning business.

1092
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,505
Embling hasn't been
to the dispensary.

1093
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:39,519
So it looks like
he's with this African girl.

1094
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,578
She's changed her train ticket
to tomorrow...

1095
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:43,681
so they're probably
still in the area.

1096
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:45,919
Lubra lips.

1097
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,985
Nothing.

1098
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,622
Having kittens over
at Cirencester.

1099
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:55,567
Don't want to tell the police.
Cause the most terrible row.

1100
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:59,038
There can't be too many hotels
in this town.

1101
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:14,307
You'd better get dressed.

1102
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,574
Hurry up.

1103
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:20,341
Will you pass me my clothes,
please?

1104
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:30,253
Get dressed in the bathroom,
for goodness sake.

1105
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:54,673
Your parents will be
very disappointed in you.

1106
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,944
Seems like you haven't
learned very much at all...

1107
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:58,815
while you've been with us.

1108
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,629
Aren't they all funny?

1109
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:19,968
Aren't they?

1110
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,074
I think we'd better go.

1111
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,612
Yes. I'm ready.

1112
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,122
You keep
this half of the world going.

1113
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,095
You look after the other!

1114
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:44,990
I realized I hadn't any idea
what she'd gone back to.

1115
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,628
Her letters came every week.

1116
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:52,792
She told me about an army
officer called Idi Amin...

1117
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:56,303
and how her stepmother
had disappeared...

1118
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,463
and she was looking after
her brother and sister.

1119
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:03,334
We read in the papers
her father had been executed.

1120
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,778
Then the letters stopped.

1121
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,832
After I was expelled...

1122
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:34,068
I went back home
and worked in my dad's pub.

1123
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:40,238
I was a bit like a sleepwalker.

1124
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:42,009
Here you go. Kev.

1125
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,711
The old town
hardly seemed real anymore.

1126
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:49,086
I spent my time
writing to embassies...

1127
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,181
and government ministers...

1128
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:52,725
even the prime minister.

1129
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:57,663
But mostly...

1130
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,757
I concentrated.

1131
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:07,333
An ether surrounds the world...

1132
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,639
washing over us all the time...

1133
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:13,737
and all sorts of messages
get transmitted through it.

1134
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:21,180
I had this dread
I'd suddenly know she'd gone.

1135
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:25,589
I spent most of the time
willing her to be all right...

1136
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,493
sending...

1137
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,325
love, I suppose.

1138
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:35,227
That word neither of us
had used because...

1139
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:37,566
we were both too cool for that.

1140
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,043
"Danny...

1141
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:25,211
"we're in Nairobi now
and finally safe.

1142
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:28,380
"A lot of things have happened.

1143
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:32,756
"I'm very different to how
I was when you last knew me...

1144
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,624
"but I'm waiting for the time...

1145
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:40,531
"we'll sit down together
and look into each other's eyes.

more than I can say."

1148
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:03,688
there were
much bigger worlds again...

1149
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,727
and some small place in them
for me.
