1237
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:30,940
* But it's still your call *

1238
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,210
* But we all play it *

1239
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:38,150
* sometimes we win
sometimes we fall *

1240
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:42,160
* But there's no reason
just to give it up *

1241
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:45,060
* 'Cause after all *

1242
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:48,660
* If you can't choose
what to be *

1243
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:52,070
* You can choose
what to dream *

1244
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,470
* And I believe *

1245
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,310
* Oh, yeah, I believe *

1246
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,460
* Oh *

1247
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,960
* If you can't choose
what to be *

1248
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:20,360
* You can choose
what to dream *

1249
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:22,400
* And I believe *

1250
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:26,300
* I believe in love *

1251
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:29,400
* It's the best
of everything *

1252
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:33,310
* I believe in hope *

1253
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,610
* And the changes
it can bring *

1254
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:44,280
* If you believe that nothing
can stand in your way *

1255
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,620
* Just say *

1256
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:51,060
* Oh, I believe *

1257
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,880
* Do you believe *

1258
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:31,760
* Would you believe me
if I said I'd never lie *

1259
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,600
* Though it ain't easy
I can tell you I have tried *

1260
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,700
* But I gotta say
that it comes those days *

1261
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:40,010
* That I told
something untrue *

1262
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:44,170
* Would you forgive me
if I said I'd lied to you *

1263
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:53,620
* This is my fear
to tell you what I've done *

1264
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:57,460
* As things come clear
I'm afraid that you'll be gone *

1265
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,550
* But all I know
is if you go *

1266
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:01,960
* At least
I've told what's true *

1267
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:05,990
* Hope you'll forgive me
when I say I've lied to you *

1268
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:11,600
* Yeah, I'm burning up *

1269
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,610
* I'm burning for you *

1270
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,910
* When the truth
has been spoken *

1271
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,610
* There's nothing to do *

1272
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,210
* Yes, I'm burning up *
* Burning up *

1273
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:23,310
* I'm burning for you *

1274
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,480
* When the truth
has been spoken *

1275
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,150
* There's nothing to do
Oh, yeah *

1276
01:49:45,110 --> 01:49:47,340
* Yes, I'm burning up *
* I'm burning up *

1277
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:51,680
* I'm burning up *
* I'm burning up *

1278
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:56,150
* I'm burning up *
* I'm burning up *

1279
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:00,020
* Yes, I'm burning up *
* I'm burning up *

1280
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:03,250
* That's right
Yes, I am *
* Oh, I'm burning up *

1281
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:06,730
* I'm burning up *
* Oh, I'm burning up *

1282
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,460
* I'm burning up *
* I'm burning up *

1283
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,970
* Oh *
