1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,250
OK

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Thanks.

3
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Could you help me?

4
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,299
Did Marius gave you this fish bowl, like this?

5
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,300
There are other fish.

6
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,299
What a weird picture.

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,299
Listen, can you ask Daniela to feed them while we're away?

8
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
They're just fish. Nothing can happen if they are not fed a couple of days.

9
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Did you take the toothpaste?

10
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Yes, and some cotton absorbent too. You'll get another.

11
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,300
-Do you have some soap left? -Check in the drawer.

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,299
-There is no more.

13
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,299
-I'll get it for you. I'll be out for cigarettes anyway.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,300
-Get some Amo or Lux. No more Palmolive, I got dandruff because of it.

15
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,300
-Could you go to Petronela and get my hairdryer?

16
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,299
-You're packing as if you're mountain tripping.

17
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
-Do you have any money left?

18
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,300
-Check the jeans. It's a wallet in the back pocket.

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,299
-That's where you keep your money, in a wallet?

20
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,300
-Better than hanging out of the pockets like you're used to.

21
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
-Close the damn door. It's windy.

22
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,300
-Did you see Petronela? -She was in the shower earlier.

23
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,299
-Hot water? -Yup

24
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,300
-Petronela? -Not in here.

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,299
-Otilia? -Yea.

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
-What is it?

27
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,300
-The teacher noticed you were not around on Thursday.

28
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,300
-Didn't I ask you to bail me out?

29
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,299
-I tried. But she said she heard that one two weeks ago.

30
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,300
-She said you'd better bring a waiver. -I will

31
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,300
-Does she smoke? - Vikent.

32
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,300
-It's open.

33
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
-Morning. Did you start already?

34
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
-It's Wednesday. With the lecturer.

35
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
-'The thorn birds' with Richard Chamberlain. Tonight if you want.

36
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,299
-How is Gabi? -She's depilating.

37
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,300
-I want an Assos and a Kent. -Don't have Kent.

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,300
-Where can I find some? - You can't, I got some Marlboro instead.

39
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,300
- What am I to do with it? Give me an Assos and a Lux.

40
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
-Anything else? -A Tic-tac. An orange one.

41
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,300
-The tic-tac is on me. -Thanks.

42
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,300
-If you change your mind, you're welcome tonight. Ramona is coming too.

43
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,300
-Not really.

44
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
-They're so cute. Are they yours?

45
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
-No, I found them yesterday near the power station. Do you want one?

46
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
-I can't. Gabitza is allergic to cats.

47
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,299
-What do you feed them? - Some dumplings yesterday night.

48
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
- I'll get some powder milk for them. - Thanks.

49
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,300
-Hey girls. Tell Gabi her father phoned and said he'll be here tomorrow around 10.

50
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
-I'll tell her. -Thanks.

51
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
-Your father called. He'll be here. -Damn.

52
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
-Did you tell your parents? -Tell them what?

53
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,300
-He's supposed to be here at 10.

54
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,299
-I can't figure out what to do about this exam.

55
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,299
- You'll take it another day.

56
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,300
-Should I take some notes to read?

57
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
-No point to do that.

58
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,300
-Didn't you have some powder milk? -It's in the Nescafe can.

59
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
-How much do I owe you? -80.

60
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,300
-Here is the powder milk.

61
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,299
-Is it a girl? -Yup.

62
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,299
-How much is rexona? - 50

63
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,300
- Do you have Kent? -No, ask Radu.

64
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,300
-And the blister? -25.

65
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,299
-Progesterol. Is it good?

66
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,299
-German, made in Hungary under license.

67
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,299
-How come you know?

68
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,300
-My cousin told me. She uses them, not me.  I'm too fat anyway

69
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,299
-Expensive. Do you find any buyers?

70
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,300
-No doubt about it. Instantly.

71
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,300
-I'm leaving. I have to dye my hair. Red head

72
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
-Really? -Kidding, actually I put on nut concoction cause my hair is thinning

73
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
-Hey, can you tell Petronela to bring the hair dryer?

74
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,299
-She's taking an exam. I'll bring it later.

75
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,300
-Bye, good luck. -Bye

76
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,300
-When are you going to meet Adi? -At 11.

77
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,300
-I think I have fever. -Take an aspirin.

78
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,299
-I think it's my bad tooth. I need painkillers. Vial painkillers.

79
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,300
-Check the kit. Maybe there is some left.

80
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,299
-What a bad timing. I have an appointment at the dentist.

81
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,300
-No time for that.

82
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
-Can I ask you something? -Say it.

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,299
-Could you deal with the money part? You know I am not even able to bribe a ticket collector.

84
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,300
-I'll deal with it.

85
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,299
-Here is the money, count it.-2700, right?

86
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,300
-Yes.

87
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,299
-My stomach aches. -Eat something.

88
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
- Eat what? I can't eat anything.

89
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,300
-Don't worry. Everything will be all right.

90
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,300
-Come on, enough. Bye

91
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
-Don't turn back. It bodes bad. -I forgot the address.

92
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,300
-Stop being superstitious. You're not from the country side.

93
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,299
-You know something, I'll bring some notes with me after all.

94
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,300
-Then bring them.

95
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,300
-Tickets please! Let me see your tickets please.

96
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,299
-Do you have a spare ticket? - No.

97
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,300
-Tickets please

98
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,300
-Excuse me. Did Ady get in?

99
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,299
-What are you doing? Learning?

100
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,299
-Perusing those abstracts.

101
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
-Did anyone get in?

102
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,300
-It started late. They couldn't find the key to the classroom.

103
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,299
-Stop. Your classmates can see us.

104
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,300
-So what? - I'm embarrassed.

105
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,299
-Listen, Diana asked if we wanted to swap the trips.

106
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,299
-So that she goes to Izvor and we go to Costinesti.

107
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,300
-The same timetable? -Not really.

108
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,299
- 7-14 Izvor, 15-22 Costinesti,

109
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,300
-I have the last exam on the sixth.

110
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,299
-Then I'll have to go home for a week and then return.

111
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,300
-I don't know, it's rather complicated.

112
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
-You did remember about the money, didn't you? -Yea, sure.

113
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,299
- You give it  to me in an envelope or what?

114
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,300
- I wanted to keep it separated from the money for the flowers.

115
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,300
- 300, right? - I'll give it back when I get my scholarship.

116
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,299
- Are you hungry? Do you want me to get you something?

117
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,299
- My mother packed some cookies for me.

118
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,299
-She woke up in the morning to make cookies for you?

119
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
-She woke up to prepare the meringue cake, cause after 8 the gas pressure drops.

120
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
- Please get the flowers for my mother. I think I'll be stranded here all day.

121
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,300
- I don't think I...  can make it.

122
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
- Where...?  Are you telling me you won't be able to attend my mother's birthday?

123
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,300
- Don't be angry with me. - I am. She's making your favorite cake and you don't come?

124
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,299
- You told her to make it for me? -I did, and she made the cake.

125
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
- It's just that I can't, not that I don't want to.

126
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,300
- What do you mean you can't? What is it you have to do? Say it.

127
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,300
- I can't tell you now. You can't tell me now?

128
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,300
-Don't you trust me? Say it if you don't.

129
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
- It's not about that. I just don't understand why you can't come. Do you keep secrets from me?

130
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,299
- I have no secrets. I'll tell you later, that's all.

131
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,300
- Why is it such an issue?

132
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
- Ok, if you don't find it an issue, I don't know what else to say.

133
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,299
- If I had to come to your place for the first time and I had forgotten about it, that would have been an issue.

134
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,300
- Come on, I don't want to argue with you.

135
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,300
- Who started it? I asked to get some flowers for my mother and you say you don't want to come.

136
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,300
- Fine, I'll come. I 'll find a way and I'll make it.

137
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,299
- You're making me a favor now. - Hey, will you stop? do you want me to come or not?

138
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,300
- The professor would like you to speak a little lower, ok?

139
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,300
- What kind of flowers do you want? - Don't take  anything.

140
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,300
- Tell me. Do you want carnations?

141
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
- Get some gladiolas. - How many?

142
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,299
- 48. - I can't, they're even.

143
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,300
- Then how many? - Don't know. 49 maybe.

144
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,300
- She'll say I don't her age if I get 49.

145
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
- Who's counting, anyway? - You don't know my mother.

146
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,300
- Get 47 then. I don't know. Do as you please. I'll just take how many you want.

147
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,300
- Ok, I'll manage one way or another and I'll come.

148
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
- Listen, we won't get too formal, are we?

149
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
- No, you'll come good and proper. At 5.

150
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,300
No delays

151
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,299
- You're starting to annoy me. I'm never late.

152
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,300
- Unless something unforeseen pops up, in which case everybody is late.

153
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,299
- Ady, do you your report card with you? They won't allow us without it. - Yes

154
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
- I'm leaving.

155
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,300
-  What's the time? - Past twenty. Do you need mine?

156
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,299
- No, no , keep it.

157
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
- See you later.

158
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
- Don't you kiss me? - No, cause you've upset me

159
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,299
- Don't upset me anymore. - You too.

160
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
- Bye. - Bye.

161
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,299
- How can I get a pack of Kent cigarettes?

162
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
- Why didn't you tell me. I would have brought it for you.

163
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,300
- I need it for Gabi. Go to Unirea, you'll find some black marketers.

164
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,300
- Bye.

165
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,299
- Hello.

166
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,299
- I'm listening.

167
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
- I have a booking. On the name Dragut.

168
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,299
- You have a booking here. Since when?

169
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,299
- Today. Tonight, I mean.

170
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,299
- What I want to know is when did you made it?.

171
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,300
- Since last Tuesday.

172
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,300
- There is nothing here.

173
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,299
- A friend of mine made it. I know for sure it was Monday, or Tuesday.

174
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
- Do you know who did she talked to?

175
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
- No, but I 've heard she gave her name and address.

176
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,299
- What was the name again?

177
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,300
- Dragut.

178
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,300
- Nope. There is no Dragut in here.

179
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,300
- Listen, go find Nelu for me.

180
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,299
- Maybe my colleague knows you.

181
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
- I told you it wasn't me who booked the room.

182
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,299
- My friend called and a man answered.

183
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,300
- On the phone. So she didn't come here personally?

184
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,299
- I don't know exactly. I guess she called.

185
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,300
- Anyone can call.

186
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,299
- Was the reservation confirmed? Yesterday?

187
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,300
- What to confirm it for?

188
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
- I would really like you to talk in a civilized manner.

189
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,299
- The reservation has to be confirmed at least 24 hours prior.

190
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,299
- The man she talk to didn't mention anything like this.

191
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,300
- I doubt he didn't.

192
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,300
- Nelu....

193
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,300
No... It hurts.

194
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,299
There is someone here who says you've booked a room for her yesterday.

195
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,299
- Not yesterday, Tuesday.

196
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
- Or Tuesday.

197
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
- Ok, What was the name again?

198
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,299
- Dragut.

199
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,300
- Dragut(Nice), ha, that's the name all right.

200
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,299
- Yea, thanks.

201
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,300
- Listen, could you call me if they send the pay check?

202
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,300
- Ok, fine.

203
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
- No, if the reservation had been made I would have find it.

204
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,299
- So, what do we do now?

205
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,300
- Do what now?

206
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,299
- Is anyone serving in the shop?

207
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,299
- In a minute.

208
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,300
- We really need a room. Please, let's tackle this

209
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,299
- Tackle what miss? There is a delegation from Bucharest who arrived yesterday. The whole place is full.

210
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,299
- Do you understand?

211
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,300
- Anything. I don't mind if it has 3 beds.

212
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,300
- Can't you understand Romanian? It seems you don't.

213
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,299
- Do you have Kent?

214
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,300
- 80, a pack.

215
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,300
- We have a delegation on the way. See what you can do.

216
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
- Ok, I can't talk anymore. I call you back. Bye, bye.

217
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
- I'm listening.

218
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
- Hello. I'd like a room starting tonight.

219
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,299
- Tonight?

220
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,299
- Yes, please.

221
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,299
- Everything is taken.

222
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,299
- I don't mind if it has 3 beds.

223
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,300
- Can you call Marcu here, please.

224
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,300
- How many nights?

225
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,300
- Two, but it could take longer.

226
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,300
- Today... not really.

227
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
We have a room but starting tomorrow

228
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,299
- But we really need it tonight, please.

229
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,300
- How many? - Two.

230
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,300
- With double bed. - Doesn't matter.

231
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
- Yes? - Go to the bar and get two coffees to that table.

232
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,299
- Is it neckezol or ness?

233
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,300
- Just go. She knows what to give you.

234
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Tell her it's for me.

235
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,300
- I can't spell the name, Miha...  - Mihatescu with a T.

236
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
- So, can you help me?

237
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,299
- I don't really know. He hasn't confirmed the reservation until now, but still...

238
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,300
- Please, I'm begging you.

239
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,299
- It's a double bed, did I tell you?

240
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
- It's ok.

241
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,300
- Do you have an ID?

242
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,299
- You have a temporary address here. Are you a student?

243
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,299
- Yes

244
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
- If you stay at the student hostel why do you need a room here?

245
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,300
- We're six in the room. During exams it gets kind of crowdy.

246
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,299
- Two persons.

247
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,550
- Yes

248
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
But if you don't pay the whole room I might have to bring in someone else.

249
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
- You better change this ID. The Police won't be happy with this.

250
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
- I forgot it in the jeans when I washed them, that's why it's not clear.

251
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,299
- The other person? Dragut(Nice).

252
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,299
- That's the actual name, Dragut.

253
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,299
- Is she a lady also?

254
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,300
- Yes,

255
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
she has that problem at school too... Dragut Gabriela.

256
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
- Excuse me, how much you charge a night?

257
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
- It's there for all to see. Double bed, 62 lei.

258
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,300
- Can't we pay for only one night?

259
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,299
- I've already given you someone else's reservation. If you don't like it...

260
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,300
- Fine, fine.

261
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,299
- Your day starts at 12. When you’re not in the room, you leave the key at the counter.

262
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,299
- Ok.

263
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Thanks.

264
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,300
- P 14. Hello.

265
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,300
- I'm not sure she's here anymore.

266
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,300
- Ok , I'll go. Will you wait over the phone?

267
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,299
- Gabitza?

268
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,299
- I've got the room

269
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,300
- But not at Unirea, at Tineretului.

270
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
- She said it was no reservation, nothing.

271
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,300
- I told them, but...

272
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,299
- That's the way it is.

273
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,300
He'll understand.

274
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,300
- Listen, the room costs here 186 lei.

275
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,300
- It's a double bed. I couldn't find anything better.

276
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,300
- Why didn't you look for a room yourself? You're starting to annoy me.

277
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
- Listen, find someone to lend you another 200 lei.

278
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
You're a big girl, you’ll manage.

279
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,300
- Just go and ask. Go.

280
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
- I'll leave the key at the counter, ok?

281
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
- Listen, how can I recognise that man?

282
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,300
- How can he recognise me?

283
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,300
- Are you insane, Gabitza?

284
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
How is he going to recognise me, if you described yourself?

285
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
- You are something, you know.

286
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Ok, I'll see what I can do.

287
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
- Be sure you have your ID with you.

288
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,600
- Bye, bye.

289
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
- Excuse me. No 24?

290
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
- Who are you looking for?

291
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
- I'm supposed to meet someone here. He gave me this address. Decebal, 24.

292
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,599
- Did you see anyone waiting here?

293
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,599
- No.

294
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,599
- Is there a man called Bebe working here?

295
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
- Bebe who?

296
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
- Don't know. All I know is he's mr. Bebe.

297
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
- Don't know. Ask the boys at the service.

298
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,600
But I don't know any Bebe here.

299
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,599
- Excuse me. Mr Bebe?

300
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
- Miss Gabi?

301
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,599
- She couldn't make it. She's not very well

302
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,599
- My name is Otilia.

303
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,600
- We agreed on the phone she will come.

304
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,599
- I know. That's why I was afraid we won't recognise each other.

305
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,599
- I tried to ask some people.

306
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
- Ask what?

307
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
-If there was someone waiting for me.

308
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,599
- Cause I was late and I thought I lost you.

309
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
- We're going with your car?

310
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
- Where is she? - At the hotel, she's waiting for us.

311
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
- Shut the door properly.

312
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,599
- Do you work here?

313
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,599
- Where do I work?

314
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
- Just asking.

315
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
- May I smoke in here?

316
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,599
- Miss, listen here.

317
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
- I have nothing to hide.

318
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
- You've seen, I've come with my car, you can note the license plates if you want.

319
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
- But, let me tell you something. I work by trust here.

320
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,599
- I look at the person and I can tell if it's going to work or not.

321
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
- You can trust me, really.

322
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
- She didn't feel all right and she couldn't come.

323
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,599
- We tried to contact you through Ramona, but she went home.

324
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,600
- And we had no phone number of yours to contact you.

325
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,599
At what hotel are you lodged?

326
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,600
- Tineretului.

327
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,600
- Listen, When I talk to your friend, I had a request.

328
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,600
- To book a room at Unirea or Moldova.

329
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,599
- She told me. But if there weren't any room what was I to do?

330
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I had a hard time even at Tineretului until  I got the room.

331
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,599
- Has your sister done this previously?

332
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,599
- My sister? No.

333
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,599
- How old is she?

334
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,599
-22, She'll be 23 this march.

335
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,599
- Many happy returns of the day

336
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,599
- Do you live together?

337
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,599
- Yes.

338
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,599
- You're not from here, are you?

339
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,599
- No.

340
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,599
- Where are you from?

341
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
- Campulung.

342
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,599
- Never been there.

343
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,599
- You didn't miss anything.

344
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,599
- Do you have a rented room?

345
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,599
- No, at the hostel.

346
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,600
- How is it there?

347
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,599
- Lot of noise. You can hardly learn.

348
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,599
- Where do you study?

349
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
- Polytechnics

350
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,599
- Not bad, you don't have to go to the country side.

351
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
- Yea, right.

352
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
- I have to make a detour to drop something.

353
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,600
- Wait here.

354
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,600
- What are you doing outside?

355
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,599
- How many times did I tell you not to go out when I'm missing?

356
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,599
- Why did you have to go out?

357
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
- Miss Iancu told me they brought sugar at...

358
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,599
- Forget the sugar. What do you need that for?

359
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,599
- It's not for me.

360
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
- I don't any sugar, understand?

361
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
- I just don't want to see you out, you drive me crazy.

362
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
- It's the third time this month you lock yourself outside.

363
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,599
- The wind slamed the door.

364
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,600
- The fucking wind, huh?

365
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,599
- Here it is. Lose this one too, cause this is the last I have.

366
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
- Don't worry son, I won't lose it.

367
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,599
- Why do you have to get in the street, what do you need?

368
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
- Do you want to catch a cold or what?

369
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,599
- Miss Iancu had to go to the complex so as not to lose her place in the line.

370
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
- So why didn't she let you in the house?

371
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,599
She was afraid you'd steal from her?

372
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
- No, no.... - I'll have a talk with her too.

373
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,599
Now get in the house.

374
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,599
-But she kept a place in the line for me.

375
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
- Forget the line. Go inside.

376
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
- Ok, I'll go. - Right now. So I can see you getting in.

377
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,599
- Don't you need anything to eat?

378
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,600
- Just go in and forget the rest.

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,999
- Viorel, someone called you on the phone.

380
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
- On the phone?

381
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
How many times do I have to tell you not to answear the phone when I'm away?

382
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,999
- Hey, where do you think you're going?

383
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,999
- 206, It has already been paid for.

384
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,999
- Didn't anyone tell you to leave the key at the counter when you leave the hotel?

385
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
- There is someone in the room waiting for us.

386
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
- What's the number? -206

387
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,299
- Dragut Gabriela? -Yes.

388
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,300
- She's already in the room.

389
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,299
- And him? - He's visting.

390
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,299
- Didn't they tell you visits have to be anounced? Do you think you can come in just like that?

391
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,299
- I thought only after 22.

392
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,300
- Your colleague told me

393
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,299
- You didn't understand. If he stays after 22 he has to pay the room.

394
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,299
Visits have to be anounced regardless.

395
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,299
- Do you have an ID?

396
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
- May I take these?

397
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,300
- You take it when you come down.

398
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,300
- 206.

399
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,300
- Gabitza?

400
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm with mr Bebe.

401
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,299
- Hello. Gabriela. - Hello

402
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,300
- Come in.

403
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,299
- Did you get the money?

404
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,300
- When?

405
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,299
- Want a coffee? - No, thanks.

406
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,299
- Some cookies? - No.

407
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
- They are good, home made.

408
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,300
- Take a seat, please.

409
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,299
- It's good you've meet.

410
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,299
- I thought you wouldn't recognise each other.

411
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
- Miss, I think we've started all wrong.

412
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,300
- I've head two requests over the phone.

413
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,299
- Firsly, book a room at Unirea or Moldova.

414
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
- Secondly, to show up alone.

415
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,300
- Do you think I told you this, just to....

416
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,300
- No. I understood what you asked, but I couldn't find anywhere else.

417
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,299
- Miss, you couldn't find. Then we should have meet when you found.

418
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,300
- Now, my ID is downstairs.

419
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,299
- I'm sorry.

420
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,300
- You can be sorry all you want but my ID is at the counter.

421
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,299
- I thought I'd better not postpone it anymore. I already did that too many times.

422
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,299
- What month are you?

423
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,299
- The third.

424
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,300
- You said the second on the phone.

425
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,300
- When we talked I was in the second. Now I'm in the third.

426
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,299
- What blood type do you have?

427
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,300
- 0 I

428
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,300
- Are you hypotensive?

429
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,299
- No... I don't...

430
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,300
- Are you allergic to anything?

431
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,299
- Just to cat hair. Not to much. Some redness around the neck, that's all.

432
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,299
- Are you going to use anaesthetics?

433
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,299
- Miss...

434
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,300
- I'm asking cause I don't really know how it's done.

435
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
- A friend of mine who also... interrupted that she has been administered anaesthetics

436
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,300
- Have you ever had an abortion?

437
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,300
We didn't agree to that and it's no need for that.

438
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,300
I just place a probe in and a spontaneous abortion ensues.

439
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,299
Of course, there is some bleeding, we have to be cautious with the haemorhage

440
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,550
but there is no anaesthesia involved

441
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,599
I mean it doesn't hurt that bad so it doesn't need anaesthetics.

442
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
And more there are no facilities here.

443
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,600
You make perform anaesthesia in a hospital, not whereever you like.

444
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,600
It's very important to stand still all the time the probe is in.

445
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,599
so as not to break off or fall cause I'm not inserting it again.

446
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I put it once and that's it, understood?

447
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
How did you think it's going to be?

448
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,599
I thought you made up your mind since you've called me.

449
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,599
- I did, but...

450
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
- But what?

451
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Miss, we're not playing here.

452
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
We could end up in jail for what we're doing here.

453
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Just that I' ll be worse.

454
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
We're not playing, ok?

455
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Once we let it roll there is no turning back.

456
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,599
If everything goes right, after I place the probe, bleeding will occur,

457
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
and you will expel the foetus.

458
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,600
It's very important how you act afterwards

459
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
You need someone to help you, because the haemorhage may be heavy.

460
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,599
And God forbid you spill blood all over the place, cause we're in big trouble then.

461
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,600
That's why I asked you to bring some oilcloth.

462
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,600
- I... forgot it at the hostel

463
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
-You forgot it at the hostel.

464
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Then...put a plastic bag or something, I don't know.

465
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
And again, don't let anyone come in

466
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,599
Room sevice, anyone, keep the door closed at all times

467
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
- Do you know how much time it takes?

468
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,599
I mean since you place the probe until...

469
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,600
cause we've rented the room for 3 days.

470
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,899
- It depends. It can take 2 hours as well as 2 or 3 days.

471
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,899
It dependson how the human body will react.

472
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,900
-What if I need to go to the toilet?

473
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,900
- Can't you understand it'very important not to move out of the bed at all?

474
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,899
If the probe fell, we achieved nothing.

475
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,900
I'm not putting it again, I told you.

476
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,900
That's why I told on the phone it's very important to have someone to help you.a friend or..

477
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,900
because when you feel contractions and the bleeding starts it doesn't matter at that point.

478
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,900
But until then, you must not budge.

479
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Be ware of infections.

480
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,900
When I insert the probe, I sterilize it.

481
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,900
I have alcohol, all I need, but afterwards there is an infection hazard.

482
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,899
You know the blood is kind of favorising it.

483
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,899
I'll give you some ampicilin to prevent it.

484
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,899
Have you ever taken ampicilin?

485
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,900
- Yes

486
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,900
- Is there any danger... or can the foetus not be expelled?

487
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,900
- Anything can happen, I told you, but usually it  is expelled.

488
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,900
- Forgive me for asking, but what if, God forbids, she faints or gets fever

489
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,899
or she loses blood, what do I do then?

490
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Do I call an ambulance, do I call you?

491
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,900
- If you call the ambulance, we're half way in prison, all of us.

492
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,899
And be careful. If you call the ambulance, don't say you're not pregnant,

493
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,900
cause they'll figure it out anyway

494
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,899
Just say, I don't know, you saw something coming out but you couldn't tell what it was

495
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,899
Nobody will believe you but it doesn't matter.

496
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,899
At least thet'll be covered.

497
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,900
It's best that we don't resort  to the ambulance.

498
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
How is your period?

499
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,899
Do you lose a lot of blood?

500
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,900
- Kind of yes.

501
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,900
-Lay down so I can palpate you.

502
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Unzip.

503
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Don't leave.

504
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,900
Miss, what month did you say you were?

505
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,900
- 3 month

506
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Is there a problem?

507
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,900
- I'm going to ask you one more time and I want you to pay attention.

508
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,900
When was your last period?

509
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
- December. It was due on 20.

510
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,899
- It was due on 20 but it didn't come?

511
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
- No

512
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,900
- So the last time it came was... november.

513
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,900
- Yea, I guess so.

514
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,899
- Let's calculate. November, december, january, february

515
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,900
How much is that?

516
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,900
But it last came in december.

517
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,900
You have to calculate from november.

518
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,900
It may be a little over 3 months.

519
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
- A little? It's way over 3 months.

520
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Miss, I want you to gather yourself.

521
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,900
What month are you?

522
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Because there is a different set for 3 and a different set for 4 months

523
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,899
- It could be the fourth.

524
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,900
- The forth?

525
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,900
Or the fifth?

526
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,899
Miss, you better be careful with this things...

527
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,899
- It can't be the fifth.

528
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Most probably the fourth.

529
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,900
I have an irregular period.

530
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,899
- You kind of playing with the months.

531
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,900
Could be fourth, could be fifth.

532
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Do you realise that from 4 moths on it's not an abortion anymore,

533
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,899
it's homicide.

534
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
5 to 10 years of jail.

535
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Did you know that?

536
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,900
You better not know it onwards.

537
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
- I don't have a regular period.

538
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,899
Sometimes it comes in 2 and a half months

539
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,899
That's why I didn't bother.

540
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,900
-Miss, please...

541
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,899
- You may not believe me...

542
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,900
-Well, I don't.

543
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,900
If you have an irregular period go to someone else, not me.

544
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,899
That's how people are.

545
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,900
They ignore the problem on, and on and on.

546
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,900
And then come to me for help.

547
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,899
You want someone else to pay for what you did?

548
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,900
It's not me who had fun.

549
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,899
- Miss, I don't know...

550
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,900
It's very dangerous.

551
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,900
- Well, is just that you didn't say, so we asked Ramona

552
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,899
Who do you think will perform an abortion in the fourth month?

553
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Or the fifth or whatever it may be.

554
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,900
- Please, I beg you.

555
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,900
- You may beg, but...

556
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,899
everything in this world has a price.

557
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,899
- But we're paying you.

558
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,899
- Really?

559
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,900
- How much do yu have?

560
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,900
- Look. We had to book the room for 3 days cause they wouldn't have given it otherwise

561
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,900
- So?

562
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,900
- We manage to get 3000 in the first place,

563
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,900
- Miss did I mention anything about the money?

564
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,900
how much it would be and we asked oyher people as well

565
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,900
and that's what everybody told us. It's at most 3000.

566
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,900
-Ramona told you it's 3000?

567
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,900
-She said that what she knew.

568
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,900
-Then let Ramona perform it, if that's what she knows.

569
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,900
- Miss, do you remember what we talked on the phone?

570
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,900
I said I was sympathetic and if you want, I can help.

571
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,899
Ay or nay?

572
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Did I say anything about the money?

573
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,900
- You said we'll get along somehow.

574
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,899
- Of course, that's why I asked you to come personally at the meeting

575
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,900
So we can agree on every aspect from the very begining.

576
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,899
Look now. I'm not being judgemental for what happened to you

577
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Every one makes mistakes in life.

578
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,899
I didn't ask for your name, nor where is the father of the baby, nothing of that

579
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,900
It's not my bussiness.

580
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,900
I said I can help you and as you can see I have nothing to hide.

581
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,100
I came with my own car, my ID is at the counter

582
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,100
If Militia shows up, I'm the first they bust.

583
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,100
So I'm risking my freedom....

584
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,100
You should know I have children too

585
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,100
I'm being nice to you and I help you

586
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,100
So you should be nice to me as well

587
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,100
That's how I see things.

588
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,099
- Hold it a bit cause I don't think I follow you

589
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,099
- I'm not going anywhere.

590
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I think you're the one hurrying.

591
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,100
What the part you didn't understand?

592
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,100
I was very clear and I don't like to repeat myself.

593
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,100
What did you think?

594
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,100
That I risk 10 years of jail for 3000?

595
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,100
That what you thought?

596
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,100
What do you think I am, a street beggar?

597
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Did you see me searching in the dumpster?

598
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,099
Look now,

599
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,099
while I go to the bathroom, you'll do some thinking

600
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,100
and when I come out you'll tell what you decided.

601
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,099
If you want to go along, then you tell me who is the first one

602
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,100
If not I get my things and I leave

603
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,100
- You're the one who asked for my help, not me.

604
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,099
- God, I'm sick

605
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,100
I can't believe what's going on.

606
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,100
- Why did you have to tell him you're in the second month?

607
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,099
- That's what Ramona told me.

608
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,099
Otherwise he might not want to.

609
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,100
- So that's how he want to.

610
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,099
- Why the hell did you have to wait for so long?

611
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,100
- What am I to do now?

612
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,099
And we paid for the room too.

613
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,100
- The room is your major worry, now?

614
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,099
Damn Gabi, you really annoy me sometimes.

615
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,099
I told you many times to be careful. But not you. You know better.

616
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,100
- I don't know what to do.

617
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Don't worry, you don't have to be involved in this.

618
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
There is one thing to help me, and come with me and totally different to...

619
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Give me the money.

620
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,100
- You tell us how much. Is 4000 ok?

621
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,099
4500, 5000, how much?

622
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
- Do you have that kind of money?

623
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,099
- Why are we talking then, just for fun?

624
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,099
- We can make it.

625
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
- You can make it.

626
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,100
- You tell me what a burden the room was

627
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,099
and then you say you can come up with an aditional 2-3000

628
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,099
Come on lady.

629
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,099
How can you make it?

630
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,099
- We'll borrow.

631
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,099
- Really?

632
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,099
And how do you give it back?

633
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,099
- That's our bussiness.

634
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,099
- So, now you're getting tough on me.

635
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,099
- I didn't say that, I was explaining...

636
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
- And how much time will it take to get the money?

637
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,099
- At the most next Saturday.

638
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,100
I'll have it all.

639
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,100
- Until next Saturday you'll have all the money?

640
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,100
- Ok then, if you say so.

641
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,099
You call me when you have all the money and we'll see then.

642
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,099
- No, please don't go.

643
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,099
I beg you to do it today.

644
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,099
The room is paid and all...

645
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,100
- How to do it? Is it you that is doing it?

646
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,099
- -No..., please forgive me

647
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,099
I meant you do it.

648
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,100
- So, how do we do it?

649
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,099
- Here's 2800 we got so far and I promise you I'll have another 2000 by Tuesday.

650
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,099
Will this do?

651
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,100
You must trust us, we won't...

652
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,100
- Trust? What trust? Do I know you? Do I know who you are?

653
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,100
You can take the train tomorrow and leave town. How do I know?

654
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,100
- We wouldn't do something like that.

655
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,100
I'll give you my ID

656
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,100
- What am I to do with it? Look for you in the middle of nowhere?

657
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,099
- We're students here, where could we go?

658
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,099
Look, I'm going to phone home and get the money til Monday

659
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,099
- Girl, are you bullshiting me?

660
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,100
I am asking you once more: are you bullshiting me?

661
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,099
- I'm not bullshiting you, but...

662
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,100
- But what?

663
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,099
- I've explained it plain and clear. Don't make me repeat myself cause I don't like it.

664
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,100
- Believe me, if I had that money I would have gone home and get it for you.

665
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,099
- Girl, what the fuck do you think?

666
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,100
You think you can fool me like a fucking idiot?

667
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,100
I have scums like you for breakfast.

668
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,099
Smarter assholes tried to fuck me and they couldn't do it.

669
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,099
Do you think you can fool me?

670
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,099
Like you're some smartasses and I'm a stupid fuck?

671
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,100
Fuck you and all this!

672
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,099
- Please, please, you have to help me.

673
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,100
It doesn't concern her. It's about me.

674
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,099
And please let's do it today.

675
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,099
Like you said.

676
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,100
- What do you mean, I said so?

677
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,100
- If you make mistakes, you pay.

678
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,099
It's my fault. She has nothing to do with it.

679
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,099
- I didn't require that, do you understand?

680
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,100
- I understood very well.

681
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,100
She's not my sister, I'm sorry I lied to on the phone.

682
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,100
She's just my room mate.

683
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,099
- So what? Did I ask you whose sister is she? I don't think so.

684
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,100
I've explained it to you very clear

685
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,100
- Yes. That's the best I can do. What I can do?

686
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,100
My room mate has no obligation

687
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,099
- That's why I was suggesting...

688
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,099
- You don't suggest anything to me , clear?

689
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,100
You come to me and ask me something.

690
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,099
And I told you I can help and I told you the conditions

691
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,099
If you don't understand, its ok, nobofy is forcing you.

692
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,099
- I'm having my period.

693
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,100
- What did you say?

694
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,099
Please repeat. You said it low and I couldn't hear.

695
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,100
- She's having her period.

696
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,100
- I'm out of here. I had enough of this.

697
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,100
-Please, please don't leave.

698
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,099
- Ok, ok. Put the damn probe and...

699
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,100
- And?

700
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,100
So how am I to put the probe?

701
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Do you think I was born yesterday?

702
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,100
- Excuse me...

703
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,100
Do you have a cigarette?

704
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,100
Thank you.

705
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,400
-Lye down.

706
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,399
- Are you making a shot?

707
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,400
-No

708
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,399
- What is it?

709
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,400
- Water.

710
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,399
- If nothing happens till tomorrow, you can add some yourself.

711
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,400
- Give me the probe.

712
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,400
- Don"t be tensed.

713
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,400
- When you feel something stinging let me know.

714
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,399
- Did it sting?

715
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,400
- Yes.

716
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,399
- When you feel it comes out, you go and sit on the closet.

717
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Cause it comes out easier.

718
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Give me the bandage.

719
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Hold this.

720
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,399
Important. Don't cut the cord until the placenta is out.

721
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,400
If it remains inside, it's bad.

722
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,400
You just stay still until it comes out, ok?

723
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Sit still!

724
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,399
- Can I cover myself?

725
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,400
- Yes.

726
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,400
- I forgot to tell you something important.

727
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400
Don't throw the aborted fetus in the closet, cause it will jam. Ok?

728
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Not by pieces not as a whole.Don't get any ideas.

729
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,400
And don't bury it so that the dogs will find it and all

730
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,399
You wrap in a cloth, you go whatever neighborhood you chose

731
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,399
You get in the first apartment building you see

732
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,400
and you throw it in the dumpster from the 10th floor. Got it?

733
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,400
- Yes

734
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,400
- Check her temperature in the morning and in the evening.

735
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,400
If it's 37-38, it's ok

736
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,400
If it goes beyond 39 you gave her aspirin and these.

737
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,400
If you want I can come and see you tomorrow at 2, or tonight after 8

738
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,399
- No, you don't have to...

739
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,400
- Come on, don't...

740
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,400
As you wish.

741
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,400
If you're ill or you need me, then call me.

742
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,399
Don't move, ok?

743
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Questions?

744
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Ok, I'll be on my way.

745
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,400
Good luck.

746
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,700
- Thanks.

747
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,699
- Listen

748
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,700
- I'm  curious to know...

749
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,700
How come Ramona recommended this guy to you?

750
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,700
- Luciana had an interruption with him recently.

751
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,699
- So it's not her that had the interruption?

752
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,700
- No.

753
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,700
- Then why did she recommend him?

754
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,700
What if it's an asshole?

755
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,700
She thought she was making you a favour, right?

756
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,700
- She said this guy will do it even if the pregnancy is over 3 months.

757
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,700
- Then why did you tell this jerk it's 2 months?

758
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,700
- I thought it was better this way.

759
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,700
- Really? Well, stop thinking.

760
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,700
And if you are going to lie, at least tell me about it.

761
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Why the fuck did you tell him I'm your sister?

762
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,700
How did it cross your mind?

763
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,699
- He told me I should come and you went instead of me

764
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,700
what could have I said?

765
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,700
- Then why didn't you go?

766
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,700
- I've asked you to go, haven't I?

767
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,700
- Gabitza, are you following me?

768
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,700
Why didn't you go?

769
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,700
- Because I was reluctant, that's why.

770
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,700
- So you lied your sister would come.

771
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,700
- I didn't lie to you.

772
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,700
- It doesn't matter who you lied to.

773
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,700
- I just forgot to tell you, but I didn't lied to you.

774
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,700
- It doesn't matter anymore.

775
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,699
- I'm just upset that because of some stupid mistakes you've made

776
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,700
things had to happen this way.

777
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,699
We could have gone to Miss Jeni, the one Dorina told you about.

778
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,700
And things would have been all right.

779
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,700
-  Sure, now it's easy to say that.

780
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,699
It was your opinion it doesn't matter it's a man as long as it's cheap.

781
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,700
- Did I say that?

782
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,700
I said to do it where it's cheaper, of course,

783
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,700
but not that it doesn't matter if it's a man or not.

784
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,700
I didn't even think that....

785
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,700
- Do you think I did?

786
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,699
- God damn it.

787
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,699
If that that bitch from the hotel had kept my reservation

788
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,700
maybe none of this would have happened.

789
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,700
- What were you thinking, making the reservation over the phone?

790
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,700
- I told her I was from another town.

791
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,700
- Did you?....

792
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Whatever.

793
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,699
- Are there any cigarettes left?

794
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,700
- No.

795
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,700
- This still nature painting sucks.

796
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,700
- Comfortable?

797
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,700
- Yes.

798
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,700
- Does that thing hurt?

799
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,699
- Stings a bit.

800
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,700
It hurt when he put it.

801
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,700
- I have to go to Adi's.

802
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,700
It's his mother's birthday and I promised I would go.

803
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,700
Should I turn on the lamp?

804
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,700
- No, leave it like this.

805
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,700
-I'd like a glass of water here.

806
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,699
- I'll be away for an hour.

807
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,699
- Do you want me to bring you something to eat?

808
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,699
- I'm not hungry.

809
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,699
- You'll be later.

810
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,699
- No. I have the cookies.

811
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,699
- I could bring some beef salad from Adi.

812
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,700
- No, I won't eat.

813
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,700
- Ok, I'll see what I'll do.

814
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,699
- Look, I'll leave the number here.

815
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,700
If you need something, call me.

816
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,700
- Don't leave it, I won't call you there.

817
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,700
- I'll call you anyway but it's better that you have it too.

818
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,700
- I'm leaving. Be careful, don't let anyone in.

819
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,700
- Are you leaving or what?

820
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,700
- What about the key?

821
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,700
I'll lock you in and take the key.

822
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,699
Don't worry, you'll be all right.

823
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,700
- Bye.

824
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,700
-Miss. Miss.

825
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,700
- The person who visited you forgot his ID.

826
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,700
- Don't tell me that you forgot the flowers on top of being late.

827
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,699
- If you talk to me like this, I'm leaving.

828
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,700
- You're late and angry?

829
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,699
- Good evening. I'm Alin's mother.

830
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,699
- Otilia. Happy birthday.

831
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,700
- Thank you dear. I'm so glad you came.

832
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,700
- Are those pickles coming?

833
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,700
- Go, go inside. I have to get some pickles.

834
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,700
- I have to make a phone call.

835
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,700
- Good evening. 206, please.

836
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,700
- Otilia, my dad.

837
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,699
- Dad? That's how you introduce me?

838
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,699
- Otilia. - Nice to meet you

839
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,700
- Happy Birthday. -Come in.

840
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,699
- You don't have to.

841
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,700
Ady, give her your slipers.

842
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,699
Put them on or you'll catch a cold.

843
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,699
- You take mine and take the shoes.

844
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,699
- But I don't want to.

845
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,699
- Come in, don't be shy.

846
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,699
- Good evening.

847
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,699
- She is Ady's girlfriend,

848
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,699
Otilia.

849
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,700
- They are the Rusu, Ady's godfathers'.

850
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,700
She is doctor Aldea, doctor Racoviceanu, cardiologist, his wife

851
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,700
- Let her sit down, she's dizzy with so many new people.

852
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,700
- He went to cardiology but his problem resided in the upper story. -ha, ha

853
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,700
- We'll see who's the doctor when the prostate gets nasty.

854
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,699
- Where is the toilet?

855
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,700
- Excuse me.

856
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,700
- The toilet? - Down the hall. Turn on the light.

857
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,700
- I won't be able to stay much longer.

858
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:42,700
- What are you saying. You've just arrived.

859
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,699
- Did you wash your hands?

860
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,699
- You said it was just passing by and saying Happy birthday

861
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,700
not having dinner with your folks.

862
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,700
- We wait till they pop off the champagne and then we go to my room.

863
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,699
- Are you calm now?

864
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,699
-Let me go, I'm all sweaty

865
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,700
- Here comes the soup.

866
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,700
- Please, go ahead.

867
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,700
- Come on, come on.

868
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,699
- Whenever you see eachother you start all over again.

869
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,699
- So, what's the problem?

870
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,699
- What would you like to drink?

871
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,699
- Some juice please.

872
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,699
- Very good, those meat balls.

873
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,699
- They're with frozen meat.

874
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,699
- It's not that I don't drink, but I don't feel like now.

875
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,699
- It's very good that she is not drinking.

876
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,700
- Not even vermouth?

877
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,699
- I don't mind, but not now, really.

878
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,699
-Maybe the girl is fasting.

879
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,699
- So what if she's fasting?

880
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,699
- I'm not fasting.

881
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,699
- I've heard you're from Galati county.

882
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,699
- Galati city, actually

883
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,699
- Galati city, you say.

884
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,699
- Do you happen to know Dr Ivanov, the surgeon?

885
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,699
He's very professional.

886
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,699
- Not really. After highschool I left the to go to university.

887
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,699
- He was my student.

888
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,699
- Straight A student.

889
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,700
- Yes, 9,80  9,70

890
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,700
- And it was hard back then. If you grabbed a 7 in Anatomy you were celebrating all day.

891
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:50,700
Now they churn out '10' on the conveyor belt.

892
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,699
- Even 10,50. I know a student straight '10' till the sixth year.

893
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,699
The Party gave him another 0,50

894
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,699
And now he's 10,50. How about that?

895
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,699
- Don't forget 0,25 if you start a family.

896
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,699
- Yes, that too.

897
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,699
- Maybe your son will take that 0,25 next year

898
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,700
- Look, he blushed, ha ha.

899
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,699
- Oh, leave my boy alone.

900
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,699
- It's time...

901
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,700
- Are your parents teaching, too?

902
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,699
- No, my father is in the military and my mother is retired, she's sick.

903
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,700
She was working when she was younger, but now...

904
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,699
-Sometimes, simple folks are better raised than a lot of people with high education.

905
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,700
- Not really. It depends much on the environment.

906
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,700
Take this Dima for instance. He's from the country side. The Party

907
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,699
promoted him on account of his 'worker origins' and now he's a big shot.

908
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,699
- Forget that. Let's have a toast better.

909
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,700
- Happy birthday, happy birthday.

910
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,699
- Turn the volume a little higher, I want to hear what The All-Too-Knowing is up to.

911
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,700
- Is this pork?

912
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,699
- It's very hard to cook in this house

913
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,699
Ever since Ady was a little boy, he didn't eat pork

914
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:47,699
Whenever he saw a bit of fat on his dish, he refused to eat

915
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,700
no matter how insignificant that piece of fat was

916
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,699
- Our Valentin would do the same.

917
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:57,700
- In the soup too. The same refusal.

918
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,700
Even his school lunchbox. If I put chicken in he would give it to his friends.

919
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,700
And I couldn't stand that. Because we weren't so well put back then.

920
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,700
I had to stay up to 3 hours in a line for a pound of meat.

921
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,699
And he was picky.

922
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,699
- It's better the children be acustomed to hardships since they are little

923
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,699
cause no one is going to grant them any favours later in life.

924
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,699
-That's true

925
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,699
- They sent me to take care of the cattle when I was a little boy

926
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,700
and I did my homeworks at the light of a gaslamp.

927
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,700
And we were 9 brothers

928
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,699
My mother was putting the 'mamaliga' (polenta) on the table

929
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,699
and some were lucky to snatch a piece, and some weren't.

930
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,700
-But you managed to snatch. - ha ha ha

931
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,700
- Not here. My husband is very picky.

932
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,700
- If I didn't prepare the mash potatoes the way his mother did, he wouldn't eat.

933
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,700
- And still, it's not as good as my mother's.

934
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,700
- But it's good. - Ok,ok it's good all right.

935
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:52,699
- Nowadays, people are too spoiled.

936
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,700
- My grandmother used to add some milk.

937
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,700
- Me too.

938
01:16:58,700 --> 01:16:59,699
- And some water in which to boil the potatoes.

939
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,700
- It depends on how you're used to.

940
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,699
- We didn't have any butter. But my mother used to put potatoes in the 'mamaliga'

941
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,700
It was awesome.

942
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,700
- We ourselves, we had differences with our parents when we were young.

943
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,700
- Stop taking their side. They take everything for granted.

944
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,699
Look at them. Hostel, scholarship, mom and dad feed them. Man...

945
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,699
- It's not quite like that

946
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,700
Think about the allotment of jobs in medicine

947
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,699
If they end up in some far away hamlet, they're through.

948
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,700
- What's the problem with the allotment?

949
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,699
I myself had to work 8 years in Cotnari

950
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,700
And I was fine.

951
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,699
- Please, have some more

952
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,699
Don't wait for me to serve.

953
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,700
Doctor, what would you like?

954
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,699
- If girls aren't smart enough to mary during faculty years

955
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,700
they end up in the countryside and marry eather the teacher or the priest

956
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,700
And the priest is usually the biggest drunk in the village.

957
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,699
- Come on. Thre are serious priests as well.

958
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,700
- Those are exceptions.

959
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,699
- Most of them have colour TV, VCR, and if you're looking for them they are busy.

960
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,699
- What are they busy with?

961
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:04,700
- Busy with confessions. - ha ha

962
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:07,699
- We're going to the church on Easter.

963
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,699
They can arrest me if they like. I don't care.

964
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,699
- Who's going to arrest you?

965
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:14,700
- The priest, ha ha ha

966
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,700
- Don't laugh. Guess what colleague I bump into on Easter at the church.

967
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,700
He was sneaking behind a column. ...Hutonas

968
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,700
- Aurel went straight to him and ask him 'where is your notebook?'

969
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,700
- No, it wasn't like that. I told him 'why don't you take that notebook out and write clearly?'

970
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,699
He played it down,  'come on Aurel, don't say that' and things like that

971
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,700
- You did the right thing.

972
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,699
- You know, my sister in law gave last Easter egg paint from Germany.

973
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,700
And some marzipan. It was a delight.

974
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,700
- Last year all my eggs cracked during boiling. I can't imagine what happened.

975
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,699
- Mine were just fine

976
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,699
- If you use good paint I'm sure they were fine

977
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,699
- I use a bit of oil. Makes them shine.

978
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,699
- I use butter.

979
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,700
- I don't have to smear anyting. This german paint does the trick.

980
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,699
I had yellow and green paint. And orange.

981
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,699
And blue.

982
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,700
- No, I got blue from yellow and green.

983
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,700
- After we use the paint, we share the rest of the paint with neighbours.

984
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,700
-That's a good did.

985
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,699
- Would you like a cigarette?

986
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,699
Come on, have one.

987
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,699
- Thank you.

988
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,699
- Where are you studying?

989
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,699
- Polytechnics.

990
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,699
- When I was young, girls went to medicine and boys to polytechnics.

991
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,699
- The same thing today.

992
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,699
- The main adavantage at polytechnics is you don't get stuck in a village.

993
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,700
- It's not easy to spend a lifetime in a factory, either.

994
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,699
- You stay at the hostel?

995
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,699
- Yes.

996
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,700
- How many in the room?

997
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,899
- Usually 4, But I pulled some strings and I moved together with a friend of mine.

998
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,900
- Resourceful girl.

999
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,900
- Miss, excuse me, but I...,

1000
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,899
well, it's not proper for a young lady to smoke in the presence of the boy's parents

1001
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,900
- Emilian! - Don't interrupt me.

1002
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,899
I was 43 when my father passed away but I've never smoked when he was around

1003
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,899
Never.

1004
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,899
- That's very healthy

1005
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,899
- As if yor father didn't know you were smoking.

1006
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,899
- Get the champagne from the refrigerator.

1007
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,900
- Of course he knew. But it's about respect.

1008
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,899
The children are now openly defiant.

1009
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,899
- Even my Valentin...

1010
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,899
- Who's defying you?

1011
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,899
- Well, it may not be the right word but....

1012
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,899
you know what I mean

1013
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,899
- I, for one, didn't aprove of my son not serving in the army.

1014
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,900
Why shouldn't he ? He has to, he's got to learn what life is all about.

1015
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,899
Not smothered, because sooner or later he's got to find out what a real man is..

1016
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,899
- That's right, our son behaves the same way...

1017
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,899
- I don't agree...

1018
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,899
What? You think that if you spend nine months there and they brutify you

1019
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,899
you'll come out a man?

1020
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,899
-That's right.

1021
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,899
- I wouldn't tolerate for my son to suffer like that.

1022
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,899
What for?

1023
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:30,900
-You should see the ones that serve sixteen months! Poor guys...

1024
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,899
-It also depends where you're serving.

1025
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,899
-Border police is the worst.

1026
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,899
- But it's satisfactory.

1027
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,899
- No, no...the disciplinary batallion is the hardest.

1028
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,899
- Yes, but that' not what we were talking about!

1029
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,899
- No, listen here...

1030
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,899
- We didnt't exempt Adi because his father didn't want to.

1031
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,899
No, God forbid, his father has principles.

1032
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,899
That's why the boy is studying chemistry now.

1033
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,900
- Chemistry is good, dear. You'll see, I'll take him in as my assistant

1034
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,900
and you'll see he'll grow to like it.

1035
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,899
- We'll keep him at home to learn for an year and he'll have another go.

1036
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,899
- Allright, where's that champagne? Let's pop the cork!

1037
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,900
-The army, only the army is the real school of life.

1038
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,900
- Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you

1039
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:12,900
- Congratulations, dear!

1040
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,900
- Happy birthday! Cheers!

1041
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,899
- Could you please get me the phone?

1042
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,900
- Yea, sure.

1043
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,100
- Adela is on the phone.

1044
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,100
-  Now, are you going to tell me what is going on?

1045
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:56,100
You've been out of it since you came.

1046
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,099
- I'm not in the mood to talk about it.

1047
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,100
- Are you going to tell me?

1048
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,099
- Are you sure you want to know?

1049
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,100
- What do you mean? Of course I do.

1050
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,400
And please tell me no matter what.

1051
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,400
- I had to go help Gabitza have an abortion.

1052
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,400
- And that's what you needed the money for?

1053
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,399
- Do you imagine that an abortion is 300 ?

1054
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,400
- Then what did you need them for?

1055
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,400
- Don't worry, I'll give them back on Monday and that's the end of it.

1056
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,400
- Look, my father had a colleague, a doctor, that got 3 years detention for an abortion.

1057
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,399
- What if I get pregnant? what are we going to do then? Have you thought?

1058
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,399
- Cut it out!

1059
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,400
- No really, it can happen.

1060
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,400
And again, what would you do if I got pregnant?

1061
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,600
- Don't roll your eyes. Have you thought?

1062
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,600
- What exactly am I supposed to think about?

1063
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,599
- What are we going to do if I get pregnant?

1064
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,600
- But you won't .

1065
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,600
- How do you know I'm not already?

1066
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,600
- Are you?

1067
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,599
- You have no idea when I'm due for my period.

1068
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,600
- I do know. Sometime these days, right?

1069
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,599
- What do you care? It's not your problem.

1070
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,600
- Why are you saying that?

1071
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,300
- Did it ever happen while we were together?

1072
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,299
- Take Thursday, I asked you to take care, and come outside.

1073
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,299
Remember? And you, you couldn't care less.

1074
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:29,300
- How can you talk about this?

1075
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:33,300
- You're not ashamed to do it, but you're ashamed to talk about it?

1076
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,299
- I don't see the point of talking as long as you're not pregnant.

1077
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,300
- I want to know what to expect of you.

1078
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,300
- Don't worry, if it happens, I'll take care of it.

1079
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:48,300
- Yeah, right... - What do you mean?

1080
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
- Did you ever need anything and I didn't help?

1081
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,999
- Do you at least know how many times I needed help?

1082
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,699
You have no idea.

1083
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,700
- It's not my fault that you don't talk about it!

1084
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,699
Do you want me to take a guess about your problems?

1085
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,700
- And the thing with Gabi, why didn't you tell me? I would have helped.

1086
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,700
- Helped me? You can't even conceive the idea and you'd have helped?

1087
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,700
- The main thing is for you to take care not to get pregnant.

1088
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,700
- Don't bother, I wouldn't count on you anyway.

1089
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,699
At least Gabitza, as plain as she is, would help me.

1090
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,700
- Oh, and I wouldn't, or what?

1091
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,699
I just said I don't condone abortion because it's very dangerous.

1092
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,700
- So what would, according to you, be the solution?

1093
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,700
- I don't know, I'd marry you.

1094
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,699
- So if I get pregnant...

1095
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,700
- Just cut it out!

1096
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,700
- Don't worry, I'm not spending the rest of my life cooking mashed potatoes for you.

1097
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,700
- Otilia,did my parents' friends annoy you or what?

1098
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,700
- They annoyed me too, but that is not the point.

1099
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,700
I know that you also yhink my parents are simple people, without higher education.

1100
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,699
- Did you ever hear me saying that? Did I ever say that to you?

1101
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,699
- You didn't, but I know your opinion.

1102
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,699
Actually, you did say it once.

1103
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:03,700
- What did I say?

1104
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:05,699
- Can I come in ? I brought you some creme broulee.

1105
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,700
- Thank you.

1106
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,699
- Save some space for the meringue cake.

1107
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,700
- Why are the lights off?

1108
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,400
- Could you please get me the phone?

1109
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,400
- Look now...

1110
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,400
I'm sorry if I made any mistake.

1111
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,399
You know I love you and I want for us to be together.

1112
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,399
- Please get me that phone.

1113
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,399
- Look, I appologized.

1114
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,400
- You said you were sorry.

1115
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,400
And do you at least know what for?

1116
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,399
Tell me, do you know what you're sorry about?

1117
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,400
- I see that you're upset, and I don't want you to be upset over me.

1118
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,400
If I made any mistake, it wasn't on purpose.

1119
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,400
I want us to get along, ok ?

1120
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,400
- Until what?

1121
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,400
Until I get my allotment and I leave by myself?

1122
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,400
I asked you not to touch me now.

1123
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,400
- It's going to work out.

1124
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,400
We're going to leave for camp, it'll be just the two of us and we won't fight anymore.

1125
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:51,400
- Please get me the phone.

1126
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,399
Could you please give me some privacy while I talk to Gabitza?

1127
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,400
It won't take long.

1128
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,400
Good evening. Room 206, please.

1129
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,400
Could you tell me, did anybody go up to 206?

1130
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:41,400
I'm Mihartescu, you talked to me in the morning.

1131
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,400
No, no, you don't have to go up.

1132
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Thank you.

1133
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,399
I have to go.

1134
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,400
- What is it, did something go bad with Gabi?

1135
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,400
Stay around for just  5 minutes, they're cutting the meringue cake now.

1136
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,399
- I'd like to, but I really can't.

1137
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,399
Sorry.

1138
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,400
- Then at least go in and say  " bye".

1139
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,400
- You go in and tell them for me. I really can't stay anymore.

1140
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,400
- Do you realize how shitty I'll feel in front of them?

1141
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,400
- I'm sorry.

1142
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,400
Bye.

1143
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,900
-Please don't walk me out. You really don't have to.

1144
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:42,900
- Get inside. It's embarassing to wait silently for the elevator.

1145
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,199
- Good evening. 206 please.

1146
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,199
- Your ID.

1147
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,199
- You have my ID. I showed it to the receptionist this morning.

1148
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:32,200
- I need your ID.

1149
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,199
- I think it's upstairs.

1150
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,199
- Call the room, to bring it to you.

1151
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,200
- I called the room earlier, and my friend was sleeping.

1152
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,200
I'll be right back with it, I don't want to wake her up.

1153
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,200
- Why don't you have your ID anyway?

1154
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,199
- I just went out for some cigarettes and met someone, that's all.

1155
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:53,200
- You went out...

1156
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,200
- I'll be back with it.

1157
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:40,100
- Gabitza?

1158
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,100
Gabitza?

1159
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,099
What's wrong?

1160
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:55,100
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

1161
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,099
- It got out.

1162
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,100
It's in the bathroom.

1163
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,099
- Pick it up.

1164
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,100
Tell them I'll be right down.

1165
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,099
Do you have a bag?

1166
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:08,100
Tell me, do you have a bag or something?

1167
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,099
- Will this do ?

1168
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:15,100
- It's too small.

1169
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:41,100
- Burry it, ok?

1170
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,099
Do you promise?

1171
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,099
- Don't worry, I won't throw it away.

1172
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,099
- You will be back, right?

1173
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,099
- Cut it out.

1174
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,099
Lock the door.

1175
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:53,100
- If the receptionist comes, tell him I went down.

1176
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,899
- Do you know at what time the last bus comes?

1177
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,899
- In about an hour, I guess.

1178
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:29,900
I don't know.

1179
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,899
- A cab around here?

1180
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,899
- You won't find a cab in this neighbourhood Miss.

1181
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:35,899
- Thanks.

1182
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,900
- You're welcome.

1183
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:13,900
- Gabitza?

1184
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:23,900
Gabitza?

1185
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:35,900
Gabitza!

1186
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:42,899
- What's going on ?

1187
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,899
- Oh, they had a fight, at the wedding.

1188
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,899
Your friend is waiting for you at the restaurant.

1189
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:47,899
- My friend is waiting for me at the restaurant?

1190
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,900
- Yes, she came down 5 minutes ago.

1191
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:51,899
Take the other way, because there's the wedding here.

1192
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,900
- Thanks.

1193
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,900
- What are you doing?

1194
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,899
I didn't know where you where.

1195
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,900
- I was very hungry.

1196
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,899
I think I have a bit of a fever.

1197
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,899
- Did you take an aspirin?

1198
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:25,900
- I took an ampicilin.

1199
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,900
- Did you burry it?

1200
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:43,900
- You know what?

1201
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:48,900
We'll never talk about this, ok?

1202
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:58,899
- Are they serving anything at this hour?

1203
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,900
- Yes, he's coming right away.

1204
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,900
- What's that supposed to be?

1205
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:22,900
- So, the menu from the wedding that it is : beef, pork, steamed liver, bread-crumbed brain.

1206
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,150
- Could you bring us a bottle of mineral water, while we think about the order?
