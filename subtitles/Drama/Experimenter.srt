2
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,355
Hello. I'm Mr. Williams.
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,557
Please? And you are?

4
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,892
- Fred Miller.
- You must be?

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,561
Wallace. James Wallace.

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,731
Great. Please. Have a seat.

7
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,603
Now before we do anything else,
allow me to pay you.

8
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,573
Please check that both names
are spelled correctly.

9
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,743
You understand this is yours
simply for coming to the lab.

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,779
From now on, no matter what
happens, the money is yours.

11
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,115
I'll have to have
you sign a receipt.

12
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,652
There you go. Now,
psychologists have developed

13
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,321
several theories on
how humans learn.

14
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,957
Uh, for example, it might help
to reward a person.

15
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,692
Sometimes it helps
to punish them.

16
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,794
We do know that punishment,
thank you very much,

17
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,897
is a powerful incentive towards
learning. For example,

18
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,668
when a parent spanks a child.
However, we know little about

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,037
the effect of punishment on
learning because almost

20
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,707
no scientific studies have been
done of it on human beings.

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,577
Now, one of you will play
the role of "learner",

22
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,912
who will receive a mild
punishment

23
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,815
if he answers incorrectly
to a series of questions.

24
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,885
That punishment will be
administered by a "teacher".

25
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,788
What kind of punishment
are we talking about?

26
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,790
Well, first, let's determine
which of you

27
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,492
will be "learner"
and which will be "teacher."

28
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,695
If you'll just choose one.

29
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:11,797
Good.

30
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,500
Teacher.

31
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,703
I guess I'm the learner, huh?

32
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,371
Good.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,675
This is the machine for
generating electric shocks.

34
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,811
Go ahead.

35
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,384
Now, let's set up the learner
to receive some punishment.

36
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,186
If you'll just follow me
into the next room.

37
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,455
Is it OK if I leave my hat here?

38
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,623
Yes, that's fine.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,894
Now you might wanna
remove the jacket.

40
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,763
Go ahead and have a seat.

41
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,567
Now, when you push one of
these four buttons,

42
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,769
this box will signal
a light in the other room,

43
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,171
telling the teacher how you're
responding to the questions.

44
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,006
What kind of questions?

45
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:00,245
Word pairs. "Strong arm",
"black curtain", and so forth.

46
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,280
Now, we want you
to memorize them.

47
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,916
The teacher will first read them
as word pairs,

48
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,387
"strong arm", for example, then
he'll read only the first word,

49
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,223
"strong", followed by
a series of word choices.

50
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,759
"Back, arm, branch, and push".

51
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,428
Your job is to remember
which of those words

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,764
was originally paired with
the first word, "strong".

53
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:19,798
- Arm.
- Right.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,868
You'd indicate that by pushing
one of these buttons here.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,637
If you had thought it was the
first word I had read, "back",

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,472
you'd push this first button.

57
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,474
If you thought it was
the second word, "arm",

58
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,710
you'd push the second button,
so on and so forth with

59
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,179
third and fourth word choices.

60
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,081
Now, if you get
the answer incorrect,

61
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,650
you will receive
an electric shock.

62
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,720
Would you please roll up
your right arm sleeve, please?

63
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,357
Would you just help me strap him
in to limit any excess movement?

64
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,292
How far do you think he'll go?

65
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,027
- Too soon to tell.
- Now this is

66
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,730
connected to the shock generator
in the next room.

67
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,433
- Electrode paste.
- And electrode paste,

68
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,002
to eliminate any excess burns
or blisters.

69
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,505
Um, you know, I should say that
a couple of years ago,

70
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,974
- in the West Haven VA Hospital...
- Mm-hm...

71
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,845
they determined that I had
a slight heart condition.

72
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:11,883
Nothing serious, but how
dangerous are these shocks?

73
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,820
Well, although the shocks may be
extremely painful,

74
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,656
they cause
no permanent tissue damage.

75
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,025
Oh. OK.

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,462
Well, we'll be communicating
from the next room.

77
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,964
<i>The lab coat,
I decided to make it grey.</i>

78
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>White would seem too medical.</i>

79
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,652
- Okay.
- Thank you.

80
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,255
Now, if he gets the answer
incorrect, you administer

81
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,392
the shock by flipping one of
these switches here. You see?

82
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,995
Each switch has
a little red light above it.

83
00:04:56,997 --> 00:05:00,799
Now, to give you, the teacher,
an idea of the amount of shock

84
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,535
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair

85
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,705
you receive a sample shock
yourself. Is that all right?

86
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,207
- Uh-huh.
- OK, just roll up your sleeve.

87
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,410
<i>Life can only be
understood backwards</i>

88
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,746
<i>but it must be lived forwards.</i>

89
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,948
Good.

90
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,520
Now, I'll ask you to close your
eyes and just estimate for me

91
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,222
the amount of volts
you think you're receiving.

92
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,093
OK, close.

93
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,999
This part, this part's where
the experiment really begins.

94
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,576
Now, just use this scale here
to tell me the amount of volts

95
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,178
you think you received
in the sample shock.

96
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,548
Pfff, 195?

97
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,951
No, actually, that's incorrect.
It was 45 volts.

98
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,256
All right.

99
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,431
OK, learner, uh, I'm going
to read you the words,

100
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,700
and then I'm gonna
repeat the first word

101
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,837
and you're going to tell me
the pair for that word. OK?

102
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,074
He doesn't have a
microphone but he can hear you.

103
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,144
Keep it moving, understand?
Remember, each time he gives

104
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,213
a wrong answer, move up one
switch on the shock generator.

105
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,750
It is important that you follow
the procedure exactly.

106
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,286
OK, here we go.

107
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,157
"Blue girl. Nice day."

108
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,126
Fat neck. Green ink.

109
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,762
Rich boy. Fast bird.

110
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,765
Blunt arrow. Soft hair.

111
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,735
"Cool cave. Gold paint."

112
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,939
In the first word.

113
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,141
"Blue: Boy,

114
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,544
girl, grass, bat."

115
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,680
Correct.

116
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,417
"Soft rug..."

117
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,753
<i>He finds his way into it.</i>

118
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,390
<i>With increasing confidence
he finds a rhythm, a groove.</i>

119
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,525
That is incorrect.

120
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,227
<i>Until...</i>

121
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,795
90 volts.

122
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,707
- Um...
- Here we go.

123
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,245
"Gold: Dollar, necklace,
moon, paint."

124
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,550
Incorrect.

125
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,754
120 volts, gold paint.

126
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,660
"Hard: Stone, head, bread,
work."

127
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,066
Incorrect.

128
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,634
135 volts.

129
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,644
OK.

130
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:05,050
"Wet: Night, grass, duck,
cloth."

131
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,989
Incorrect. 150 volts, wet duck.

132
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,127
<i>It really hurts.</i>

133
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,263
Mmm.

134
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,533
<i>How do you know when a change,</i>

135
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,702
<i>a true and lasting change,</i>

136
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,503
<i>is about to overtake your life?</i>

137
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,772
"grass, man, girl..."

138
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,047
- Eighth floor, please.
- The same.

139
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,895
Are we going to the same party?

140
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,231
Probably.

141
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,933
You know Doris Eissenman?

142
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,268
Saul Harwood's invited me.

143
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,738
Ah.

144
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,073
I've never heard of him.

145
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,979
Shall we continue talking,
or wait till

146
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,615
we're properly introduced?

147
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,785
You're a dancer?

148
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,155
Oh, well,
I studied, here and in Paris.

149
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,158
- I work in an office now.
- Mmm-hm.

150
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,693
- What about you?
- I'm at Yale.

151
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,831
Limited dance skills, although
I did spend some time in Paris.

152
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,667
What are you studying at Yale?

153
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,036
I teach, actually.
Social Relations.

154
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,106
Did you just give that guy there
your phone number?

155
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,110
So if I wanted your number
I can get it from him?

156
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,480
Social Relations.

157
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,516
- What does that mean?
- It's a combination.

158
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,852
Sociology, anthropology,
psychology.

159
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,923
You know, basically covers
everything from

160
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,192
the way people talk in elevators
to the study of

161
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,761
role-playing, conformity,
authority.

162
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,896
Soft: Rug,

163
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:35,300
pillow, hair, grass.

164
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,373
Incorrect. A hundred and...

165
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,810
sixty-five volts, strong shock.

166
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,047
<i>Ah! Let me out of here!</i>

167
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,382
<i>I told you,
I have a heart condition.</i>

168
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,419
<i>I will not be part of
the experiment anymore!</i>

169
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,156
- He says he's not gonna go on.
- Please continue, teacher.

170
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,392
He says
he doesn't want to go on.

171
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:05,163
Well, whether the learner
likes it or not, he must go on

172
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,899
until he's learned all the pairs
correctly.

173
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,235
Please continue, teacher.

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,471
Uh...

175
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,376
Calm down, concentrate.

176
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,848
"Sad: Face, music,

177
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,951
clown, girl."

178
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,756
Incorrect.

179
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,358
180 volts.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,228
<i>Ahh! Dammit!
Let me out, let me out!</i>

181
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,597
<i>He went all the way.
Most of them do.</i>

182
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,134
"Sharp.

183
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,470
Axe, needle, stick, blade."

184
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,774
No response from the learner

185
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,809
must be interpreted as
a wrong answer.

186
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:57,448
<i>Still laughing,
trying to hide face with hand.</i>

187
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,452
Something's happening
to that man in there.

188
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,955
Can you please go check that
everything's OK?

189
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,757
Not once we've started.

190
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,625
Please continue, teacher.

191
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,560
So you accept
all responsibility?

192
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,530
The responsibility's
mine, correct.

193
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,666
Continue, please.

194
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,371
"Wet: Night, grass, dark, cloth."

195
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,609
<i>Clenching fist,
pushing it onto table.</i>

196
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,985
- How are you holding up, Alan?
- "Dollar: Necklace,

197
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,488
"moon, paint." 375 volts.

198
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,691
Dangerous, severe shock.

199
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,897
<i>Let me out of here,
let me out. Get me out of here.</i>

200
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,733
<i>You can't hold me in here.
Get me out.</i>

201
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,784
- What is this?
- I just liked the picture.

202
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,421
The colors... Don't you?

203
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,423
Yeah.

204
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,559
Take it. It's yours.

205
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,464
Why don't you mail it to me?

206
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,571
Or we could leave it here
and you can move in?

207
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,309
That'd be easier, wouldn't it?

208
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:43,354
"Wet: Night, grass, duck,

209
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,490
cloth."

210
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,597
"Wet duck."

211
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,465
435 volts.

212
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,802
Huh.

213
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,673
Ohh.

214
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,075
OK, um,

215
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,478
"Brave: Woman, soldier,

216
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,614
dog, horse."

217
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,422
"Brave woman."

218
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,557
450 volts.

219
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,798
OK, what now?
I'm at the end at 450 volts.

220
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,634
Continue, please.

221
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,569
The last switch again.

222
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,338
Yeah, but...
but he could be dead in there.

223
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,075
The experiment
requires that you continue.

224
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,943
Go on, please.

225
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,112
And his health
doesn't mean anything?

226
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,215
Whether the learner likes it
or not, we must continue.

227
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,684
I'm sorry, look,
I don't mean to be rude, sir,

228
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,287
but I think you should
go look in on him. I mean,

229
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,457
all you have to do is look in on
him. Look into that door.

230
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,058
'Cause I'm not
getting any noise,

231
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,094
I'm not getting no sound here.

232
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,262
We must continue.

233
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,566
Go on, please,
the next word is "white".

234
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,887
Teacher: "White: Cloud, horse",

235
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,790
rock, house."

236
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,060
White horse.

237
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,795
450 volts again.

238
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,201
"Fair.

239
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,872
Price, rule, skin, sky."

240
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,478
Wrong. 450 again.

241
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,850
All right, thank you.
We are done with the experiment.

242
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,985
OK.

243
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm just going
to speak with the learner.

244
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,723
I think he might be
a little upset. In the meantime,

245
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,125
my assistant would like
to ask you a few questions,

246
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,629
- if you don't mind?
- Yeah, surely.

247
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,697
Dr. Milgram?

248
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,833
How do you do?

249
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,539
Uh, first I'd like...
No, thank you.

250
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,175
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

251
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,676
Yes, surely.

252
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,219
Uh, why did you give him,
the man in the other room,

253
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,588
the learner, the shocks?

254
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,158
Well, as you could see,
I wanted to stop 'cause

255
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,061
each time you gave him a shock
the guy hollered.

256
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,397
Did it sound as if
he was in pain?

257
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,833
Yeah.

258
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,836
Did he say he wanted you
to stop the experiment?

259
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,505
Yes.

260
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,308
Did he have
a right to stop the experiment?

261
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,045
I don't know.

262
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,180
Why didn't you stop,
at that point,

263
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,916
- when he asked you to stop?
- Why didn't I stop?

264
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,818
- Mm-hm.
- Well, 'cause...

265
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,553
'Cause he told me to continue.

266
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,790
Why did you listen to that man
and not the man in pain?

267
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,365
Well, 'cause... 'cause I thought
the experiment depended on me.

268
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,501
- And nobody told me to stop.
- He asked you to stop.

269
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,439
That... That's true,
but he's the, um,

270
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,576
you know, the subject,
shall we say?

271
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,945
Who was the...

272
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,580
Who bore the responsibility

273
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,550
for the fact this man was
being shocked?

274
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,322
I don't know.

275
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,563
Could you fill out items six
through 18 on the questionnaire

276
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,799
in front of you, please?
Here's a pen.

277
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,675
Ah, I get a little skittish.

278
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,111
Uh... nervous.

279
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,714
As I explained to
Mr. Wallace in the other room,

280
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,817
this shock generator's actually
used for small animals

281
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,755
for laboratory experiments.
Mice, rats, and so forth.

282
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,492
The visual designation
is actually misleading.

283
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,028
This shock generator's actually
been adjusted so that the shocks

284
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,765
were just slightly stronger
than the shock you experienced.

285
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,167
Are you all right?

286
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,303
Yeah, I'm fine, you know.

287
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:28,906
No hard feelings.
I probably would've done

288
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,208
the same thing myself.

289
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,610
<i>Ciao.</i>

290
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,683
Each subject has a
reconciliation with the learner.

291
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,618
We ask the subject
to maintain a secrecy

292
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,454
so that future recruits
aren't tipped off.

293
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,756
Down the line
we get more candid.

294
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,259
The first thing
I wanna tell you is

295
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,661
the man in the other room
wasn't being shocked.

296
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,998
The only real shock was
the one that you felt early on.

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,034
We're really interested in
studying your reaction

298
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,504
to having to inflict pain on
someone you don't know.

299
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,374
The experiment's about
obeying orders.

300
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,911
The man in the other room
works with us as a team.

301
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,713
Jim, you can come out now.

302
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,916
He wasn't really being shocked,
he's perfectly fine.

303
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,551
We weren't trying to fool you,

304
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,420
we're just interested
in studying your reactions.

305
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,756
Man, you dog.

306
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,826
I... I was worried sick.
I thought I was...

307
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,196
You're a good fella. No hard
feelings, no hard feelings.

308
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,565
But you thought
you were really shocking him.

309
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,567
When he wasn't making noise
anymore,

310
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,570
that's when I was worried.
I didn't wanna go on with it.

311
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,772
- But you did go on.
- Yeah, but I did not want to.

312
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,742
You saw how it was,
how I was fighting it.

313
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,612
Well, you understand why
we had to do it this way.

314
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:45,916
We wanted to get true reactions
from people, you see.

315
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,487
You'll receive a copy of the
report when the project's over.

316
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,789
Until then, we ask you not to
say anything.

317
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,391
You may end up
talking to someone

318
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,160
who is a potential participant.

319
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,931
How do you feel about having
come down here and done this,

320
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,700
now that you know?

321
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,602
I mean...

322
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,838
Now that I know the truth,
I don't mind.

323
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,674
Thank you very much
for coming down.

324
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,544
We certainly do appreciate you
giving us your time.

325
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,580
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alan here will help you out.

326
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,550
We think you'll find the report
very interesting.

327
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,753
Thanks. Yeah, thank you.

328
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,332
I still get nervous.
You're cool as ice.

329
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,736
Maybe all those years of
teaching high school

330
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,372
- gives you sort of a...
- Poker face?

331
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,008
Discipline, I was thinking.

332
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,277
You're like a gravedigger.

333
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,612
I think you mean undertaker.

334
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,483
The domino effect starts to kick
in, in the teacher's mind,

335
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,585
once he assumes the role.

336
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,622
Get some women in here.
Get my wife in this seat,

337
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,492
we've got nine kids,
the first squawk

338
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,227
she'd stop the whole shebang.

339
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,095
Nine kids.
Are you sure about that?

340
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,366
Oh, yeah. I have enough saved up
to give 'em each a pair of socks

341
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,235
if the electricity gets me.

342
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,305
You're a brave man, Jim.
All right, next subject's due.

343
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,006
I should get going.

346
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,157
I was born in the Bronx, 1933.

347
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,327
My father's from Hungary,
my mother Romania,

348
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,964
Jewish immigrants. It was a
matter of chance they arrived

349
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,867
in the US as children and
managed to raise a family in.

350
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,070
New York instead of being swept
up into the extermination camps

351
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:49,006
and murdered by the Nazis, like
millions of others like them

352
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,274
in Eastern Europe.

353
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,710
That's really what's behind

354
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:56,814
the obedience experiments.
The inkling I was chasing,

355
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,650
the thing that troubled me.

356
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,156
How do civilized human beings
participate

357
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,392
in destructive, inhumane acts?

358
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:12,930
How was genocide implemented so
systematically, so efficiently?

359
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,299
And how did the perpetrators of
these murders

360
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,034
live with themselves?

361
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,183
My daughter, Michele,
a precocious child

362
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,886
who at this point in the story
hasn't yet been born,

363
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,923
"My dad's a psychologist,"

364
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,859
but not the kind who talks to
people lying down.

365
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,228
He's an experimental
psychologist.

366
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,798
"He does experiments."

367
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,471
First let's determine which of
you will be "learner"

368
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,907
and which will be "teacher."

369
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,013
"Teacher."

370
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,950
They both say that.
And no one's caught on?

371
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,586
- Not a soul.
- Not the corporate manager,

372
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:11,455
the banker, the plumber,
the Good Humor man.

373
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,891
The Good Humor man
was actually vicious.

374
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,994
Crude mesomorph of obviously
limited intelligence.

375
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,497
The script has kind of momentum.
It carries them along.

376
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,700
- Men only?
- Every hour.

377
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:25,369
It's getting to be a blur,
really.

378
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,672
So you lead them both, both
the teacher and the learner,

379
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:32,443
into the, uh... electric chair?

380
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,779
Well, we don't call it that,

381
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,617
but, yes, if you'll follow me
into the next room, please?

382
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,590
Here's my home.

383
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,159
I think I'd go nuts in this
little room all day.

384
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,663
Well, they keep me busy. Agh!

385
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,331
Actually, I have
a heart condition.

386
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,432
Really?

387
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,135
It does give you authenticity,
I think, in the part.

388
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,405
But I think I'm a better actor
than I am accountant.

389
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,740
It's nearly time for
the next one.

390
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:06,944
- Oh.
- Is somebody in there?

391
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,779
Maybe Alan.

392
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,115
- Shall we join him?
- Sure.

393
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,186
To give you, the teacher,
an idea of how much shock

394
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,389
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair

395
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,625
you receive a sample shock
yourself. Is that all right?

396
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,761
- Fair enough.
- Give me your right arm.

397
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,929
This is the only real shock,
right?

398
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,297
Mm-hm.

399
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,099
Have you done it?

400
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,368
Been shocked like that,
literally?

401
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,704
- Yeah.
- It's not pleasant.

402
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,609
Now if you'll just
use the scale here

403
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,411
to estimate for me
the amount of volts you think

404
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,813
you've received
in the sample shock.

405
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,951
- I don't know. You tell me.
- That was only 45 volts.

406
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,120
So go ahead and begin the test.

407
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,923
He doesn't have a microphone
but he can hear you.

408
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,025
Just speak into the microphone.

409
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,594
The rooms are partially
soundproof.

410
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,930
Are you ready, learner?

411
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,867
<i>Continues with
robotic impassivity,</i>

412
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,136
<i>oblivious to experimenter.</i>

413
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,772
<i>Seems to derive no pleasure
from the act itself.</i>

414
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:12,009
Incorrect.

415
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,912
The correct answer is box.

416
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,948
<i>Curt and officious
when saying "Correct".</i>

417
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,084
75 volts.

418
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,653
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

419
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:25,689
<i>Each time
he administrates a shock,</i>

420
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,025
<i>lips drawn back,
bares his teeth.</i>

421
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,030
"Sweet: Candy, girl,

422
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,498
taste, pickle."

423
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,536
Wrong. "Sweet taste." 120 volts.

424
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,074
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

425
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,945
<i>Looks sadly at the experimenter</i>

426
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,280
<i>and continues reading
word pairs.</i>

427
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,454
Wrong. "True story".

428
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,056
135 volts.

429
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,026
"Slow, walk..."

430
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,661
<i>Afterwards, if a learner</i>

431
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,363
<i>who says he agreed to it</i>

432
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,999
<i>and therefore must accept
responsibility.</i>

433
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:13,337
Wrong. "Slow music." 150 volts.

434
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,507
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

435
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,842
<i>I can't stand the pain.</i>

436
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,446
The man,
he seems to be getting hurt.

437
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,049
There's no
permanent tissue damage.

438
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,085
Yes, but I know
what shocks do to you.

439
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,387
I'm an electrical engineer,

440
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,523
and I have had shocks.

441
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,425
You get real shook up by them,

442
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,129
especially if you know
the next one is coming.

443
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,665
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,234
It's absolutely
essential that you do continue.

445
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:48,705
Well, I won't, not with the man
screaming to get out.

446
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,041
You have no other choice.

447
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,815
Why don't I have a choice?

448
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,451
I came here on my own free will.

449
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,121
I thought I could help
in a research project.

450
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:09,092
But if I have to hurt somebody,
if I was in his place,

451
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,096
no, I can't continue.

452
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,902
I've probably gone too far
already. I'm very sorry.

453
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,713
I could've wept.

454
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,249
I mean he looked like
he wanted to slug me.

455
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,686
Out of gratitude, you
do understand, I mean wept.

456
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,721
Because all day we've been

457
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,157
getting nothing but "wrong,"
zzzt.

458
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,096
You do realize I have to sit and
listen to you scream all day.

459
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,399
Well, so do I.

460
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,735
He was what, Danish?

461
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,370
Dutch, actually.

462
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,306
Right, but it wasn't his
nationality that caused him

463
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,376
to stop, it was the fact he
worked with electricity.

464
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,644
Hmm.

465
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,847
They all seem
to wanna impress you...

466
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,183
- for some reason.
- Mm-hm.

467
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,052
But why?

468
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,955
Why do so many,
the vast majority,

469
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,391
push all the way through
to the final switch?

470
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:19,029
Why is the Dutchman's defiance
the anomaly instead of the norm?

471
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,165
All the psychiatrists and
psychologists I consulted

472
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,035
were convinced we'd have trouble
finding a single person

473
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,371
that'd go all the way through
to the end. I'd have been

474
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,907
better off consulting the guy
from Pepe's Pizza.

475
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,241
Oh, you mean Pepe?

476
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,277
I think his name is Carmine.

477
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,046
Well, you get my point.
The butcher, the baker,

478
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,048
the candlestick maker.

479
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,619
I'd like to try it,
the test shock.

480
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,356
I just wanna...
know what it feels like.

481
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,959
Sasha.

482
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,863
I don't even think about that,
and I've been in there

483
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,666
supposedly getting
zapped to the maximum.

484
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:02,406
This really isn't necessary.

485
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,042
Well, yeah, but it's not harmful
either.

486
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,577
I mean I just wanna
understand it better.

487
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,947
OK.

488
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,986
Other arm.

489
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

490
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,211
<i>I designed
a series of variations,</i>

491
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,680
<i>25 in all, and continued
the experiments</i>

492
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,682
<i>over the next two semesters.</i>

493
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,186
<i>We adjust the script so that
the learner bangs on the wall...</i>

494
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,521
<i>but says nothing.</i>

495
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,426
<i>We asked the teacher
to physically press</i>

496
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,428
<i>the learner's hand
on a copper plate,</i>

497
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,963
<i>forcing him
to receive the shock.</i>

498
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,000
- House.
- Wrong. 135 volts.

499
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:09,673
<i>In Bridgeport, to deduct the
potential intimidation factor</i>

500
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:15,045
<i>of Ivy League prestige. And,
back at Yale, we include women.</i>

501
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,082
What did you just do?

502
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,319
Uh, he said: "Ow."

503
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,654
Did you turn off the machine?

504
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,293
I... I thought that if it seemed
like I,

505
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,497
you know, turn...

506
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,540
OK. "Short..."

507
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,675
The machine?

508
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,248
Please continue, teacher.

509
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,555
OK, "Short: Sentence, movie",

510
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,791
time, skirt."

511
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,165
I'm sorry, that's wrong.
It's "short time".

512
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,943
<i>In nearly every case,</i>

513
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,179
<i>the essential results
are the same.</i>

514
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,115
<i>They hesitate, sigh, tremble
and groan,</i>

515
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:28,118
<i>but they advance to the last
switch, 450 volts,</i>

516
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,454
<i>"Danger Severe Shock XXX",</i>

517
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,722
<i>because they're
politely told to.</i>

518
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,295
The results are
terrifying and depressing.

519
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,497
They suggest that the kind of
character produced

520
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,467
in American society
can't be counted on

521
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,403
to insulate its citizens from
brutality and

522
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,474
inhumane treatment in response
to a malevolent authority.

523
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,746
Milgram? Milgram is
Hebrew for pomegranate.

524
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,482
Is that what you mean?
It's one of the seven fruits

525
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:01,384
- of the Bible.
- You're Jewish, same as me.

526
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,488
You seem upset.
Am I upsetting you?

527
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,023
I have office hours.
You can make an appointment.

528
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,959
Huh? You don't like surprises.

529
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,395
You know, I've been thinking
about the experiment a lot.

530
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,499
It really rattled my wife
about what it said about me.

531
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,367
If she was me,
she liked to think

532
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,469
she wouldn't have pulled
the switch.

533
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,838
- But you know what?
- What?

534
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,474
You never know. That's
the thing, how can you know.

535
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,543
- You can't, right?
- No, you can't.

536
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,846
If it's any consolation,
a great many participants

537
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,248
were prone to nervous laughter,

538
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,851
but my wife actually is waiting
for me at home for dinner,

539
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,053
- so...
- Are you inviting me?

540
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,490
No. Make an appointment.

541
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,963
With leftover grant money
we film the last two days

542
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,634
of the experiment,
May 26 and 27th, 1962.

543
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,838
Four days later, Adolf Eichmann
is executed in Jerusalem.

544
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,744
<i>Eichmann, architect of
the Holocaust,</i>

545
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:04,481
<i>responsible for the deportation
and murder of millions of Jews,</i>

546
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,284
<i>escaped to Argentina after
World War II.</i>

547
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:13,123
<i>He was living with his family
under the name Ricardo Klement,</i>

548
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,458
<i>an employee of Mercedes-Benz,</i>

549
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,328
<i>when Israeli Mossad agents
captured him in 1960</i>

550
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,697
<i>and brought him to trial.</i>

551
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,899
<i>To completed the translations,</i>

552
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,368
<i>I beg to submit a translation</i>

553
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,672
<i>into the German of our number,
887.</i>

554
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,941
<i>Eichmann didn't deny his crimes,</i>

555
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,010
<i>showed no trace of guilt
or remorse.</i>

556
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,214
<i>Said he was
merely a transmitter.</i>

557
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,382
<i>"I never did anything
great or small</i>

558
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,687
<i>without express instructions
from my superiors."</i>

559
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:54,064
<i>The cradle rocks above an
abyss and common sense tells us</i>

560
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:58,001
<i>that our existence is but
a brief crack of light between</i>

561
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,337
<i>two eternities of darkness.</i>

562
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,580
Let me out of here!
Hey, that really hurts!

563
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,716
I told you,
I have a heart condition!

564
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,318
I will not be in
this experiment anymore!

565
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,487
Ow! Let me out.

566
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,623
Let me outta here! Let me out!

567
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,426
Let... me... out... of here.

568
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:28,565
<i>♪ I will no longer be here ♪</i>

569
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,504
Ah, hey, Stanley,
a nice day to wrap up

570
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,807
- the new obedience experiment.
- Yeah, yeah.

571
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,344
Hmm.

572
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,550
I should tell you about Asch.
Solomon E. Asch.

573
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,987
If you ever saw my thesis at
Harvard, and I worked for him,

574
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,689
diligently and miserably,

575
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,825
at the Institute for Advanced
Study at Princeton.

576
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,796
Asch did the things with
the lines, right?

577
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:05,368
The study you are taking part in
today involves the perception

578
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,837
of the lengths of lines.

579
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,174
As you can see, there are
a number of cards,

580
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,644
and on each card there are
several lines.

581
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,080
Your task is a very simple one.

582
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,583
You're to look at the line on
the left and determine which of

583
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,953
the three lines on the right
is equal to it in length.

584
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,792
<i>This is a recreation
from a film I made in the 70's.</i>

585
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,594
<i>Five of the six participants are
confederates.</i>

586
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,764
<i>The single true subject
in the white T-shirt</i>

587
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:38,501
<i>hears everyone else's answers
before announcing his decision.</i>

588
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,837
- Two.
- Two.

589
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,839
- Two.
- Two.

590
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,840
Two.

591
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:47,544
Good. Let's move onto the next
card. Same thing, gentlemen.

592
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,013
- Three.
- Three.

593
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,716
- Three.
- Three.

594
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:56,019
<i>After the first few
rounds, members of the group</i>

595
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,487
<i>choose the wrong line.</i>

596
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,689
- Two.
- Two.

597
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,259
<i>The subject denies
the evidence of his own eyes</i>

598
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,228
<i>and yields to group influence.</i>

599
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,163
Two.

600
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,099
Very good. Thank you.

601
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:11,267
In the language of
social science, the experiment

602
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,537
was known as the effect of group
pressure upon the modification

603
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,441
- and distortion of judgments.
- Pff. Great title.

604
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,777
It made Asch famous...

605
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,713
amongst social scientists.

606
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,828
It always bothered me that
the experiment was about lines.

607
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,731
I wanted to do something
more humanly significant.

608
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,305
He hears the bell.

609
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,708
Stanley, it's so good
to see you.

610
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,044
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is Sasha.

611
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,581
Sasha, how are you?
So lovely to see you. Come in.

612
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,816
- Stanley - How are you?

613
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,151
Glad you made it.

614
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,490
Can I tell you what a miserable
time I had working for Asch?

615
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:11,728
Princeton, the bureaucracy,
the institutional arrogance.

616
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,931
Not permitted to use a scrap of
paper without it becoming

617
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,801
an issue to be settled behind
closed doors.

618
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,337
A candy bar in the office

619
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,107
and I was reported
via formal letter.

620
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,609
I assumed he'd introduce me
to the leading intellectuals

621
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,311
of the day. This did not happen.

622
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:32,115
I assumed that he'd acknowledge
me in the book I was researching

623
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,684
for him, a book on conformity.

624
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,188
He did not finish the book.

625
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,957
It was like drinking from
a glass with a false bottom.

626
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,560
I thought there'd be more.
I was thirsty.

627
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,563
Please call me Sholem,
I would prefer it.

628
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:48,998
There's no need to be so stuffy.

629
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,134
In an elevator? Really?

630
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,237
They met in an elevator.

631
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,573
Can someone please pacify
the dog?

632
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,543
Here I am,
still trying to impress him.

633
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,246
Human nature can be studied
but not escaped,

634
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,315
especially your own.

635
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,617
Well, I was on my way
into this party

636
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,019
and I could feel somebody
walking behind me

637
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,956
as I went into the building.
We both got onto the elevator,

638
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,692
and it turned out we were going
to the same floor.

639
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,228
And one of us said,
I don't remember which,

640
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,096
"Are we going to the same
party?"

641
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,831
My fate was sealed.

642
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,701
He didn't leave my side
the whole night.

643
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,769
And he drove me home,

644
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,072
and it turned out we had
a lot in common.

645
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,408
We were both from the Bronx,
my mother was born in Russia.

646
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,311
So my sister's friend,
her parents in Vienna

647
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,648
had sent her and her brothers
to New York during the war.

648
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,850
But when I was over there
visiting, they had

649
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,120
just reclaimed their factory,
and it was a coat factory,

650
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,422
and that's where I got this.

651
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,492
So, you're a well-travelled
American girl,

652
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,361
born in Switzerland,

653
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:55,298
who took dance lessons in Paris
and is wearing a Viennese coat?

654
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,669
Why haven't we met before?

655
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,540
Stanley, why do you feel
compelled to dwell on

656
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,643
the negative aspects of
obedience?

657
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,879
Why must you focus on
its destructive potential?

658
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,982
Obedience isn't necessarily
an instrument of evil.

659
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:16,052
I think we can both agree,
looking at recent history,

660
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,854
the history that brought you
to this country,

661
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,124
a history in which
we see abusive power

662
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,827
assuming unprecedented murderous
dimensions.

663
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,097
Why does your experiment give me
a dirty feeling?

664
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,434
He didn't expect these results.

665
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,403
He tried to change
the conditions

666
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,339
so that people
would refuse to obey.

667
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,574
Ah.

668
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:40,009
We met in a library.

669
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,078
Oh, him, not him.

670
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,448
The whole time, I'm sorry,
this is startling,

671
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:50,353
out of 780 subjects,
not a single person got up,

672
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,988
went to the door and looked in

673
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,657
to see if the man screaming
was all right.

674
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,627
Not a single one.

675
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,767
<i>Sasha goes back
to school, Smith College,</i>

676
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,669
<i>for her degree in social work.</i>

677
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:11,174
<i>My first obedience paper
submitted almost two years ago</i>

678
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,776
<i>to the Journal of Abnormal
and Social Psychology</i>

679
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,913
<i>is finally published
in October 1963,</i>

680
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,782
<i>just after I start
a new job at Harvard,</i>

681
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,519
<i>Assistant Professor,
Department of Social Relations.</i>

682
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,322
Am I impressed with myself
being at Harvard?

683
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:30,994
Well, I got my PhD here,
Harvard is the best place to be.

684
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,065
The subjects were seen to swear,
tremble, stutter,

685
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:40,336
bite their lips, dig their
fingernails into the flesh,

686
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:44,007
and these were characteristic
responses, not exceptions,

687
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:48,411
and yet, despite this behavior,
the majority complied.

688
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,814
Yes?

689
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,150
How do you justify
the deception?

690
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,621
I like to think of it as
illusion, not deception.

691
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,491
Semantics, you may say,
but illusion, you know,

692
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,826
has a revelatory function,
as in a play.

693
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,195
Illusion can set the stage for
revelation,

694
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,965
to reveal certain
difficult-to-get-at truths.

695
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,235
But still, when you go to see
a play, you pay for a ticket.

696
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,936
You know you're seeing a play.

697
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,673
These people didn't know
it wasn't real.

698
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,175
You tricked them.

699
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:22,178
Hello, today we'll be
doing an experiment about

700
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,480
blind obedience
to malevolent authority.

701
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,550
I'd like for you to pretend
that this machine is delivering

702
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,819
painful shocks to a person in
the other room.

703
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,921
How truthful do you think
that would be?

704
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:36,025
But if you think of it, really,
you were delivering shocks

705
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,529
to your subjects.
Psychological shocks.

706
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,330
- And the anxieties...
- No...

707
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,932
methodically, for one year.

708
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,668
If your facts were
as solid as your imagination,

709
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,004
you'd realize that this is
a false analogy.

710
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:53,109
As Kierkegaard says: "Take away
paradox from the thinker"

711
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,012
- "and you have a professor."
- An assistant professor.

712
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,548
For the moment,
Dr. Milgram and myself

713
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,817
are only assistant professors,
it's true.

714
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,619
<i>The gentleman
in the elevator now</i>

715
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,455
<i>is a</i> Candid<i> star.</i>

716
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:08,424
<i>These folks who are entering,
the man with the white shirt,</i>

717
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,693
<i>the lady with the trench coat,</i>

718
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,263
<i>and, subsequently,
one other member of our staff,</i>

719
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,432
<i>will face the rear.</i>

720
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:20,636
<i>And you'll see how this man in
the trench coat...</i>

721
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,879
<i>tries to maintain his
individuality,</i>

722
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:35,017
<i>but, little by little...</i>

723
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,860
<i>he looks at his watch but
he's really making an excuse</i>

724
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,696
<i>"for turning just a little bit
more to the wall."</i>

725
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,397
Actually, it's true.

726
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,934
There's an element of illusion
in almost all my work.

727
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,403
<i>This man has apparently</i>

728
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,805
<i>been in groups before.</i>

729
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:09,085
<i>Candid Camera</i> was a reference
point, I never denied that.

730
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,554
You can see that plainly enough
in the lost letter technique,

731
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:14,924
which I conceived of at Yale and
was refined at Harvard.

732
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,260
<i>Leave a letter, a sealed,
stamped letter</i>

733
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,595
<i>but unmailed,
for someone else to find.</i>

734
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,799
<i>Leave it on a sidewalk,
inside a store, a phone booth.</i>

735
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,634
<i>Put it under the windshield
wipers of a parked car</i>

736
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:27,904
<i>with a note saying,
"Found near car."</i>

737
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:31,073
<i>All letters are addressed to
the same post office box.</i>

738
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,109
<i>But they're evenly split between</i>

739
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,311
<i>four different
intended recipients.</i>

740
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,514
Friends of the Communist Party,
friends of the Nazi Party,

741
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:42,785
Medical Research Associates,
and Mr. Walter Carnap.

742
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,121
<i>All fictitious.</i>

743
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,290
<i>The innocuous content of
the letters,</i>

744
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,992
<i>if anyone's curious enough
to open and read,</i>

745
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,595
<i>was a simple message
from "Max" to "Walter"</i>

746
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:54,931
<i>proposing an upcoming meeting.</i>

747
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,336
Carnap.

748
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,839
It's kind of an odd name.

749
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,174
Like the philosopher?

750
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,780
<i>In two weeks,</i>

751
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,515
<i>out of 100 "lost" letters
to each addressee,</i>

752
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:15,685
<i>72 were sent to the Medical
Research Associates,</i>

753
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,254
<i>plus 71 percent to
Mr. Walter Carnap,</i>

754
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,891
<i>but a mere 25 to
the Friends of the Communists,</i>

755
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,927
<i>and the same number, 25,
to the Nazis.</i>

756
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,730
We can deduce from this
that the American public

757
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,932
has an aversion
to Nazis and Communists.

758
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:33,269
Results that are reasonable
and even comforting,

759
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:37,106
though not startling.
But why not take it further?

760
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,975
<i>Taketo Murata, another student,</i>

<i>drives to Charlotte and

<i>to lose a new batch of letters.</i>

<i>When the letters come back,
the percentages, once again</i>

764
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,763
<i>confirm expected prejudices.</i>

765
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,432
<i>Pro-white letters get mailed
more often</i>

766
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,101
<i>in white neighborhoods.</i>

767
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:09,038
<i>More pro-negro letters get
mailed from black neighborhoods.</i>

768
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,909
<i>A variation.</i>

<i>They land in trees, ponds,

773
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,922
Not all my ideas are brilliant.

774
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:43,139
Well, it's not on the front
page, strangely enough.

775
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,086
I found it. Page Ten.

776
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,691
OK. Uh...

00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,532
It's odd to see one's name

00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:17,974
It wasn't a thousand, was it?

784
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,909
I talked to him for
over half an hour

785
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,011
and I don't see
a single direct quote.

786
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:26,515
"Dr. Milgram pointed out
that from 1933 to 1945,"

787
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,351
millions of persons

788
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,587
were systematically slaughtered
on command.

789
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:35,458
Gas chambers were built,
death camps were guarded,

790
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,295
corpses were produced
with the same efficiency

791
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,765
"as the manufacture of
appliances."

792
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:45,101
There's a quote.

793
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,438
Do you think anyone else reads
this paper?

794
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,788
President Kennedy has been shot.

795
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,224
He was shot in the motorcade
in Dallas.

796
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:11,560
He was shot in the head.

797
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,897
It's Milgram. It's just another
one of his experiments.

798
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,432
- On the level?
- Yes.

799
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,368
Kelly, you've got that radio,
yeah? Turn it on.

800
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,639
<i>His tour
of the City of Dallas, Texas.</i>

801
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,142
<i>A presidential aide,
Mario Bryan, said he had</i>

802
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:28,444
<i>"no information on whether
the President is alive... "</i>

803
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,480
He's rigged a faked broadcast,
like Orson Welles.

804
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:34,950
I wonder what the experiment's
really about?

805
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,920
- This is real.
<i>- The president is critical.</i>

806
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:40,189
<i>Texas Governor John Connally
also was shot</i>

807
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,092
<i>and has been taken to surgery
in Parkland Hospital...</i>

808
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,824
I got it cheap, I got it cheap
from a grad student.

809
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:16,525
He gave me a deal
when he realized

810
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,294
he couldn't take it with him
to London.

811
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,497
It's making a funny noise.
Maybe you can have a look.

812
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,467
- Stanley...
- You love this kind of thing.

813
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,969
The dean lives
right across the street.

814
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:29,205
We just applied for
financial aid.

815
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:31,540
A Jaguar, right.
What's he going to think?

816
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,509
What...
Who cares what he thinks?

817
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,778
I didn't say that.

818
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,114
- Well...
- I didn't say that.

819
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:41,984
Yeah.

820
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,320
See you soon.

821
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,695
It was cheaper than you think,

822
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,964
but I understand it creates
the wrong impression.

823
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,265
- Do you?
- I do.

824
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,434
Or are you just doing
an imitation of

825
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,203
someone who listens,
who's reasonable?

826
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:03,639
Well, we're going to need
two cars.

827
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,876
Is that the dean?

828
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:12,014
Well, maybe it'll impress
the Harvard tenure committee.

829
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:14,350
Who cares what they think?

830
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,556
- So you returned the car?
- I did.

831
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,492
- It was sensible.
- Hmm.

832
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:27,329
I don't know a single tenured
professor who drives a Jaguar.

833
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,632
I didn't like the color.

834
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:33,402
If you get turned down it won't
be because of an automobile.

835
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,906
But it's got to sting, yeah?

836
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:40,643
The attacks, the criticisms,
the violent reactions.

837
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,846
That woman was going through
a divorce, it turns out.

838
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,182
I didn't take it personally.

839
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,485
I'm going through a divorce.

840
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,454
I don't spit at people.

841
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,827
I'm sorry to hear that.

842
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:01,797
Thank you.

843
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:18,214
It's true that I am, possibly,
more than commonly on edge,

844
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,816
but how would you feel if you
picked up a copy of.

845
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,285
<i>American Psychologist</i>
and found yourself attacked in

846
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:27,590
an article called "Some Thoughts
on Ethics in Research:".

847
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:31,160
A Response to Milgram's
Behavioral Study of Obedience"?

848
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,730
Psychiatrists,
many of you in this room,

849
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,466
predicted that only one person
in a thousand

850
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,101
would deliver the shocks across
the board,

851
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:42,972
an estimate that was off by
a factor of 500.

852
00:50:42,974 --> 00:50:48,677
So what happened in the lab was
discovered, not planned.

853
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,315
But you expected, you knew you
were going to worry some people.

854
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,617
- Mmm.
- Stress, in fact,

855
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,819
- was a part of it.
- Well, every...

856
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:57,853
Extreme stress.

857
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:01,257
Every experiment is a situation
where the end is unknown,

858
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:05,394
indeterminate, something that
might fail.

859
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,197
The indeterminacy is part of
the excitement.

860
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,699
Ethics. The undertow of ethics.

861
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:16,005
I wanted to ask a question,
a series of questions

862
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:19,942
about the psychological function
of obedience. The conditions

863
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:23,145
that shape it, the defense
mechanisms it entails.

864
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,950
The emotional forces
that keep a person obeying.

865
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:30,986
As someone with pretensions as
a moral educator,

866
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:35,724
let me suggest that science must
enhance our moral personhood,

867
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:38,494
not... not diminish it.

868
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,363
You forced people
to torture other people.

869
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,831
- No.
- To see if they...

870
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,935
No. No. No.
That is alien to my view.

871
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,673
No one was forced, right?

872
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:53,642
The experimenter told the
subject to perform an action.

873
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:57,379
What happened between
the command and the outcome

874
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,481
is the individual.

875
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:04,687
With conscience and a will,
who can either obey or disobey.

876
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:09,058
I don't see how you can
seriously equate victimization

877
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,961
in a laboratory con
with the willful participation

878
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,296
in mass murder.

879
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,799
Victimization? Look...

880
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:21,570
When the experiments were
complete

881
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,873
all the subjects were
sent this questionnaire.

882
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,408
Here's some examples.

883
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:33,816
84 percent said they were glad
to have been in the experiment.

884
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:37,152
15 percent indicated neutral
feelings.

885
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:41,490
1.3 percent indicated negative
feelings.

886
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,393
1.3 percent.

887
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,396
Four-fifths thought more
experiments of this sort

888
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:51,066
should be carried out,
and 74 percent said they had

889
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:55,237
learned something of personal
importance about themselves

890
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,674
and about the conditions
that shape human action.

891
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:05,714
<i>A year after the study,
a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Errara,</i>

892
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,117
<i>was hired to meet with subjects
who might have suffered</i>

893
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,252
<i>possible negative effects.</i>

894
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:14,390
This is not another experiment.
There's no trick here.

895
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,859
I can see why you may have
your doubts.

896
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

897
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:20,262
This is a debriefing meeting.

898
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:23,365
We're here to assess
the after-effects.

899
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,502
So, tell us how you feel.

900
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,739
I'd like to know
what the point is of it.

901
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,376
To learn something about
human nature.

902
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,112
That was the aim.

903
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,248
Professor Milgram?

904
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:44,219
I hope that... I sincerely hope
that, basically,

905
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,955
you don't have the feeling that
would rather not have been

906
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,757
a part of this experiment.

907
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,729
It's an interesting
life experience.

908
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,798
I don't like hurting anyone

909
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,867
and I can't understand myself
going all the way.

910
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,737
- It left me feeling guilty.
- Mm-hm.

911
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,039
Weren't we supposed
to have coffee?

912
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:08,544
I told my husband.
I know I wasn't supposed to.

913
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,979
But I don't do everything
I'm told.

914
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,449
He said he wouldn't have done
the shocks.

915
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,050
He would have refused.

916
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,154
I wanted to cry,
but I started to laugh.

917
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:22,624
- I think I did both.
- I was quite frightened,

918
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,227
and I was quivering, and it's...

919
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:28,597
I actually tried to memorize
the word pairs myself so that

920
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,232
so that if they
switched it around

921
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,000
I wouldn't have to get
those shocks.

922
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,170
There's a tendency to think that
everything a person does

923
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:38,907
is due to the feelings or ideas
within the person.

924
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,277
You haven't had your coffee.
You want coffee?

925
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,913
- Yes.
- Cream? Sugar?

926
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,483
- I'll take two sugars.
- Both, please.

927
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,651
Yes, thank you.

928
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,956
But sometimes a person's actions
depend equally

929
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,058
on the situation
you find yourself in.

930
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,495
And in this case, the power of
the situation overwhelmed

931
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,563
your personal power.

932
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:04,166
I'm an understanding person.

933
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:09,738
I'm an intelligent human being.
Speak the truth to me...

934
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,077
and I'll cooperate gladly,
even if it's a bitter truth,

935
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,212
but don't lie to me.

936
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,250
The purpose was
to advance science,

937
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,986
learn something.

938
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,555
Maybe you shouldn't do this kind
of experiment

939
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,091
if you have to deceive.

940
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:33,529
Look, you can deceive other
people but don't deceive me.

941
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,901
<i>We had half a dozen
sessions with Errara</i>

942
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,870
<i>and invited subjects. The
meetings were sparsely attended,</i>

943
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,907
<i>full of confusion and
complaints, but we concluded</i>

944
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,276
<i>that no one showed signs
of harm,</i>

945
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:49,278
<i>no one had been traumatized.</i>

946
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,915
- Stanley?
- Tom Shannon.

947
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,618
Tom did the wiring on
the shock generator.

948
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,454
- At Yale. The shock box.
- Pleased to meet you.

949
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,757
- This is Sasha.
- This is Michele.

950
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:04,960
Hey, I hated hearing about
Jim McDonough. Dead at 49.

951
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,929
That stuff about his heart
was no joke.

952
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:11,166
Yeah, I know. Sat down to a bowl
of oatmeal, had a heart attack.

953
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,371
He had nine kids.

954
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,442
Oh, sad. Maybe you shouldn't
unload such a large brood

955
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:22,344
into the world, no offense.

956
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:25,914
She's taking us to Paris. It's
the first stamp on her passport.

957
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,550
- That's awesome.
- Sasha thinks I need a vacation.

958
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,686
Yeah. I heard they roughed you
up pretty good

959
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:33,655
- about those results.
- He's up for tenure.

960
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:35,090
People get feisty,
but it'll work out.

961
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:38,393
Gotta finish your book now.
Publish or perish, right?

962
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,429
Actually, I got sidetracked

963
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:42,731
working on
the small world problem.

964
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:47,235
For the Small World Problem, we
asked people in Kansas and Omaha

965
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:51,273
to mail a packet to a person in
Sharon, Massachusetts.

966
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,744
The instructions are simple.

967
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,347
<i>There's a target person.</i>

968
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:01,283
<i>In this case, a stockbroker
named Jacobs in Sharon, Mass.</i>

969
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:04,519
<i>Assuming they don't know them,
people are asked to mail</i>

970
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,722
<i>the folder to someone who might
know him.</i>

971
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,825
<i>They can send it to a friend,
relative, or acquaintance,</i>

972
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,794
<i>but they have to send it,
and this is key, to a person</i>

973
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,465
<i>they know on a first-name basis.
There's a roster to fill out</i>

974
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:17,866
<i>and a batch of postcards
to mail back</i>

975
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,369
<i>to Harvard to track the process.</i>

976
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,171
<i>Will it work? We don't know.</i>

977
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,074
<i>A woman in Omaha sends the
folder to a high school friend,</i>

978
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,176
<i>a bank clerk, in Council Bluffs,
Iowa.</i>

979
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,446
<i>She sends it to man in Belmont,
Massachusetts, a publisher,</i>

980
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,383
<i>who sends it to a tanner in
Sharon, the tanner sends it</i>

981
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:37,919
<i>to his brother-in-law, a sheet
metal worker, also in Sharon,</i>

982
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,323
<i>who sends it to a dentist,
who sends it to a printer,</i>

983
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:43,725
<i>who sends it to Mr. Jacobs.</i>

984
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,061
<i>Seven links in the chain.</i>

985
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:51,066
<i>The average chain, in fact,
involves 5.5 links.</i>

986
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:54,236
<i>That is, we determine that less
than six degrees of separation</i>

987
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:57,239
<i>exist between you
and several million strangers</i>

988
00:57:57,241 --> 00:58:00,375
<i>who you may or may not encounter
in your lifetime.</i>

989
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,846
<i>When we understand the structure
of this communication net,</i>

990
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,315
<i>we stand to grasp a good deal
more about</i>

991
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,751
<i>the fabric of society.</i>

992
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:11,953
<i>Maybe it's not necessarily
justified,</i>

993
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,189
<i>this common human complaint.</i>

994
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:18,293
<i>The feeling that we're all
cut off, alienated, and alone.</i>

995
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,932
I don't need to go into detail
to hide the things I remember,

996
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:26,501
when I was 16, in Bucharest.

997
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,371
The killings, torture, terror.

998
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:30,706
Why are you bringing this up
now?

999
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,207
It's relevant.

1000
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:36,344
The man was just turned down
for tenure at Harvard.

1001
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,947
You wish to give the tragedy
some perspective.

1002
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,983
It's not just that.
Because, bear with me,

1003
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,486
they took people to the
slaughterhouse and strung them

1004
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,655
on meat hooks, still alive.

1005
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:49,191
Cut open their bellies
like cattle.

1006
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,159
A five-year-old boy.

1007
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:55,230
And they watched the entrails
spill out, the blood drain,

1008
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:59,601
and they wrote notes and they
pinned the papers to the bodies.

1009
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,937
"Kosher."

1010
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,697
Serge was just giving me
a lesson in...

1011
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:29,765
Reality?

1012
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:34,035
The pogroms,
in Romania during the war.

1013
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,872
The Iron Guard,

1014
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,510
they lit people on fire,
threw them off buildings.

1015
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,748
This is my charming way of
saying your husband's work

1016
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,084
is very important...

1017
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:51,086
and timely.

1018
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:54,489
Because the techniques change,
the victims change,

1019
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:58,794
but it's still a question.
How do these things happen?

1020
01:00:00,062 --> 01:00:02,397
How are they institutionalized?

1021
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,401
The Algerian War,

1022
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:09,738
the tortures. Do you know about
this in the States?

1023
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,439
Yeah, of course.

1024
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,410
You should do the obedience
experiments in Europe, Stanley.

1025
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:18,146
France, Germany.

1026
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,749
Recreate them.

1027
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,884
Will it be different?

1028
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,154
- I don't think so.
- Who would fund them?

1029
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,292
The experiments are unethical.
Remember?

1030
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,062
No tenure, no funding.

1031
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,265
And the IRBs? The IRBs, yes,

1032
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:40,302
basically you cannot do these
experiments without submitting

1033
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,571
something to
the Internal Review Board.

1034
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:46,041
He'll finish his book, and then
Stanley wants to move on

1035
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:49,010
from the obedience experiments,
and why not?

1036
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:54,583
Well, you look under a rock,
ugly things crawl out,

1037
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:57,085
and we have to face them.

1038
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:04,226
Your other experiments,
the letters, the maps,

1039
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:06,294
clever, hopeful,

1040
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:10,732
but you have to get back to
the obedience experiments.

1041
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,200
I do. I have to.

1042
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:15,570
Yes, Stanley.
You have no choice.

1043
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,581
<i>My new job at
City University of New York</i>

1044
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:29,851
<i>involves a jump in pay

1045
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,521
<i>The head of the department of
social psychology.</i>

1046
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,658
The City of New York is
a major laboratory, to be

01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,661
utilized in the research and
training of graduate students

1048
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:41,763
in social psychology.

1049
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,605
That's from the CUNY brochure.

1050
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,634
I wrote it.

<i>Sasha finds an apartment for us

1052

<i>time refuses to stand still.</i>

1056
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,960
I walk to the station

1057
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,895
take the train into this city.

1058
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,564
I enjoy the routine.

1059
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,438
Today's assignment.
Get on a local bus,

1060
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,374
and then with the bus in motion
and loud enough

1061
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:28,810
to be heard by your fellow
passengers,

1062
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,879
sing your favorite song.

1063
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,016
Any song we want?

1064
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:38,119
Just as long as you know the
words and can sing them loud

1065
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:42,324
and clear. Pair up. Non-singer
takes notes, then switch roles.

1066
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,264
You may say, "so what, singing
a song, anyone can do that."

1067
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,899
Or, "I don't have to do that",

1068
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,867
I'm an individual,
not a conformist."

1069
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,235
Or, "This is silly",

1070
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:57,906
it doesn't change the world
to sing a song."

1071
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:00,475
My answer to you is simply this.

1072
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,045
Get on the bus and sing.

1073
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,116
Now go, right now. Come on.

1074
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:14,322
No humming.

1075
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,737
My next guest is
professor of psychology

1076

the City University in New York.

1078
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:35,643
He's written a fascinating book,
a disturbing book.

1079

<i>An Experimental View,</i>

just published by<i> Harper & Row.</i>

1081
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:46,421
Please welcome a very creative,
very controversial

1082
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,824
sociopsychologist,
Stanley Milgram.

1083
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,292
Doctor. Dr. Milgram.

1084
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:56,031
So your subjects, they thought
the shocks were real,

1085
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:59,868
that they were
delivering 450 volts,

1086
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,936
- 65 percent of them.
- Mm.

1087
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:06,107
But they were not particularly
aggressive or sadistic people.

1088
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:08,777
They were a representative
cross-section of the average

1089
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:12,047
American citizen living within
range of Yale University.

01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:15,583
I thought, yes, we'd do
the experiment in New Haven,

1091
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,286
and there'd be very limited
obedience,

1092
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,656
and then we'd recreate
the experiment in, say, Berlin,

1093
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:25,160
and find the rate of obedience
to be much higher.

1094
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,263
Saved a bit on airfare,
didn't you?

1095
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,533
So, let me get this straight.

1096
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:34,669
You did the experiment
in the early 60's?

1097
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,872
And here we are, 1974,

1098
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,608
and your book still feels like
news.

1099
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,744
Why is that?

1100
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,981
People don't have the resources
to resist authority.

1101
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,184
That's what the experiment
teaches us.

1102
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:51,953
But people don't wanna hear it.
The experiment explains

1103
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:56,891
a kind of flaw in
social thinking.

1104
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,861
A deadening,
a suspension of moral value.

1105
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:02,030
What would you
say to your critics,

1106
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:06,334
critics who would insist
the moral lapse is yours?

1107
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:11,072
One of them cites "the extremely
callous, deceitful way"

1108
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,007
the experiments were
carried out."

1109
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:16,377
Another calls them "morally
repugnant, vile,"

1110
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:20,782
um, "Milgram belongs on the
other end of the shock machine."

1111
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:26,054
There certainly is a certain
kind of Kafkaesque quality

1112
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:28,156
- to the experiments.
- Kafkaesque?

1113
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:31,025
The experiment taught me
something about the, uh,

1114
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,161
plasticity of human nature.

1115
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:36,030
Not the evil,
not the aggressiveness,

1116
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,366
but a certain kind of
malleability.

1117
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,170
<i>65 percent of volunteers
were obedient.</i>

1118
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,807
<i>That left 35 percent who
recognized a moral breach,</i>

1119
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:49,410
<i>took responsibility for
their actions and resisted.</i>

1120
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,479
There is no permanent
tissue damage.

1121
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:54,682
That's your opinion.
If he doesn't want to continue,

1122
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,251
I'm taking orders from him.

1123
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,686
The experiment requires
you continue.

1124
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,255
You have no other choice.

1125
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:03,258
If this were Russia maybe,
but not in America.

1126
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:07,595
<i>But obedience,
compliance, was more common.</i>

1127
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:13,368
<i>You tell yourself: "I wouldn't
do that. I'd never do that."</i>

1128
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,703
<i>But then, what did Montaigne
say?</i>

1129
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:21,442
<i>"We are double in ourselves.
What we believe we disbelieve,</i>

1130
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,846
<i>and we cannot rid ourselves of
what we condemn."</i>

1131
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,797
Another one of my experiments.

1132
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,732
Hank, a CUNY grad student,

1133
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,102
was the designated
"crowd crystal" staring up

1134
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:49,737
at a fixed point in space,

1135
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53,508
looking up at a non-existent
"something".

1136
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,711
<i>As you multiply
the confederates,</i>

1137
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:57,579
<i>the people who stare up</i>

1138
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:02,483
<i>the number of people who
actually stop and look</i>

1139
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,819
<i>increases exponentially.</i>

1140
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:09,023
<i>Meanwhile,</i> Obedience To
Authority<i> gets translated into</i>

1141
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,694
<i>eight languages and nominated
for a national book award.</i>

1142
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,868
October 24th, 1974, 4:25pm.

1143
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,172
Sheila Jarcho, J-A-R...

1144
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:25,673
I know how to spell it, Stanley.

1145
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,744
C-H-O, working on the mental
maps project, comes in

1146
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:33,114
and tells me errors were made in
the neighborhood map,

1147
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,050
already duplicated in some
500 copies.

1148
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,887
Her facial expression captures
the attitude that she's shown

1149
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,557
all along in her capacity as
research assistant.

1150
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,993
Are my eyes
really that close together?

1151
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,162
On the whole, both men and women
are highly critical

1152
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,331
when studying photographs of
themselves.

1153
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,100
The vanity factor's
extraordinary

1154
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:54,102
when people judge
their own image.

1155
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,404
Do you ever worry that
everything's sort of

1156
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,274
an anti-climax since
the obedience experiments,

1157
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:03,211
and that your work,
really everything you're doing,

1158
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,546
is just a flash in the pan?

1159
01:08:06,915 --> 01:08:11,119
The truth is, you're invested in
the idea of authority

1160
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,321
and you love lording it over
all of us.

1161
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:16,057
Me, the other students,
and even your wife.

1162
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,258
Me?

1163
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,193
Well, fuck yeah.

1164
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,364
I work here because I get paid
for it

1165
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,733
and I actually think
it's kind of fun.

1166
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,803
Sheila, what's wrong with you?

1167
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:32,807
Huh. Just keep doing
what he tells you to do.

1168
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,012
I don't get along
with all my students.

1169
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:39,881
The flash in the pan?

1170
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:43,017
How many people can manage even
that flash?

1171
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:45,253
I've done some psych
experiments,

1172
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,188
but in my mind I'm still about
to write

1173
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,490
my great Broadway musical.

1174
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:53,928
4:27 pm. Paul Hollander,
looking tan and fit,

1175
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,596
pays a visit from Massachusetts.

1176
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,366
Tan and fit and miserable.

1177
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:00,301
I am so sorry, Paul.

1178
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,537
Well, another marriage
down the drain.

1179
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:06,140
- I should've seen it coming.
- It's terrible, rotten.

1180
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,842
But you look good.

1181
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,445
The worst of it is she's
erected a Berlin Wall

1182
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,347
- between me and my daughter.
- Oh.

1183
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:15,049
Nice place you've got here.

1184
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,618
It isn't Harvard, but thank you.

1185
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,654
Harvard would never have given
you an office half as grand

1186
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,391
as this, or found you
as bewitching a secretary.

1187
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:25,993
Oh. Well, I just go
where the work is.

1188
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,931
So, aren't you
going to take my picture, then?

1189
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,368
I'm considering it.

1190
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:43,111
Do you ever feel invincible
one moment

1191
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:45,079
and then worthless the next?

1192
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,585
Yes and no.

1193
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,662
The camera begins to attract
its own subject matter.

1194
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:05,333
It's no longer a passive
recorder, but actively

1195
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,402
attracts the people it records.

1196
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:14,475
Uh, Stanley Milgram?

1197
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,379
How did I get to be so old?

1198
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,416
What is the Kierkegaard quote?

1199
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,520
"Life can always be...

1200
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:27,688
Only be understood backward."

1201
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,825
October 24th, 1974, 4:29 pm.

1202
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,694
Conversation with Paul Hollander
interrupted by the arrival of

1203
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,798
a messenger bearing, at last,

1204
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,935
the German edition of
<i>Obedience To Authority.</i>

1205
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:42,537
With crass barbed wire
cover design.

1206
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:44,872
<i>Mein Gott.</i>

1207
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,809
- What's your name?
- Thomas Shine.

1208
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,745
Mind participating in
my experiment?

1209
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:51,979
It depends.

1210
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,583
He just wants to take your
picture. Everybody's doing it.

1211
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,787
- OK. I need a signature.
- Oh, yes.

1212
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,491
He's interested in
the unacknowledged power

1213
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,660
of photographic images.

1214
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,362
OK.

1215
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:13,134
Uh, "Life can only be understood
backwards"

1216
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:15,970
but has to be lived forwards."

1217
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,586
<i>Around this time,
I was also working on.</i>

1218
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,688
The Familiar Stranger.

1219
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,227
<i>We take photographs of commuters
on a train platform.</i>

1220
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:42,296
Each figure in the photographs
are given a number.

1221
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,965
The photos are duplicated,

1222
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,267
and a week later
the students follow up.

1223
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,471
Hello. I'm a student at CUNY.

1224
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,874
Would you mind filling out
this questionnaire?

1225
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,475
- OK.
- Also,

1226
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,711
do you recognize
any of these people?

1227
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,012
No.

1228
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:00,882
- What about here?
- Well, that's me.

1229
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,484
Yes.
Can you identify anyone else?

1230
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,820
Uh, not by name.

1231
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:09,724
Most commuters recognize,
on average, four individuals

1232
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:12,593
they see in their daily routine
but never speak to.

1233
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,262
Familiar strangers.

1234
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,964
Amongst these
are "sociometric stars".

1235
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:19,567
Figures that they not only
recognize

1236
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,903
but even fantasize about.

1237
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,776
They wonder what kind of lives
these strangers lead,

1238
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,711
what their jobs are like.

1239
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,247
And if they ran into each other
in another place,

1240
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:36,851
or if some emergency jolted them
out of this routine,

1241
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,821
they might start to speak,
actually know one another.

1242
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,664
I teach at CUNY, and I see you
out here all the time

1243
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:52,466
and I wonder about the things
you must see.

1244
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,402
You look familiar.
What do you teach?

1245
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:57,939
Social psychology. "The City of
New York is a vast laboratory."

1246
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:00,608
I had no idea you were English.
You're English?

1247
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,977
- Yes.
- Assuming that accent is real.

1248
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,814
- I saw you on TV.
<i>- Good Morning America.</i>

1249
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,784
- I knew you looked familiar.
- He tortures people

1250
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:12,553
- with electric shocks.
- That isn't accurate.

1251
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,488
He's very controversial.

1252
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,791
Have you read my book? Have you?

1253
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,327
I don't get a chance to read as
much as I'd like to.

1254
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:21,395
- It's OK.
- I read the review.

1255
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,464
Well, there were many reviews.

1256
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:26,467
It was<i> The Times,</i> wasn't it?
Harsh.

1257
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:28,603
Yes, it was. It was harsh.

1258
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:31,606
It was nominated for an award,
but yeah, who cares?

1259
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,975
Why disabuse yourself?

1260
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:35,076
What?

1261
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,979
I don't wanna make you angry,
ma'am. Just...

1262
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,548
have a nice day, OK?

1263
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:43,084
Abe, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

1264
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:56,230
I was bowled over when I first
read about it,

1265
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:58,432
and you in<i> The Times,</i>

1266
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,635
and then I read the original
material

1267
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,870
and the scientific journals,
and I mulled.

1268
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,972
- You m-mulled?
- I mulled.

1269
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:09,143
This mulling produced the idea
to do a TV play

1270
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:12,947
of a hopefully high caliber, for
an accepted show,

1271
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,350
of a decently adult level,
treating, in fictional form,

1272
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:19,587
the kind of experiments you
performed and its aftermath.

1273
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:22,356
Using it as a springboard for
my own characters

1274
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:25,459
and situational inventions.

1275
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,329
I, uh, I kept this.

1276
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:32,566
D'you see how yellow?

1277
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,503
Stan, sorry, help me.
I was just wondering.

1278
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,638
Your name, its derivation?

1279
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,708
Milgram means "pomegranate"
in Hebrew.

1280
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,911
It's one of the seven fruits of
the Bible. I'm Jewish,

1281
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,646
if that's what you're asking?

1282
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,815
Apples is another, right?

1283
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,885
Figs, grapes.
Olives, they're a fruit?

1284
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:55,489
Anyhow, when you point out
the parallels, the connections,

1285
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,859
Hannah Arendt,
<i>The Banality Of Evil,</i>

1286
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,928
the My Lai massacre,
all of that,

1287
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,364
I see where you're coming from.

1288
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:06,934
I'm here because a serious
situation is pending

1289
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:09,503
with regard to
the drama I propose.

1290
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:15,009
<i>Playhouse 90,</i> the Columbia
Broadcasting System.

1291
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:17,712
CBS.

1292
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,763
Michele,<i> ma belle. Ca va?</i>

1293
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,331
Hi.

1294
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,168
I was just gonna get
some ice cream.

1295
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:03,724
Whenever I'm up late like this,
which is a lot,

1296
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,760
I think of your grandfather.

1297
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:08,529
- Sam.
- Yeah, that was his name.

1298
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:09,864
Yeah.

1299
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,433
He died.

1300
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:16,937
That's right, in his sleep. It's
the luckiest way, people say,

1301
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,939
not to know what's happening.

1302
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,143
Why... Why did he die?

1303
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,410
Hmm.

1304
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:26,180
Heart disease.

1305
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,048
It was before you were born,

1306
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,985
before your mother
could meet him.

1307
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:36,724
He was a baker,
his specialty were cakes.

1308
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,225
- He worked late.
- Mmm-hmm.

1309
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,128
I got it from him.
Maybe you'll get it from me.

1310
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,768
<i>Basically there are
three types of people.</i>

1311
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,337
That's what
your research confirms.

1312
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:53,541
There's the person
who makes things happen,

1313
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:56,644
the person who
watches things happen,

1314
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:59,780
then the person who says,
"What happened?"

1315
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,316
Right?

1316
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:07,087
I'm a dramatist, I was explicit,
not a scientist.

1317
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:12,026
Your work is a springboard for
revealing basic human truths.

1318
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:15,196
You get your consultant's fee.
What's the problem?

1319
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,999
It isn't about the money.

1320
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,772
<i>I'm sorry, she needs
to speak to you again.</i>

1321
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:26,941
<i>She says it's urgent.</i>

1322
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,011
Tell her to relax.

1323
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:40,187
Excuse me.

1324
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,996
<i>Dr. Stanley?</i>

1325
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,698
Yes?

1326
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,202
<i>Mr. Bellak won't be back
in his office this afternoon.</i>

1327
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,404
Excuse me?

1328
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,673
<i>He can't talk to you today
anymore.</i>

1329
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,676
<i>He says you can visit the set.</i>

1330
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:40,180
OK.

1331
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:57,665
So, you sold him the rights?

1332
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:03,203
No. But it's a gray area.

1333
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:07,007
But it's your book, it's your
work, it's your experiments.

1334
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:10,311
Either you did it or you sold it
or you didn't. Right?

1335
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,180
In the opinion of
Harper's legal department,

1336
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:16,116
we don't have a supportable
claim, not on the basis of

1337
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,954
copyright infringement,
because the show is fiction.

1338
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:22,356
Are we finished with this?

1339
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:24,992
They gave me a consulting fee.
Is that enough?

1340
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,829
Your father's turning into
a fictional character.

1341
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,864
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1342
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,433
And why do they have
to make you a<i> goy</i>?

1343
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,902
It's not about me.
I'm just a springboard.

1344
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,271
- Why?
- I don't know.

1345
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:41,442
Oh, I see.
So, you had no choice?

1346
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:45,045
I could just give the money back
but they'd make the show anyway.

1347
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:47,314
Why don't I give the money back?

1348
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,883
I'll give the money back!
That's a good idea.

1349
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,586
You know what?
You don't have to be so snippy.

1350
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:05,165
They don't just come in

1351
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,434
and sadistically pull these
switches, bing, bing,

1352
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,604
they have an inner struggle
not to obey.

1353
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,508
Their inner pain is
the evidence to that.

1354
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,344
Steven, what you're doing
is very important,

1355
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,780
and I love the design.
It's audacious.

1356
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:23,484
And?

1357
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:27,688
I am being careful, which is why
I've got tenure around here

1358
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,024
long before black
became popular.

1359
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,427
It's tricky. Very tricky.

1360
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:37,398
There'll be criticism of
anything breaking new ground.

1361
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,000
There are times when
your life resembles a bad movie,

1362
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,169
but nothing prepares you
if your life

1363
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,804
actually become a bad movie.

1364
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:47,608
Here's Dr. Steven Turner,
Steven/Stanley, Turner/Milgram,

1365
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:51,879
of Rutledge University,
a bachelor and a WASP,

1366
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:54,648
being played by William Shatner,

1367
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:57,985
four years after
his last<i> Star Trek</i> episode<i> .</i>

1368
01:20:57,987 --> 01:21:01,422
Ossie Davis plays his colleague
and best friend.

1369
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,659
I don't believe you're
adequately considering

1370
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:08,128
faculty reaction.

1371
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:11,598
You may find yourself teaching
in Siberia.

1372
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,747
This has to be somewhat weird
for you.

1373
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:32,052
Well, I've made some films
myself actually.

1374
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,720
Documentaries.

1375
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,324
I think Ossie may have meant,
and I was wondering also,

1376
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:42,162
do you have a best friend
who is, you know, a brother?

1377
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:47,835
I mean this tradition of
a black best friend,

1378
01:21:47,837 --> 01:21:49,903
where did that come from?

1379
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,473
You don't have
a black best friend, Bill?

1380
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:54,608
No. Do you?

1381
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,545
This character isn't me.
I'm just a springboard.

1382
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,981
Did you know I did the first
interracial kiss

1383
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:03,050
in US TV history?

1384
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:05,385
Ah,<i> Star Trek,</i> sure.

1385
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:09,189
I kissed Nichelle Nichols on
network TV.

1386
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:12,426
Controversial, but you did it.

1387
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,362
The network was... nervous.

1388
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,932
They insisted we shoot
an alternative version,

1389
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:22,236
but during the close up
I did this...

1390
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,743
First time, 1968,

1391
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:31,545
in the history of TV.

1392
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,451
I've read about
your experiments, Doctor.

1393
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:43,056
Did you happen
to use any black folk?

1394
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,098
Yes, of course.

1395
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,496
And the results?

1396
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,032
They fared the same as
everyone else.

1397
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,501
Roughly 65 percent compliant.

1398
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:57,137
You didn't force or
threaten anyone, right?

1399
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,373
- No.
- You didn't twist anyone's arm?

1400
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,376
Didn't hold a gun
to anyone's head?

1401
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:05,612
You see, it brings to mind when
I was six or seven years old,

1402
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:07,681
coming home from school.

1403
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:10,484
Two policemen call me over
from their car.

1404
01:23:11,352 --> 01:23:13,587
"Come over here, boy.

1405
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:15,856
Come on over."

1406
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,325
- Have I heard this one?
- No.

1407
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,260
They tell me to get into
the car,

1408
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:23,564
and they take me
to the precinct station.

1409
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,700
Then one of them
takes a jar of cane syrup

1410
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,936
and pours it over my head.

1411
01:23:28,938 --> 01:23:33,373
And they both laugh like it's
the funniest thing in the world.

1412
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,342
I laugh too.

1413
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:40,914
Then they give me hunks of
peanut brittle and let me go.

1414
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:45,252
It took me 30 years
before I told anyone.

1415
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:49,456
Where was this, Ossie?
Down South?

1416
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:52,526
Well, it doesn't matter where,
and that's my point.

1417
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,094
You don't have to go to Germany

1418
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,396
to learn about
obedience to authority.

1419
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,899
This in the book. Actually,
it's the tenth chapter,

1420
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:02,169
- which very few people get to.
- The Tenth Level.

1421
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:06,340
The agentic state,
in which the demands of

1422
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,141
the democratically installed
authority

1423
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:09,743
conflict with conscience.

1424
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,179
<i>The Banality Of Evil.</i>

1425
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:18,285
I don't take responsibility.
Do you take responsibility?

1426
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,455
I take responsibility.
Now count that as wrong.

1427
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:22,923
No response counts as wrong.

1428
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:26,293
You pull the switch then,
dammit, you pull the switch.

1429
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:28,495
Mr. Dahlquist, that's your job.

1430
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:31,565
No, I won't.

1431
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,934
Nobody can learn anything
like this.

1432
01:24:35,436 --> 01:24:38,272
There was a time, I suspect,
when men and women

1433
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:40,574
could give a fully human
response to any situation.

1434
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,444
When we could be fully absorbed
in the world as human beings.

1435
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,947
But more often, now,

1436
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,317
people don't get to see
the whole situation

1437
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,985
but only some small part of it.

1438
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:55,522
There's a division of labor,
and people carry out small,

1439
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:58,158
narrow, specialized jobs,

1440
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,995
and we can't act without some
kind of direction from on high.

1441
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,766
I call this "the agentic state".

1442
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:08,435
The individual yields
to authority,

1443
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:12,372
and in doing so becomes
alienated from his own actions.

1444
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,709
Mr. Dahlquist,
you agreed to the rules.

1445
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:19,513
The agentic state is
"store policy".

1446
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,982
It's "I'm just doing my job."

1447
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:25,385
Or "That's not my job."

1448
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,822
Or "I don't make the rules."
"We don't do that here."

1449
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:32,592
"Just following orders."
"It's the law."

1450
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:36,029
In the agentic state,
the individual defines himself

1451
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:39,166
as an instrument carrying out
the wishes of others.

1452
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,935
A soldier, a nurse,
an "administrator".

1453
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:42,969
An actor.

1454
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:48,241
A corporate employee, or even,
yes, academics and artists.

1455
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:52,079
- Please continue.
- Oh God. Oh God.

1456
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,915
- Mr. Dahlquist?
- Just shut up a minute!

1457
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,085
Now hold on.

1458
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:05,025
- Come on, come on.
- Son of a bitch!

1459
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,761
A person has a choice.

1460
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:10,997
He or she chooses
to become agentic.

1461
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,367
But once you assume the role,

1462
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,702
it's almost impossible
to go back.

1463
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,906
Wrong.

1464
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,275
195 volts.

1465
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,611
"Dance."

1466
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,414
<i>Let me out of here! Let me out!</i>

1467
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:29,015
Continue, please.

1468
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,250
<i>We always asked,</i>

1469
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:31,952
<i>"Is there anything
the man could've said</i>

1470
01:26:31,954 --> 01:26:34,521
<i>to stop you from administering
the shocks?"</i>

1471
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,857
<i>"I don't think so. No."</i>

1472
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,393
<i>I told you
I have a heart condition!</i>

1473
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,368
Michele.

1474
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,704
Sit up here. All right?

1475
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,176
Could we get a couple of
hot chocolates?

1476
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:57,711
- You want chocolate?
- Yes, please.

1477
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,980
- Hot chocolates all around?
- Yeah, yeah.

1478
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:02,883
Do you want anything?
OK, no, we're fine.

1479
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:06,720
I need you to stay put,
stay in your seats. OK?

1480
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:19,199
I'm sorry.

1481
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,937
I could say it a thousand times
and mean it every time.

1482
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,442
Marc, turn around in your seat.

1483
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:37,484
Piaget.

1484
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:43,089
You remember when
I was translating Piaget?

1485
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,094
I hit this line about
child development.

1486
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:54,034
It's the specific point when
the growing child is able

1487
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:58,338
to recognize a gap between what
exists and what might exist.

1488
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,575
And it occurred to me,
we choose our reality

1489
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:03,910
when we choose another person.

1490
01:28:06,647 --> 01:28:09,316
What does that mean?

1491
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:11,418
Marriage is not a fantasy.

1492
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:15,622
No, no, right.

1493
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,591
Right.

1494
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,695
But it is a choice.

1495
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:28,134
You have to know
that I choose you.

1496
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,072
Every day I choose you.

1497
01:28:44,418 --> 01:28:46,186
1984.

1498
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,489
1984 was a big year for me.

1499
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,791
My lecture fees peaked,
I was asked to speak

1500
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:55,462
all over the world, about
the obedience experiments,

1501
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:58,832
of course, in relation to
Orwell's prophetic book.

1502
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,702
A book that describes
a totalitarian world

1503
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:06,039
where people aren't very good
at thinking for themselves.

1504
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:15,615

1505

1508
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,900
1984 was also the year
that I died.

1509
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:46,913
<i>I was 51.</i>

1510
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:56,523
Excuse me? We need to see
a doctor immediately.

1511
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:59,626
I'm Stanley Milgram.
This is my ID.

1512
01:29:59,628 --> 01:30:02,295
I believe I'm having
my fifth heart attack.

1513
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,799
Dr. Heissenbuttel...

1514
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:07,701
That's who treated me last time.

1515
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:10,036
You need to fill this out.

1516
01:30:10,038 --> 01:30:12,172
The agentic personality.

1517
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:17,103
<i>No one can truly know
what they might or might not do</i>

1518
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:21,107
<i>when presented with the demands
of a particular situation.</i>

1519
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:24,411
<i>In 2008, a professor at Santa
Clara University replicated</i>

1520
01:31:24,413 --> 01:31:28,248
<i>the obedience experiments and
got roughly the same results.</i>

1521
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:32,152
Over<i> 60 percent of volunteers</i>
<i>delivered the full shocks.</i>

1522
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:34,954
<i>In 2010, the experiments
were duplicated</i>

1523
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,223
<i>on a French reality TV show,</i>

1524
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:40,026
<i>Le Jeu de la Mort,
The Game of Death.</i>

1525
01:31:40,028 --> 01:31:43,697
<i>Participants were egged on by
a live studio audience.</i>

1526
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:45,765
<i>Over 80 percent went

1527
01:31:54,241 --> 01:31:57,043
<i>Alexandra Milgram, Sasha,</i>

<i>continues to live in

<i>in Riverdale. Our children live

<i>near Boston and Toronto.</i>

1531

<i>Sasha never remarried.</i>

1532
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,262
<i>The obedience experiments are
cited and discussed</i>

1533
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:20,333
<i>in nearly every introductory
psychology textbook worldwide.</i>

1534
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,636
<i>My obedience film is screened</i>
