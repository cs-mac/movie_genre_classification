1
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,570
I was with these so-called
"Groupies" never start anything.

2
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,533
That's ridiculous for me,
unreachable stars to cross,

3
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,895
pseudo-religious madmen,

4
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,409
who are willing to
for a single glance,

5
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,568
a single word or a touch
by a stranger totally surrender.

6
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,616
This stranger seems to be the key
to a different world.

7
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,856
I could never say
what fascinates me more,

8
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,212
the groupies themselves or the people
which they adore.

9
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,655
The focus was on the road
signs of life everywhere.

10
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,417
I'm probably going too fast,
to see them. Well.

11
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,850
And then one day I'm
turned into the street groupie.

12
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,612
And I, Andrea Marr,

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,976
would become a groupie.

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,331
I grew up here. Porter City.
Here, everyone still has hopes.

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,816
Here everybody has dreams.
Here, each 'a band.

16
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,808
This is my neighborhood: West Hills.
Here's are not that many bands.

17
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,658
And here I am.
Well, what can I say?

18
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,179
I can not help it.

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,139
I'm at 18
Everyone says how beautiful I've become.

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,329
What irritates me, however, is
that there are also some who say,

21
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,293
I had become sexy.

22
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,370
The problem is, I think,
I have not changed me at all.

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,575
These are my parents.
They wanted to have children.

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,930
I think I was just an accident.
Who knows?

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,970
In any case, they are too old
for a daughter as a teenager.

26
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,891
Well, we were just in the second Semester
the final year.

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,576
For everyone else, a time
of hope and joy.

28
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,098
For me it was sheer torture

29
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,371
Already heard of the Brown?
- Brown? You want to Brown University?

30
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,815
Mr. Jones, I do not know
why should I enroll myself.

31
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,610
The never take me there on.
- Why do you doubt yourself, Andrea?

32
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,619
Again the best work.
- Everything has tits gets, 'ne one.

33
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,459
You have boobs. What have you got?

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,858
Darcy was a good friend,
resents everything that one does not.

35
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,810
Cybil said to have dyed her hair again.
- I had got used to the pink.

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,973
I got it yesterday. The hairdresser
has not given much trouble.

37
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,331
But it looks cool. Is not that right?
- Yes.

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,934
Richard was shy. I tried
to give him some confidence.

39
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,016
Because I knew exactly
how it looks in it.

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,412
Hey, Richard, you're in math but
'Ne written one. I find cool.

41
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,100
Oh yeah?
- Clear.

42
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,329
Shit.

43
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,295
Look, my little-boy fags.
Give me the ball again.

44
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,253
Forget it, you ass!

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,489
Oh God.

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,369
Madness. That was really funny.
But can stupid sayings do not like.

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,856
Stay down.
- His conduct was inexcusable.

48
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,416
The bastard had gone too far.
Someone had to tell him.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,899
And that someone was me.

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,531
Parker, why do you let them
not just in peace?

51
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,895
Help.

52
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,571
Hey, hello, Andrea.
Our sweet little Andrea.

53
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,738
Did you just say something?

54
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,336
Sound as if you had asked
if you ever on my ...

55
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,298
Shows it to him.
- Hey, guys, okay?

56
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,538
Cybil had the strength,
I would have liked.

57
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,653
She lived her life. And if that one
did not fit, that was his problem.

58
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,090
She was great. I'm never
behind it rose, why did it myself.

59
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,178
Wow, your hair is.
- Yes, I know.

60
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,817
I mean, Sheila was the first time with 14

61
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,217
Sandy was even until 13th
I'm 17 and you are 18th

62
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,971
The national average is 16,
Andrea.

63
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,575
And?

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,569
And that's why we should do it at last!
That is why we are so, as we are.

65
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,658
That is why we look, how we look.

66
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,220
What is it?

67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,180
Am I fat?

68
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,975
No.

69
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,410
I have a feeling that today
the night for us both.

70
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,180
Hey, hey, hey ...

71
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,014
Darcy, are you sure? I mean,

72
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,452
you take over the responsibility for
that we are here virginity?

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,539
Responsibility, what do you think?
- I do not know. It's just, Darcy,

74
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,858
We know the guys at all yet.
- I know them, trust me.

75
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,531
You also need to know not one yet,
to make it with him. I mean ...

76
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,458
Are you thinking about who think like that across?

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,569
Hey!

78
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,940
Does not look like it.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,811
When we meet again,
We are both women.

80
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,013
Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

81
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,011
Hey, Scott, do you remember who I am?
- Clear.

82
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,657
Betty!
- Darcy.

83
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,692
Yes. And you are from Franklin, right?
- Porterville City.

84
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,769
Yes, I remember.

85
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,499
Well, here I first met
a flock of groupies.

86
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,850
Poor Things.

87
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,289
They would give their lives to
that as a bull-necked,

88
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,771
belching idiot smiling at them sometimes.
- Hi. Did you want to dance?

89
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,495
Yes, so much.

90
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,499
Lhr plays probably just a game.
- The little one is perhaps a point.

91
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,815
Yes.
- What is it called?

92
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,929
Let's be good times.

93
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,053
Your lips are ripe.

94
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,173
Your neck is ripe.

95
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,093
I'm a class above you.

96
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,053
Your head is the most mature.

97
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,009
Wow, suddenly I felt ready,
me of this older, more experienced man

98
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,089
to be led into the land of love.
- Man, in whom everything is ready.

99
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,576
Farewell, unnamed high school chick.
Long live Andrea Marr,

100
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,340
a sexually blossoming young woman.
- I desire you more than anything else.

101
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,773
Mark, we have beer again.

102
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,377
And, you're a wife?
- Not yet.

103
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,613
But Scott said,
that he likes me.

104
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,619
Come now, let's get outta here.
- Only a second.

105
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,379
Ok? Here, you want 'n sip of tequila?

106
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,531
My God, pull yourself together,
you'll soon be a wife.

107
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,700
Oh, such a crap.

108
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,935
Hi.

109
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,295
Hi.

110
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,619
Oh my God, what is that shit?
- Very cool. I'm almost finished.

111
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,174
Beat it just!

112
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,860
You disgusting pig!
- Now you 's souvenir.

113
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,295
That's what you want groupies!

114
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,619
Shit, I do not believe this.
- Me neither. It was so disgusting.

115
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,691
I can not believe it,
You gave me Scott stretched.

116
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,896
High school chick, parasite,

117
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,137
Groupie. I swore,
This is the name I would never be anyone.

118
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,739
Had I only known then ...

119
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,812
Is late. But it was not my fault.
Excused.

120
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,692
Lies das.

121
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,578
Lhr have opened it?
- Lies.

122
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,331
"We are pleased on behalf of the
College of Brown University ... "

123
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,773
There must be some mistake. Would
my record is not there yet small.

124
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,138
Oh yes, since this terrible thing
happens to me is, I mean,

125
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,179
I've become sexy, it falls
my father difficult to touch me.

126
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,817
To Brown, I?

127
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,296
Wow. How was that possible?
What had I done to deserve this?

128
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,011
I mean, has some 20 minutes ago
so 'n guy above me masturbate.

129
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,373
Mom! Can you bring me another soap?

130
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,899
"Why are we the ambition
has been lost "

131
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,258
Andrea Marr. Would a college girl
so what to write?

132
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,536
Poverty, anarchy and self-doubt
Generation Y.

133
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,531
What I know about poverty?
I'm from West Hills.

134
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,136
So 'n shit.
- What did you so 'ne bad mood,

135
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,974
Miss University? If I had known
that they take this year each,

136
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,058
I had also enrolled.

137
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,855
Was kidding.

138
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,730
Is that dirty here.
Not to touch that railing.

139
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,334
Dirt you can find anywhere.

140
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,340
I was tired of my sheltered life.
I had heard

141
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,218
that one under the bridge
at the 12th The narrow ridge road

142
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,860
between homelessness and the Arts
really catches the eye.

143
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,576
I felt myself drawn to.
- Andrea, let's turn.

144
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,256
Oh yes, here I belonged.
- Andrea, what are we doing here?

145
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,500
Look around.

146
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,453
Thanks, I've seen enough.

147
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,689
Hey!

148
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,968
Hi.
- Hi.

149
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,295
Hi.

150
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,174
If 's great days today.
- Andrea, let's get outta here.

151
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,609
Just relax.

152
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,696
This is Derek.
- This is Jonathan.

153
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,778
Hi, I'm Andrea.
- Glad.

154
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,777
This is Darcy.
- Did any of you ne 'butt?

155
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,653
Oh, shit, that are here yet
all homeless bum.

156
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,532
They were only recently
Theme in 'nervous talk show.

157
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,211
That's not a homeless person.
- The front man of "The Color Green" Is.

158
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,135
Kalahari?

159
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,970
What is "Color"?
- Green.

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,455
Is the coolest band
between East and West Side.

161
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,936
I can not believe it, Todd Sparrow hath
asked for 'Ner cigarette.

162
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,133
Who is Todd Sparrow?

163
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,890
At that moment I realized
that God must be a woman.

164
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,411
For a being as he could not
have been created randomly.

165
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,889
Darcy.

166
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,535
I felt like I had
my whole life

167
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,054
spent in the basement
and the first time come to light.

168
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,700
Andrea, come on now!

169
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,174
Let's go.
- Everything all right?

170
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,253
It does not matter, come on.

171
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,651
I can not think of anything else.
- I'd forgotten him in your place.

172
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,657
You're right. Has already been forgotten.

173
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,736
I can not.

174
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,170
Andrea, I'm your friend.
- Says one: "I'm your friend"

175
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,653
usually followed by something unpleasant.

176
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,658
Sure you're my friend.
- Ok, listen:

177
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,659
You're too nice, too smart, too good
for 'n guy like Todd Sparrow.

178
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,979
But he looks so wonderful?
- Who are you talking about, man?

179
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,456
Todd Sparrow.
- The guy has my life turned upside down.

180
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,816
Blackman, we talk about your work
after the hour.

181
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,011
Mr. Jones, I can at the Brown.
- Congratulations.

182
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,136
On the other hand, your 16-page work
about this Todd Sparrow

183
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,539
has been a disaster, Andrea.
What were you thinking?

184
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,688
Kucki galley boy, galley boy,
our queens-urchin.

185
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,539
Oh, all afraid of the fairies-Beng ...

186
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,697
Never touch me again, you stupid cow.

187
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,738
You look really cool.
- Yes, I know.

188
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,331
Lts see from all
as if you were in 'Ner band.

189
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,379
Rebecca Farnhurst, it was pretty cool,
but never joined a group.

190
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,288
Thus it was for most
somehow invisible. She was the girl

191
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,980
that was always half cut off,
if 's photo was taken.

192
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,849
Even when we were kids.

193
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,296
We are in 'Ner band.
- Yes. Just like everyone else here.

194
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,616
But let's be real. Right, Cybil?
- Sure, Greg.

195
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,331
Which style?
- Rock.

196
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,816
Ok, grunge-rock or post-grunge rock?
Old pop punk or neo?

197
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,055
Old pop or grunge? Old Grunge or Pre?
Old grunge pop psychoanalysis or post?

198
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,571
Or 08/15-Rock? Please do not 08/15-Rock.
I'm so sick of this shit.

199
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,578
Just music.
We have not determined.

200
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,453
Ok, I want to know is yes.

201
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,572
What stinks here because that way?
- I no longer wash.

202
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,859
Someone told him,
Kurt Cobain never washed.

203
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,489
That helps you with your music?
- Hey, this is original, man

204
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,180
So naturally.

205
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,298
When can you hear it?
- We 's unpaid gig

206
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,259
on Friday in the "Oh Hell".
- It's all great. I'm coming anyway.

207
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,896
Andrea, what did you want?

208
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,335
I want to Rebecca Farnhurst
to "Oh Hall" go?

209
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,769
What would the implications for
on my social status?

210
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,979
And above all, what the "Oh Hell" is?
- If a club in the city.

211
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,371
Nothing exciting.
You need not to come.

212
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,498
Supposed to be kidding? Sure I go out.

213
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,335
Friday?

214
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,376
You wanted to come to the game.

215
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,816
Rebecca said, the game would be stupid
and she would be fully in the cultural trip.

216
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,170
She reads books without pictures
and going to concerts.

217
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,169
Ever had the team sports
anyway just a primitive ritual,

218
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,251
where the men have their
act out repressed homosexuality.

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,891
And you should of emancipatory
Reasons not to support.

220
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,371
Then she added:
- Do you think we miss' a party?

221
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,258
How about the one Schnuckelchen?

222
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,293
Todd Sparrow.
- Todd Sparrow.

223
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,695
Crazy guy.

224
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,455
Class, right?

225
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,810
Is better than that
what would you choose your parents.

226
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,898
Again, a saved soul.
- Yes.

227
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,090
For the first time in my life
I felt like an individual.

228
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,817
Oh man, I'm excited.
This is the total shutdown.

229
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,538
Is real hot here.
- Incredibly, yes.

230
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,977
So what I've really never seen before.

231
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,768
That was something I had never experienced before.
The people came out and raced.

232
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,733
And some even fell down.

233
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,615
Wow, is the sweet.

234
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,971
And I'd almost
gone to the stupid game.

235
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,531
Hey, is not 'cool ne Mucke?
- Yes, that is really 'cool ne Mucke.

236
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,774
We "Badhead" are.

237
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,733
Yes!
- We love you!

238
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,573
Hey, that was the upper hammer!

239
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,653
War sucks, but we are getting better.

240
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,738
And now for you "The Color Green"!

241
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,973
Yes, Andrea, he is here.

242
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,449
And then God created man.
And in that moment I had

243
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,253
only the desire to thank her.
For the snake, the apple.

244
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,373
And that they would allow,
that each order went down the drain.

245
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,459
Because if they had not approved it,
would not hurt my body now

246
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,333
because of the soul,
which revealed itself to me here.

247
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,653
And my head would not go crazy
because of a boy named Todd Sparrow.

248
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,733
I'm your friend.

249
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,896
Oh man, you caught it.
- Can you pinch me again?

250
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,816
The same. How do you like his music?
- Absolutely spiritually.

251
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,371
You have not noticed
there is life after MTV.

252
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,657
I think I feel sick.
- As in length.

253
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,740
God, help me!

254
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,455
Hi.

255
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,728
Do you know where the toilets are?

256
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,499
Class. What a stupid I would have
can not come up.

257
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,617
Me ... that would be bad.
- What's your name?

258
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,937
Do not panic. Do not panic.

259
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,537
Andrea. I'm Andrea.
- All right, Andrea.

260
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,658
Now you do not in my pants.

261
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm Todd.
- Hi.

262
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,098
That is Carla. This is Luke and ...

263
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,211
Well, that's Luke.
- Hi.

264
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,298
Hi, I'm Andrea.
- Hi, Andrea.

265
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,217
Do you want us to come to a party?
- I ought to make unapproachable.

266
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,969
The mystery. He would
Always ask what became of the girl

267
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,135
wanted to go to the bathroom.

268
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,577
Yes it is.
- Cool. Hey, did you 'ne cart?

269
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,173
One of my teachers once said,
we were a lost generation.

270
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,895
And only 10 years in the youth would
back to reason.

271
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,899
What should be different in 10 years?
- She is my girlfriend.

272
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,100
Hey, Carla.
- Hi.

273
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,453
Where is Todd?
- He is on the toilet.

274
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,936
Excuse me, someone like Todd
is not simply to the loo.

275
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,576
Lhr is probably very close to you.
- Yes, even fairly close.

276
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,933
There he is.
- Hey, Andrea.

277
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,609
I'm looking for you everywhere. Your Old
be upset if we do not go back.

278
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,737
Shut up.
- There is Todd, he's coming.

279
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,460
Look shortly forth.

280
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,655
Thank you.

281
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,733
Todd! The party is left full.
- Carla, let's get out here.

282
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,857
I'm tired.
It was nice to meet you.

283
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,496
Yes. I was pleased too.
Maybe we're leaving times ...

284
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,891
to 'n coffee. Or see us' n at film.
- Want to say something to his back?

285
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,379
That 's quite a nice pike.
- Yes, that was pretty bad.

286
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,537
No, the pike. Todd.
- Well, see you tomorrow.

287
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,900
Got it.

288
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,810
Is late. Was not my fault.
Excused.

289
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,135
We worry
to our little treasure.

290
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,939
Is sweet. I love you.
- We just do not want

291
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,376
anything that makes your plans broken.
- What are your plans?

292
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,053
The university.
- Oh, that. What should make the break?

293
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,935
Favourite.

294
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,737
I could not sleep.
It was so embarrassing,

295
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,530
this terrible demonstration.
- For the first time was quite good.

296
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,419
Believe me, your mom and I know
that you would not do it to us,

297
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,896
Have sex before we're dead.
Is not it, sweetheart?

298
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,698
I appreciate your confidence.

299
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,698
Come on, hurry up.
- Hey, stay cool.

300
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,578
I've got a new song written
and it got my parents played.

301
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,089
Did you like them.
They found him really good.

302
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,211
Well, frankly,
I normally never play them before that.

303
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,256
My dad is not on my music.

304
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,619
If I'm honest, I do not think
that you can have a say there, Darcy.

305
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,729
Until then.

306
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,258
Hello, folks.
- Hey, heavy dress.

307
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,332
Now she has now through the animal kingdom.

308
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,816
Is something wrong?
- Great that you're just cut off.

309
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,733
Good morning, students,
here says the director.

310
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,972
This insolence sprayed at the school building
says more about you than about your goal.

311
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,615
As long as the hack does not answer,
you will all the consequences

312
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,810
this disrespectful behavior
have to bear.

313
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,700
Is everything ok?

314
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,689
Yes.
- Eventually, I got a coffee bar

315
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,171
and 's billiard table in my studio.
And a system with 64 tracks.

316
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,851
And 'n Jacuzzi.
Hey, this is left full.

317
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,576
Greg, do not exaggerate now.
- I do not exaggerate.

318
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,499
No, honestly, I know
that we can do it.

319
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,293
We are the greatest.

320
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,980
Right, Cybil?

321
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,218
What 's going on, Cybil?
- Mr. Jones.

322
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,136
I am the person responsible
for this disrespectful behavior.

323
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,492
Hey, yeah!

324
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,656
And you, take good.
You got to groupie.

325
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,016
Rubbish, I will not.
Is ridiculous, right?

326
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,619
I was looking for clues
this groupie-madness explain

327
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,697
me in the near
lead by Todd Sparrow.

328
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,729
Shitty idea.

329
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,377
I was cursed to
Virgin of the only colleges to be.

330
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,220
You dance really cool.

331
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,289
I know. I mean, thank you.

332
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,538
How do you know?
- They would have us almost trampled to death.

333
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,976
Do not you remember?
- Oh, the sweet boy. You were das.

334
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,620
Long day.

335
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,971
A long life, I'd say.
- I'm Kevin.

336
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,372
Andrea.
- I know.

337
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,896
Everyone already holds for the successor
by Kurt Cobain. Maybe they are here.

338
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,329
The record companies no longer know
that they should seek.

339
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,059
Anyone who 's what little
can on the guitar, is taken.

340
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,455
Even from 'NEM backwater like here.
It really is ok.

341
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,091
Unfortunately they can not distinguish
between good and bad.

342
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,377
Can not they?
- No. I can. You can do it.

343
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,658
Yes, anyone who enjoys listening to music, it can be.
- What he said

344
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,573
has never interested me.
I liked his voice.

345
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,413
And the way he said it.
I only wish that he continues to talk.

346
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,016
Record bosses hear any music?
- Nonsense, only listening to

347
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,295
if you sound like someone else.
Not if you 'have s own sound.

348
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,299
I listened to him no more. Any words
he was like a ricochet,

349
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,255
the giant swept through his apartment
and shot me directly in the groin.

350
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,619
At that moment I knew
that he would be the first.

351
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,140
What do you think?

352
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,688
I would never have dreamed,
I once in bed

353
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,738
of such a wonderful country lover.

354
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,420
Are you okay?

355
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,815
Ok?

356
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,455
Ok.

357
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,218
Still ok?
- And then it happened.

358
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,698
Who is it?
- It's me, Kevin.

359
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,737
The sweet boy.
- No, on the record.

360
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,336
Todd Sparrow, from the Color Green-time.
- Ok, go on.

361
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,215
Ok.

362
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,651
I heard his voice and knew
He was with me.

363
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,935
In the fall I'm going to
'Ne school of journalism in the Northwest.

364
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,330
This confuses our plans.
But I would like to see you again.

365
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,772
You love me too?
- I made this terrible mistake.

366
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,776
Yes, of course.
- This makes me incredibly happy.

367
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,736
Night, Kevin.

368
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,374
I'll call you immediately,
when I come home.

369
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,738
Hello, I'm not a virgin.

370
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,653
Good night.
- Night, honey.

371
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,692
Oh God.

372
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,139
Thank you, I love you.
- We love you too, little mouse.

373
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,458
Dream a Little Dream.
- Good night.

374
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,374
Good night.

375
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,617
I wondered if she did not
would love it if they knew

376
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,817
what I did today.
I was now a woman.

377
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,410
But I felt guilty. Not
because I had lost my innocence,

378
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,216
but because I had betrayed my heart.
And this heart belonged Todd Sparrow.

379
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,179
You had sex. Shit, did you have sex.
Look at you only.

380
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,131
Come on, tell me, you bitch old.
How was it?

381
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,610
Pretty disappointing.
I think it was' s fault.

382
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,289
Oh, nonsense. Do you still have it all?
The first time you have to forget quickly.

383
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,299
For if now is a really,
then you are not sitting in bed crying:

384
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,059
"I'm not a virgin."
Think of it as a warm-up exercise.

385
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,489
As a warm-up exercise? And for what, please?
- Hi, Andrea.

386
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,453
Hi, Jonathan. Hi, Derek.

387
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,460
You know gays?

388
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,215
Cool.

389
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,339
Rebecca looked at me as if I did
the answer to many questions.

390
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,169
I knew that look,
because I just looked at Cybil.

391
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,219
The two are good friends of mine.
- This is great and you know it

392
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,368
I can not believe that Beac ..
- Hey, you've seen Todd random?

393
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,249
No, I did not.
- Hey, I've seen his girlfriend.

394
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,900
What's her name again?
- Carla. Shit, that is something of cold.

395
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,376
Yes arctic. She is big on space.
- Thank you, guys.

396
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,299
Then take care.
- Bec, I have to go. Until then.

397
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,371
Got it. Keep your chin up, Andrea.

398
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,249
Hi, C.

399
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,775
Carla.

400
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,736
He is in the "Strictly Locals".
- Who? I mean, whom You did, ..

401
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,695
Todd.

402
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,293
He is in 'NEM record store.

403
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,937
And? How are you doing?
- It is not long dominated it.

404
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,853
He will certainly be back.

405
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,096
It interests me, frankly,
not very.

406
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,609
Come here.

407
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,897
We'll see you, Andrea.
- Ok, I'm looking.

408
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,216
Perhaps we can then
at times longer.

409
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,893
She was so cool, so clarified.
This made her so attractive, so unapproachable.

410
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,935
No wonder,
that Todd spent so much time with her.

411
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,493
It was like 'ne revelation for me.
So I would be from now on.

412
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,939
Cool and clarified.

413
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,939
Say something. Say something.

414
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,700
Say something.

415
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,897
The "Where-is-the-toilet"-Andrea.
All vertical?

416
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,698
He always found the right words.

417
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,977
All right, so far. And what are you doing here?

418
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,098
I see through the windows.

419
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,688
Real hyper. You know those guys?
- I wish I would know it.

420
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,698
I wish I'd know them all,
Todd knows that. I wish

421
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,210
I would be so cool and could say "yes".
But that would somehow not me.

422
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,376
Yes, sure.
- Hard to grasp, Good Pig.

423
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,855
The Buzz is Mitchell's label.
He wanted to take us under contract.

424
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,773
But I ... I do not know.

425
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,538
What do you think?
- What do you not know?

426
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,335
He is so 's spoiled toffs
from 'Ner-rich family. No idea

427
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,691
how important it is music.
- Absolute nonsense!

428
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,331
Oh yeah? Why is that?
- Andrea betting everything on one card.

429
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,532
Well.

430
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,772
If Buzz uses the assets to
build a record label

431
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,856
he only wants to
his overbearing father rebel

432
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,135
by the money
invests in a risky industry.

433
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,572
Buzz will do so all the success,
not to hear from his father:

434
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,493
"You'll never make it. You are
A bottle. You and your record label. "

435
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,054
Why would he then signed a contract with
to make someone to whom he has not believed?

436
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,210
He has heard your music
and it is good.

437
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,292
Why hang around here any longer,
take 'ne with him on board!

438
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,259
If you hear your music means so much,
you should do everything

439
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,170
all to hear it. Because it determines
every man touched so like me.

440
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,809
My God.

441
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,973
I'm so sorry. I ...

442
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,937
did not you ...
I am so slipped out.

443
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,620
Is ok, Andrea.

444
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,853
Everything is ok.

445
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,296
Your booth is top class.
- You actually heard Carla.

446
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,057
Do you know you long time?
I mean, are you ...

447
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,536
We are very close.
She lets me stay here and ...

448
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,257
That's nice.
I think she is very nice.

449
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,575
Yes.

450
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,213
This is because my room.

451
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,848
He was not only a musician,
He was an artist.

452
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,211
And his world was
one giant screen.

453
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,975
Sit down.

454
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,574
What I play now is for you.
Is not ready yet, but I thought

455
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,656
you want ...
- You take off?

456
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,493
... Heard it before.

457
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,655
He sang with such passion. He sang
full of pain. He sang about 20 seconds.

458
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,456
That's all. It sucks.
- It's wonderful.

459
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,698
Awakens in me a strange feeling.

460
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,370
In you, I think, 'ne artist.
- Oh God, no. Unfortunately not.

461
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,778
Oh yes, I see.
- And then he said:

462
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,849
When you say your soul, it's so far,
is all that was before, forget it.

463
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,938
Only then you can drop it.

464
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,256
Will you let yourself fall, Andrea?
- Shit, of course!

465
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,375
Yes.

466
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,850
I knew what would happen now.
And I was ready.

467
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,289
Because in my mind it is
already happened a hundred times.

468
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,700
That was incredible.

469
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,900
Yes, that's it.

470
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,293
Thanks, I've never ...

471
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,220
I gotta go.

472
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,373
Where are you going?
- I ...

473
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,220
I promised the boys,
that we practice a bit.

474
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,570
What practice?
- Well, of course, with the band.

475
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,374
Lhr guys are famous.

476
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,732
You have to get going immediately to practice.
- Well, that 's guy wants to listen to us.

477
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,216
We just have to play sensational,
Do you understand?

478
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,253
Oh no! I was lousy, right?

479
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,336
Andrea, you were fabulous.
Yes, more than fabulous.

480
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,856
Listen, you can stay here as long
as you want.

481
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,853
Just please take nothing with.

482
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,220
Is ok, Andrea.

483
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,213
Everything is ok.

484
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,376
I had to talk to someone.
With someone who listens to me.

485
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,134
With someone who understands
what was happening to me.

486
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,176
The school psychologist
had only recently been there.

487
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,969
Their predecessor was due to some
Suicide cases have been fired.

488
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,490
I told her that I am totally
feel fucked. I told her,

489
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,378
I was confused,
because I'd had sex with Kevin.

490
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,453
And now I had been fucked properly.
There's a difference, okay?

491
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,016
If you were fucked
do you suddenly realize that you're a wife.

492
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,019
There are men and women.
But fuck men only. Yes, fuck!

493
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,255
Fuck!

494
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,456
Did I say something wrong? I'm sorry.
Sorry.

495
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,418
One moment, please, Parker.

496
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,980
You have been fucked.

497
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,455
I do not believe this.
Who did it?

498
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,378
The cute guy from the club?
Oh, nonsense.

499
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,577
So you would not fuck Cute.

500
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,257
Oh no! No, I do not believe it.
Tell me now, please do not

501
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,696
that you have fucked Todd.
Holy shit!

502
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,776
Hi, guys, how are you?
- Why are you crying for?

503
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,255
No idea.

504
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,571
Did you get what you wished for.
Andrea?

505
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,737
Can not believe that you Todd Sparrow
has pushed over the sheets.

506
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,176
This is really cool.
- Todd Sparrow has crossed you?

507
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,536
This is nothing but you, Greg.
- Shut up.

508
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,411
He has not only me crazy.
- This is incredible!

509
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,776
Where are you going?
- No idea.

510
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,936
And finally shower, you stink!

511
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,810
Cybil!
- Yes?

512
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,535
Cybil, please. Stop there.
- You're old enough.

513
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,697
Does not matter what I think.
- Cybil, please!

514
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,057
If you want it,
wilt thou not chase him.

515
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,533
I'll call you.
- Ok.

516
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,295
Darcy.

517
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,538
What about you?
- I got it done.

518
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,371
That's great but. Who was it?
- Sun 'n type. Nobody, you know.

519
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,178
Hey! Come on, tell me how it was.

520
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,010
Actually, I did not wanted
but eventually he was then but,

521
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,371
you know where.
When I asked him to stop,

522
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,335
He has said ...

523
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,654
What?

524
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,738
He said: "If we stop now,

525
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,891
he gets this pain again
in his balls. "

526
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,729
Oh no!

527
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,373
On the other hand, you're a wife.

528
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,856
Poor Darcy. I think
I got a better choice is made.

529
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,458
Is ok, Darcy. Everything is ok.

530
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,816
Listen, I gotta go now.
- May I come with you, Andrea?

531
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,299
You know, I need to "Strictly Locals".
Since you belong to no.

532
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,175
We'll see you in school tomorrow, ok?

533
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,971
I was a bitch. I had her
The really done? My girlfriend?

534
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,059
I wanted to go back, apologize,
immediately wanted to Todd.

535
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,490
Ok, if it really only
a one-night stand was

536
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,890
We could not remain friends.

537
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,170
And we might as friends
not even have sex again?

538
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,499
And what about Carla?
He also had sex with her?

539
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,331
He had sex with any girl in town?
If we had sex again,

540
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,776
that would mean,
I'm his girlfriend? His girlfriend.

541
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,019
Was that even possible?
I was old enough, I was cool enough?

542
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,657
Was I?

543
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,373
That was exactly what I needed right now:
Taking a sip of coffee,

544
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,931
a bit of time for me.
Nothing that reminds me of Todd Sparrow.

545
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,175
Hi.

546
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,129
Hi.

547
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,656
And how's it going, how's it going?
- You are from West Hills, right?

548
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,249
Yes.
- So you have clay and what in the bulb.

549
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,656
I've got nothing in the bulb.
- Oh, even 'a whole lot.

550
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,578
You are also very pretty.
- Thank you.

551
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,011
He has such a girl like you
not at all deserve.

552
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,371
Why do you say that?
- I'm his sister.

553
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,697
Suddenly it all made sense.
Probably their parents

554
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,850
Years ago in an accident
were killed.

555
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,898
And since then, Carla had
protect her little brother.

556
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,495
This explained her sadness.
I wanted to put her hair in order.

557
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,657
But she was so beautiful.
- Surprised?

558
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,455
Yes.

559
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,860
Relieved?
- Yes.

560
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,655
He is in Seattle. Want the address?

561
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,896
I thought
best deputy I am shy.

562
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,731
Nothing I would rather have.
- Remember, I warned you.

563
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,618
I wanted that Todd Sparrow learns
what everyone else thought.

564
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,533
I was too good for him.
Me that he did not deserve.

565
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,414
I'm not a woman for one night.
I would choose my words so

566
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,770
that she hit him to the core.

567
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,460
Todd loved.

568
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,460
Swollen too.

569
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,293
Dear Mr. Sparrow.

570
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,453
I still have it all? We had sex!

571
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,578
Thank you very much

572
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,658
for sex

573
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,091
with me.

574
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,937
Todd.

575
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,250
Todd.

576
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,132
Todd.

577
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,809
Shit.

578
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,371
Dear Todd,

579
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,415
a picture is worth a thousand words.

580
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,138
Dear Todd,

581
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,980
I miss you.

582
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,940
With love, Andrea.

583
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,373
I followed my heart.
So I would not lose face.

584
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,136
We are "The Apocalypse".
- What do you mean "Apocalypse"?

585
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,013
Is better than "The Badhead".

586
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,616
Wow, that sound so full of different.
- Yes, I find it. Yes!

587
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,697
Sorry about that. Hey, how are you?

588
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,373
Excuse me, may I?

589
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,259
Hey does it the name of the band?
- The name "The Apocalypse".

590
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,338
What?
- The name "The Apocalypse".

591
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,975
The name "The Apocalypse".
- Ok, Buzz.

592
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,618
Lts of which were so sharp,
I just can not put it into words.

593
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,300
About the Hammer!

594
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,100
Hey, hey, hey.

595
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,496
Cybil.
- Cybil, man!

596
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,331
I'm Buzz. My assistant, Jill.
- Gillian.

597
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,057
God, you klangt great out there.
True Power!

598
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,976
How about 'NEM cup of coffee?
- Pulls off, I'm tired.

599
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,696
I know it comes as a surprise.
I heard Pig Gut Records.

600
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,177
Never heard of it.
- You have heard of it.

601
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:39,972
Cybil.

602
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,616
Cybil is Todd Sparrow label.
- Regardless of shit.

603
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,856
He offers perhaps
a contract to.

604
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,819
Why do I need a record deal?
- That's what you wanted.

605
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,292
Hey, Andrea.
- Oh God.

606
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,572
Hi, Kevin.

607
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,577
Hi.
- Hi. Why have you never called back?

608
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,053
Do not know. When did you call?
- Oh man, every day.

609
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,211
Every day. Sounds pretty desperate.

610
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,333
Pity no one told me.

611
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,697
Typically parents, I know only too well.

612
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,895
Yes.

613
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,936
Please take your time, I'll wait here.
- And, what's new?

614
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,408
Actually, nothing at all.
I slept with Todd Sparrow.

615
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,578
Oh, really nothing at all.

616
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,851
Is something wrong?
- No, everything is fine.

617
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,655
I ...

618
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,857
Is also not worth mentioning.
- What?

619
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,339
It's just a rumor that you
'd slept with Todd Sparrow.

620
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,293
Really? I mean, really?

621
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,290
This is not true, right?
- Todd and I have met.

622
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,059
If one meets Todd,

623
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,252
He drags her into bed.
- Kevin, how can you say such a thing?

624
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,339
You hardly know him. Between Todd
and to me it was something special.

625
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,293
I must go now.

626
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,290
Between you and me
There was something special!

627
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,098
That was incredible.
- That was it.

628
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,339
Hey, I said that he likes you.
Not that he was going to be your friend.

629
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,851
Guys like Todd Sparrow are not suitable
for 'ne relationship. Do you?

630
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,255
No, I do not know.

631
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,769
Rubbish, I knew it.
What I did not know was,

632
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,614
why he had become a part of me.
What was he, that I wanted?

633
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,653
What he had, I needed?
Why I felt incomplete otherwise?

634
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,619
Is this what Todd Sparrow?
- Who the hell is Todd Sparrow?

635
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,577
Oops, Andrea.
- Do you know where Cybil is?

636
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,857
Sorry, no idea.
- You will have to hang in the sample.

637
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,535
And I'm mad at her murder, ok?
If one's got a band,

638
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,254
one should allow the other
not depend on 'Ner sample.

639
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,055
Greg, Cybil is actually the band.
And you know it.

640
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,377
That's not true.
And anyway, shut up.

641
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,092
However, it is. You hold the door.
- Take care, guys.

642
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,095
What?

643
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,260
Cybil is there?
- No.

644
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,735
Cursed.

645
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,056
They stayed away all night.
The I'll kick your ass.

646
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,138
She's been with me.
- Yeah, right.

647
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,615
I'm off now.

648
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,849
I would never be an artist.
My life was too harmonious.

649
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,096
I felt there was something in the air.
It was like a plague.

650
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,456
A disease that affects only teenagers,
because we want to be well-infested.

651
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,572
Stop it with immediately.

652
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,408
I absolutely had to find someone who
confirmed to me,

653
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,891
I still was me.
And that everything will be fine again.

654
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,055
Hey.

655
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,455
Hey.

656
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:16,209
Oh, hi, Marjorie. And, what's new?
- We have tickets for Hanson.

657
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,091
Maybe I'll come to the concert.
- Is sold. For months.

658
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,652
In addition,
why would you want to come with us?

659
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,456
Yes, I also think
because you belong to something, do you?

660
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,615
Yes.

661
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,975
Yes.

662
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,176
Ok, I'll see you sometime.
See ya.

663
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,177
I was scared.
I felt so alone.

664
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,016
Everything was different.
I closed my eyes and felt

665
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,611
that my eyes the tears
could not hold back.

666
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,291
I began to cry, to me, to Cybil
by Darcy at all.

667
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,339
Most of all I cried for Todd Sparrow.
For a moment it felt like,

668
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,056
as he would put his arms around me.
And that was nice.

669
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,979
May I come in, dear?
- Yes, Daddy, come clean.

670
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,818
Why are you crying?
- I do not cry.

671
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,935
Ok.

672
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,292
Do you know

673
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:58,849
your mom and I are old.
We can not understand many things.

674
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,058
But we want you to know one thing:

675
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,018
We are so incredibly proud of you.

676
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,099
And grateful that you exist.

677
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,093
The day is come tomorrow.

678
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,689
Daddy?

679
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,614
Yes, dear?

680
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,300
Lhr understands everything.

681
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,533
Good night, darling.

682
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,649
"Thank you for your letter, Andrea.
Us feel good.

683
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,295
We have added much new material.
The CD should be out soon.

684
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,139
Take care of yourself.
And thank you for your support. Todd. "

685
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,419
The manager would also be
may have written.

686
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,730
Shit, I suddenly knew,
I had to do.

687
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,929
Kevin.

688
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,420
I'm so sorry.

689
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,010
Oh, no big deal.

690
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,496
I get us' n water.
- He was so understanding.

691
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,450
'Ne good idea.

692
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,300
And I hated it.

693
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,532
Everything ok?

694
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,253
Who would have thought that good looks,
Intelligence, charm and honesty

695
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,373
could be merged in a boy
me and not the so-turns?

696
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,379
But maybe that was my destiny.
Maybe it was my fate,

697
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,968
and I would learn to love him.
And then every night we would ...

698
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,375
Kevin.

699
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,578
I need to get out.
- I'm coming with you.

700
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,255
Toll.

701
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,057
Exactly what I meant.
You really think our way

702
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,859
for a rising star.
This ladies' man.

703
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,056
This is likely bootlicker here
did not live.

704
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,219
Not to mention his appearances throughout.
This record bosses do not know

705
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,252
what is good and what is bad.
- He was like a verbal percussion drill.

706
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,816
With a constant hum
He drilled into your brain,

707
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,976
until you loved him best out of your head
would blow up.

708
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,655
Kevin.

709
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,813
Do you play music?

710
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,129
No.

711
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,255
Wait a minute.

712
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,889
Cybil!

713
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,095
Andrea!

714
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,969
Cybil?

715
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,576
Hi, Andrea.

716
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,260
Where have you been?

717
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,173
To Mitchell.
- For Mitchell?

718
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,690
He said if I 's place
needed to sleep, I could stay.

719
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,017
I needed him, so I stayed.
That's it.

720
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,013
Everything is ok?

721
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,369
Andrea.

722
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,499
Could you take my school closet
clear up for me? I'll do ne fly.

723
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,259
We have only two months before us.
- Why should I torture myself?

724
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,655
I'm not so 'n Ass like you
- Hey, I'm not an ace, yes?

725
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,136
The knowledge on the Brown University
apparently not.

726
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,493
And what becomes of your degree?

727
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,611
I do not think

728
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,698
I need to at all.

729
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,138
You have 'n record deal, am I right?

730
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,012
My God!

731
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,096
I am so incredibly proud of you.
- My lyrics, my.

732
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,733
Those were always yours.

733
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,815
Andrea!

734
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,696
Do you remember me?
- We need to celebrate somewhere.

735
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,408
I will strike for the first appearance
the Music Hall before.

736
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,333
Sure to come good.
- Hey.

737
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,213
Hey.
- Are you okay?

738
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,697
Fairly well.
- Where were you, Cybil?

739
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,171
Oh man Kurt Cobain has never
'Ne thrown sample.

740
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,656
The still's not at all know?
- What we do not know?

741
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,618
Buzz Mitchell has talked to me.
And now we make 'a record.

742
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,256
Hey, guys, this is Todd Sparrow label.
Not for long. And you are famous.

743
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,338
I just can not believe it.

744
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,809
I knew it.

745
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,010
I knew it. I've told you.

746
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:56,373
Shit, I'm soon 'ne system
with 24 tracks. No. By 48

747
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,499
No, with innumerable tracks.
- I can not believe it's still.

748
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,056
I do not believe this.
- Is perhaps better that way.

749
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,769
He just wants me.
- What?

750
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,460
He just wants me.

751
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,928
And then you told him that we
'Are a band and always have. Or?

752
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,573
That we 'ne unit.

753
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,017
We're a unit. We're a band.
Got it?

754
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,049
Buzz says,
you are not mature enough as a musician.

755
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,338
I'm supposed to occur with other types.

756
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,931
I play probably
not even own bass.

757
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,609
Shit.

758
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,777
Richard. I could not do anything for you.

759
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,737
I've always said you're the band,
Cybil.

760
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,573
I wish you all the best.

761
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,540
You'll make it

762
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,460
Your lyrics, what?

763
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,978
Listen to me. It's never been gone,
as I wanted. Now I have a chance.

764
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,930
And I do not think
I will excuse myself.

765
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,533
Sure. Cybil must never apologize.
That makes everything so much easier.

766
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,220
Not Cybil?

767
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,419
Make business interests
and art together,

768
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:48,250
is a conflict almost inevitable.
- Wimp, just simply shut up.

769
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,455
I was just
to believe in this whole rock star crap.

770
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,936
What it delivers on stage
is not shit. It's good.

771
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,420
Yes?
- Yes. Yes, sure.

772
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,657
And what shall I say more?
So, how did you react just as,

773
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,011
that was incredible.
I'd gone crazy full.

774
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,295
Yes.

775
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,419
Well, if one so much disappointment
and humiliation as has happened to me,

776
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,896
then you learn
to take it with a certain dignity.

777
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,689
Really?

778
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,533
So I think you're great.

779
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,818
Hey, you bum. Do you know what I know?
- No idea.

780
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,090
"Color Green" have tonight
her first big appearance.

781
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,169
Guess who breaks forth.

782
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:40,011
Only, not to return by Todd Sparrow
considered to be? Forget it.

783
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,732
Am in the process.
- Me too.

784
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,899
I like you, man, I know I red
'A whole lot when the day is long.

785
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,251
There is not much time for most,
what to bring myself.

786
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,611
But are you anyway
more of the quiet variety.

787
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,330
How far is it for?
- I do not think

788
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,859
that it can still be very far.

789
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,608
Folks, I swear,
that it must be here somewhere.

790
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,811
Crap, crap. We will miss him.
We will not see him.

791
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,494
We will miss him.
- Sweet, do not get excited. Here.

792
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,453
Take what the calm down.

793
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,571
When we go at last?
- Oh dear.

794
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,137
It obviously has something against someone,
I see Todd.

795
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,820
Screwed up shit.

796
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,173
Shit.
- It goes forward.

797
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,860
It goes forward.

798
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,933
Ok, all right, come in..

799
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:34,935
ID cards.

800
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,012
Why?

801
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,376
On the poster
was no age restriction.

802
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,298
One can not just believe everything
what one reads.

803
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,778
Hey, we went an extra 200 miles.
- Then you have 's broad back.

804
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,939
Why do not you go in and say
Todd Sparrow, that Andrea Marr's there?

805
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,016
And I did not have a pen here.

806
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,973
Yes, and then tell Todd also
that Suzy's waiting outside.

807
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,531
The small, with the tattoo.
- Where is the tattoo?

808
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,418
It's wherever you want.
- Come on.

809
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,609
And you, a good trip.

810
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,300
And on it goes.

811
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,496
And what now?
- I guess we will go home.

812
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:22,291
Do you? Is not that bad here.
- I think that's bad is not.

813
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:27,335
Andrea, please. We can finally go?
- I belong to Todd.

814
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,170
I must see him, absolutely.
It takes a long time now, certainly not.

815
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,055
And as he walked through the light.
He would see and recognize me,

816
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,252
what he had made a mistake.
He would ask me for forgiveness.

817
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,529
Todd.

818
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,615
Todd.

819
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,295
Todd.

820
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:06,059
Shit, that was the absolute
worst experience of my life.

821
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,211
I agree with that, man

822
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,096
Suddenly I realized
that maybe, just maybe,

823
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,216
I, Andrea Marr, was about
become a groupie.

824
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,773
And my existence would no longer
differ from those

825
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,256
love him too.
And although we love all the same,

826
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,096
I felt different.
I always felt like something special.

827
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:35,130
Because maybe, just maybe,
his smile was meant for me.

828
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,218
That night I had
a crazy dream.

829
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,298
They were all there. Darcy, Rebecca,

830
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,695
Cybil.

831
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,579
Todd was also there. They were all there.
All except me.

832
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,373
I was somewhere else. I was ...

833
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,333
I had taken drugs? No idea
what is the meaning of this dream.

834
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,371
And so the author tries
the journey of the reader

835
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,139
with the journey of John Marcher,
the title character, equate.

836
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,898
It is a tedious, dreary,

837
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,260
dark long journey.

838
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,698
Damn, like John Marcher self

839
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,772
Does anyone know of a similar figure
like John Marcher?

840
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,131
No!
- Yes, there are some who are cursed.

841
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:51,731
Or the curse even unintentionally
have even drawn up.

842
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,816
Mr. Jones.

843
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,979
You have not yet all the more.
- I wanted to get you out.

844
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,138
Ok, I'm here.
- I've got a gig "Color Green".

845
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,780
In "La Luna".
- Is' ne murder thing, huh?

846
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,256
Please? That's the thing.
Is my first gig, hey.

847
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,579
What is with Richard and Greg?
- I can not help them.

848
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:18,809
But you tell me, Andrea. I
not play if you do not come.

849
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,058
Do you think I'll take you from that?

850
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,171
It's really important.
- I'll think about it myself.

851
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,218
Todd is also there.
- Got it changed my mind.

852
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,255
Yes!

853
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,135
I love you.

854
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,530
I think that's ...
- I'm coming.

855
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,413
Andrea.
- Cybil, you strangle me.

856
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,289
Hi, Mr. Jones.

857
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,697
Hey.
- Hey.

858
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,968
When I Cybils deep satisfaction
saw up there,

859
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,977
I felt just such a peace
in me. I felt distant.

860
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,898
Hey. Missed you.
- Keep your cool.

861
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,095
Hey.

862
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,140
And clarified.

863
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,336
Now me and kiss me already spinning,
you sweet idiot.

864
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:02,096
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight for you:
"The Color Green."

865
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:08,006
From then on it was uphill.
For in the music scene, it was quiet.

866
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:13,360
And Todd had nothing else to do but
to kidnap me to romantic places.

867
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:19,885
He spoiled me from head to toe.

868
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,885
I felt like a princess.

869
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:38,085
Shit, Todd, now come on, man

870
01:14:40,487 --> 01:14:42,318
And then it happened.

871
01:14:42,447 --> 01:14:46,565
On the I-know-what-how-many-years
Open Air on the farm Bresnick.

872
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:50,965
It was like a mini-Woodstock.
And we all buried our differences.

873
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:55,877
And for one afternoon we were able to
to be like that time in the 60s.

874
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:08,517
They were all there. Even the MTV kids.
Cybil had become a little star.

875
01:15:11,247 --> 01:15:14,603
But of all the stars,
the firmament were the stage,

876
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:18,245
only shone a particularly bright

877
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,836
Finally, I felt I was somebody.

878
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:12,516
I was met with respect,
I had the very deserves.

879
01:16:19,927 --> 01:16:20,882
Todd.

880
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:25,036
Todd, come on. They want to 'ne added.
- I come, come. I come from.

881
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:28,079
I just bought yesterday. Shit.

882
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,004
Well, come on.
- Yes, yes.

883
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,162
Come on!

884
01:16:34,247 --> 01:16:36,203
When we were together,
We were not alone.

885
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:39,718
We were on the whole world,
the whole cosmos.

886
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,399
Hi, Cybil.

887
01:16:46,447 --> 01:16:50,884
I congratulate you. You did it.
Now you belong to the circle of groupies.

888
01:16:52,807 --> 01:16:53,762
Cybil.

889
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:59,841
That you're been on the stage.
- Are you Todd Sparrow's girlfriend?

890
01:17:00,527 --> 01:17:02,802
I guess so.
- We envy you.

891
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:06,078
What did Cybil already?
I was not just a groupie

892
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:09,563
I was a celebrity.
I was Todd Sparrow's girlfriend.

893
01:17:10,207 --> 01:17:11,435
It was me.

894
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:17,565
What do you mean you go away?

895
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,527
We go on tour.

896
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:26,322
Well.

897
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:32,365
I could go with you yet.

898
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:36,358
You could take me.
Then I would be with you.

899
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:42,964
We'll see you when I get back.
Ok?

900
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:50,087
And when are you coming?

901
01:17:51,727 --> 01:17:54,287
No idea.

902
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:05,487
Is ok, Andrea.

903
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,480
Everything is ok.

904
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,727
And then he was gone.

905
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:26,476
Yes!

906
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:30,397
I would like to make some nice photos.
- Do not play around it.

907
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:32,478
How about
with a friendly "Cheese"?

908
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:37,282
Hey. Today is the happiest day of your life.
Smile!

909
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:43,843
Are you okay, honey?
- Yes, do not worry.

910
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:56,238
We organize at home
a small barbecue and invite you.

911
01:18:56,527 --> 01:18:59,564
Sure.
- For dessert: Homemade ice.

912
01:19:39,727 --> 01:19:42,844
Have you got any plans, Rebecca?
- No concrete.

913
01:19:42,967 --> 01:19:45,527
Some got an idea?

914
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:49,402
Dad, I'll be right back.

915
01:19:49,527 --> 01:19:52,564
Bec, I'll call you, ok?
- Ok, see you later.

916
01:19:56,527 --> 01:19:57,516
Hey.

917
01:19:58,647 --> 01:19:59,636
Hey.

918
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:03,320
Where are your parents?

919
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:08,718
They could not come.
They are too busy.

920
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
What about Greg?

921
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:18,124
He is ...

922
01:20:20,727 --> 01:20:23,560
Richard, where's Greg?

923
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:26,836
He ...

924
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,760
He was my best friend.

925
01:20:44,727 --> 01:20:47,525
Greg's suicide note was brief:

926
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:49,842
"We're the band."

927
01:20:49,967 --> 01:20:52,356
I had to think long
if I go to a farewell party.

928
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:57,397
But then I thought that each of us
now needs the other. To talk to.

929
01:20:57,527 --> 01:21:02,555
Together we would cope better
what had happened to our friend.

930
01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:12,643
Hey, Schnuckelchen. Sweet.
I wanted to tell you,

931
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:15,801
I'm loving you like crazy.
I am glad we are friends.

932
01:21:15,887 --> 01:21:19,243
Yes, I love you, too.
- Shit, I love you.

933
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:26,003
But this party sucks.
I do 's departure.

934
01:21:26,727 --> 01:21:30,083
I'll call you tomorrow, ok?
- Ok. Got it. Until then.

935
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:37,722
Darcy.

936
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:43,318
Forgave you. Leave me alone.
- No, I do not let you alone.

937
01:21:47,087 --> 01:21:48,042
Darcy.

938
01:21:48,727 --> 01:21:51,082
What are you doing?

939
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:54,438
Want to know not yet.
- Yes it does.

940
01:21:55,447 --> 01:21:58,757
I know that I will not be a good girlfriend
have been. You were always important to me.

941
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,203
I swear it. Do not talk crap.
You need to see a doctor.

942
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:06,085
Promise me that you go to the doctor.

943
01:22:09,047 --> 01:22:10,082
Yes ok.

944
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:16,287
Then it is good.

945
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:22,365
I'm so jealous of you.

946
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:24,916
Why?

947
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:29,805
Because you simply ... You always have everything.

948
01:22:31,527 --> 01:22:33,597
And because you're so ...

949
01:22:33,727 --> 01:22:36,287
so ''re a whore.

950
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:40,042
Stand up.

951
01:22:50,527 --> 01:22:51,846
We are now women.

952
01:22:52,207 --> 01:22:56,519
The funny thing was that I
for the first time felt like a.

953
01:22:58,047 --> 01:23:01,756
Here's the guy with the soft-boiled eggs?
- Shut up. Yes, he is.

954
01:23:01,887 --> 01:23:04,355
The need to show me.
- Whom have we here?

955
01:23:04,887 --> 01:23:09,039
Our princess Tues Have you
viewed your dinner again?

956
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:11,078
Parker, shut up.

957
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:14,358
Andrea? That can not ...
Were you sick?

958
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:16,796
The last time you shall
have spent mostly lying down.

959
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:19,721
Parker, we want to celebrate here.
- I know. I know.

960
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:22,202
I do not think
I still get times as an opportunity.

961
01:23:22,287 --> 01:23:25,085
So I want to make the most of it.

962
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:28,085
But I will also give a chance.

963
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:31,165
Lhr should blow me both one.

964
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:36,999
That was Greg. Queens-urchin.

965
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:39,042
Richard.

966
01:23:45,847 --> 01:23:46,836
Darcy.

967
01:23:47,887 --> 01:23:50,720
Want to dance with me?

968
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:54,476
But happy.

969
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:14,035
Words can be the perfection
not describe this moment.

970
01:24:19,407 --> 01:24:22,240
I congratulate you, Andrea Marr.

971
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,560
Can we talk briefly?

972
01:24:33,927 --> 01:24:36,487
That's my fault.

973
01:24:37,207 --> 01:24:40,244
It's my fault that he is dead.
- Cybil.

974
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:43,596
You can not help it.

975
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:45,718
You had to decide.
You had no choice.

976
01:24:45,967 --> 01:24:46,922
No.

977
01:24:47,927 --> 01:24:50,487
He was weak.

978
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:53,885
I knew it
And I've done it anyway.

979
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,237
He was so ...

980
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:57,402
What?

981
01:24:58,087 --> 01:25:01,045
He was so damn similar.

982
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:02,836
Cybil.

983
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:06,395
You had one goal in mind.

984
01:25:06,527 --> 01:25:08,518
And there've been following.

985
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:11,605
Only through your talent, you've reached it.

986
01:25:11,727 --> 01:25:14,560
How can that be weak?

987
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:27,285
My first album I dedicate to you.

988
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:29,276
Why?

989
01:25:30,687 --> 01:25:33,645
You were always my inspiration.

990
01:25:35,247 --> 01:25:40,275
You're just
I always wanted to be.

991
01:25:40,847 --> 01:25:41,836
Cybil.

992
01:25:42,647 --> 01:25:44,558
What do you mean?

993
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:47,645
What am I? I am nothing.

994
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:54,960
You are my everything.

995
01:26:08,007 --> 01:26:11,079
I knew I was not gay.
Cybil and knew she was there.

996
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:15,235
But I was glad it had happened.
For what would become of us always,

997
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:18,723
Cybil and I would one
always have in common: this kiss.

998
01:26:19,127 --> 01:26:22,085
We'll see.
- Yes. We'll see.

999
01:26:27,367 --> 01:26:31,918
That night, I'm not immediately
home. My world was so far back

1000
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:34,117
that I probably
would not find anyway.

1001
01:26:39,607 --> 01:26:42,963
I had to think about Rebecca's words.
That she loves me.

1002
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,802
And that Darcy is jealous of me.
And to Richard with the chair.

1003
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:49,361
That was awesome.

1004
01:26:49,487 --> 01:26:52,843
And I thought of Cybil.
About how strong they always were.

1005
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:56,923
But it was just like all of us.
And then we kiss.

1006
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:01,245
I thought this night would really
not be able freaky.

1007
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:02,596
Hey, Andrea.

1008
01:27:16,047 --> 01:27:17,036
Hi.

1009
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,361
I need to talk with you.
- I know.

1010
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,441
That night was Todd Sparrow
his soul air.

1011
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:31,247
He spat.
And it struck me right in front of the feet.

1012
01:27:31,687 --> 01:27:34,440
He said how sorry he was,
that he had treated me badly.

1013
01:27:34,567 --> 01:27:37,161
And how hard it was to
deal with the fame of his age.

1014
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:41,037
He said that deep inside him he would
to hate themselves. And his music.

1015
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:43,283
And that he, not without me
can go on tour.

1016
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:47,197
Was there something else? Oh yes. He said,
he 's had a hard life.

1017
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:51,803
And he had me from the first moment
would have liked. Then he stopped talking.

1018
01:27:51,927 --> 01:27:54,043
He looked at me and said:

1019
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:57,763
Tell something about you.
- In the fall I am going to Brown University.

1020
01:27:59,887 --> 01:28:02,720
Brown? The elite-Brown?

1021
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:08,638
The only really take as good.
- Yes, indeed.

1022
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:14,047
Wow, a. ..

1023
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:19,636
is' ??ne really good school. You have to
even more to have, as I thought.

1024
01:28:20,807 --> 01:28:23,640
Yes. I suppose I did.

1025
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:26,122
Yes.

1026
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:28,122
Really cool.

1027
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:33,920
That's never happened to me.

1028
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:37,005
Well, I've read about it.

1029
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:41,205
This should happen again.

1030
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:49,043
Want to 's sandwich or something?
- No, no, thank you.

1031
01:28:49,207 --> 01:28:53,086
Carla is sure what in the refrigerator.
- Is not really necessary.

1032
01:28:56,887 --> 01:28:59,276
I've written a lot again.

1033
01:28:59,407 --> 01:29:01,363
Including 's song
I would like to play for you.

1034
01:29:01,887 --> 01:29:04,720
I, you mean ..
- Todd.

1035
01:29:05,647 --> 01:29:08,957
It's really been 'n bit late.
Ok?

1036
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,844
I still have so many things to do.

1037
01:29:17,647 --> 01:29:20,480
You want to leave me.

1038
01:29:20,927 --> 01:29:23,885
I must just go home now.

1039
01:29:24,327 --> 01:29:26,318
No, I ...

1040
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:29,405
I mean, you're going to leave me.

1041
01:29:29,607 --> 01:29:34,397
You go to this university.
And of course there is no place for me.

1042
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:37,967
Shit, I ...

1043
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:41,045
I do not know if I can handle it.

1044
01:29:42,527 --> 01:29:46,315
Because I need you, Andrea. Are you listening?
I need you.

1045
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:50,204
You have changed me.
Yes, even my music.

1046
01:29:53,607 --> 01:29:57,156
I can not stand being alone anymore.
- And I said:

1047
01:29:57,367 --> 01:29:59,927
Is okay, Todd.

1048
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:03,320
Everything is ok.

1049
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:07,236
Yes.

1050
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,562
All wonderful.

1051
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:13,322
Hey.

1052
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:28,318
Change is something mysterious.
Especially when it takes place.

1053
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:31,477
I was looking forward to
my life to begin.

1054
01:30:41,287 --> 01:30:45,405
I could never tell me what
more fascinating: the groupies themselves

1055
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:48,485
or the people they idolize.

1056
01:30:48,647 --> 01:30:52,606
Granted, I had moved well.
But when I was back on the road,

1057
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:56,515
I knew that it is not so bad,
to be a groupie.

1058
01:30:56,647 --> 01:31:00,526
It just means that anything you
admire in another.

1059
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:05,877
I just never would have thought that someone
could also be something to admire me.

1060
01:31:06,007 --> 01:31:08,680
But what the heck! I was now a woman.

1061
