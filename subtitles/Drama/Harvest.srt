1
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,528
<i>People always say...</i>

2
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,998
<i>there's no such thing
as the perfect crime.</i>

3
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,665
<i>But I don't agree with that.</i>

4
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,639
<i>If you plan things
carefully enough...</i>

5
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,209
<i>if you think through
every last detail...</i>

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,607
<i>if you have nerves of steel...</i>

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,841
<i>if you can remain calm
no matter what happens...</i>

8
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,316
<i>there should be no problem
you can't handle.</i>

9
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,944
<i>It's really all
a matter of character.</i>

10
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,319
<i>Of course,
if I had any character...</i>

11
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,587
<i>I wouldn't have stolen
$2 million from my boss.</i>

12
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,196
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

13
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,129
<i>Ho, ho, fucking ho.</i>

14
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,849
Well? How did it go?

15
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,683
Good. Went good.

16
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,014
How much?

17
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,284
A lot.

18
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,353
Am I gonna have to slap
the shit out of you? How much?

19
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,128
Vic, it's a great big
fucking pile of money.

20
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,800
$2,147,000 and change.

21
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,407
Hmm.

22
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,812
My God,
we're actually doing this.

23
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,882
No, we're not doing it.

24
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,517
It's already done.

25
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,664
Look, don't be so worried.
The hard part's done already.

26
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,573
Everything worked
just like you said it would.

27
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,612
Yeah. I guess.

28
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,271
Just act normal for a few
hours and we're home free.

29
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,212
Okay?
Okay.

30
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,445
Okay.

31
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,491
You wanna take the money
and not me?

32
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,992
You wanna take the money?

33
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,921
<i>No. I don't know.
I was just...</i>

34
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,029
Well, if you wanna
take the money...

35
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,569
I mean, if you think
you can do a better job...

36
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,968
<i>of guarding $2 million...</i>

37
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,336
No, no, no. It should
be you. It should be you.

38
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,841
It's just we didn't
discuss that.

39
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,139
Are we through discussing it?

40
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,147
Or is there more to say
on the subject?

41
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,982
No, we're done.

42
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,383
Cool. Okay, shut the door.

43
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,977
Okay.
Okay. And, Charlie.

44
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,647
Yeah?
Act normal.

45
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,484
Yeah.

46
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,250
Oh, good! Good.
No, no, no.

47
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,225
No, no.
That's none of your business.

48
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,595
That's none of your
fucking business, all right?

49
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,600
I don't give a shit,
you toothless old whore.

50
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,916
Mom. Mom, I gotta go.

51
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,886
Don't you ever
touch her again!

52
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,756
Sidney! Sidney! No! No!

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,050
Don't hurt him.

54
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,255
Jeez, it's Christmas.

55
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,963
I love you.

56
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,629
Don't be an asshole.

57
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,101
Giselle, come on,
hop up there.

58
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,436
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

59
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,474
Hi, Charlie.
Didn't see you come in.

60
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,342
Who gave Rusti the shiner?

61
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,975
Her asshole boyfriend.
Some dipshit guitar player.

62
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,814
I swear to God,
if he comes in here again...

63
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,513
I'm gonna break his
fucking fingers.

64
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,889
Jesus, look at this place.

65
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,356
Just 'cause it's Christmas...

66
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,524
people all of a sudden
can't look at tits and ass?

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,898
Hi, Renata.
Hello, Counselor.

68
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,402
Not drinking tonight?

69
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,628
Just watching the floorshow.

70
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,004
Sidney, get my favorite
crooked lawyer a beer.

71
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,801
Actually, I'll take a rum.

72
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,004
Rum?
Mmm-hmm.

73
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,144
Rum and what?
Got any pineapple juice?

74
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,676
If you got one of those
little plastic umbrellas...

75
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,811
you can put that thing
in there.

76
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,451
What?

77
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,589
You look like the cat that
swallowed the canary, is what.

78
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,590
Like you're about
to belch a feather.

79
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,968
Been working on this
acquisition deal for a while...

80
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,529
and it finally came through,
so...

81
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,108
Is this
a Bill Guerrard thing?

82
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,610
<i>No, this is a... No.</i>

83
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,778
Charlie Arglist.

84
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,142
Man of mystery.

85
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,178
This mean
you're rich, Charlie?

86
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,052
'Cause if you are,
we could run away together.

87
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,157
It's a thought.

88
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,055
Leaving Wichita.

89
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,629
Damn right, it's a thought.

90
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,065
Come the first of the year, there'll
be no more nude dancing in the city.

91
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,897
Which means
I'm fucked.

92
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,699
And don't tell me, "Move
out to the county," either.

93
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,468
Because Bill Guerrard's
got the county all to himself.

94
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,340
And I don't think
he's looking for competition.

95
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,505
Isn't that right,
Charlie?

96
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,413
You should let me
help you out.

97
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,043
If I was real smart, I'd
see this as an opportunity.

98
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,381
I could, you know.
Could what?

99
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,523
Help you.
You, Charlie?

100
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,559
<i>If you had that photo...</i>

101
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,866
Of Councilman Williams
and Cupcake? Mmm-hmm.

102
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,036
Vic's got that photo.

103
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,939
And I know
he won't give it to me...

104
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,703
because I've asked him nice
and he just won't.

105
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,506
Well, he wouldn't
have to know.

106
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,106
Well, that would be
just about...

107
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,345
the nicest Christmas present
you could give me, Charlie.

108
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,785
I'd have to think of something
extra nice to give you in return.

109
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,456
No. Forget it.

110
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,164
I appreciate the thought, but you'd
be getting in way over your head.

111
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,602
Vic Cavanaugh and Bill Guerrard
eat guys like you for lunch.

112
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,434
Sidney.
Yo.

113
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,872
I'll be back later
to close up.

114
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,473
It's against my religion
to give out personal advice...

115
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,248
but you should either sober up
or get real drunk.

116
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,437
That's fucking horrible.
Toss it and give me a beer.

117
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,348
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls. "

118
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,390
Have you seen
Charlie tonight?

119
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,329
No. You just missed him.

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,608
How about Vic?
Seen Vic?

121
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,604
No. Not yet.

122
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,878
Of course,
it is Christmas.

123
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,545
Yeah, right.
Christmas.

124
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:36,196
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls. "

125
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,860
What sort of fucking moron
would write such a thing?

126
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,073
<i>Roy Gelles is in town.</i>

127
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,645
Vic, did you hear me?

128
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,184
<i>Roy Gelles is in town.</i>

129
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,413
So what?
So he's looking for us.

130
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,581
So maybe he knows.
That's what.

131
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,249
Roy Gelles doesn't know shit.

132
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,020
Roy Gelles knows
what Bill Guerrard tells him.

133
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,890
And Bill doesn't know
shit either, so chill out.

134
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,792
Then what is he doing in town
on Christmas Eve?

135
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,764
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.

136
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,664
He's got a daughter in town.
Maybe he's visiting her.

137
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>Like you said,
it's Christmas.</i>

138
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,331
That still doesn't explain
why he's at the Sweet Cage.

139
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,533
Listen, Charlie, don't go
squirrelly on me now, okay?

140
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,337
<i>Just stick to the plan.</i>

141
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,673
Maybe we should leave now.

142
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,872
<i>Well, we're not going to.</i>

143
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,609
In case you haven't noticed, it's
a fucking hockey rink out there.

144
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,208
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

145
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,547
<i>What?
Nothing.</i>

146
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,611
<i>They say the rain is
supposed to stop by midnight.</i>

147
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,948
By 5:00 in the morning,
we're in Kansas City...

148
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,151
where we enjoy a leisurely
breakfast at the airport...

149
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,194
and by 8:00, we're on a plane
to someplace warm...

150
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,026
where it's against
the fucking law to rain, okay?

151
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,190
Click.

152
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,424
Vic? Vic?

153
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,500
Fuck me.

154
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

155
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,876
Fuck.

156
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,875
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

157
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,391
Hi, Mr. Arglist.
I didn't recognize you.

158
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,448
Hi.

159
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,259
Yeah. Boy, I didn't realize
how slippery that was.

160
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,594
Yeah. Didn't you notice all the
cars off the side of the road?

161
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,032
I wasn't paying close
enough attention, I guess.

162
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,967
You going somewhere, Mr. Arglist? No.

163
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,272
Hey, none of my business,
right?

164
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,602
I'd be careful, though.

165
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,202
We're gonna have this freezing
rain on and off all night...

166
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,837
so I'd stay off the road...

167
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,914
and probably take it easy
with that, too.

168
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,952
The next guy
who pulls you over...

169
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,318
might be somebody
who don't know any better.

170
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,651
I definitely owe you one.

171
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,818
All right. It's Tyler.
It's R.P. Tyler.

172
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,657
Remember my name
to Mr. Guerrard.

173
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,957
I will.

174
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,497
What is it?

175
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,128
Just kidding. Just kidding.

176
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,762
Have a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

177
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,634
Dickhead.

178
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,138
I'm not working Christmas
for no fucking money, Dennis.

179
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,443
I'm not.

180
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,451
I could be at home spending
Christmas with my kids.

181
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,647
Your kids with your husband,
Francie. They in Denver.

182
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,656
Fuck you very much
for throwing that in my face.

183
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,124
Look, you can cry all you
want, but you're still going on.

184
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,320
You've been here long enough
to know the goddamn drill.

185
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,761
You wanna work on the hot nights,
you gotta work on the cold.

186
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,196
Fuck it, Dennis.

187
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,291
I'm not paying Bill Guerrard
a $100 stage rental fee...

188
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,135
so some old pervert can look at
my twat on Christmas fucking Eve!

189
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,366
Go dance.

190
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,340
Tell you what.
Since it's Christmas Eve...

191
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,899
stage rental's on the house.

192
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,408
Hi, Charlie.
I didn't see you come in.

193
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,469
Hi.

194
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,537
You mean it?

195
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,005
Uh-huh.

196
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,512
Gee, thanks.

197
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,024
Since when are you a friend
of the working girl?

198
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,685
It's Christmas, Dennis.
It's God's birthday.

199
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,269
Well, hello there, Councilman.

200
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,107
So, Dennis, you're saying
you haven't seen Charlie, huh?

201
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,513
Charlie? No.
Why do you ask?

202
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,145
How about Vic Cavanaugh?
You seen him?

203
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,950
Dude, I don't do henchmen,
man. I do strippers.

204
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,805
Hey, Frankie.
Is Vic around?

205
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,540
He's sitting over there.

206
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,907
Let me get you a drink.
Thanks.

207
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,273
Victor.

208
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,747
You know, us being seen
together, tonight of all nights...

209
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,413
is probably not so smart.

210
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,047
I would have called...

211
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,256
but I had
a bit of a situation.

212
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,495
So, guess who's
over at the Tease.

213
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,727
Roy Gelles.
I just spoke to him.

214
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,065
You just spoke to him?
Yeah, I spoke to him.

215
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,298
<i>Come on, man. What the
fuck... What did he say?</i>

216
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,774
What's wrong with you? He just
called to wish me a merry Christmas.

217
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,275
Well, what
did you say?

218
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,005
Well, I wished him
a merry Christmas.

219
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,273
What did he say?

220
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,939
What the hell
are you so worried about?

221
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,576
Vic, I sue people
for a living.

222
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,843
You sell them pornography.

223
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,615
Roy hurts people.

224
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,657
He makes it so their knees and
elbows bend in both directions.

225
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,988
That worries me.

226
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,119
Let me ask you something.

227
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,591
Did I make a mistake when I
made you my partner in this deal?

228
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,761
Hey! You didn't make me your partner.
I am the one who showed you...

229
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,669
how to steal $2 million worth
of Bill Guerrard's money.

230
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,799
Then I showed you how to do it so
he wouldn't know what you'd done...

231
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,275
till it was too late.

232
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,642
What we've done, okay?

233
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,113
Remember that.
What we've done.

234
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,275
And here's the thing
about what we've done.

235
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,818
Mr. Arglist?

236
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,713
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

237
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,558
Left to yourself, you'd
still be on a barstool...

238
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,390
thinking about
how it could be done...

239
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,465
if somebody had the balls
to do it. Which is me.

240
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,297
Don't poke, Vic, okay?
I get it.

241
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,601
Hello.

242
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,470
Yeah.

243
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,911
I know that.
I know that.

244
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,383
I know that, too.

245
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,323
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

246
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,763
So, I'll meet you
at the Velvet Touch at 1:00.

247
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,098
Just like we planned,
all right? Who was that?

248
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,029
Not that it's any
of your fucking business.

249
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,074
That was my wife.

250
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,234
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie.

251
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,214
The lovely Gladys, of whom you've
heard me speak over the years...

252
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,250
with tenderness
and affection.

253
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,251
She was wondering
if I'm gonna be home...

254
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,116
in time for midnight worship.

255
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,191
<i>I thought that's who you were...
Oh, having dinner with? No, no.</i>

256
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,090
See, Gladys is
on the Subway Diet.

257
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,719
She has a couple of foot-longs
at lunch, couple at dinner.

258
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,357
Buys her clothes
from Omar the Tentmaker.

259
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,697
But perhaps I'm being unkind.

260
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,700
Anyway, let me out of here.

261
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,371
Hey, Vic.
Yeah?

262
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,809
If you wouldn't mind, you know,
in case we get separated...

263
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,250
tell me where the money is.

264
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,614
Excuse me, Mr. Arglist.

265
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,349
That's hilarious.

266
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,485
He's something else.
Yeah.

267
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,421
Mr. Arglist, I wonder
if I might have a word?

268
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,959
Sure. Vic!

269
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,527
Mr. Arglist, I'm sorry to bother you.

270
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,564
I believe
you can help us.

271
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,062
Peter Van Heuten is a
friend of yours, right?

272
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,528
Yes.

273
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,499
He's in no shape to drive...

274
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,005
Charlie fucking Arglist!

275
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,734
Yo ho ho, mo-fo!
What are you doing here, man?

276
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,712
Hiya, Pete.
Merry Christmas!

277
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,749
It's good to see you!
Good to see you!

278
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,411
What are you doing here, man?
The real people are in there.

279
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,919
Let's go in here.

280
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,921
<i>Everybody, I want you to meet...
Listen up, a friend of mine...</i>

281
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,892
This is Charlie Arglist, the
most talented and handsome...

282
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,429
mob lawyer in all of Kansas.

283
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,563
I really wish you
wouldn't do that. Come on.

284
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,761
Come on. That was Vic Cavanaugh you
were hanging out with back there.

285
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,998
So what? Hey, let me ask you a question.

286
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,040
Is it true that one time...

287
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,134
he cut the hand off of somebody
who stuck their fingers...

288
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,544
up the twazzallah of a
dancer over at Tease-O-Rama?

289
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,672
Look around at the bar.

290
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,410
Do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here?

291
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,077
Because if they chopped off
the hand...

292
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,950
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper...

293
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,921
half the men in Wichita
would be wearing hooks.

294
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,153
Are you trying to tell me that these
are just normal guys you work for?

295
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,352
What are you doing here?

296
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,588
Trying to get my ashes hauled,
like everybody else!

297
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,597
<i>NoëI, Joyeux NoëI!</i>

298
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,690
It's all right.
He's drunk.

299
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,698
Sarabeth isn't performing
that function anymore?

300
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,433
Did she do that
for you oftentimes...

301
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,873
throughout your saga?

302
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,137
Occasionally. Not very often. Mmm-hmm.

303
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,676
Is she still wearing
flannel to bed?

304
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,941
Silly me.

305
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,381
I thought, until I met
and married Sarabeth...

306
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,146
that it was
only little children...

307
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,711
who wore those things with
the feet sewn on the bottom.

308
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,222
You could have warned me
about that.

309
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,189
And I'm actually
being kind of serious here.

310
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,954
I tried to, Pete.
I really did.

311
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,189
Yeah, bullshit. I was the end
of your alimony problem.

312
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,822
That's what I was.
Like hell. You were in love.

313
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,060
With my wife.

314
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,462
Love.

315
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,602
Someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost...

316
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,766
of that particular illusion.

317
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,139
Hey.
Yeah?

318
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,012
<i>Did you ever go and...</i>

319
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,741
The strippers?
Yeah, occasionally.

320
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,045
Yeah?
Yeah, sure.

321
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,585
When I'm really desperate...

322
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,019
or completely shit-faced, or
generally have my head up my ass.

323
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,683
I'm all those three things
right now, baby. Let's go!

324
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,249
So how you doing
otherwise, buddy?

325
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,851
Great. Great. Really great.

326
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,888
Drawing a lot of buildings.
Making a fucking fortune.

327
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,227
Well, listen.
I gotta make a phone call.

328
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,603
If you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm.

329
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,074
Remain calm.

330
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,436
Big mob lawyer.

331
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,422
<i>Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?</i>

332
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,485
No. She just called.
Said she's on her way.

333
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,156
All right, listen...

334
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,359
when she gets back, you tell
her I have that present...

335
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,698
that I mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave.

336
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,963
Okay? Bye.

337
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,234
Mr. Arglist.
Councilman.

338
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,830
I wonder if we might
have a quiet word.

339
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,432
Actually, I'm kind of...

340
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,604
Would you be good enough to deliver
a message from me to Mr. Guerrard?

341
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,481
Wichita is a community
of good people, Mr. Arglist.

342
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,646
Christian people.

343
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,452
Yeah, half of them are in this
very bar trying to get laid.

344
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,289
That may well be. But my
point is, some time ago...

345
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,492
in a moment of weakness,
I did a very foolish thing.

346
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,958
And that foolish thing
was photographed.

347
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,799
I believe that photo is in the
possession of a Mr. Vic Cavanaugh...

348
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,341
an associate of yours,
who refuses to surrender it...

349
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,673
despite several generous
offers for its purchase...

350
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,873
the last of which,
delivered not 10 minutes ago.

351
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,643
People can be stubborn.

352
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,516
Do you think Mr. Guerrard would be
able to persuade Mr. Cavanaugh...

353
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,576
Oh.

354
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,319
...to reconsider if he understood
his own interests in the matter?

355
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,494
Well, Mr. Guerrard is one of
the most persuasive men I know.

356
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,258
What kind of figures
are we talking about here?

357
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,925
Are we talking about four?
Five? Six?

358
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,936
Five, Mr. Arglist.
Low five.

359
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,831
Councilman, I think
the photo in question...

360
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,034
might be closer than
you can possibly imagine.

361
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,507
You've given me hope, Mr.
Arglist. Merry Christmas.

362
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,778
Wonderful season, isn't it? So
full of mutual understanding.

363
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,113
Yeah.

364
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,393
You gotta know the whole
culture is in the toilet...

365
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,987
if a guy dressed like that can
get laid in a place like this.

366
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,126
Hey, you're flipping off the
mob here, just so you know.

367
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,727
Did I mention to you that I
really wish you wouldn't do that?

368
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,965
Yeah.

369
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,033
M- O-B, mob. Okay?
All right, let's go.

370
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,043
Right back at you, huh?

371
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,579
And there, that one, too.
There, see?

372
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,165
That's my chair in there.

373
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,400
You wanna know the truth?

374
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,774
I can't fill it.

375
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,216
Neither could I, if it
makes you feel any better.

376
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,583
Listen, Charlie.

377
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,784
Before we go in, there's
something I have to tell you.

378
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,925
It's been on my conscience, and
you can punch me if you want to.

379
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,998
I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

380
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,969
Back when you and Sarabeth were
still married that last year...

381
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,026
Uh-huh.

382
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,129
...she and I
were fucking.

383
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,503
No kidding?

384
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:38,614
Like minks. Everywhere.
Kitchen table, your bed, garage.

385
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,140
Wow.

386
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,986
Jesus, Charlie,
we were friends.

387
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,483
It doesn't make you angry?

388
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,286
Actually, it makes me curious.

389
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,791
Makes me wonder
who she's fucking now.

390
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,428
Yo ho ho!
Merry fucking Christmas!

391
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,031
Guess who I brought with me?
Ghost of Christmas Past.

392
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,800
Ooh.

393
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,841
Marley!
Get the fuck in here.

394
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,147
Hey, everybody.

395
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,585
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

396
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,848
Hello, Charlie.

397
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,122
Come in
and have a piece of pie.

398
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,128
Hi, Dottie.
No, thank you. I'm fine.

399
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,790
I just wanted to stop in and
wish you all a very merry...

400
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,732
Screw the pie, you old harpy.
We're here for dinner.

401
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,168
Turkey, cranberry,
stuffing, the works!

402
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,299
Thanks. Yeah.

403
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,672
Yeah. Motherfucker.
Yeah.

404
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,844
Turkey-alurkey.

405
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,642
Pathetic.

406
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,985
What did you say, Stan?

407
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,023
You two are pathetic.
Makes me ashamed to be a man.

408
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm pathetic?
I'm pathetic?

409
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,860
Who paid for that
hip replacement...

410
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,193
your insurance company
wouldn't cover, huh?

411
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,528
Dad, tell me that!

412
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,002
And who took care of your mortgage
payments when you were recuperating?

413
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,903
And when you're
done with that...

414
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,532
maybe you could
explain to me who it was...

415
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,508
raised his only daughter...

416
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,537
to be a cold, gossiping,
hypocritical bitch!

417
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,983
So, Spence, how you doing?
Go to hell.

418
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,726
Don't you talk
to your father that way.

419
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,697
He's not my father. He didn't
even send us presents this year.

420
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,165
I hate his guts.

421
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,702
Is that right, Charlie?

422
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,170
You didn't even send them
any Christmas presents?

423
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,332
No.
Christmas is tomorrow.

424
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,036
Guess what, Daddy?
I was in the Christmas play.

425
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,100
So what?

426
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,113
All you were was Tiny Tim's sister,
and you didn't even have any lines!

427
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,614
And he didn't even
come to watch!

428
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,311
He would have, but Mommy
didn't send an invitation!

429
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,617
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but maybe you should go now.

430
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,681
And perhaps you would give
Pete a ride home?

431
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,590
Sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight.

432
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,288
Okay.
Yeah.

433
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,423
Listen, sweetie,
I'm gonna go...

434
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,661
and I'm gonna come back and
visit you tomorrow, all right?

435
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,136
Don't believe him, Melissa. He's
lying. All he ever does is lie.

436
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,331
Shut up!

437
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,338
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

438
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,624
On the whole,
I thought that went well.

439
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,625
Yeah, it's good
to see the family.

440
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,753
What do you say, one more
drink? The night is young.

441
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,322
All right, one more,
that's it. Okay. One more.

442
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,971
Melissa really misses you.

443
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,779
Not Spencer. He hates me.

444
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,312
You just gotta give him time.
He'll come around.

445
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,453
Your leaving came
at an awkward age for him.

446
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,460
A clean break is best.

447
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,363
No, a clean break is easiest.
On you.

448
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,123
Oh.

449
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,669
Are you saying
you have no regrets?

450
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,871
Don't believe in them.

451
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,375
Bullshit.
Everybody has regrets.

452
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:30,306
Guys our age,
what else is there?

453
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,449
I ever tell you
my father was a twin?

454
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,189
Identical?
Fraternal.

455
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,853
Looked a lot alike, though,
him and my uncle.

456
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,487
Different temperaments
completely.

457
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,130
My father, he's a cop.

458
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,996
By-the-book guy.

459
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,966
Believed in the law. Wanted
his only son to be a lawyer.

460
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,566
Drank in moderation,
didn't smoke.

461
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,305
Kept up his
life insurance premiums.

462
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,377
Voted in every election,
not just for president.

463
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,542
Let me guess.
Uncle didn't vote.

464
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,883
He said he didn't want
to encourage the bastards.

465
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,055
In and out of jail
from the time he was 16...

466
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,855
drunk all the time,
fucked everything that walked.

467
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,364
Won a fortune playing poker,
lost it all the same way.

468
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,593
Lost an eye in a fight.
Half his life...

469
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,864
So what you're trying to say
is, you take after your uncle.

470
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,767
I wasn't finished.

471
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:31,905
My father was 54...

472
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,309
when he died of a massive
embolism, right here in Wichita.

473
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,915
My uncle
died the very next day...

474
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,547
in a car wreck in California.

475
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,854
So the point is...

476
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,891
it is futile to regret.

477
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,794
<i>You do one thing,
you do another...</i>

478
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,235
I mean, so what?

479
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,534
What's the difference?
Same result.

480
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,273
How many of these lights
you gonna sit through?

481
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,850
See if I tell you
another fucking story.

482
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,153
Sorry, guys, we're closed.

483
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,657
We just want one drink.
Each.

484
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,591
My friend's a mobster. You
might know that, you might not.

485
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,464
I'll tell you what. I'll
give you one, on the house...

486
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,000
if you drink it up and leave.

487
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,697
But I'm not opening
my register back up.

488
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,603
Thank you, gorgeous.

489
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you know where this last
drink is going to take me?

490
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,739
To that perfect stage
of drunkenness.

491
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,282
And then, do you know
what I'm going to do?

492
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,684
I'm going to go straight home,
go to bed, and dream of you.

493
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,954
I don't think I'd pursue
that particular line.

494
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,684
You with him?
Yeah.

495
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,196
Makes no difference.
It's okay.

496
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,295
It's a free country.

497
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,427
And any man can dream
anything he wants to dream.

498
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,868
And tonight
I'm gonna dream of you.

499
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,836
All right, I gotta make a
phone call. I'll be right back.

500
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,305
Okay, behave yourself.

501
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,541
<i>Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?</i>

502
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,135
No. Not yet.

503
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,848
But you won't believe
who just walked in.

504
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,476
<i>Roy Gelles? No. Forget
Roy Gelles, will you?</i>

505
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,516
That fucking guitar player.

506
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,557
The one who gave Rusti
the black eye.

507
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,989
What's going on?

508
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,356
<i>I swear to God...</i>

509
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,157
if he gives Rusti any trouble, I'm
gonna break his fucking fingers.

510
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,493
What's your name,
jock strap?

511
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,897
Which hand should I break?

512
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,128
I don't have the answer
to that question, Sidney.

513
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,398
<i>Listen, when Renata gets
back in, just tell her...</i>

514
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,132
I know.
You got a present for her.

515
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,334
I hope you don't think she's
gonna fuck you, Charlie.

516
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,003
<i>Think it's out of the
question? Absolutely.</i>

517
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,240
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

518
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,941
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

519
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,184
Would you like to know what
you're going to be wearing...

520
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,985
in my little dream?
Disregard him.

521
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,113
Hmm.

522
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,490
That fish necklace,
and that's it.

523
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,225
Completely disregard him
tonight. He's drunk.

524
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,825
Except for that necklace, you're
gonna be one naked little Christian.

525
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,041
Pete, not that you're asking
for my advice...

526
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,373
but, listen, I would shut
the fuck up right now.

527
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,906
Yeah.

528
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,945
Hey. Sporty Nuts.
Pete.

529
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,486
If you don't get laid tonight,
fish necklace or no...

530
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,820
it's 'cause
you're not trying, my son.

531
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,587
Pete, I hope you're
listening to me.

532
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,218
And if you play
your cards right...

533
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,531
this hot-assed
little Jesus freak...

534
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,093
just might initiate you into the
Campus Crusade for Cunnilingus.

535
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,766
Do you notice that I am practicing
non-violent resistance...

536
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,276
in honor
of the Christmas holiday?

537
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,877
Because that's the way...

538
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,975
baby Jesus
would have wanted me to do it.

539
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,453
That was unpleasant.
I think I scraped my tummy.

540
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,159
Hmm.

541
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,670
Oh, my nuts.

542
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,968
I got it. I got it.

543
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,943
You sure?
I got it.

544
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,084
Oh, fuck.

545
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,362
Jesus Christ, Pete, you had
the whole goddamn parking lot.

546
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,664
Why did you have
to throw up in the car?

547
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:58,640
I think that boy drove one of my
testicles up into my body cavity.

548
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,177
Are you sure?

549
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,844
I don't know
where else it could be.

550
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,608
Okay, bounce me.

551
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,985
Again, again.

552
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,485
Now, three times fast.
Three times fast!

553
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,556
If you're trying to shake the
money out of his pockets...

554
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,296
you gotta turn him
upside down first.

555
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,900
Right.

556
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,568
Think that did it.

557
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,975
One, two. Yup.

558
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,212
We did it.

559
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,380
You have a good night,
Mr. Arglist.

560
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,076
Good night, now.

561
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,635
Take me home, buddy.
I know my limit.

562
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,964
You are home,
for Christ's sake, Pete.

563
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,813
Pants, pants, pants.

564
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,044
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

565
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,621
Do you remember
when you used to live here?

566
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,212
Do you remember?
Yeah. I remember.

567
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,257
This used to be your house.
Come on.

568
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,192
I got it, I got it, I got it.

569
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,354
I know the way.

570
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,489
Are you sure?
Buddy, I got it.

571
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,396
All right.
I got it, okay?

572
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,899
Man down.

573
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,540
Man down.

574
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,343
I thought I had it.

575
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,107
But I didn't.

576
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,680
I didn't have it.

577
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,589
Man still down.

578
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,893
Man remains down.

579
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,962
Get some rest, pal.

580
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,784
Stop! Stop it!

581
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,454
Oh, fuck!

582
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,620
Oh my God!

583
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,626
Hi, Rusti.
Is Renata inside?

584
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,395
Oh, fuck!

585
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,162
Charlie, did you meet Donny?
Ronny.

586
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,669
Yeah. Donny had this giant
crush on me back in high school.

587
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,103
Only I had no idea.

588
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,041
We had two classes together,
chemistry and something else.

589
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,303
We can't remember.

590
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,346
Anyway, so we're talking...

591
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,971
and remembering old times,
and guess what?

592
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,976
We're getting married.

593
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,382
Oh, fuck!

594
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,147
Great.
Oh, God!

595
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,248
Listen. Let this night
be a reminder to you...

596
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,718
when you think
about using her...

597
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,059
As a punching bag.
All right?

598
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,190
<i>All right? Don't... All right? Sidney.</i>

599
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,891
Sidney.
All right.

600
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,499
You do hear that siren, right?
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,408
Look, Charlie,
my blood was up, you know?

602
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,008
My mother's always telling me
I need to work on my anger.

603
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,172
Channel my energies
into something more positive.

604
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,681
Makes me
want to slap her silly.

605
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,979
Jesus Christ, Sidney, you
don't hit your mother, do you?

606
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,314
Christ, no.

607
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,150
Charlie, I'm talking about
desires here, that's all.

608
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,588
Urges and shit.

609
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,826
Anyway, I gotta go.
Gotta pick up the kids.

610
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,327
We're going to Six Flags
tomorrow.

611
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,692
Good.
Yeah.

612
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,321
Is she back?
Oh, yeah.

613
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,798
She's gonna be pissed at me
'cause I'm leaving early.

614
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,836
That's okay. I got something
for her, to cheer her up.

615
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,271
Damn. You can read the
fine print on the lubricant.

616
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,144
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.

617
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,709
I guess I thought
you'd be happier. Happy?

618
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,152
I'm fucking ecstatic.
Can't you tell?

619
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,088
And in return for this,
you want exactly what?

620
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,096
Nothing.

621
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,032
Nothing.

622
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,804
Charlie, I've been hearing
weird things about you all night.

623
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,934
Like what?

624
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,706
Like waiving stage rentals
over at the Tease-O-Rama.

625
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,272
Comping dancers' drinks?
Not like you at all.

626
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,610
And now this.

627
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,926
Oh, my God.

628
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,896
You are leaving town.

629
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,341
Have you and Vic
been dipping into the till?

630
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,072
Steal from Bill?
That would be crazy.

631
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,417
Well, then there's only one
other possible explanation.

632
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,586
You're in love with me.

633
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,127
I've always liked you.

634
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,092
I've noticed.

635
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,279
Tell you what.
What?

636
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,787
Give me 45 minutes to close up,
then meet me at my apartment.

637
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,082
All right.

638
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:20,950
Okay.

639
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,493
I forgot. Vic called.

640
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,696
Said to tell you that you
were right and he was wrong.

641
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,573
Something about a guy you
thought might be looking for you.

642
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,166
Yeah?
He is.

643
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,502
This was when?

644
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,576
About half an hour ago.

645
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:49,016
Vic said for you to meet him at
the Velvet Touch as soon as you can.

646
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,288
You sure nothing's going on?
Not a thing.

647
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,755
Don't forget to come back,
okay?

648
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,422
I won't.

649
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,875
Vic.

650
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,901
<i>Harder. Oh, yeah.</i>

651
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,903
Vic, hate to interrupt!

652
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,076
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

653
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,447
Come on, Vic.

654
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,951
<i>Don't stop.</i>

655
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,411
<i>Almost there.</i>

656
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,588
<i>Keep going. Keep going.</i>

657
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:14,730
Vic?

658
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,997
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

659
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,666
Mr. Arglist?

660
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,734
Oh, fuck!

661
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,338
Ouch, that had to hurt.
Yeah, it sure did.

662
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,471
What were you doing?

663
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,481
I was gonna be sick,
but now I'm okay.

664
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,240
Different car.

665
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,848
Yeah, it's my ex-wife's.
It's a long story.

666
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,852
You don't look too good.

667
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,118
You want me to call somebody
to come get you?

668
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,126
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm headed home anyway.

669
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,362
Okay, Mr. Arglist. You go
home and get some sleep.

670
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,093
And don't forget to put in a good
word for me with Mr. Guerrard.

671
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,361
I will, Officer.
Officer what?

672
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,868
Taylor.
Tyler.

673
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,204
But it's pretty close, though. Yeah.

674
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,442
All right, tell you what.
When you go home...

675
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,539
I don't think I'd come back out
again tonight, if I were you.

676
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,017
No, I probably won't.
Good night to you.

677
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,021
Happy holidays.
Okay. All the best.

678
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,756
Oh, fuck.

679
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,301
<i>Hello?
Renata.</i>

680
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,672
<i>Charlie.
Listen.</i>

681
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,976
You were right.
Vic and I have been skimming.

682
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,108
Well, duh.

683
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,277
<i>I think Roy Gelles
must have found out...</i>

684
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,947
<i>and I think
he might have killed Vic.</i>

685
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,423
<i>That's terrible.</i>

686
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,925
So, I was thinking it might
be best if I left town.

687
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,258
I was wondering
if you wanted to come with me.

688
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,397
You have the money?
What?

689
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,825
Which...
The money we're talking about.

690
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,666
That you and Vic
have been skimming.

691
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,330
<i>Try to keep up, okay?</i>

692
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,930
No. Vic had it.

693
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,075
So, your idea is that we should
run away together and be poor?

694
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,510
I thought I'd give it a shot.

695
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,138
<i>Here's the thing, though.</i>

696
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,651
Roy wouldn't have killed Vic unless
Vic told him where the money was...

697
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,482
which means Roy has it now.

698
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,079
Well, why don't you sneak up
behind him...

699
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,819
and hit him over the head
with something and take it?

700
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,487
Me? You want me
to sneak up on Roy Gelles?

701
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,191
Charlie, think of this
as your defining moment.

702
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,529
<i>This is your chance
to be something more.</i>

703
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,193
Like a murderer?

704
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,601
<i>This is your chance
to start over, Charlie.</i>

705
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,902
Our chance,
if that's what you want.

706
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,503
<i>If that's what I want.</i>

707
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,871
Listen, I just gotta
ask you one thing.

708
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,473
What?

709
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,353
I didn't have
a specific question planned.

710
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,215
Nothing, sorry.

711
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,551
<i>Well, then...</i>

712
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,366
Gladys.

713
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,418
Gladys, it's me,
Charlie Arglist.

714
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,361
Gladys, where is Vic?

715
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,591
It's a sweet thought, Charlie.
But she's already dead.

716
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,139
Jesus Christ,
you scared the fuck out of me!

717
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,966
I thought you were dead!
I thought Roy killed you.

718
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,671
Well, he was going to.

719
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,603
But he got sidetracked.
You should have been there.

720
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,377
He actually threatened
to shoot Gladys...

721
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,610
if I didn't tell him
where the money was.

722
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,710
But I think he was counting...

723
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,187
on a level of commitment and
affection between her and me...

724
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,621
that just simply wasn't there.

725
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,027
Where is he now?

726
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,187
Follow me.
You're gonna love this.

727
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,236
Hey, Roy!

728
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,440
You still alive in there?

729
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,545
You didn't asphyxiate yet,
did you?

730
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,519
Hey, Vic.

731
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,253
Come a little closer,
so I can talk to you.

732
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,520
What's that, Roy?

733
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,857
Jesus fucking Christ!

734
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,735
Damn it, I took his gun.

735
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,872
Guess he must have
another one.

736
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,339
Must have.

737
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,374
Is that you, Arglist?

738
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,139
Hi, Roy.

739
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,308
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you.

740
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,510
You do know that, right?

741
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,816
Roy, you must be
one fucking optimist...

742
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,083
if you think you're ever
getting out of that trunk.

743
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,819
Let me out, Arglist.
I'm your only hope.

744
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,828
Actually, you just told me you'd
kill me if you got out, Roy.

745
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,725
I didn't mean it.
Sounded like you did.

746
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,165
I was just pissed off.

747
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,204
It's cramped in here
and I'm claustrophobic.

748
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,829
Come on.
Give me a hand.

749
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,373
Wanna go to the trunk?

750
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,239
Already tried it.
Let's go to the back seat.

751
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,642
Ready?
Yeah.

752
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,875
That's one
big motherfucker.

753
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,444
One, two, three!

754
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,197
Oh, God damn.

755
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,964
We're gonna have to
take the door off.

756
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,234
It's not gonna fit. You
want me to get the Mercedes?

757
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,366
Mercedes? What Mercedes?

758
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,468
My ex-wife's. It's a
long story. Don't ask.

759
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,606
There is no way that
this thing is gonna fit...

760
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,480
in a piece-of-shit Mercedes
if it don't go in a Lincoln.

761
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,985
No, they're surprisingly
spacious, Vic.

762
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,851
I'm offering you a deal,
Arglist.

763
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,550
Jesus fucking shit.
Give me something.

764
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,058
Don't be an idiot.
God damn it.

765
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,686
Fucking shut up!

766
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,497
Shut the fuck up in there!

767
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,332
You just keep
your fucking mouth shut, okay?

768
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,130
Piece of fucking shit!
God damn it!

769
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,746
You keep that up, you're
gonna spring the lock.

770
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,422
What the fuck were you thinking?
Why didn't you just shoot him?

771
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,253
And then you could have
put him in the trunk...

772
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,792
and you wouldn't need
that footlocker.

773
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,954
Because I want the pleasure
of seeing his big ass...

774
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,158
sink to the bottom of
Lake Bascombe! That's why!

775
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,327
Hey, Roy. Roy?

776
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,938
I can't wait for you
to feel the icy water...

777
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,998
seeping into this trunk...

778
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,840
shriveling your balls
before you drown!

779
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,180
What if he's reloaded?

780
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,844
Well, he's folded up in there
like a card table.

781
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,822
How the hell
is he gonna reload?

782
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,720
I don't know, Vic.

783
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,348
She could never
do anything right.

784
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,052
Jesus.

785
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,292
What?

786
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,838
Nothing. I just thought you
were gonna put Roy in the trunk.

787
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,533
The footlocker might not fit
in the back seat, is all.

788
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,371
You're the one
been going on...

789
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,910
about how spacious
these fuckers are.

790
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,376
And now you're saying
it won't fit?

791
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,006
It might. I'm not sure,
is what I'm saying.

792
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,110
One night driving a Mercedes,
and already you're an asshole.

793
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,880
Come on,
help me get this thing.

794
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,357
Ow! God damn it!

795
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,895
<i>If I could open
the fucking door...</i>

796
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,763
Okay.

797
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,909
Jesus, Charlie, you're right.
This thing is spacious.

798
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,145
There's no way it would
have gone in a Lincoln.

799
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,242
Give me the key.
Oh, yeah.

800
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,551
All right.
I gotta get my shit.

801
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,585
Oh, Vic?

802
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,090
What?

803
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:49,958
Whose thumb is this?

804
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,925
Oh, yeah. Good news, Roy.
Charlie brought your thumb.

805
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,972
So, you think you're
going to go back to Florida?

806
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,773
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

807
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,781
Maybe you shouldn't tell me
where you're going...

808
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,407
and I shouldn't tell you
where I'm going.

809
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,952
I just think
it's safer that way.

810
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,079
He's going to kill you,
Arglist.

811
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,020
That's where you're going.

812
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,115
It's the truth, Arglist!

813
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,919
Think about it.

814
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,485
Pay no attention
to the man in the trunk.

815
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,472
He's got a gun, Roy. He could
shoot me now if he wanted to.

816
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,940
Uh-uh. He needs your help
to unload the car.

817
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:39,112
Once he's deposited me
and his missus in the lake...

818
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,709
you're next.

819
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,812
You know what, Roy?

820
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,548
One more word
out of that trunk...

821
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,584
and I'm gonna shoot it
at both ends.

822
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:51,616
Because the truth is, I can't
remember which end your head's at.

823
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,069
You know, the fact of the
matter is, I should shoot you.

824
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,166
What were you doing
in there tonight?

825
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,733
What are you talking about?
Well, you're waiving stage fees...

826
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,904
you're comping drinks,
being nice to people.

827
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,971
You may as well wear a
fucking sign that says:

828
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:15,245
"Hey, I just stole a shitload of
money and now I'm blowing town. "

829
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,343
For Christ's sake...
Calm down! It's Christmas.

830
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,012
Everybody's nice
on Christmas.

831
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,490
No, Charlie. No. Only
morons are nice at Christmas.

832
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,587
And that's a lot of people,
too, Charlie.

833
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,357
Especially in Kansas.
But not everybody.

834
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,664
What kind of man
shoots his own wife...

835
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,169
in the back of the head
on Christmas Eve?

836
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:36,705
Roy, he already knows
that you shot her, okay?

837
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,239
That's what he told you,
Arglist?

838
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,437
What the hell do I want
to shoot his wife for?

839
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,910
Bill Guerrard knows about
this whole deal, Arglist.

840
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,110
That's not what
you said earlier, Roy...

841
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,414
when your thumb
was in the vise.

842
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,546
You'll never make it
out of Wichita.

843
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,057
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
did I not warn that asshole...

844
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,150
to shut the fuck up?

845
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,852
You told him.
You got one chance, Arglist...

846
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,225
That's right. I told him.
Take the wheel.

847
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,356
...and that's me.
Take the fucking wheel!

848
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,561
Think about it!

849
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,465
Fucking asshole.

850
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,702
Well, I guess
that was the head end, huh?

851
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,404
Where's the thumb?

852
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,048
The thumb,
where's the thumb?

853
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,684
Thank you, sir.

854
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,506
There she is.

855
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,947
It's kind of beautiful
out here, huh?

856
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,262
All right, give her a shove.

857
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,797
Well, come on. Open the fucking door
and help me with this goddamn thing.

858
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,433
What do you think
we're here for? Come on.

859
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,849
Jesus.

860
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,045
Hang on! It's caught.

861
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,715
Okay.

862
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,221
Okay.

863
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,849
Now toss it over.
Come on.

864
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,665
For fuck's sake, Charlie,
come on.

865
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,569
Fuck, this is heavy.

866
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,130
It says, "Keep off. "

867
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,190
All right, ready?
Let's go.

868
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,285
Think I'd rather push.

869
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,123
Okay, fucking push.
I don't give a shit.

870
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,761
You're in the way, Charlie.

871
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,974
Okay, let's go. Ready?
Yeah.

872
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,624
It's falling apart.

873
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,414
You know what?
Put it up on its end.

874
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,918
Just shove it up.

875
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,080
I mean, it's as deep here
as it is any place else.

876
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,316
Just throw
the fucking thing over.

877
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,160
Vic.

878
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,174
God damn it, Roy. That was just
blind fucking luck, you asshole.

879
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:15,140
Give me a hand, Arglist.
I'm all stiff.

880
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,490
Now, as promised.

881
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,693
Well, Roy, the good news is,
you're out of the trunk.

882
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,236
The bad news is, you're
down four quarts of blood...

883
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,668
and your gun's empty.

884
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,674
I'm going to kill you anyway.

885
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,080
Here, hold this.

886
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,014
That's an unrealistic goal,
Roy.

887
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,584
You're dead, Roy.

888
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,526
Don't just stand there
pretending you're not.

889
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,606
Jesus Christ, Charlie!

890
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,677
Throw me a rope or something.
I can't swim!

891
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,573
I'm thinking, no.

892
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,110
You were gonna kill me,
right, Vic? You asshole!

893
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,516
Jesus, you're stupid!

894
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,553
All right, that's it!
Fuck you!

895
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,188
Look, okay, I'm sorry!

896
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,356
Charlie, I'm sorry!

897
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,094
I'm going to throw
the gun away! Look!

898
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:45,032
Oh, God, you have no idea
how cold this water is.

899
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,234
Charlie.

900
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,873
So long, Vic.

901
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:56,718
Don't you want to know
where the money is?

902
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,451
I know where the money is. It's
in the back seat of the Benz.

903
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,650
Not a chance! Not a chance.

904
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,793
I'm done talking to you, Vic.
I'm through listening to you.

905
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,558
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself!

906
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,795
Only hurry! Hurry!
I can't feel my legs!

907
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,063
I'm dying here! I'm dying!

908
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,932
Charlie! God damn it!

909
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,841
I know what I did was wrong!
But, Jesus! Fuck!

910
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:31,780
I'm shot, Charlie.
I can't pull myself up!

911
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,155
Please. Please.

912
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:41,492
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be his name, because...</i>

913
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,230
We are kingdom come,
and will be done...

914
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,064
and give us every day...

915
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,570
<i>our bread,
because we gotta eat...</i>

916
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,278
Charlie, is that you? Charlie!

917
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,176
I knew it. I knew it.
You're a good man, Charlie.

918
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,775
You're a good man.

919
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:07,152
Vic, I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

920
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,627
No! No.

921
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:17,924
No!

922
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,547
Vic! Vic, hold on!

923
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,278
Hold on, Vic.

924
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,053
Is that all?

925
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,083
Yeah.

926
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,361
Stocking stuffers.

927
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,899
Big spender.

928
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,538
Do you have any kids?
No.

929
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,701
Then shut the fuck up.
Bag it.

930
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,918
<i>Hello. Charlie?
Renata.</i>

931
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,211
I'd just about given up.

932
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,777
I fucked up.

933
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,586
Vic's dead.

934
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,055
What about Roy Gelles?

935
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,527
He's dead, too.

936
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,766
Why don't you come over?

937
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:35,127
<i>I'll wait here for you.
The front door's open.</i>

938
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,900
No. I don't see the point.
I mean...

939
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,733
I don't have the money.

940
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,401
Vic died before he told me
where it was.

941
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:47,480
You know what?
Money isn't everything.

942
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,617
Excuse me?

943
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,952
You know what I said before?
It's true, isn't it?

944
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,659
<i>You're in love with me.
Yeah.</i>

945
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,188
<i>Sure. I guess.</i>

946
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,597
I've still got to ask you
something.

947
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:07,858
What?

948
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:15,039
I don't have it yet.
I'm sorry.

949
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,146
<i>But you're coming over?
Yeah. Sure.</i>

950
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,012
See you.

951
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,882
Take me with you, man.
Oh, fuck.

952
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,626
Jesus, Pete.
No, I mean it.

953
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,123
Take me with you, buddy.

954
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,702
I can't do my life, man.
I can't do it.

955
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,801
Just get some rest.

956
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,239
I hate myself.
I want a new life.

957
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,041
You don't want mine.
I really do.

958
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:30,943
I'm in trouble.

959
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,680
I'm in big fucking trouble.

960
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,420
But that'd be great.
Don't you see?

961
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,255
We go out in a blaze of glory.

962
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,857
Like men.
Like men, Charlie.

963
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,201
No goddamn life left
for men anymore.

964
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,407
Not here.

965
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,904
This country, all that's left
for men is money and pussy.

966
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:03,278
<i>But together,
you and me together...</i>

967
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,157
Don't you think?

968
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,937
Come on. Hurry up.

969
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,735
Bill Guerrard
is around here somewhere.

970
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,142
Oh.
Yeah, "Oh. "

971
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,152
Where is he?

972
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,017
Oh.

973
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,717
Hide behind the door and
shoot him when he comes in.

974
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,919
You don't happen to have
any bullets for this, do you?

975
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,363
Shotgun behind the bar.

976
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,928
"As Wichita falls...

977
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,175
"so falls Wichita Falls. "

978
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,102
I like that.

979
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,942
And I'm gonna give your
pussy-whipped pal Arglist...

980
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,746
another 15 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass.

981
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,980
After which time I'm going to assume
his brain overruled his pecker.

982
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,087
Well, Bill,
that's just not enough time.

983
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,520
He lives way across town.

984
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:06,157
Yeah? Well, that's your bad luck.
I should be home in Kansas City...

985
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,897
watching my kids
open their Christmas presents!

986
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,598
Now I gotta waste
the whole fucking day...

987
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,368
looking for that nitwit!

988
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,841
I'll never understand lawyers.

989
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:21,105
I mean, here they've got a license
to steal from the general public...

990
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,016
all legal and aboveboard,
but is that enough?

991
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,883
Fuck, no! They gotta
steal from their friends!

992
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,986
Anybody
but a fucking lawyer...

993
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,159
would consider
the consequences, right?

994
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:38,927
That I would,
for an absolute certainty...

995
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:42,664
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife.

996
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:46,135
And that would give
a normal person pause.

997
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,170
But not a lawyer.

998
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:52,274
It defies the imagination,
you know.

999
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:57,942
How a woman like you could throw
in with a couple of farthammers...

1000
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,113
like Cavanaugh and Arglist.

1001
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,982
Cavanaugh, he doesn't
have the brains...

1002
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,549
to pull off
something like this.

1003
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,324
And Arglist,
he doesn't have the guts.

1004
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,363
Maybe that's where you
came in, huh?

1005
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,701
What did you do?

1006
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,307
Did you encourage them both?

1007
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,816
Suppose you do luck out...

1008
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:42,330
and you get clear of Wichita
with all that money.

1009
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:43,656
At some point...

1010
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:47,361
you're gonna have to get rid of
at least one of the peckerwoods.

1011
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,131
And then what do you got?

1012
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:52,865
A dick with no brain?

1013
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,568
Or a brain with no dick?

1014
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,416
You know what, Bill?

1015
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,944
You seem awfully tense.

1016
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:12,216
And I have this idea
of what might help you relax.

1017
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,088
You do, huh?

1018
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,154
Mmm-hmm.

1019
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,236
That you, Arglist?

1020
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,039
Drop the gun.

1021
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,152
Step away from the desk
and put your hands up.

1022
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:42,155
Charlie,
don't be a fucking idiot.

1023
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,659
You've been watching
too many stupid old movies.

1024
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,627
Why would I drop my gun?

1025
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,493
I don't know, Bill.

1026
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,165
Because I got
a big fucking shotgun...

1027
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,426
and I'll blow your head off?

1028
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,799
Well, if you could do that,
you'd be me...

1029
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,394
and I'd be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes.

1030
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,771
Jesus, Charlie,
just shoot him!

1031
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,143
If he was gonna
pull the trigger...

1032
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,738
he'd have done it when he came
through the door, girlie.

1033
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,114
It's something they don't
teach you in law school.

1034
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,016
Which is a shame,
because...

1035
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,289
Get his gun, Charlie.

1036
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,825
Get his gun.

1037
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:29,931
He's dead, Renata.

1038
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,906
The fuck he is! Sidney
loads that with birdshot!

1039
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:34,374
Why would he? I mean...
Charlie.

1040
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,207
...from a liability standpoint,
that doesn't make any sense at all.

1041
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,473
Charlie!

1042
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,347
Well, Arglist...

1043
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,479
now you've truly gone
and shit in your nest!

1044
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,695
All right, girlie.
You first.

1045
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,957
Mr. Guerrard?

1046
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,228
What's going on?

1047
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,112
Come here!

1048
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,455
Bitch!

1049
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,258
Charlie.

1050
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,894
I don't know why
I even bother with Kansas.

1051
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,836
Do I hear an "amen"?

1052
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,036
My old man tried
to tell me...

1053
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,911
that I'd be better off
starting a church...

1054
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,745
and letting Jesus pay
for the mortgage...

1055
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:52,651
in this sorry-ass
backwards state.

1056
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,020
I wouldn't listen.

1057
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:56,816
Instead...

1058
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:01,352
I put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs.

1059
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,226
Which have a proven track
record everywhere but here.

1060
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:14,498
And now I've been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer...

1061
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:19,343
who imagines he can kill me
with a shotgun loaded for snake.

1062
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,578
Serves me right.

1063
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,920
That's all I can say.

1064
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,020
All right, girlie...

1065
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,789
this is the one
that's gonna kill you.

1066
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,390
Bill.

1067
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:49,466
Yuck!

1068
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:09,225
I will say, after this...

1069
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:12,597
the holidays are never gonna
feel quite the same to me.

1070
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,765
How's the foot?
Shorter.

1071
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,207
You don't happen to have
any morphine...

1072
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,108
or Demerol or anything,
do you?

1073
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,444
Try this.

1074
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,178
I have to give you credit,
Charlie.

1075
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,351
You took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion...

1076
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,860
but in the end,
you did the deed.

1077
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,295
'Deed you did.

1078
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,200
You really came through,
Charlie.

1079
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,540
The odds were definitely
against it, but somehow...

1080
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,482
you managed to be
the last man standing.

1081
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,824
I know what I wanted
to ask you.

1082
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,828
What?
Where are you actually from?

1083
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,903
Originally.

1084
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,608
Why do you keep
asking questions, Charlie?

1085
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,973
What's it got to do
with anything?

1086
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,246
I was just curious.

1087
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,211
Wanted to know
where you came from.

1088
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,630
It's a long story,
Charlie.

1089
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:34,698
I think we've got plenty of time
to get to know each other better.

1090
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,711
Don't you?
Yeah.

1091
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,074
I guess we do.

1092
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,613
It's just you and me now,
Charlie.

1093
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,820
To the victor go the spoils.

1094
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,498
You saved my life,
Charlie.

1095
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,101
You're a different man,
just like I promised.

1096
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,572
Can you feel it?

1097
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,011
Yes. I can.

1098
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,918
Charlie.

1099
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,086
What'd you do?

1100
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:42,032
Oh! Damn stupid fuck!

1101
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,231
You stupid fucking whore!

1102
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,708
You dumb, dumb fuck!

1103
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:50,836
Your mother again?
Shit!

1104
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,939
Hi, Charlie. Yeah.
Who else?

1105
01:20:55,717 --> 01:21:00,279
Loans me her camper and fails
to mention that it's out of gas.

1106
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:03,888
If you've got a gas can,
you can siphon some from me.

1107
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,589
Charlie.

1108
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:41,528
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way...

1109
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:47,958
but you're about
the nicest guy I know.

1110
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:53,601
I'm awfully sorry to hear
that, Sidney, but thank you.

1111
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:57,404
Have a good time
with your kids at Six Flags.

1112
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,675
Merry Christmas.

1113
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,288
Nuts! Fuck!

1114
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,329
What was that?

1115
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:00,899
Nothing.

1116
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:42,246
Morning, Pete. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1117
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,443
Where are we?

1118
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,716
We're in heaven.

1119
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,188
Mmm.

1120
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,563
They got pancakes?
They got everything.

1121
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,393
Good.
