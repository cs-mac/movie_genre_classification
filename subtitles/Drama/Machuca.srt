1
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,515
Gonzalo...

2
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,891
...eat it all.

3
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:35,518
Okay, thanks.

4
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:53,701
Mom?

5
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,497
Bye, honey.

6
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,103
Eraser.

7
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,279
Look...

8
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:42,259
Good morning... boys.

9
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,098
Those of you aware that...

10
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,809
...the bulletin board is to be read.

11
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:56,146
Will have noticed
certain changes here at school.

12
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,775
You have new classmates.

13
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,695
They live near the school,

14
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:07,323
so most of you have probably seen

15
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,367
many of them around.

16
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,167
Well?

17
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,295
They live around the corner!

18
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,339
- Yes?

19
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,132
- I know that one.

20
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,718
His mother does our laundry.

21
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:30,344
Hi, Christian.

22
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:34,098
Good. Now you're classmates.

23
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:38,185
I hope you give them a warm welcome,

24
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:41,313
as you would a brother
or a new friend.

25
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,489
All right boys, please be seated.

26
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,200
Hold on.

27
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:57,328
I don't want the new boys
sitting together.

28
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,998
You. Yes, you.

29
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:03,959
Get your things
and sit over there.

30
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,881
Liven up!

31
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,133
- How about You. What's your name?
- Pedro Machuca.

32
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:16,011
- Speak up. I can't hear you.
- Pedro Machuca.

33
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,181
- Louder!
- Pedro Machuca!

34
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,103
That's more like it.

35
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:27,647
Make yourself heard,
Machuca.

36
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,233
Go sit down.

37
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,527
Over there.

38
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:36,280
You,

39
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,531
there.

40
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,952
You, there...

41
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,498
And you...

42
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:48,333
over there.

43
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,917
Right.

44
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:18,610
All alone?
How's that sandwich, Infante?

45
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,784
Tasty. You want it?

46
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:26,743
Take it.

47
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:30,455
The priest screwed you.

48
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,789
Who will you copy from now?

49
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,630
Thatjerk.
Hey!

50
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,175
Machuca!
Hey, Machuca!

51
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,259
Come on!

52
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,055
Let's have some fun.

53
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,308
Hey, Machuca. My name's...

54
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:54,268
Gaston Robles!!!

55
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,811
Just kidding.

56
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,439
Go ahead, be unfriendly.
I don't care.

57
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,773
But I want my desk back.

58
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:03,068
- Why?
- It's none of your business.

59
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,904
- To be near my friend.
- Let him move.

60
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:10,116
We're doing you a favor.
You're getting a free ride.

61
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:13,577
Our parents pay for your tuition.
And you want to make the rules?

62
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,956
- No way.
- Complain to the priest.

63
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,335
The priest, you shithead?

64
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,919
His name is Father McEnroe.

65
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,224
Hello, my honeypie!

66
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:43,480
That's enough, Mama.
Cut it out.

67
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,484
- What took you so long?
- I came straight here.

68
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,402
- Really?
- Yes.

69
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,239
Anything new at school?

70
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,698
No, nothing.

71
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,285
You have much homework?

72
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:04,791
Hey, you dummy!

73
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,502
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

74
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:13,299
- The Martians landed in Santiago...
...this morning.

75
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,468
I know.
- We have an errand to run.

76
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,054
- No, not again.
- Yes, again.

77
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:24,893
- I have homework.
- You can do it there.

78
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:32,108
NO CIVIL WAR

79
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,641
THE LONE RANGER
CHAPTER ONE

80
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,019
We had a good time, right?

81
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,691
Did you like Roberto's gift?

82
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,200
My little man...

83
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,706
Lucy, I brought some things.

84
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:37,918
I had a lucky day.

85
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:42,172
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, sweetie.

86
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:45,008
Hello, hello.

87
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:48,094
I got a great tip
at the black market.

88
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,057
- Anything yummy?
- Yeah, lentils,

89
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:55,768
milk, shaving cream,

90
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,604
- oil, sardines.
- We're overstocking.

91
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,690
We have plenty of oil already.

92
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,276
With things as they are,
you never know.

93
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,695
This situation can't last, can it?

94
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,742
No, it can't.

95
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:15,578
What are you eating,
you pig?

96
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:18,080
- Jello.
- You're gonna get fat.

97
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,831
- Such a pretty...
- Leave her alone.

98
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,375
- Here, let's see.
- No, give it to me!

99
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:29,173
Give it over here.

100
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,344
Dad,

101
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:36,180
it's the Gold Collection, first issue.
When the Lone Ranger meets Toro.

102
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,433
This is a great chapter.

103
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,937
Toro uses Indian medicine
to heal his wound.

104
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,191
You found this
at the black market?

105
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,569
What a ridiculous question!

106
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,030
It's late.
Time for bed.

107
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,075
It's a school night.

108
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,910
Good night, Dad.

109
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,286
Good night.

110
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:08,251
...the first Chilean president
ever to visit the Soviet Union.

111
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,088
Good night

112
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:15,758
Ajoint press release signed today
at the Kremlin confirms

113
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:18,761
#USSR support... #

114
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:20,387
What ajerk

115
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:22,889
Good night.

116
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,732
Can't she do any better?

117
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,402
Why? I think he's good-looking.

118
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:50,331
NO RUNNING - NO SPLASHING
NO FIGHTING GAMES

119
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,709
Stop running! Do as I say!

120
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:02,008
Boys!

121
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:04,719
Boys!

122
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,764
Remember,
this pool has a chemical

123
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:10,475
that turns pink
when it comes into contact

124
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:14,395
with urine.
So please be careful. Please!

125
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,778
Jump if you're wearing
a black shirt!

126
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,407
You!

127
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,867
Out of the pool!

128
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:47,425
You will learn
to respect each other.

129
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:50,511
Even if it's the only thing
you learn at this school.

130
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:54,348
I don't care who you are
or where you were born.

131
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:57,393
You will respect each other here!

132
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,269
Is that clear?

133
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,897
Yes, Father McEnroe.

134
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:05,066
Good. Enjoy yourselves.

135
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,280
Jump in.

136
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,039
The water's great!

137
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:42,851
RESIGN
DO IT FOR CHILE

138
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:46,729
RIGHT WING BEWARE
HERE COME THE RABBLE

139
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,607
THE OLD CAPITALIST ECONOMY
IS DEAD

140
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,654
Gonzalo,

141
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,240
Gonzalo,

142
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,867
I'm waiting, honey.

143
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:19,301
- Afternoon.
- How's little mama's boy?

144
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,728
- How is it now?
- Fine.

145
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:34,565
Do you like it?

146
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,191
No.

147
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,611
- Stunning.
- Thank you.

148
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,656
And now?

149
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,115
Even worse.

150
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,284
The boy's in a bad mood.

151
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:51,414
If you don't mind my saying so,
you look gorgeous.

152
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:52,873
Thank you.

153
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,458
I mind you saying so.

154
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,086
Gonzalo, what's your problem?

155
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,630
You loved the designs before.

156
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:05,176
- You're not the one paying.
- Neither are you

157
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,917
Hey! You jerk.

158
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,171
What's with this guy?

159
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,123
Move over, shithead.

160
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,958
Does it hurt, Infante?

161
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,086
- No.
- Come on, I want to show you something.

162
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,421
Come on, man.

163
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:31,923
Come on.

164
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:36,677
Come on, man.
Come on.

165
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:41,223
Nothing's gonna happen.
Don't worry.

166
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,647
Why so serious?

167
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,400
Relax, man.

168
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:59,740
We got him ready for you.

169
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,993
Go on, hit him.

170
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:04,327
He threw dirt at us.

171
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:06,788
Don't be chicken.
Hit him!

172
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:13,836
This is how we do things
here in Vitacura.

173
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,341
What's your problem?

174
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,054
Go on, hit him.

175
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:25,347
Go on.

176
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:26,723
Go on, hit him!

177
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,852
Don't be chicken!
Hit him!

178
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,812
Are you afraid?
Hit him!

179
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,481
Be a man for once in your life!

180
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,066
Coward!

181
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,400
Coward! Coward!

182
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,735
Let me go, dammit!

183
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,361
Come back, you coward!

184
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:47,367
- Faggot!
- Learn how to fight, you pussy!

185
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,451
Fuck off!

186
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:05,633
Look at those two pussies.
They should get married,

187
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:14,183
Faggot!

188
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,336
Hi.

189
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:48,006
- Does it hurt?
- No.

190
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,386
- You're not leaving?
- No, my ride's not here yet.

191
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,597
You want a lift?

192
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,017
No, it's okay.

193
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,185
Come on. Hold on a second.

194
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,312
Hi, Uncle!

195
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:06,898
Can we give my friend a lift?

196
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,858
All right, but quick!

197
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:11,485
Dad, there's no room!

198
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,070
Yes, there is!

199
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,739
Come on, hurry!

200
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:21,244
Shut up, midget.

201
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:23,413
The little princess
is too good for us.

202
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,334
Where to, Strawberry Face?

203
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,132
That's a pretty nice school.

204
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,718
It's a private school.

205
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,803
Sorry, no offense

206
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,304
Where to, Sire?

207
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,848
The corner of Bentjerodt
and Hernandez.

208
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,478
Nice neighborhood.

209
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:02,783
Look! Fatso's got his seat
up his ass!

210
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,243
Stop it, Dad.

211
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,620
Strawberry Face
is cracking up!

212
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,163
Is he your dad?

213
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:10,456
No, a neighbor.

214
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:14,001
Peter, do whatever Silvana says.

215
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:16,170
Only one carton at a time.

216
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,839
If they're imported,
never more than two.

217
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,799
- Where are you going?
- To work.

218
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,760
A snob like you
wouldn't know.

219
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,721
That's enough.
Let's get to work.

220
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,473
And don't confuse the flags.

221
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:31,726
It happened to Silvana last time.
That was scary!

222
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,144
I wasn't scared.

223
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:38,232
Here's your stop, Strawberry Face.

224
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:41,610
- How far are you going?
- To Parque Forestal.

225
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,862
- That's on my way.
- You sure?!

226
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:47,198
- Yeah. I can do some shopping.
- You got cash?

227
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,494
Enough chatting.
We're late.

228
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,799
Hello, Lucy?

229
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,550
Is Mama home?

230
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,220
Tell her I went to a friend's house

231
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,638
to do homework.

232
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,267
I'll be home later.
Bye.

233
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:20,854
20 years to get there,
3 years to screw it up!

234
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:27,944
Strawberry Face.
Get me 3 packs from the truck.

235
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:31,239
One Hilton, two Monarchs.
The box in front.

236
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,200
And be careful.

237
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,536
Flags! Flags!
Chilean flags!

238
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:53,134
Did you lock the truck?
Give the Hiltons to Silvana.

239
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:56,095
Allende, Allende,
the country's not for sale!

240
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,638
Flags! Flags!

241
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,020
Here.

242
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,230
- You still here?
- Willy said to give you this.

243
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:11,275
- Gonzalo, you're helping us?
- How's it going?

244
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,111
- I sold everything.
- Give me the cash.

245
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,202
I had to lower the price.

246
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,412
What's this?

247
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:27,874
- It's for me.
- You're a smart-ass.

248
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:31,794
Jump if you're not a commie!

249
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:32,628
Jump, kids, jump!

250
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:37,966
Jump if you're not a commie!

251
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:51,103
Jump!

252
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:02,197
Now what?

253
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:05,408
Now we go
to the real demonstration.

254
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:07,452
C-C-Y!

255
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:10,413
C-C-Y!

256
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,082
C-C-Y!

257
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,003
Chilean-Communist-Youth!

258
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:23,049
Power to the people!

259
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:28,638
Power to the people!

260
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:33,768
Power to the people!

261
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:40,023
Flags! Flags!

262
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,526
Here.

263
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:45,487
Allende, the people
are behind you!

264
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:47,906
Flags! Flags!

265
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:52,660
Chilean Flags!
Socialist Party flags!

266
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:59,666
Allende, the people
are behind you!

267
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,336
- How's it going, snob?
- Fine.

268
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:11,719
Jump if you're not a mummy!

269
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,474
Jump if you're not a mummy!

270
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,437
Jump if you're not a mummy!

271
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,773
What's a mummy?

272
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,317
- Rich and spoiled, like you.
- What?

273
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,111
Rich and spoiled, like you.

274
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:38,535
Go on, jump!
Jump!

275
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:41,009
Get out, honey.

276
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:58,776
- Evening, Amador.
- Come in, Madame.

277
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,986
Thank you.

278
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:13,539
I'm so sorry.

279
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:16,458
I'm late.
I couldn't come any sooner.

280
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,294
It's good to see you.

281
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:21,671
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

282
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:28,011
Sit down, honey.

283
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,770
You're not hungry?

284
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,854
No.

285
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:40,897
What happened, Chief?

286
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,858
The people at his school
are nuts.

287
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,652
The kids will end up
killing each other.

288
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,028
What school is that?

289
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:49,364
- Or did you tell me?
- Saint Patrick's.

290
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,999
Saint Patrick's.
I went there, too.

291
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,377
- Silly.
- Best school in all of Chile.

292
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:07,422
I heard things have changed there.

293
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:11,551
That the priests have turned red on us.
Is that true?

294
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:16,388
Like the rest of the country.
The kids are more restless, though.

295
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:19,683
Aren't they?
- Mama!

296
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:24,813
- Why didn't you go to Buenos Aires?
- I didn't have to.

297
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:27,148
My family's coming
this weekend.

298
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:29,609
To celebrate my wife's birthday

299
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:30,985
They're coming?

300
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:32,820
I thought

301
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,532
they wouldn't set foot in Chile
while Allende was president.

302
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,450
It's only a few days.

303
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:42,287
How absurd.

304
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:46,499
You can't compare Santiago
with Buenos Aires.

305
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:50,586
She'll have an awful birthday,
poor thing.

306
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:52,672
I don't understand.

307
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:55,549
We'll go to Vina, to the casino.

308
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:57,843
Wonderful.

309
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:12,940
How's the book I gave you?

310
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,652
I don't like the Lone Ranger.

311
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:17,986
You don't?

312
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,697
You want another book?

313
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:21,448
No.

314
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:27,620
I'll get you another next time,
just in case.

315
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,080
All right?

316
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:34,543
Make yourself at home.

317
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:58,440
Thank you.

318
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:21,335
RIGHT-WINGERS BEWARE

319
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,615
Thanks, Infante.
See you.

320
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,659
Hey! I can take you home

321
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,368
if you want!

322
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:01,204
No, thanks. Here's all right.

323
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,434
Can I?
- Okay.

324
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:02,552
Hi, Mama.

325
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,808
- I brought a friend.
- Some nerve!

326
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,644
Go on home, I'll make a snack!

327
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,480
See you there!

328
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:52,640
Why are you two so quiet?

329
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,141
Aren't you hungry?

330
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:56,226
Is there a bathroom?

331
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,145
Of course there is.

332
00:35:58,145 --> 00:36:01,440
That shack back there.

333
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,942
Pedro, go with him.

334
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,694
- Go with him!
- He can go by himself!

335
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,446
Give me your cup.

336
00:36:11,782 --> 00:36:13,743
Your friend seems nice.

337
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,244
Were you hiding him?

338
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:19,081
Clean yourself up.
You're a mess.

339
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:44,813
Hi.

340
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:47,774
Hi.

341
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,539
Is it yours?

342
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:06,082
Yes.

343
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:08,042
Be careful.
We're all thieves here.

344
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:11,087
It'll vanish in a flash.

345
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,680
- Hi.
- You could knock at least.

346
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,348
I was outside with the snob.

347
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:25,433
His name's Gonzalo.

348
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,143
Hey, give me a hand.

349
00:37:30,229 --> 00:37:32,106
- She's got the hiccups.
- Pat her on the back.

350
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,276
Guys, come sit over here.

351
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:40,197
- So tell me, snob.
- Gonzalo. His name's Gonzalo.

352
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:43,700
- Cut it out, Silvana.
- I didn't say anything.

353
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:48,538
- Hey, Peter.
- What?

354
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,540
How's school with the snob?

355
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,209
I mean Gonzalo.
- You're such an ass!

356
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,461
We're learning English.

357
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,214
Seriously.
It's not so hard. Is it?

358
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:00,966
Not really.

359
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:02,259
Okay, say something.

360
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:06,513
Even I know that one.
Something else.

361
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:08,431
Something else...

362
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,974
Okay, say...

363
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:13,102
"My sister Rosita is cute."

364
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:22,360
And say...

365
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,530
"Salvador Allende
is the President of Chile."

366
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:32,078
You're pulling my leg.

367
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:34,246
If you don't believe me,
don't ask.

368
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:38,375
Do you know this one?
What does "I love you" mean?

369
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,880
I quit. Ask Gonzalo.

370
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,216
Do you know?

371
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,468
I love you.

372
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,097
Your friend here knows.

373
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:06,151
What's the big hurry,
blondie?

374
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:18,620
- Who is it?
- Patricio Infante.

375
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:27,170
How are things?

376
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:30,047
- Hi there, Cesar.
- Patricio! Nice to see you!

377
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,674
What's new?

378
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:33,592
And the little gringo?

379
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,844
He's grown! Have a seat.

380
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,849
- How's everything?
- Fine. We're doing our best.

381
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,769
Cigarettes! Good.
I'll take some.

382
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:45,729
Any ham?

383
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,690
Sure. Excellent quality.

384
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:14,171
NO CIGARETTES

385
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:18,467
NO MILK - NO MEAT

386
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:22,471
NO EGGS - NO FLOUR

387
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:26,683
Toro.

388
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:31,938
We'll study together
next time.

389
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:32,855
Okay?

390
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,274
Robles.

391
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:41,947
Machuca.

392
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,870
Infante...

393
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:51,372
Gomez.

394
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:55,000
- How did you do?
- Seven.

395
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:44,337
Boys...
On your mark,

396
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:46,756
get set,

397
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:48,174
go!

398
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,654
Second...

399
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,531
Machuca.

400
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,034
Third...

401
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:37,928
Are you upset?

402
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:43,266
If you'd gotten a 7,
they'd have caught us for sure!

403
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,144
"For sure."

404
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:50,106
What a drag.
It's my sister's birthday.

405
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:53,275
- All these assholes are coming over.
- So what?

406
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,493
My parents are going out.

407
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,621
I have to stay in
and play the cop.

408
00:43:07,372 --> 00:43:10,208
- How old is she?
- 16.

409
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,628
They don't like leaving her alone
with her boyfriend.

410
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:18,340
- I can come if you want.
- To my place?

411
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,760
It's no big deal.
I was only offering to help.

412
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:36,607
Hi.

413
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,858
Hi.

414
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:40,110
Happy birthday.

415
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,987
Thanks.

416
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,704
Hold it, hold it!

417
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,043
- Say hello!
- Hello.

418
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:00,879
- New friend?
- Yes.

419
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:04,674
One of the new kids, right?

420
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:07,635
- What's your name?
- Pedro.

421
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:09,971
- Pedro what?
- Pedro Machuca.

422
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:11,347
Machuca...

423
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,058
- Cut it out!
- Okay, okay.

424
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:15,976
Get out of my face!

425
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:19,479
- What do they call you?
- Peter.

426
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:20,731
Peter...

427
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:21,815
Come on, stop it.

428
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:23,942
Cut it out.

429
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:27,153
These people
have such weird names.

430
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:29,072
Leave him alone.

431
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:31,282
- Stop it.
- Cool it.

432
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:36,745
- You know what this is?
- No.

433
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,623
For self-defense, look.

434
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:11,569
I told you.
He's an asshole.

435
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,195
Forget about it.

436
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:37,134
Is all that yours?

437
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:39,928
Yeah.

438
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:42,430
More or less.

439
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,308
I get hand-me-downs
from a cousin.

440
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,228
Adidas!

441
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,396
Lucky you!

442
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:53,899
"Made in Germany."

443
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,651
You want to try them?

444
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,361
- Can I?
- You can borrow them.

445
00:45:58,195 --> 00:46:00,113
Your dad's really cool.

446
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:04,492
No, they were a gift
from a friend of my mom's.

447
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:06,911
- From Buenos Aires.
- She has nice friends.

448
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:18,422
I'd like to meet one.

449
00:46:55,664 --> 00:46:58,208
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

450
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,502
- Come on, tell me.
- Nothing.

451
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:09,010
Tell your friend
not to eat everything!

452
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,099
Have a drink with me.

453
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:17,601
Come on!

454
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:25,442
Have a drink with me.
Come on.

455
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,826
You can keep it.

456
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:41,498
Go on, take it.
Your mommy isn't home.

457
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:09,829
Invite me again sometime.

458
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,540
Your friends are so chic...

459
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,543
I didn't hear you complaining
about the #filet mignon. #

460
00:49:15,543 --> 00:49:18,128
Not to mention the Chivas.

461
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:21,798
There's no better aphrodisiac
than a good whisky.

462
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,552
Stop it, you're too drunk.

463
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:28,930
- Don't be vulgar.
- I'll show you vulgar.

464
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,307
Let go. Don't touch me.

465
00:49:31,307 --> 00:49:33,642
The kids are asleep.

466
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,770
- You'll wake them.
- Vulgar?

467
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,273
- I'm the vulgar one now.
- Let me go.

468
00:49:39,273 --> 00:49:43,109
You know what? Your friends
are the ones who are vulgar.

469
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,527
Now they're vulgar.

470
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:48,531
Stupid sluts talking nonsense
and jerks who only care about money.

471
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:51,075
How much money they make...
Now that's vulgar.

472
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,994
At least they're proud
of something.

473
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,705
Proud of something?
Like you, right?

474
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,123
What does that mean?

475
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,584
- You know exactly what I mean.
- No, I don't.

476
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,128
If you have something to say,
say it. Be a man, for once.

477
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:08,299
Otherwise shut up.
- Just please don't involve Gonzalo.

478
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,510
You've gone too far
with this.

479
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,928
Me? I've gone too far with it?

480
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,395
Open the door!
Maria Luisa, open the door!

481
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:26,316
- Open up!
- No way. Sleep somewhere else.

482
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,416
Good morning.

483
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,043
It smells like men in here.

484
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:50,379
Who's he?

485
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:51,964
Afriend.

486
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:56,677
- What's your name?
- Pedro, ma'am.

487
00:50:57,553 --> 00:50:58,637
Pedro.

488
00:50:59,972 --> 00:51:01,848
I'd never seen you before.

489
00:51:02,974 --> 00:51:04,392
He's new.

490
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:07,312
In your class?

491
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:08,688
Yes.

492
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:18,655
You have beautiful eyes.

493
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,282
Thanks.

494
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,743
And you?

495
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,996
And you?

496
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:31,083
You trying to get away from me?

497
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:42,052
Did you have fun at the party?

498
00:51:42,052 --> 00:51:44,387
Not really. It was boring.

499
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:47,265
Liar.

500
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,143
Do you like the present?

501
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,728
- What present?
- Didn't you see it?

502
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:53,979
No.

503
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,028
This.

504
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:03,655
It's from Roberto.

505
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:06,699
Take it.

506
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:11,871
I'll leave it here,

507
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:13,622
in case you're interested.

508
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:16,750
Kids, time for breakfast.

509
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,297
Wow, look!

510
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:26,384
You're so lucky!
Let me borrow it.

511
00:52:26,384 --> 00:52:28,011
Not that one.

512
00:52:28,594 --> 00:52:30,513
You can borrow this one.

513
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:39,438
Okay, mister. There you go.

514
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,025
Keep it down, one at a time!
One at a time, please.

515
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:47,987
- 3 cans of condensed milk.
- 2 per family.

516
00:52:47,987 --> 00:52:49,614
My nanny said I could get 3.

517
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,741
Tell her to stand in line herself.

518
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:55,703
There you go.
Shall I wrap it for you?

519
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:58,038
That's 50 Escudos.

520
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:15,095
- Hey, snob.
- Hey.

521
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:18,056
- What's up?
- Just hanging around.

522
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:19,891
Condensed milk!

523
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:22,769
- Give me some.
- No, the can is not open.

524
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,729
- Come on, open it.
- No

525
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:27,232
- Guess which hand.
- I can't.

526
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:31,068
- Come on, you have two.
- I can't.

527
00:53:31,068 --> 00:53:33,154
- It's not open.
- Open it.

528
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:35,030
No, I can't.

529
00:53:49,252 --> 00:53:52,505
- Try it, it's delicious.
- Thanks.

530
00:53:57,176 --> 00:53:59,845
Stop it!
You're not breastfeeding!

531
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:03,098
Drink it slowly
so you don't swell.

532
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,017
Slowly.

533
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:10,855
Why go to school
if you don't learn anything?

534
00:54:10,855 --> 00:54:13,649
Besides, Peter's a lazy bum.

535
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:17,444
You don't need to study
to be dumb.

536
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:21,698
With all that money
the priests are wasting on him.

537
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:26,703
- What school do you go to?
- I stopped going.

538
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:29,664
I got bored. I have to work
and take care of the house.

539
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,249
What about your mama?

540
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,252
- No, she doesn't.
- Doesn't what?

541
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:40,424
She left.

542
00:54:40,674 --> 00:54:42,300
Where to?

543
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:55,396
Look.

544
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,067
Close your eyes.

545
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,577
You kiss good for a kid.

546
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:15,789
Did you like it?

547
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:22,879
You want more

548
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:33,722
Come here.

549
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:57,619
Asshole!

550
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,377
- Hi.
- Hi, Peter.

551
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:08,963
What was that?

552
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:12,633
Stop!

553
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:13,467
I need at least one

554
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:14,844
- to take home.
- You want some?

555
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:17,513
Come on, let him try.

556
00:56:20,432 --> 00:56:21,850
Have a seat.

557
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,169
Two lollies.

558
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:28,091
Thank you.

559
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:30,843
Hey, give it here.

560
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:35,264
Hey, give it here.

561
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:45,857
Hey, Machuca.
Come and get it.

562
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:48,151
Forget it.
I'll buy you another.

563
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:52,321
Listen to your girlfriend.
Women know best.

564
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:57,076
They're in love!
They're in love!

565
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,372
Peter, you want it?

566
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,291
Come and suck it.

567
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,209
Let go of him!

568
00:59:55,337 --> 00:59:57,256
You disappoint me.

569
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,178
You all disappoint me.

570
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:10,059
What kind of arrogance

571
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,812
has gotten into you?

572
01:00:13,646 --> 01:00:15,564
Look at yourselves.

573
01:00:17,066 --> 01:00:18,942
Please!

574
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:21,236
You.

575
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,072
You insist on acting like

576
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:26,116
an animal.

577
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,368
It's all about you

578
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:32,580
and only you.

579
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:34,623
And the others?

580
01:00:34,874 --> 01:00:36,709
Don't they count?

581
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:43,715
Hasn't this school
taught you anything?

582
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:49,762
And you.

583
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:53,599
You.

584
01:00:54,975 --> 01:00:58,979
You think you can gain their respect
with you fists?

585
01:00:59,313 --> 01:01:00,522
Tell me.

586
01:01:01,606 --> 01:01:05,693
What will you do
after you hit your classmate?

587
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,159
Will you strangle him
until he can't breathe?

588
01:01:13,576 --> 01:01:15,411
Until he's dead?

589
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,705
And then what?

590
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:20,582
Will you eat him?

591
01:01:23,835 --> 01:01:26,671
And you.
What's so funny?

592
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:33,886
That's enough.

593
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,556
- Your glass.
- Not the kids, Patricio.

594
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,850
Why not?
They need to learn.

595
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,018
Otherwise they lose control.

596
01:01:42,018 --> 01:01:43,311
That's enough.

597
01:01:43,979 --> 01:01:48,066
When I was a baby,
they'd dip my pacifier in wine.

598
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,193
That kept me quiet.

599
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:53,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

600
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:02,037
Dad, will you be traveling
more often?

601
01:02:02,037 --> 01:02:03,580
A bit more often.

602
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,749
Especially to Rome.
The FAO office is there.

603
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:10,002
- What language do they speak there?
- Italian, dummy.

604
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:12,630
Why?

605
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:15,424
He wants the Lone Ranger.

606
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:16,175
So?

607
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:20,053
- And you want a Neil Diamond record.
- Yeah, please, Dad.

608
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:22,973
- It's...
- So you want me to turn smuggler.

609
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:28,770
- It has a blue cover and...
- I could use a pair of new shoes.

610
01:02:29,187 --> 01:02:31,939
- Really?
- Really.

611
01:02:47,704 --> 01:02:49,622
Let's all move to Italy.

612
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:51,332
What?

613
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:53,292
Let's move to Rome.

614
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:55,794
I could easily get a transfer.

615
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:58,589
Considering the situation here...

616
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:02,175
It's not all that bad, but...

617
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:05,053
We'd be better off there.
I'd be making dollars.

618
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:12,018
Socialism may be best for Chile,
but not for us.

619
01:03:12,476 --> 01:03:14,645
Well, not yet.

620
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:19,650
- I mean it, let's move!
- Yeah, Mama. It would be fun.

621
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,610
You don't even speak Italian.

622
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,486
Who cares?

623
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:28,449
- What do you say?
- Come on, Mama!

624
01:04:46,104 --> 01:04:47,438
Mama! Mama!

625
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:55,446
What is it?

626
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:59,825
- What?
- There are people outside.

627
01:04:59,825 --> 01:05:02,994
They're hunting dogs
and killing them!

628
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:05,789
Calm down! It's all right.
There's no danger.

629
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,667
Go watch TV.

630
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:10,793
Go on.

631
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:13,587
Your mama'll be right out.

632
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:48,578
CIVILWAR

633
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:05,635
Gonzalo, I hope you have money
for the movies.

634
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:07,262
I won't pay for you.

635
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:09,472
- Of course I do.
- When I have money,

636
01:06:09,472 --> 01:06:12,266
I won't spend it
on stupid things.

637
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,977
I'll open a shop.
I'm sick of selling

638
01:06:14,977 --> 01:06:18,730
- in the street.
- I want to be a priest.

639
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:20,440
Like Father McEnroe.

640
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,317
A priest? What for?

641
01:06:22,317 --> 01:06:24,527
To help people.
Especially the poor.

642
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:28,781
You mean to help yourself.
For the cash.

643
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,367
What about you, Gonzalo?

644
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:34,328
I don't know.
Maybe a priest, also.

645
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:35,788
See? That's two of us.

646
01:06:35,788 --> 01:06:38,290
Are you crazy?
You two don't even go to church.

647
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,167
So? What does that matter?

648
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:42,544
It doesn't?
You know who a priest marries?

649
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:45,046
Priests don't marry.
- Yes they do.

650
01:06:45,046 --> 01:06:49,675
God. And forget about sex.
You guys are too horny for that.

651
01:06:49,675 --> 01:06:52,928
Look who's talking!
You're the horny one!

652
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:07,442
Come on, run!

653
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:10,278
I want to show you
something wonderful!

654
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,996
What a boring movie!

655
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,886
Gonzalo, look.

656
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:39,554
Gonzalo.

657
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,225
Look over here, man.

658
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:52,233
Stop reading that.
It's bullshit.

659
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:54,193
And you can't even dance.

660
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:56,570
White men and Indians
are never friends.

661
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,947
Sure they are.
It's possible.

662
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:07,497
- What do you want?
- Where's the money?

663
01:08:08,206 --> 01:08:12,001
- There's none left.
- Where's the rest?

664
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:14,628
Hold it, stay there.

665
01:08:15,296 --> 01:08:19,341
Hold it, stay there.

666
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:26,014
Come here.

667
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:29,892
- Give me that!
- Let go!

668
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:32,103
Let go! Let go!

669
01:08:33,604 --> 01:08:37,775
Shame on you!
Pushing me around like that!

670
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:45,448
Who's that?

671
01:08:45,824 --> 01:08:47,659
Afriend.

672
01:08:48,117 --> 01:08:50,328
Afriend, right.

673
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:54,165
Some friends you have.

674
01:08:58,961 --> 01:09:02,464
Know where your friend will be
in 5 years?

675
01:09:02,464 --> 01:09:04,507
Starting college.

676
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:09,011
And you'll be cleaning toilets.

677
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:11,806
In ten years,
your friend here

678
01:09:11,806 --> 01:09:14,975
will be working
at his daddy's company.

679
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:18,228
And you'll still be
cleaning toilets.

680
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:23,024
In 15 years, your friend will own
his daddy's company.

681
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:27,654
And you? Take a guess.

682
01:09:29,822 --> 01:09:32,992
You'll still be cleaning toilets.

683
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:34,827
Some friend.

684
01:09:37,413 --> 01:09:40,540
He won't even remember
your name by then.

685
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:44,002
- Your friend.
- I think you better leave.

686
01:09:44,002 --> 01:09:46,129
- Your friend.
- At this rate,

687
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:49,048
you'll just get
drunker and drunker

688
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:51,550
and in two years you'll be dead.

689
01:09:53,761 --> 01:09:55,804
Don't you dare touch her!

690
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:57,723
Let go of her!

691
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,975
Leave!

692
01:10:02,352 --> 01:10:04,270
Go find some booze.

693
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:11,068
Your friend better go home.

694
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:13,571
Go on, kiddo.
Go home.

695
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:16,115
You, go find your father.

696
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:17,866
Mama!

697
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:20,744
Go on, do as I say.
Be a good boy.

698
01:10:25,498 --> 01:10:28,042
Kids and drunks don't lie,
do they?

699
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:30,002
Sometimes they do.

700
01:10:33,089 --> 01:10:35,924
We praise you, oh, Lord.

701
01:10:36,842 --> 01:10:38,385
Dear parents,

702
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:44,057
I'd like to take a break
from the Gospel

703
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:44,974
to discuss

704
01:10:45,683 --> 01:10:47,602
what is happening

705
01:10:47,602 --> 01:10:49,479
here at the school.

706
01:10:49,896 --> 01:10:52,106
Father, I'd like to say something.

707
01:10:52,106 --> 01:10:54,358
The recent violent behavior
at the school

708
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:56,610
is unacceptable. My son gets in fights
every day. The new kids

709
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,862
are constantly

710
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:01,073
provoking our children.

711
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:10,540
Father. To a certain extent, we're all
responsible for what's happening.

712
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:13,375
Silence, please.
In my opinion,

713
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,294
the blame rests with you,

714
01:11:15,294 --> 01:11:16,211
Father.

715
01:11:17,087 --> 01:11:20,674
You're trying to brainwash
our children by mixing them

716
01:11:20,674 --> 01:11:23,635
with people
they don't need to know.

717
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:26,804
You're manipulating them,
and we won't stand for it.

718
01:11:27,513 --> 01:11:31,767
All parents were informed
in advance

719
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:35,104
about the measures
the school intended to take.

720
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:41,068
Those who don't like the school
can leave the school.

721
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:43,695
Why don't you leave,
you communist priest!

722
01:11:46,197 --> 01:11:48,408
Hold on, wait a second.

723
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:51,994
The father represents the sentiment
of a considerable group here.

724
01:11:55,873 --> 01:11:58,792
Those of us who want
equal opportunity

725
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,336
and a democratic education
for our children.

726
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:05,673
Go on, clap.
Father, this madness

727
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:07,550
will bankrupt the school.

728
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:10,469
We'll soon have returns
from the farm

729
01:12:10,469 --> 01:12:12,388
managed by the students.

730
01:12:12,888 --> 01:12:17,726
That will cover the small deficit
we're operating under.

731
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:21,563
Father, you know I donated
30 pigs to your farm.

732
01:12:21,563 --> 01:12:26,359
Pigs I brought from my own farm, which
the communists want to steal from me.

733
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:31,322
I heard the pigs are dying because
they're not receiving vaccinations!

734
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:33,282
These things happen.

735
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,159
It's part of the process

736
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:38,036
your children are going through.

737
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:41,206
Excuse me, Father,
for turning my back on you...

738
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:45,960
Look, I don't think
this is a good thing.

739
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,755
This sort of paternalism,
frankly,

740
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:53,634
because people don't want

741
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:57,012
to receive things...

742
01:12:57,012 --> 01:13:01,725
for free, without having done
something to deserve them.

743
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:06,020
- We've earned everything we have!
- They're hard-working people!

744
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,650
Paternalism is what you're doing,
speaking for others as if they couldn't!

745
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,818
I speak on behalf of

746
01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:15,070
a great majority of people.

747
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:21,785
Father, what's the whole idea
of mixing pears and apples?

748
01:13:21,785 --> 01:13:26,539
I'd like to know why it is
you try so hard...

749
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:29,417
Let me finish.
Why mix pears and apples?

750
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:32,253
I'm not saying we're better or worse,
just different.

751
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:36,965
When I was a child...

752
01:13:40,344 --> 01:13:41,595
When I was a child...

753
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:46,683
I lived on a farm

754
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,601
next to San Nicolas.

755
01:13:49,519 --> 01:13:52,355
My father took care of the cattle.

756
01:13:54,315 --> 01:13:57,192
If something happened
to an animal,

757
01:13:57,192 --> 01:14:00,028
it was docked from our food
at the end of the month.

758
01:14:01,113 --> 01:14:03,949
The reason didn't matter.

759
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:06,784
My father was always to blame.

760
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,580
I came here to Santiago

761
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,373
when I was 15...

762
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:16,085
because I didn't want my children
to be blamed for everything.

763
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,922
But I can see things here
are the same.

764
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:24,968
Everything is always our fault.

765
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:28,596
That's just how it is.

766
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:32,600
No one will blame you for
not changing.

767
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:36,520
Sometimes I ask myself,

768
01:14:38,522 --> 01:14:40,857
when will things change?

769
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:48,197
When will we dare
to do things differently?

770
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,827
That's my opinion.

771
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:56,163
Save your bitterness!
Get the hell out of here!

772
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:59,333
Get these Marxists out of here!

773
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:32,029
Nationalists!
- Present!

774
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:38,076
National Front,
freedom and country!

775
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:41,288
Nationalists!
- Present!

776
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:47,335
National Front,
freedom and country!

777
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:50,546
Nationalists!
- Present!

778
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:56,552
National Front,
freedom and country!

779
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,143
National Party flags!

780
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,979
Chilean flags!

781
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:29,248
Flags!

782
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:32,209
Flags...

783
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:34,587
SOCIALIST PARTY

784
01:16:42,135 --> 01:16:44,054
Communists, bastards!

785
01:16:44,054 --> 01:16:45,972
Living off the state!

786
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:47,890
Communists, bastards!

787
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,767
Living off the state!

788
01:16:51,602 --> 01:16:52,561
Maria Luisa.

789
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:56,398
- Why come if you're not protesting?
- Come on, make some noise.

790
01:16:56,398 --> 01:16:58,317
Okay, that's why I came.

791
01:16:58,317 --> 01:17:00,235
Living off the state!

792
01:17:00,235 --> 01:17:02,154
Communists, bastards!

793
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:03,989
Living off the state!

794
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:05,698
Here.

795
01:17:25,383 --> 01:17:26,301
Hey, you have to pay!

796
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:28,219
Pay me, you asshole!

797
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:30,721
Pay me, you shithead!

798
01:17:30,721 --> 01:17:32,973
Who do you think you are?

799
01:17:35,392 --> 01:17:37,936
Up yours, motherfucker!

800
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:50,781
Pablo, hi.

801
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,743
What are you doing here?
What if Patricio saw you?

802
01:17:54,743 --> 01:17:56,995
I'm married, not retarded.

803
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,169
You didn't bring my daughter,
I hope.

804
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:06,754
No, of course not.
See you.

805
01:18:09,549 --> 01:18:11,509
Who do you think you are?

806
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:12,468
What was that?

807
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,220
She spat on your car.

808
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,931
Hey, you little bitch!
Clean it up!

809
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:19,725
What's your problem,
you fucking snob?

810
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:21,518
Look what you did, you scumbag!

811
01:18:23,853 --> 01:18:25,605
Fuck you, snob!

812
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,400
Calm down.
She's just a kid.

813
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,321
She's just a kid!

814
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:37,407
Hey!

815
01:18:38,909 --> 01:18:41,036
You fucking little bitch!

816
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:43,538
Fuck you, snob!

817
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:47,125
I was sticking up for you,
you little shit!

818
01:18:50,962 --> 01:18:52,296
Go back to your shantytown!

819
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,923
Go back to your shantytown!

820
01:18:56,342 --> 01:18:58,093
You're all fucking snobs!

821
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:01,680
Go home, you scumbag!

822
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,890
You fucking lowlife!

823
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:04,612
Your mama didn't look happy.

824
01:20:12,411 --> 01:20:14,288
That was your mama?

825
01:20:16,332 --> 01:20:18,250
Was that your mama?

826
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,167
Answer me.

827
01:20:22,045 --> 01:20:25,298
Your mama is a real shitbag.

828
01:20:26,132 --> 01:20:27,383
The whore.

829
01:20:27,383 --> 01:20:29,093
Fucking snob.

830
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:30,970
Cocksucker.

831
01:20:31,178 --> 01:20:32,388
Cocksucker.

832
01:20:32,763 --> 01:20:33,973
Whore.

833
01:20:35,307 --> 01:20:38,268
Whore, whore,

834
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,525
Where were you?
Let's get out of here!

835
01:20:45,525 --> 01:20:47,277
What are you doing?

836
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:04,027
Are you crazy?

837
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:06,321
They're all dead, Father.

838
01:23:06,696 --> 01:23:08,281
They were sick.

839
01:23:40,394 --> 01:23:42,312
- Pack some sweaters, please.
- Which ones?

840
01:23:42,312 --> 01:23:43,063
All of them.

841
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,981
- Why? It's summer in Europe.
- End of summer.

842
01:23:45,899 --> 01:23:47,775
All of them.

843
01:23:50,987 --> 01:23:54,615
Don't, give me that.
A little girl smoking...

844
01:23:55,616 --> 01:23:57,993
Let her smoke,
she's old enough.

845
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:02,914
- Just one.
- Fine.

846
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:04,833
- Your ties?
- Yes.

847
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,297
What are you looking for?

848
01:24:12,173 --> 01:24:13,382
The camera.

849
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,384
Are you taking it with you?

850
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,720
Of course, it's a trip.
Rome, Italy, the Vatican...

851
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,306
I won't be working
the whole time.

852
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,516
4th drawer,
you put it there yourself.

853
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:25,435
You mean the 2nd.

854
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,312
The 4th, in back.

855
01:24:32,483 --> 01:24:34,360
- Shall I close it?
- Yes.

856
01:24:45,912 --> 01:24:47,789
Careful, careful...

857
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:09,225
Not so hard, asshole!

858
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:11,978
- What?
- You bit me, man!

859
01:25:12,686 --> 01:25:15,564
I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, sure.

860
01:25:20,277 --> 01:25:22,529
A kiss of mine'll make it better.

861
01:25:22,529 --> 01:25:24,739
Better my ass, you jerk!

862
01:25:25,782 --> 01:25:30,578
- Get off me!
- You ruined it for both of us!

863
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:32,830
You shithead! Why'd you go

864
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:33,914
and bite her?

865
01:25:33,914 --> 01:25:36,125
What have you got in your mouth?
A razor blade?

866
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,919
Learn how to kiss,
carrot head.

867
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:42,214
Don't tease the snob,
he might start crying.

868
01:25:50,429 --> 01:25:52,390
Give me my bike back.

869
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,350
Don't be stupid.

870
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:56,685
Give it back!
Give it back!

871
01:25:56,685 --> 01:26:01,189
- Thanks for the bike!
- No, give it back, shit!

872
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:05,026
Give it back!
Come on, give it back!

873
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,903
Give it back!

874
01:26:07,278 --> 01:26:09,238
Give it back!

875
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:12,074
Fucking rabble!
Sons of bitches!

876
01:26:17,788 --> 01:26:19,706
What did you say?

877
01:26:20,248 --> 01:26:21,792
What did you say?

878
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,877
My mother isn't a bitch.

879
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:29,799
Go on, hit me.
Hit me.

880
01:26:53,404 --> 01:26:55,281
My little boy.

881
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,457
Stop seeing that old fucker.

882
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:27,949
...bravely risking his own life,
the second person to enter the room

883
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:30,826
as shots rang
from inside the palace,

884
01:28:30,826 --> 01:28:33,787
stray bullets flying everywhere.

885
01:28:33,787 --> 01:28:35,664
Apparently the gun was

886
01:28:35,664 --> 01:28:38,542
a gift given by Fidel Castro
directly to the President.

887
01:28:38,542 --> 01:28:43,463
It is the gun he used
to kill himself.

888
01:28:43,463 --> 01:28:48,217
The inscription, "To Salvador, from
your brother in arms, Fidel Castro."

889
01:28:48,217 --> 01:28:52,013
Where exactly did you find it?

890
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:54,974
It was in Mr. Allende's hand
when we entered his office.

891
01:28:56,433 --> 01:28:59,269
Hello, Mama? Yes.

892
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:01,730
When will you be back?

893
01:29:03,398 --> 01:29:04,315
But Mama...

894
01:29:11,489 --> 01:29:12,406
Bye.

895
01:29:18,912 --> 01:29:21,790
The armed forces
have restored order,

896
01:29:22,332 --> 01:29:27,086
with unanimous support,
after having endured three years of

897
01:29:27,086 --> 01:29:28,713
the Marxist cancer.

898
01:29:28,713 --> 01:29:31,007
Eat your sandwich
and drink your milk

899
01:29:31,007 --> 01:29:32,550
No, thanks.

900
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:36,637
- Was Mama all right?
- Looks like it.

901
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:40,140
Both moral and social,

902
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:44,185
which could no longer
be tolerated.

903
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:46,896
The armed forces
and order itself

904
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:49,732
today have responded,

905
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:55,321
driven purely by
patriotic duty and nothing else,

906
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:59,491
to save the country
from the unyielding chaos

907
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:05,205
of Salvador Allende's
Marxist government.

908
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:07,582
Move on, faster.

909
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:08,499
Hurry up.

910
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:11,335
Go on, keep moving.

911
01:30:11,919 --> 01:30:12,837
Faster.

912
01:30:14,338 --> 01:30:15,256
Faster.

913
01:30:28,226 --> 01:30:29,143
Faster, keep moving.

914
01:30:30,394 --> 01:30:31,312
You, over there.

915
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:32,229
Inside.

916
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:41,279
Let go of me!

917
01:30:43,865 --> 01:30:45,450
You, inside.

918
01:30:49,996 --> 01:30:51,539
You, inside.

919
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,584
You, smart-ass!

920
01:30:55,584 --> 01:30:57,086
What are you doing
to the children?

921
01:30:58,545 --> 01:31:00,422
This is not a barracks!

922
01:31:21,316 --> 01:31:23,151
This is humiliating!

923
01:31:28,823 --> 01:31:30,366
Go on, keep moving.

924
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,874
Army bastards! Go back

925
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,125
to the barracks!

926
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,044
- You okay?
- What do you care?

927
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:40,639
Good morning, boys.

928
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,391
Ma'am.
- Good morning.

929
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,226
Mrs. Gilda,

930
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,688
you left this
in the Teacher's Lounge.

931
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,106
Thank you very much.

932
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,652
Boys,

933
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,946
I'm Colonel Sotomayor,

934
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:00,282
the new Principal
of the school

935
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:04,202
As you all know,

936
01:33:04,994 --> 01:33:08,039
strange things have been
going on here at the school.

937
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:09,957
Inappropriate things.

938
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,878
We're here to fix that.

939
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:16,922
To put everything in order.

940
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:22,928
So that once and for all, you can
devote yourselves to your studies

941
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:25,847
and nothing else.

942
01:33:29,684 --> 01:33:32,686
As far as the students
who don't pay,

943
01:33:33,354 --> 01:33:34,980
they should be advised

944
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,523
that we don't want
lazy people here,

945
01:33:38,483 --> 01:33:40,360
nor criminals of any kind.

946
01:33:41,486 --> 01:33:44,280
So we're gonna do
a little house cleaning.

947
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:50,036
As you can see,
the priests are gone.

948
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,496
And they should be forgotten.

949
01:33:53,205 --> 01:33:56,834
Which means if rumors about them
continue to circulate,

950
01:33:57,876 --> 01:34:00,712
I'll assume you're the source.

951
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:02,881
Is that clear?

952
01:34:02,881 --> 01:34:04,007
Yes.

953
01:34:05,091 --> 01:34:06,176
Good.

954
01:34:16,769 --> 01:34:19,771
Hang this in back
for everyone to see.

955
01:34:22,732 --> 01:34:23,984
The following students...

956
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,027
Hamilton,

957
01:34:27,236 --> 01:34:29,572
Kucevic, Orellana,

958
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:32,366
Vildosola

959
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,243
and Parraguez,

960
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:36,453
gather your things
and go to the office.

961
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:38,038
Right now?

962
01:34:38,413 --> 01:34:40,290
Yes, darling. Right now.

963
01:35:06,356 --> 01:35:09,192
- Where are they going?
- They're expelled, stupid.

964
01:35:20,535 --> 01:35:23,371
Remember, Lord, your Church
spread across the land,

965
01:35:24,748 --> 01:35:25,915
Pope John Paul,

966
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:30,127
and especially our honorable
government the Junta.

967
01:35:30,628 --> 01:35:33,881
Let your light guide them
as they rebuild

968
01:35:33,881 --> 01:35:35,799
this torn country.

969
01:37:06,507 --> 01:37:10,261
This place is not sacred anymore.

970
01:37:17,518 --> 01:37:19,436
The Lord

971
01:37:19,436 --> 01:37:21,271
is no longer here.

972
01:38:41,344 --> 01:38:44,222
Teachers, have the students
return to their classrooms.

973
01:39:32,099 --> 01:39:33,017
Mama?

974
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:36,770
Mama?

975
01:40:06,214 --> 01:40:08,049
Come in.

976
01:40:10,676 --> 01:40:12,595
How was school?

977
01:40:12,595 --> 01:40:14,805
Fine. Where's Mama?

978
01:40:15,556 --> 01:40:17,766
She went out.
She'll be back later.

979
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:20,435
And my sister?

980
01:40:20,435 --> 01:40:22,395
She isn't back yet.

981
01:40:23,647 --> 01:40:24,606
Go get changed.

982
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,317
I don't want the laundry
to pile up.

983
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:29,986
I'll make you a snack.

984
01:42:12,955 --> 01:42:14,832
Get out here,
you fucking communist!

985
01:43:03,335 --> 01:43:05,211
Fucking military!
Bastards!

986
01:43:16,013 --> 01:43:17,890
No, Juana!
Stay out of this!

987
01:43:20,142 --> 01:43:22,060
- Stay back!
- Shut up!

988
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,979
Can't you see I have a baby?

989
01:43:41,286 --> 01:43:46,207
You like flags, asshole?
Go on, eat them!

990
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,088
Hold this bitch!

991
01:43:54,256 --> 01:43:58,051
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastards!

992
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:02,681
Dad!

993
01:44:11,355 --> 01:44:12,273
Shut up!

994
01:44:12,273 --> 01:44:15,192

Turn around, dammit!

1003
01:45:13,746 --> 01:45:15,914
Where do you think you're going?

1004
01:45:15,914 --> 01:45:18,834
No! I don't live here.
I have nothing to do with it.

1005
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:22,045
- I live across the river.
- Don't lie to me.

1006
01:45:23,838 --> 01:45:26,758
Get moving!
- I don't live here!

1007
01:45:26,758 --> 01:45:28,593
Look at me!

1008
01:45:38,477 --> 01:45:40,395
Go on, scram.

1009
01:47:31,914 --> 01:47:34,458
You're supposed to die!

1010
01:48:13,369 --> 01:48:16,163
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Gonzalo.

1011
01:48:16,663 --> 01:48:21,459
...with a friend. We were eating fries
and everything spilled.

1012
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:25,255
On the table.
And they snubbed us...

1013
01:48:26,464 --> 01:48:29,300
No, don't step on the carpet!

1014
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,218
Over there, please.

1015
01:48:31,218 --> 01:48:33,137
Through that door.

1016
01:48:37,599 --> 01:48:39,518
Hi, sweetie.

1017
01:48:40,519 --> 01:48:41,436
Are you okay?

1018
01:48:42,437 --> 01:48:43,355
Are you happy?

1019
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:47,442
I'll be right back.

1020

FIFA TELLS THE WORLD
