1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
LITTLE WHITE LIES (2010)

2
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,832
I don't sting my nose.

3
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,483
You idiot.

4
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,583
I'm outta here.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,733
That's for girls.

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,400
Use the men's room then.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,795
You're tall.
I bone you yet?

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,941
My blow.
- All gone.

9
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,336
You fucker.
- It's all gone.

10
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,625
He's a total headcase.

11
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,025
Meet Ludo.

12
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,025
Ludo, this is Christine.

13
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,335
Not Christine. Christelle.

14
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,525
What?

15
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,733
Yours is mine and mine is mine.

16
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,983
That's not cool.
Cut it out.

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,083
You okay?

18
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,624
Hey, dude.
I called David.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,775
He's on his way.

20
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,733
This is rocking.
We're gonna burn it up.

21
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,553
Say, why don't you ever call me?

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,133
You never call me.
Straight up.

23
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,708
Chill out, bro.

24
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,375
I'll be right back.

25
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,941
You're going?
- For a smoke.

26
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,041
Eric bounced?

27
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,755
You're splitting?
- I'm beat.

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,250
See you soon.

29
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,375
How are you?

30
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,900
Nearly missed it.

31
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey.

32
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,583
Is Juliette coming?

33
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,941
I don't know.

34
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,041
I guess not.

35
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,150
What?

36
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,566
She won't come.

37
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,666
While I'm here.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Did she call? Did she...

39
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,285
Antoine, give us a break.
This is not the time.

40
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,150
Yeah, sorry.
I was just wondering...

41
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,800
I guess she'll come after I...

42
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,191
Where's Marie?

43
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,150
She said she'd be here but...

44
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,691
Pisses me off. She's always late.

45
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,025
Pain in the ass.

46
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,125
You mean me, doofus?

47
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,838
We can't all go in together.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,900
Or stay too long.
Let's split into 2 groups.

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Who's going first?

50
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I will.
- Me too.

51
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:58,312
We'll wait then.
- I'll wait too.

52
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,358
You guys?

53
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,275
Wait till they give you masks.

54
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,375
Hold on, Eric.

55
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,958
They're really strict.

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You been here long?

57
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,458
A half-hour.

58
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,625
I'm going for a smoke.

59
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:34,241
Did Juliette tell you if she'd come by today?

60
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,875
Ludo...

61
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We're here, buddy.

62
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
We're all here.

63
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,010
You gave us a hell of a fright.

64
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,375
It's gonna be okay.

65
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,958
You're in good hands.

66
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,458
Hey there.

67
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,550
Hi.

68
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,625
You...

69
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,916
You've got a mask.

70
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,125
You too.

71
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm getting out.

72
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,999
I'm getting out tomorrow.

73
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,708
You're...

74
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,957
You're all...
- Take it easy.

75
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,505
You're all dressed the same.

76
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,375
You're beautiful.

77
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,835
You too, you're beautiful.

78
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,791
Get some rest.

79
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,166
He'll be okay.

80
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,316
We leave him all alone a whole month?

81
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,358
Sabine'll be here. I called her.

82
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,483
As if she'd abandon her son.
But us...

83
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,583
We just go on vacation?

84
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,066
And leave him like that?

85
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,775
How can we help him, Marie?
We can't.

86
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,915
We can be there for him.

87
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:46,249
Or am I just being stupid?

88
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,301
You're right, it's...
- I agree.

89
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,608
It's mean of us...

90
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,683
I'm here another week.
I'll come by.

91
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,733
Hold on...

92
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,733
You all know,
Ludo's like a little brother to me.

93
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,275
Seeing him like that drives me crazy,

94
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,040
but what can we do? Not much.

95
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,316
Like the doc said,
he's in intensive care.

96
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,416
We can't even visit.

97
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,555
If anything happens,
like we said,

98
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,733
we fly right back.
It's one hour away.

99
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,553
Anyway, why'd anything go wrong?

100
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,900
I'll be away for 6 months afterwards.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,975
I want to spend some time with him.

102
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,316
You can all go and I'll stay here.

103
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,150
Or we shorten the vacation.

104
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,250
Good idea. I agree.

105
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,290
We take 2 weeks while he recovers.

106
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,691
So when we get back,
he'll be fit enough to see us.

107
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,791
What do you say, Marie?

108
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,025
That's okay, isn't it?

109
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,125
It's a good compromise.

110
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,290
How about it? Let's do that.

111
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,316
Sounds good to me.

112
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,191
Get off that.

113
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,483
Damn it.

114
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,691
I have to go.

115
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,650
I'm putting it out.
- You quit.

116
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
I gotta run.
- Where?

117
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,840
The Opera. My rehearsal.

118
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,608
See you later. I'll call you.

119
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,708
Bye, everyone.

120
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Lea's saying goodbye.

121
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,400
Deep breath.

122
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
That's good. And again.

123
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,125
Jeez, I love that.

124
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,333
It feels so good.

125
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,006
You're right, I was in agony.

126
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,900
You leave it till you're bent double.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,125
I know. I should drop by.

128
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,250
But right now...

129
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,566
Quitting smoking,
the hotel expansion,

130
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,165
that idiot waiter suing me,

131
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,733
the recession and now Ludo's accident...

132
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,510
And you're hardly Mr. Laidback.

133
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,625
You said it.

134
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,625
C'mon, flip over.

135
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,733
You at the hotel tonight?

136
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,043
With Véro and her sister.

137
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,525
Never mind.

138
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,625
Why? What's up?

139
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,441
I wanted a talk.

140
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,983
I need your advice on something.

141
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,143
It's important.
- Join us for dinner.

142
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,150
Or you preferjust us guys?

143
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,650
Yeah, but I don't want to impose.

144
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,275
I'll talk to her.

145
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,095
I'd be glad.
Her sister's a pain.

146
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,416
C'mon, on your back.

147
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,358
I'm always scared
she'll tell Véro I banged her.

148
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,900
Véro knows.
She told me about it.

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,733
That's massive.
Why didn't she tell me?

150
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,833
I don't know.

151
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,458
Let go...

152
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,733
You're tense, buddy.

153
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,833
Okay, one...

154
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,441
Two...

155
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,541
Relax.

156
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,108
If it's one of your orgies,
count me out.

157
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,525
I can't fool around.

158
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,775
Whatever.

159
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,816
Just keep the cousin occupied.

160
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,233
In case she's a skank.

161
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,333
I texted her, you know.

162
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:14,718
I said, I know how you feel.
Get the double meaning?

163
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:15,941
Pretty smart, huh?

164
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,816
Poor kid's having a tough time.
It's hard for her too.

165
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,775
Maybe I put too much pressure on her...

166
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,415
Then again,
her text speaks for itself.

167
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,983
It means something.

168
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,941
I never understand her texts.

169
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,983
Too many idiot metaphors.
She's a walking dictionary.

170
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,900
She's been toying with you...

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,400
...for months while
she shags someone else.

172
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
In your bed.

173
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,525
How you doing?

174
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,066
And you?

175
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,733
What's your name again?
- Virginie.

176
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,833
Antoine...

177
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,666
Nice to meet you.

178
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,566
Where's your cousin?

179
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:06,851
Missed her train. All the more for me.
You ever done a double?

180
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,583
You know, a DP.

181
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,832
Where are you going?

182
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,316
Forget it.

183
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,416
I shocked him?

184
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,083
Vincent.

185
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,916
Come quickly.

186
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:38,275
Go on...
Tell Daddy what you just told me.

187
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,108
I'm tired from making love too much.

188
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,441
That's good, son.

189
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,316
How many girlfriends now?

190
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,816
Nine.

191
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,976
Nine girlfriends?
That's huge, honey.

192
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,733
You're a real ladies man.

193
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,816
It's only natural.

194
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,983
These guys are stupid.
As if the recession just happened.

195
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,566
They open the paper,
Oh, a recession.

196
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,983
Look...

197
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,608
See the maitre d'?

198
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,468
When I bought this place, 65 staff.
38 now, same profits.

199
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,771
I have some stories to tell.
But you...

200
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,250
You wanted to talk?

201
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,268
I wanted your advice.
Actually, no...

202
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,330
How can I put it?

203
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,291
I'm having this...

204
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,541
It's pretty weird.

205
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,721
I'm not sure how to deal with it.

206
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,566
A babe?

207
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,666
No, it's not that.

208
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,791
Look...

209
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,941
It's hard to talk about it,

210
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,441
so please,

211
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,541
hear me out, okay?

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Wait till I'm done.

213
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,958
How can I say this?

214
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,541
It's just...

215
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I love your hands.

216
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,191
What?

217
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,291
I love your hands.

218
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,150
I don't know what's got into me,

219
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,585
but recently I get a strange feeling
when I see you.

220
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,145
Don't worry, I'm not gay or anything.

221
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,250
It's just you.

222
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,775
I mean...

223
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,525
It's only with you...

224
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,275
...that I get this feeling.

225
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,941
I'm trying to get a handle on it.

226
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,761
I mean, I've always admired you.

227
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,123
I like your personality.

228
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,756
The way you fight for things.

229
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
I even like your flaws.

230
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,445
You're there when I need to let off steam.

231
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,801
You're my friend, my confidant.

232
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,541
So now...

233
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,276
Now I love it when we hug to say goodbye,

234
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:01,316
or when we're watching a game...

235
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,066
...and we jump up in each other's arms.

236
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,461
Just that physical contact.

237
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:10,271
It's weird, I know,
but it gives me a thrill.

238
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,666
You're shitting me?

239
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,541
Max...

240
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,275
I was too young when I met Isa.

241
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,375
And now...

242
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,483
...she stifles me.

243
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,275
But when I'm with you,
I feel so good, relaxed.

244
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,605
Maybe I find your presence reassuring.

245
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,375
Honestly, I don't get it.

246
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,150
You've known me...

247
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,400
...15 years.
- Yeah.

248
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,983
In 15 years, I never felt this
for a guy. Not once.

249
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,650
You know me, right?

250
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,750
I know I'm not queer.

251
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,291
It's just...

252
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,708
I think I love you.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,608
Straight up,
I don't wanna kiss you...

254
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
...or sleep with you.

255
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,483
Maybe one day but...

256
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:09,238
Are you nuts or what?
What the hell is this?

257
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,358
You must be out of your mind.
What's wrong with you?

258
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,433
I'm your son's godfather. Get real.

259
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,691
Are you guys having a joke?

260
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,441
Max, please...

261
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:24,046
Don't react like this.
It only makes it harder for me.

262
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
I need your support.

263
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,958
As my buddy.

264
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,691
Not just as a friend...

265
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,066
My buddy.

266
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,166
You understand?

267
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:36,858
I don't know what to say.

268
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,233
Don't say anything.

269
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,983
It's okay if you can't find the words.

270
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,083
Just don't be scared.

271
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,191
Whatever shit you're pulling,
if this is true...

272
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,858
Max...

273
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,958
Please.

274
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,250
What?
- Pardon me?

275
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,790
Who's gonna do it? Me?

276
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,608
Tomorrow?

277
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,983
Don't put off till tomorrow...
Do it right now.

278
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,233
I don't understand.

279
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,358
Do it.

280
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,983
Mr. Cantara?
Your friend got the check.

281
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,083
Should I take it?

282
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,791
1 new message. Eric.

283
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,916
Cbll me. Usgent.

284
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,108
I was in a movie not so long ago,

285
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,025
with this guy I know, Philippe.

286
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,858
A skin flick,
but I had a few lines.

287
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,958
That was my first...

288
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,375
What do you want?

289
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,985
Are you kidding?
You asked me to call you.

290
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,650
No way.

291
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,900
What's wrong?

292
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When?

293
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:23,790
No way. Why do you always
call me to get you out of shit?

294
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,566
You're a maniac.

295
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,666
See ya.

296
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm on my way. Bye.

297
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,416
I don't believe it.

298
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:37,508
What's wrong?

299
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,840
A friend crashed his scooter.

300
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:44,138
He's in ER.
- Shit. I'll come with you.

301
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:45,441
That's sweet but...

302
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,358
Too fucking right I'm coming.

303
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,838
I just need to pee. You pay.

304
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,625
Come on...

305
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,196
A complete psycho,
you should have seen her.

306
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,275
What a bailer.

307
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,755
What are you up to? A drink?

308
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,275
No, no drink.

309
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,316
Why not?

310
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,191
I'm expecting someone.

311
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,691
Expecting someone?

312
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,791
Who?

313
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,441
Bye bye.

314
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,582
Fess up. Do I know him?

315
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,733
No, you don't.

316
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,150
He doesn't matter then.
Blow him off and let's go out.

317
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,250
I can't. Too late.

318
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:40,400
You prefer a new-age schmuck to me?
I'm on my way and I'm hungry.

319
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,191
Don't let your oldest friend starve to death.

320
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,233
Goodnight.
- Shame on you.

321
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,858
Goodnight.

322
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,150
Hey there...

323
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,733
I brought you flowers.

324
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,833
Thanks.

325
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,733
How are you?

326
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,833
Come in.

327
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,381
You okay?
- Not bad, actually.

328
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
A bit out of breath.

329
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,998
Can you get rid of that?

330
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,125
Sure, sorry.

331
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
What are you doing?

332
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,941
I thought we'd watch the movie together.

333
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,331
I'd rather see it alone.

334
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,208
I can dig that.

335
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,707
I prefer watching movies on my own.

336
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,025
I'll be off then.

337
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,608
'Night.

338
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,708
I'll see you out.

339
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,066
Sorry, it's not my thing.

340
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,166
I know, it's cool.

341
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,083
See you soon.
- Bye.

342
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,025
Don't butter me up the right way.

343
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,275
I know you architects.
Let's not waste our time.

344
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,108
Do the job or I'll find someone who can.

345
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,673
Think it over and we'll talk.

346
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,858
Yes, I'll need time to think.

347
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,566
That's what I said.
Goodbye, Mister...

348
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,666
Lother.
- Exactly.

349
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,958
Hey.

350
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,025
Look...

351
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,100
Can we forget all about last night?

352
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,591
I was dumb, blurting that out.

353
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,900
Sorry it unnerved you.
I had to say it,

354
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,608
that's all.

355
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,025
I promise.

356
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,816
I won't mention it again.

357
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,126
I mean, it's ridiculous...

358
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,441
You know I'm not queer.

359
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,150
I don't give a damn if you're queer.

360
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,191
Not so loud.

361
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,941
Sorry.

362
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,691
Try to understand.
You know what I'm like.

363
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,983
That's why
I want you to forget our conversation...

364
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,058
...before it wrecks our friendship.

365
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,011
I don't know why I said it.
So...

366
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,708
Please accept my apology.

367
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,316
And above all,

368
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,275
keep all this to yourself.

369
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:11,691
Max...

370
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,941
I don't want anyone to know.

371
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,041
Okay?

372
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,750
And lastly...

373
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,470
I'll understand if you say no...

374
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,876
Elliot, Isabelle and me...

375
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,358
Does your invitation stand?

376
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,623
Sure. Just cut out
the l-Iove-your-hands bullshit.

377
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,566
Get some help.

378
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,666
I already said I will.

379
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,143
I won't say another word, I promise.

380
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:43,816
I gotta go.

381
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:48,676
I need a new architect.
No one gives it to me up the ass.

382
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,025
Don't worry.

383
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,400
See you tonight?

384
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Sure.

385
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,418
Jesus, she's out of order.

386
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,900
My birthday and not even a message.

387
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,275
She left you
because you were scared she would.

388
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,670
Now what are you scared of?

389
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,233
Here, a little extra gift.

390
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,858
What is it?

391
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,316
My ad man pal's mobile. Call him.

392
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,541
Shit, I'm so lame. Sorry.

393
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,441
I forgot all about it.

394
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:30,316
So did he.
Why would he give a damn?

395
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,900
It's for you. Call him.

396
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,825
As soon as I settle the Juliette issue, okay?

397
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,733
Don't tell her I'm in the shit, will you?

398
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,383
We don't discuss you, Antoine.

399
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,666
You don't?

400
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,666
Thanks.
Just what we need.

401
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,816
Those guys keep staring at me.

402
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,941
Those guys over there keep staring.

403
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,691
It's weird,
people keep recognizing me.

404
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,021
Chill, you've only done two TV movies.

405
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,083
Owned, my friend.

406
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,525
She's right.

407
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,625
I'm just teasing.

408
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:09,717
Truth hurts.

409
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,666
Hey, Marie.

410
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,150
You're back, I see.

411
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,040
Yeah, I got back a few days ago.

412
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,458
How was the Amazon?

413
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,875
I shuttle back and forth.

414
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,967
Sure.

415
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,566
Goodbye, miss.

416
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,316
I don't get it.

417
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,416
They eat pussy.

418
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,640
She's not 14 anymore. Get over it.

419
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,708
You didn't know?

420
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,458
Excuse me.

421
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,316
Do you live in a cave?

422
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,983
She's not the first.

423
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,083
Get off her case.

424
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,691
I need a leak too.

425
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,691
Stop that. It turns you on.

426
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,608
You bet it turns me on.

427
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,358
I'll do it for you at home.

428
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,650
Are you nuts.
- What's the problem?

429
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,566
Don't joke about that.
- Not so funny now?

430
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,471
When it's your girlfriend.
- Stop.

431
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,001
I'd never have thought it.

432
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,625
To love.

433
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,750
To Ludo.

434
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,083
Pace e salute.

435
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,510
Hi, Brigitte.
- You're pathetic.

436
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,082
A real pain in the butt.

437
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,275
Hi, Brigitte,

438
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,858
how are you?

439
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,338
Good to see you.
- Same here.

440
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,875
Fuck it.

441
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,358
What?

442
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,668
That really pisses me off.

443
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,791
What? What's wrong?

444
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,675
Hi, Brigitte.
- Hello, Mr. Max.

445
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:55,867
What the hell's going on?

446
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,904
I don't understand.

447
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,275
How are you, Marie?

448
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,375
Good, Brigitte.

449
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,191
You got it the last 2 years.
- Last year was Ludo.

450
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,858
And I sleep with the kids?

451
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,958
Sure.

452
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,375
The bedroom?

453
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,400
Okay, but if Juliette comes...

454
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Don't start with that.

455
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,775
We agreed it was off limits.

456
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,941
If she does, I get the room.

457
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,358
Yeah, yeah.
- No. I get the room.

458
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,458
Yes.

459
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,650
I'm here 2 months a year.
What do I pay you for?

460
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,150
You remember how much I pay you?
572 euros. Per month.

461
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,816
You could do jack shit all year,
I'd never know.

462
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:46,900
But when you know I'm coming,
would it hurt to mow the lawn?

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,733
What?

464
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,233
Three days ago? Bullshit.
I know my lawn.

465
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,624
I don't give a rat's ass.

466
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:57,691
I arrive with my friends
and now what do I look like?

467
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,108
Okay, if it was only the lawn...

468
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,775
How many times have I told you
about the hose?

469
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,775
I knew it, yellow marks.

470
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,875
Listen to me, dipshit.

471
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,191
You can tell that other dipshit,

472
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,608
I want my lawn looking like Versailles,

473
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,358
or your company's going belly under.

474
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,441
Calm down.

475
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:20,775
It's just fine. I'll mow the lawn.
Where's the mower?

476
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,191
I have to pick up Véro and the kids
at the station.

477
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,650
Want me to come?

478
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,941
I won't be long.

479
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,041
Can we buy food?

480
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:31,512
Wait for Véro.
You know what she's like.

481
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,025
How are you?

482
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,275
Wow.

483
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,375
He's in a bad mood.

484
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,415
Véro? This is okay surely?

485
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,358
Fine, block up your arteries,
but not in my house.

486
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,733
And not in front of the kids.

487
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,816
And this for when we're rushed?

488
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,983
Rushed? We're on vacation.

489
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,066
You don't respect your bodies.

490
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,191
That's not chicken,
it's industrial.

491
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,816
Full of antibiotics.

492
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,733
Yeah, but it's cheaper.

493
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,025
Sure, of course.

494
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,275
Organic's more expensive, sure,

495
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,108
but you don't get sick.

496
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,778
Or boost
pharmaceutical companies' profits.

497
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:19,161
Anyway, when did we ask you
to pay for anything?

498
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,483
Very subtle.

499
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,583
Please.

500
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,096
Screw it, I'm buying it.
- Me too.

501
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,233
Can I take us into the beach?
- Sure.

502
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,150
I've been learning.
I pass my test in two days.

503
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,250
You can rent one then.

504
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,875
Jean-Louis.

505
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Run it up here, Max.

506
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,691
We'll anchor it later.

507
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,858
Sure?
The tide's going out, I'll be marooned.

508
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:04,191
It's a neap tide, you'll be fine.

509
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,858
Eric, I can't see a thing.

510
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:10,548
His tide book's from 1983.
I'm doing the ladder. Chill.

511
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,733
How are you?

512
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,691
Alright, Antoine?
- I'm good.

513
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,150
Look at this.

514
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,250
You put it in reverse?

515
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:21,321
Just back it up.

516
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,691
Bye bye, Maxie.

517
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,791
Shit. I knew it.

518
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:28,249
It's a motorboat, Max.
Use the motors.

519
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,958
See you tonight.

520
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,833
Hello, Jeanne.

521
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,832
Welcome aboard.

522
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,166
Hello, Jeanne.

523
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,166
Welcome on board...

524
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,650
Remember? He wrote that for you
when you were born.

525
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,750
Yes.

526
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:17,733
Jean-Louis wrote it for me
when I was a little baby, one year old.

527
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,833
Littler than that.

528
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,316
What can you say in Spanish?

529
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,608
She speaks to the au pair in Spanish.

530
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,650
Say something in Spanish.

531
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,525
Go on.

532
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,685
Marie never heard you speak Spanish.

533
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,025
Wonderful.

534
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,505
It's great here, Jean-Louis.

535
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,150
I think I'll buy you out and fire you.

536
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,250
You loser.

537
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:12,066
Getting speaking parts
has gone to his head.

538
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,400
Speaking parts.

539
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,108
Know what?
It's fantastic having you all here.

540
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,588
I miss my little Ludo but...

541
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:23,233
Yeah, it felt weird when we arrived earlier.

542
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:24,941
He was still living wild?

543
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,525
He was wired when he had the crash.

544
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,400
Marie and I keep saying
we should clean him up.

545
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
But do you do anything?

546
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,691
I don't snort that shit with him.

547
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,483
Hold on...

548
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:39,983
The crash was my fault?

549
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,999
He's saying we're all to blame.

550
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,566
He said I encourage him.

551
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,358
Don't be silly. He didn't say that.

552
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,008
He's just worried. We all are.

553
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,346
I'll get some crack for the kids.

554
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,458
Want a hit?

555
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,415
The Amazon? Your Indians?

556
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,458
Sorry, excuse me.

557
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,083
I spent all winter there.

558
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,456
It was great to go back.

559
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:15,249
I taped over 35 hours
of ceremonial laments,

560
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,400
sublime chants...

561
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,983
Didn't you get my photos?

562
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,749
Sure.
With you painted all over.

563
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,593
I love it there. It soothes me.

564
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,525
It has it all.

565
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:31,025
Except rosé.
So she knocks it back here.

566
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,916
Thanks.

567
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,483
Can I have a word?

568
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,048
What?
- It's really important.

569
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,233
I know it's off limits,
but I'm confused.

570
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,483
Don't tell anyone I showed you.

571
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,025
You left some of you with me.

572
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,816
You left something at hers?

573
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,733
She means I left a little bit of me behind.

574
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,108
I'm in her thoughts.

575
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,665
Alright, okay. So what?

576
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,566
So, do I reply?

577
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,108
Definitely not.

578
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,333
What? I don't even reply?

579
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:08,404
No, don't do anything.

580
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,125
You and Max fell out?

581
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,665
No, we're cool. Everything's fine.

582
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,833
Right.

583
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,082
Antoine, push. Come on.

584
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,233
I know it's off limits,
but look what she sent.

585
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,968
Don't tell anyone I showed you.

586
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,733
I don't reply, right?

587
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,191
Sure you should reply.
That's really sweet.

588
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,291
What do I say then?

589
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:53,341
You work it out.

590
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,108
Vincent?
I was looking for you.

591
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,208
I need some advice.

592
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,275
I'll just get some clothes.
- Stay.

593
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,265
I want to know what you think too.

594
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:21,816
Sit down a minute.

595
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,191
Just there.

596
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,066
I have something to ask you.

597
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,166
Go on, I'm listening.

598
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,956
Can you take a break?
I can't think straight.

599
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,708
Let's go...

600
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:43,691
It's really important.
I'd like to keep it between us three.

601
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,791
Okay?
- Sure.

602
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,116
The other evening,
after my birthday dinner...

603
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,125
I saw Juliette.

604
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,941
You'll need all the details
to form an opinion so...

605
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,691
Poker anyone?
- We're talking here.

606
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,916
Close the door, will you?

607
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,381
So, the night of my birthday,

608
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,540
after we said goodbye...

609
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,750
Is this your bag?

610
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:23,538
After we said goodbye in the street,
I went home.

611
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:26,777
Except I snuck out again to go see...

612
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,208
To go see Juliette.

613
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,191
Wanna play poker?

614
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,400
Plant 5 trees in the Amazon...

615
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,400
That's good.
- And 5 in Africa.

616
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,650
We'll party like this every night?

617
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,320
Hold on,
I'm trying to get cable on the TV.

618
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,650
Go say goodnight to your children.

619
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,300
And take a Lexomil on the way.

620
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,316
Jesus.

621
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,207
Costs me a fortune...

622
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:16,220
...and they cut me off
the only time of the year I use it.

623
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,041
What are you doing?

624
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,833
Listen.

625
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,833
What?

626
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:33,291
The weasels are back.

627
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,166
They must have heard you.

628
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:39,021
I thought they'd got rid of them.

629
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,931
The fuckers'll eat the insulation.

630
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,041
I'm jinxed right now.

631
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,208
You reap what you sow.

632
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,316
What?

633
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:56,581
Give out shit, you get it back.
It's only logical.

634
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,631
Send out more positive vibes.

635
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,108
What's up with Vincent?

636
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,233
What do you mean, what's up?

637
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,138
I don't know. You're not talking.

638
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,608
We do, we talk.

639
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:12,608
Really?

640
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:17,213
When you're alone maybe.
Everyone's asked me about it.

641
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,733
Don't bother knocking.

642
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,441
Fuck.

643
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,233
Eric, can we talk?

644
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,983
Sorry, I'm closed.

645
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,733
I've really screwed up.

646
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,525
I'm so in the shit.
I don't know what to do.

647
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,191
Let me explain...

648
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,775
I wanted to send her something,

649
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,108
a quick text, see?

650
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,400
No, I don't see.
I told you not to.

651
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,941
Yeah, but...

652
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,041
What did you send?

653
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,291
I was going to put...

654
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,941
I don't know how to express...

655
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:15,951
...how happy I am I left a bit of me with you.

656
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,457
Exactly. That's why...

657
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:23,640
I tried to delete it
and I accidentally sent 'I don't know'.

658
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,915
What was her text again?

659
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,591
You left a bit of you with me.

660
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,441
'You left a bit of you with me.'

661
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,541
'I don't know.'

662
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,971
What a numbskull, seriously.

663
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,791
Great move.

664
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,233
I told you not to reply.

665
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,316
Max, Vincent and Isa
said I should send something.

666
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,191
What did you just say?

667
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,108
What?
- You're taking the piss?

668
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,650
About what?

669
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,650
You bust my balls with top-secret texts,
then you go ask the others?

670
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,750
No, I didn't...

671
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:03,316
Know what, my friend?
Grow a pair. You're 35.

672
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,416
It's time to grow up.

673
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,025
Goodnight.

674
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,125
Yeah, goodnight.

675
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,775
Marie, can you tell Juliette.

676
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,190
I didn't mean to send her that and I...

677
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,333
You're kidding me.

678
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,125
Goodnight.

679
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,875
What are you doing?

680
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:38,413
Trying to work out
how the little bitches get in.

681
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:39,941
Who?

682
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,358
The weasels.

683
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:43,458
Listen.

684
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,583
Hear that?

685
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,249
Light on or off?
- Off.

686
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,583
They're asleep.

687
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:04,336
It's a pleasure to see you.

688
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,150
Great news, you all being here.

689
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,275
It'll bring much joy and happiness.

690
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,500
It's good to see you too.

691
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,008
Good morning, Max.
How are you?

692
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,396
Hi, Nassim.
- I'm overjoyed to see you.

693
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,191
How you doing?
- Fine.

694
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,983
Morning, Jeanne. Morning, Arthur.

695
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,566
What beautiful children.

696
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:33,066
I said to Véro,
it's marvelous you all being here.

697
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,150
We'll share some good times.

698
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,233
Coffee, Nassim?

699
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,816
No, thanks.
Vincent and I are going running.

700
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,608
He called me to say
he wanted to get some exercise.

701
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,441
Come along.

702
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:46,516
I'm going to the market with Véro.

703
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,191
Hey, Nassim.

704
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,586
Great to see you.
- You too.

705
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,708
Morning, Max.

706
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:53,733
How are you?

707
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,691
I was telling Véro and Max...

708
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:58,816
...the joy I feel seeing you all.
A real buzz.

709
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,233
That's nice to hear.

710
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:03,316
Congratulations on getting up
to go running.

711
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,775
It'll do you good.

712
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,255
Too right. Look at this gut.

713
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,835
Alright, ready?
- Let's go.

714
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,718
See you later.
- Enjoy your run.

715
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,250
Can you give me a hand?

716
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,025
Maybe we should wake them.
- At this time?

717
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,865
Comes a time you have to choose.
Bed or boat.

718
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:30,608
I don't decide the time of the tides.
After 10, it's too late.

719
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,683
We can go later.
What's the problem?

720
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,400
Why'd I buy the damn boat?

721
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
What's that?
- Nothing.

722
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:49,608
Do we need towels?

723
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:52,003
It's up to you. I took one.

724
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:55,906
We'll be on a boat.
There's water all around.

725
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,608
Stop it.

726
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,683
It bugs me.
All I do for you guys...

727
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,041
Stop being like this.

728
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,666
We're out ofjam.

729
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,816
Where's Véro?
- Waiting outside with the others.

730
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,316
Waiting for me?

731
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,275
I woke you 2 hours ago to take the boat out.

732
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,690
An hour ago tops.
- No. It's gone 2 p.m.

733
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,363
Lemme eat this, grab a shower,
and we'll go.

734
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,316
I'll just put some shorts on.

735
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:40,901
What's this?
- The hotel security cameras.

736
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:09,358
You're leaving that on?

737
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:12,108
Apparently,
music keeps weasels away.

738
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:15,353
We'll see how they like that.
Bitches.

739
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,625
Faster. Faster.

740
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,875
Awesome, Max.

741
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,483
Stop.

742
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,583
Slow down.

743
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,916
We can't hear you.

744
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:47,775
Fantastic.

745
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,170
You were great. Great roll.

746
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,965
I told you not to go so fast.

747
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,900
Bunch of assholes.

748
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,720
That's right, have a good laugh.

749
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,525
You okay, Marie?

750
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,400
Fine, you little shit.
Give me the ladder.

751
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,650
When you calm down,
we'll let you up.

752
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,300
I am calm. Give me the ladder.

753
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,733
Give me the fucking ladder.

754
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,733
Calm down.

755
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,941
I am calm. Give me the ladder.

756
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:16,483
You can come out when you calm down.

757
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,358
Calm down for real, please.

758
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,518
Stop laughing.
Give me the fucking...

759
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,316
No way I'm giving her the ladder.
She's on her own.

760
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,796
Assholes.
- I'll help you up.

761
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,791
Fuck you all.

762
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,733
Stop laughing.

763
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:38,332
That's right, enjoy it.
Take some photos.

764
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,240
I'll wipe the fucking smiles off your faces.

765
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,166
Thank you, miss.

766
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,166
She's gone.

767
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,358
I swear.

768
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,816
You've no idea how jealous he got.

769
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,775
You're putting me on.
Ludo? Why didn't he tell me?

770
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:43,441
You know what he's like.
You think he'd tell you that?

771
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:48,301
He gave me shit for months,
saying I had a thing for you.

772
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,958
Well? Did you?

773
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,208
To be honest,

774
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:57,540
if I wasn't with him...

775
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:01,040
I might have been tempted.

776
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,041
Sorry, Isa.

777
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,499
It's fine, no worries.

778
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,415
Amazing. I didn't notice.

779
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,915
I never picked up on it.

780
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,333
Too bad.

781
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,404
I'm going to bed.

782
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,166
Hold on, I didn't mean...

783
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,358
I meant,
if you hadn't been together.

784
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,025
I'm not upset. I'm glad, in fact.

785
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,941
But I need to sleep.

786
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,041
Okay.

787
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,166
Everything's fine, Marie.

788
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,608
You coming?
- I'll be there in 5.

789
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,525
Goodnight.

790
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:42,005
Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

791
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,191
Shit.

792
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,775
It's cool, don't worry.

793
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,875
He followed me one day.

794
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,983
I swear he did.
All the way to your house.

795
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,233
And?

796
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:56,525
You know when you sense
someone's there. I turned round...

797
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:59,858
...and he was there peeking round a corner,

798
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,566
like in a cartoon.
Incredible.

799
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,233
He'd lost it or what?

800
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,333
I totally busted him.

801
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:06,608
I bet he felt stupid.

802
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,708
No, it was cute...

803
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,391
Perfect.
Let's do one last maneuver.

804
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:23,725
Man overboard, starboard side,
north-westerly wind.

805
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,233
Excuse me...

806
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,941
I'm sorry.

807
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,775
Put that away right now.

808
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,275
Yes, but it's Juliette.

809
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:42,265
I don't care who it is. Slow down.

810
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
You're going too fast.

811
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,691
Shit.

812
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:55,791
What do I do?

813
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,066
It's really important.
I'm very sorry.

814
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,166
I'll be right back.

815
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,566
Not at all.

816
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,666
And you?

817
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,624
We take the boat out, go swimming...

818
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:32,921
Fun stuff you do by the sea.

819
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,333
Colt Silvers.

820
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:45,025
Can you pull over so I can buy some stuff?

821
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:49,375
Fine, I'll pick up some wine.
You guys put it away.

822
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,291
We'll buy our share.

823
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,108
It's not a problem. I was only saying.

824
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,208
Saying what exactly?

825
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,608
Holy shit.

826
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,708
I love that smell.

827
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,150
Marie, smell this.

828
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,715
I'll pass. I feel a bit sick.

829
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,983
Is something wrong?

830
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:29,333
It brings back so many memories.
I'm just so happy.

831
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:32,083
You need help.

832
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,916
And these, and that's it.

833
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,125
Hold on...

834
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:48,261
Then 3 grapefruit and 5 oranges.

835
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:52,358
Jeanne's a beautiful little girl.
Hasn't she grown?

836
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:54,458
Thanks, that's nice.

837
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,025
How about some plums?

838
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:03,100
I have a list.
I'll take care of it.

839
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,876
I'll wait in the car then.

840
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,691
Should I go back to Paris?

841
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,791
No, I just need time.

842
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,275
Right...

843
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,375
Okay.

844
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,250
Can you hear me?

845
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:13,955
They said I couldn't talk long,
so I'll be quick.

846
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:21,458
I just wanted to tell you
something very important.

847
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,708
Keep it in mind always.

848
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,460
You're a beautiful person.

849
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:35,398
You're a really beautiful person, Ludo.

850
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,140
There aren't many people like you.

851
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,733
Even if it was long ago...

852
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,833
...and even if...

853
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:53,025
...we caused each other a lot of pain...

854
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,915
I'm proud that I was your girl.

855
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:09,046
I also wanted you to know...

856
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:15,471
Although you must have noticed...

857
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,541
That...

858
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:25,063
I mess up with all the other guys too.

859
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,583
That's all.

860
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:41,166
Thank you.

861
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,458
Hey.

862
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,676
Feeling better?
- Yeah, I guess.

863
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,591
Still a bit pukey.
- Same here.

864
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,400
Lea's not with you?

865
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,441
She missed her flight.
Wasted journey.

866
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,624
Damn.
- Yeah, it sucks.

867
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:59,108
That's enough, cut it out.
You're nuts.

868
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,457
You'll wake everybody up.

869
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,333
Give it a rest.

870
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:08,608
I'll just put it away.
- Leave it. Put it away later.

871
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,708
I don't believe it.

872
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,266
Later, they'll be having breakfast.

873
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,333
Shit.

874
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,250
It's gonna leave marks.

875
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,983
You're taking the piss.

876
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,083
Stop that. Stop.

877
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:47,166
Speak French.

878
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,958
Did you forget Lea?

879
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:03,194
She's stuck at the Opera.
Rehearsals or something.

880
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,581
She won't be here today.

881
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,040
Max, what are you doing?

882
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,400
Working out where they get in.

883
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,665
They'll leave prints in the sand
and then I can...

884
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Why not go for a run?

885
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,175
Come on, it clears your mind.
You feel great afterwards.

886
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,900
I'm not changed.
I'll keep you waiting.

887
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,316
You go ahead.

888
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,733
We'll wait for you.

889
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,833
We're in no hurry.

890
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:44,208
Go on, just for me.

891
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,108
Can I come too?

892
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:53,208
Vincent never lets me.

893
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:54,775
As if.

894
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,275
Of course, you're welcome to join us.

895
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,816
More people, more energy.

896
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:01,381
Great. I'll just get changed.

897
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,733
Core exercise is crucial.

898
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:08,608
Your muscles will thank you for it.

899
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,525
You're doing them a favor.

900
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,983
Take in only the air you need.

901
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:17,503
Keep your breathing in sync
with your stride pattern.

902
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,275
There you go.

903
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:26,275
Even better is not to think about it.

904
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,670
I wasn't thinking about it.

905
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:38,191
I'm not used to those skis.
I couldn't slalom.

906
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,650
What are you doing?

907
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,790
Vincent hasn't had a go.

908
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,400
It doesn't matter.

909
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,941
You wanted to.
- It's fine, forget it.

910
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:49,025
Let's get moving before the tide goes out.

911
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:52,525
Yeah, with Ericjust now,
it wasn't very deep.

912
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:55,400
We'll go out tomorrow.
- No problem.

913
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,816
After 2 hours,
2 minutes won't hurt.

914
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,108
I wanted a drink with you guys.

915
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:03,268
Let Jean-Louis drive your boat then.

916
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,900
Alright, come on.

917
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,483
Don't worry, it's cool.

918
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,191
I said I'd take you.

919
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:11,291
Go on, Vincent.

920
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:16,083
Go on, Dad.

921
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:20,651
Thanks, Max.
- Let's clear up ready to go.

922
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:29,316
What's going on?

923
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:30,400
Anything wrong?

924
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,625
Can you all move forward?

925
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,958
Watch out.

926
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,816
Careful, on your left.

927
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,691
We're going aground.

928
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,791
Right, Jean-Louis.

929
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,750
Now straight ahead.

930
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,858
Get a move on.
Or we'll end up on a sand bank.

931
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,900
Get behind me, in my wake.

932
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,650
Let me pick up the others.

933
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:04,150
No time, you'll end up high and dry.

934
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,816
C'mon, let's go.

935
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,916
Move it.

936
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,583
Not that way, Max.

937
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,041
What a jerk.

938
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:04,525
Wait a second.

939
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,625
You've run aground.

940
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:09,456
Can't you give me a tow?

941
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,290
Too late. I'll be stranded too.

942
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,441
Just sit tight for 6 hours...

943
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,261
...until the tide comes back in.

944
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,926
You did this on purpose.
- What?

945
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:26,763
We gotta go.
To get the kids back.

946
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,848
Hold on, I'm coming.

947
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:32,108
Don't jump in.
- Shut up.

948
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,900
Don't jump.

949
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,108
It's mud.

950
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:37,191
I'm not staying here 6 hours.

951
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:40,521
You're being ridiculous.
Don't do that.

952
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,275
Shit, I'm stuck.

953
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,941
Watch out, you'll sink in.

954
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,733
Listen to Jean-Louis,

955
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,275
he knows his mud.

956
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,375
Come on, cut the crap.

957
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,083
Give me your hand.

958
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:55,175
Give me your hand.

959
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,316
Stop.

960
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:02,476
What's wrong?
- I'm losing my shorts.

961
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,525
Let go of me.

962
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,625
Cute butt.

963
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,941
Towel.

964
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:19,041
Give me the towel.

965
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:25,691
You did this on purpose.
- What's wrong with you?

966
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,525
A week ago,
you say you love my hands.

967
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,858
Now you get us stranded overnight.

968
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,150
No more, okay.

969
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,800
How could I have planned this?

970
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:40,066
2 years ago, for my coccyx,
you didn't need to use your finger.

971
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:42,816
The time you stuck your finger in my ass.

972
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,608
There must've been another way.

973
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,566
Stop this now...
- Get away.

974
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,191
It wasn't my fault.

975
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:51,316
In the bow.
- He told you to stay behind him.

976
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:53,416
Get lost.

977
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,836
Why didn't we ever hook up?

978
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,108
Here we go again.

979
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,208
Go on, tell me.

980
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:36,213
Every time you get dumped...

981
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:41,345
Bullshit. I haven't been dumped.

982
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:43,666
You don't fool me.

983
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,816
Pull that with the others, not me.

984
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:49,041
I think they know anyway.

985
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:54,458
Don't you wanna talk?

986
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,791
We can talk it over.

987
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:03,631
I look like Ludo, that's why.

988
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,400
C'mon, why not me?

989
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,400
You fuck anybody but me.

990
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,566
What's with you?

991
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:17,321
It's dumb,
we've known each other for years.

992
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:19,778
Exactly. I like it that way.

993
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:25,261
If we 'fuck', what happens then?

994
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Stop that.

995
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:34,128
We're best buddies, we get on great,
what's with you?

996
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:41,350
I'd get on your nerves.
You know me.

997
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,380
Okay, a blowjob if you want.

998
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:11,986
Thanks, we really appreciate it.
Goodnight.

999
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,290
You're back? How was it?

1000
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,880
Okay? You weren't too bored?

1001
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:48,030
It's non-stop.
You're right about the noise.

1002
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,548
What are you doing with that?

1003
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,208
Hello there.

1004
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,066
Well?

1005
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,166
That's right.

1006
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,483
I don't know...

1007
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,583
I'm at a loss.

1008
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,456
He'll wake the kids too.

1009
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:08,941
I'm sorry.

1010
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,041
I'll talk to him.

1011
01:16:11,091 --> 01:16:13,091
That's not a good idea.

1012
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:15,941
What's he doing?
- Busting the wall.

1013
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:18,041
To catch one, I guess.

1014
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,875
He hasn't slept all week.

1015
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,750
It's therapeutic.

1016
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:36,250
Sorry.

1017
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,875
What do you say now?

1018
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,720
Hello.
Not so noisy now, are you?

1019
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,875
It's the landlord.

1020
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,085
What's the story with Max?

1021
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,750
Look at me.

1022
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:39,983
Hold on, don't move.

1023
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,083
I'll be right back.

1024
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,083
I don't give a hoot.

1025
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,733
You okay?
- No.

1026
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,833
I can't sleep.

1027
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,275
I feel just great.

1028
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,900
I've decided to stop pressuring her...

1029
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,108
...and play it cool,

1030
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:48,013
like I have a life too, you know?

1031
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,541
You're going to bed?

1032
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,890
Is our age difference the problem?

1033
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:25,416
You gave me a fright.

1034
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:29,066
I need to borrow some shorts. Can I?

1035
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:30,358
What for?

1036
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,458
To play soccer.

1037
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:35,941
Jesus.

1038
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:37,025
Where is everybody?

1039
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,483
At the beach. It's gone 4.
Nobody got any sleep.

1040
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,583
Is Véro mad at me?

1041
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:44,588
She'd like you to chill out.

1042
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:47,499
Hold on, wait for me.

1043
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:50,338
Sam. What the hell was that?

1044
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,150
Go back to playing marbles.

1045
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:56,250
Try running.

1046
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,708
Tackle him.

1047
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,941
Let's get some focus.
Game faces on.

1048
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,251
You know what we gotta do.

1049
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,791
Bunch of losers.

1050
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,025
Where were you?

1051
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,441
We're in shirts.
- I didn't see you.

1052
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:25,836
Look.
- Mark the little guy.

1053
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,791
Your waitress is here.

1054
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,625
Follows me everywhere.

1055
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,983
I shouldn't have banged her.

1056
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:37,733
She was born in '87.

1057
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,833
I was in 9th grade.

1058
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,191
Sorry.

1059
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:29,266
Cut that out or I'll clock you one.

1060
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:39,761
My friends. Good evening to you.

1061
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:44,916
Hi, beautiful.

1062
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,025
I never saw you in shoes.

1063
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,650
Very true.

1064
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,941
What's going on?

1065
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:50,816
Those feet.

1066
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:53,466
You get shoes made to measure?

1067
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:56,525
Morning, ma'am.
Flip-flops, size 76, please.

1068
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,150
You idiots.

1069
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,250
I went to see Ludo.

1070
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,750
Go on, how is he?

1071
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,041
I got a real shock.

1072
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:12,051
I didn't think it was that bad.

1073
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:16,108
He's out of it,
but the doctors are optimistic.

1074
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,858
I doubt he recognized me.

1075
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,253
You made the trip in a day?

1076
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,583
Sure.

1077
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,251
Let's drink to his health.

1078
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,798
Sorry, I started without you.

1079
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:07,290
Did he open his eyes at least?

1080
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:10,525
A bit, but he's totally drugged up.

1081
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,625
But are you sure...

1082
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:14,941
He's gonna be okay.

1083
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:16,316
Say, Marie...

1084
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:18,626
Look at me. He'll be okay.

1085
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:20,717
He'll pull through.

1086
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,756
It'll be okay.
Here, eat this.

1087
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,566
A wonderful place you have, Max.

1088
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:34,483
Thank you for your generosity...

1089
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:36,623
...and your hospitality.

1090
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:42,886
Yeah, it's a killer house. Sick.

1091
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,150
What did I say?

1092
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,800
Words are important, you know.

1093
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:53,233
They have real influence on things.

1094
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:55,816
By calling things sick,
they become so...

1095
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:57,400
...in the bad sense.

1096
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,441
You see?

1097
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:00,566
Sure.
Use words for what they mean.

1098
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,191
And what they imply.

1099
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:06,691
There's an amazing experiment
by a Japanese guy, Masaru Emoto.

1100
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,983
He filled two jars with rice.

1101
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:11,566
He labeled the first one I Love You...

1102
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,858
...and the other one I Hate You.

1103
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:16,275
He kept saying those words to them.

1104
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,816
After a certain amount of time,

1105
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:21,858
the l-Iove-you rice was still edible,

1106
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,983
but the other rice was rotten.

1107
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:27,483
I cooked some rice.
Let's try it. It's awesome.

1108
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:31,275
That's why people talk to plants
or play them music?

1109
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:33,275
Exactly.
- It's wonderful.

1110
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:34,400
Amazing.

1111
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,525
But rice isn't an actual plant.
- Sure it is.

1112
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:39,775
It's not a living organism,
it's hard.

1113
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:44,635
I never get on with new-age types.
That's why I like you.

1114
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:04,481
A guy I know has driven from Paris
to see me. He'll be here soon.

1115
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,733
I didn't ask him to come.

1116
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,833
A guy? What guy?

1117
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,608
What do I tell him when he shows up?

1118
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,566
Tell him to fuck off. Simple.

1119
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:17,483
Let the poor guy stay the night,

1120
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:20,275
600 km to see you,
you can't let him camp out.

1121
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,375
Where's he gonna sleep?

1122
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,583
Up a hole. Sorry.

1123
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:28,930
There's the laundry or the couch.

1124
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,666
In my room.

1125
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:35,250
A quick shag never hurts.

1126
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,851
Especially as he's a very good shag.

1127
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:41,291
Great, it'll do you good.

1128
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,066
Your body will thank you for it.

1129
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:46,206
You're doing it a favor.

1130
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:51,583
He won't let that one go.

1131
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:53,654
Yeah, I know.

1132
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I call him then?
- Sure.

1133
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,650
Pisses me off.

1134
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,525
And the temperature in winter?

1135
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,691
12° a day.

1136
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:06,791
12°?
- Every day.

1137
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:08,858
Does it ever hail here?
- Of course.

1138
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,150
Twice we had hail.
In '67, I think...

1139
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,066
...1, 2, 3, sun's up.

1140
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:16,775
It works like clairvoyance.
Animals use it a lot.

1141
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,775
For example, in Hiroshima,

1142
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:22,233
the rats left the city
before the bomb even dropped.

1143
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:25,483
Like the tsunami.
Animals bailed before it hit.

1144
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:28,108
Why didn't we feel the tsunami coming?

1145
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:31,775
Humans don't listen
to their intuitions and premonitions.

1146
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:33,941
You have to learn to listen.

1147
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:37,900
Humanity lives by answering questions
it hasn't asked.

1148
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,740
I'm lost.
I feel dumb and that drives me mad.

1149
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:44,763
Your musical sex toy has arrived.

1150
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,915
Hey. You want some help?

1151
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:49,461
You enjoy scamming my kids?

1152
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:52,333
You're way out of line.

1153
01:26:52,425 --> 01:26:55,025
You think I didn't notice, you cheat?

1154
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:59,035
You say 1, 2, 3, sun's up.
Then you turn round.

1155
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:02,573
You go 1, 2, turn round,
then 3, sun's up.

1156
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:05,766
Cut it out.
No more bullshit tricks.

1157
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Bedroom. Now.

1158
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:11,625
Bedroom.

1159
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,375
Good evening.

1160
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,916
He was cheating.

1161
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:05,483
Are you out of your mind?
Do you realize what you just did?

1162
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:06,816
He was cheating.

1163
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:09,025
He's a child. 6 years old.

1164
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:12,780
Your godson.
Look at me when I bawl you out.

1165
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,108
I'm sick of it.

1166
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:17,525
Sick of your long face,
your pathetic hang-ups.

1167
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,858
Your weasels, your tide times.

1168
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:23,783
Relax or go back to work.
Give us all a break.

1169
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:28,566
Don't invite your friends
if it turns you into the great dictator.

1170
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:31,150
Honestly,
you're acting like a real prick.

1171
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,375
Even I begin to wonder...

1172
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:36,650
It's simple.
Stop making our lives hell...

1173
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,320
...or I'll go back to Paris with the kids.

1174
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:49,458
Why am I like this?

1175
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:53,238
Go and apologize.
You'll see, it won't hurt.

1176
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,250
What are you doing?

1177
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:09,923
Don't leave, it's ridiculous.

1178
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,250
Can we talk?

1179
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,875
Please, put that down.

1180
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:17,691
What's with you guys?

1181
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,791
I've no idea, honestly.

1182
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,066
You ignore each other...

1183
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:23,650
...and neither knows why?

1184
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:27,108
I'm sorry,
he always gets his panties in a wad.

1185
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:31,968
He went too far, yelling at Elliot.
It's better if we go.

1186
01:29:32,055 --> 01:29:36,050
I can afford our own vacation.
I don't need him.

1187
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,733
He can be a pain in the ass,

1188
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,941
but you know he's a great guy.

1189
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:44,733
Something's bugging him
and he won't talk.

1190
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,833
Can I talk to you?

1191
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,958
Forget it.

1192
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:18,983
Let's have a drink.

1193
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:21,083
You're shitting me?

1194
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,581
Is that all you can say?

1195
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:27,775
It's not easy.
You started all over at the soccer game.

1196
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:31,105
I can't read you and it freaks me out.

1197
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,858
Try to understand,
I can't take any more.

1198
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:38,650
I try to make it a great vacation.
I take care of everything...

1199
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:42,066
...and, whatever I do,
I'm the pain in the ass.

1200
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,400
I can't relax.

1201
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Stop it, Max.

1202
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:49,941
Every year you say that,
then you invite us all again.

1203
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,041
That's not the issue.

1204
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:54,775
Look how you chewed out Elliot.

1205
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:58,020
He's a kid.
Leave him out of all this.

1206
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:00,166
Yes, I know.

1207
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:02,275
I was a jerk.

1208
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,375
I'm really sorry.

1209
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,431
I'll watch what I say from now on.

1210
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:10,775
C'mon...

1211
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:12,233
Stay.

1212
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,883
We'll start over from scratch.

1213
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,066
I'm warning you...

1214
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:21,691
It's the last time.
- I promise.

1215
01:31:21,791 --> 01:31:24,511
But, please, you cut it out too.

1216
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,666
Okay.

1217
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,083
What kind of musician?

1218
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:45,775
Musician.

1219
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,875
That's yourjob?
- Yes.

1220
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:52,191
Like you do nothing else?
- No.

1221
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:53,441
Awesome.

1222
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,541
Yeah, I'm lucky.

1223
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:58,041
That blows me away.

1224
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Franck.

1225
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:04,260
Sorry to barge in.
- No problem.

1226
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,791
Elliot, I'm sorry.

1227
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:11,941
I shouldn't have talked that way.

1228
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:14,816
I shouldn't have yelled at you, see?

1229
01:32:14,916 --> 01:32:16,358
I apologize.

1230
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,458
Okay.

1231
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm on-edge right now.

1232
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:26,456
I know it's not an excuse
and it's not your fault.

1233
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,833
It won't happen again.

1234
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:35,691
Definitely not.
Let's go, kiddo, bedtime.

1235
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,108
Goodnight, sweetie.

1236
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,208
Say goodnight.

1237
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:49,973
Where's Jean-Louis?
- He went home.

1238
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:54,751
Say goodnight to the kids.

1239
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:58,457
I need a drink.
- Me too.

1240
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:02,423
What kind of ax have you got?

1241
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:04,958
A J-45.

1242
01:33:05,029 --> 01:33:06,233
Gibson.

1243
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,798
You wanna play by any chance?

1244
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:54,983
That must be unbelievable in concert.
Just acoustic, it was fabulous.

1245
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,083
Don't you think?

1246
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:01,333
How about another?

1247
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,625
I don't know.

1248
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:07,791
Just a quick one.

1249
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,666
Encore. Encore.

1250
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:43,416
They're nuts.

1251
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:48,458
We want more.

1252
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:11,691
Good, you moved the table in.

1253
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:14,775
You didn't get soaked?
- No, we're fine.

1254
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:17,425
It'll blow over with the tide.

1255
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,233
Did you sleep well?

1256
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,374
Yes, I slept fine.

1257
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:42,976
What will it be, Franck?
Tea? Coffee?

1258
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,358
Coffee'd be great.

1259
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,066
Coffee for me too, please.

1260
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:48,166
I know that.

1261
01:38:02,666 --> 01:38:05,400
I got a gift for Jean-Louis.
- Why?

1262
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,500
For yesterday.

1263
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:14,566
We could drop by for lunch.
I'll call him.

1264
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:16,666
You wanna come?

1265
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,625
I don't know.

1266
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,691
It's amazingly beautiful.
You have to meet Jean-Louis.

1267
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:26,191
Like I said,
I've known him for years.

1268
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:28,775
My dad worked at a wholesale market...

1269
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,566
...and every summer
he sent me to Jean-Louis's dad's...

1270
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:34,775
...to work in the oyster farm.

1271
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:38,400
At 5 every morning
I sailed past these beautiful houses,

1272
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,985
and said to myself,
One day, I'll buy one.

1273
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:55,303
I'll be going. I don't want
to get back to Paris too late.

1274
01:38:58,541 --> 01:39:00,358
Son of a bitch motherfucker.

1275
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:04,233
Screw you, asshole.
Blow me, you degenerate bastard.

1276
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:06,333
You stink, asswipe.

1277
01:39:08,666 --> 01:39:10,666
It's our...

1278
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:21,770
Shit-stinking, motherfucking scumbag.

1279
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:27,248
I like you.
I'll give you lots of hugs and kisses.

1280
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,733
You okay?

1281
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,833
I'm okay.

1282
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,941
You can come to Jean-Louis's.

1283
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:44,081
Thanks, but I'll be off.

1284
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:47,416
It's up to you.

1285
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,895
I shouldn't have rocked up like this.

1286
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:55,525
I had to do all I could to find out.

1287
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:57,625
And I found out.

1288
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,250
I'm not mad at you.

1289
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,708
I respect you totally.

1290
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:11,066
Even if I really, really love
making love with you,

1291
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:13,886
there's a time when I need more.

1292
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:23,733
6 months we've been sleeping together,
when you're around...

1293
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:24,816
I see now.

1294
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:27,466
I can't share things with you.

1295
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,500
It's no big deal.

1296
01:40:37,416 --> 01:40:40,136
What is, is.
But it's not for me.

1297
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Let's end it now.

1298
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:46,540
I don't want to get hurt.

1299
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,708
Or hurt you.

1300
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:00,608
Your guitar.

1301
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:01,941
It's yours.

1302
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:03,858
I can't play.

1303
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:06,253
It'll be a chance to learn.

1304
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,125
Take care of yourself.

1305
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,833
Say goodbye, Elliot.

1306
01:41:21,916 --> 01:41:24,041
It was great meeting you.

1307
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:27,393
See you soon.
- You have real talent.

1308
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Have a good trip.

1309
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,025
Drive safely.

1310
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:36,125
Yeah, thanks.

1311
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,691
He's really got something.

1312
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:53,400
I'm no judge of music, but he's got
more than one string to his bone.

1313
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,457
Stop, please. Stop it now.

1314
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:57,900
We're just saying...

1315
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,165
I don't need your opinion of him.
I don't want it.

1316
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:06,585
That's off limits too now.

1317
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:12,608
What do we have to do?
Blow things up? Block the roads?

1318
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:16,275
It's crazy.
You haven't heard the last of this.

1319
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,375
Yeah, right. Thanks.

1320
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:21,375
Fucking asshole.

1321
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:23,583
Everything okay?

1322
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,608
Don't ask. Who wants a drink?

1323
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:29,003
I've got something for you.

1324
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:33,306
C'mon, it's time for his surprise.

1325
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:37,000
Hold on, just a second...

1326
01:42:48,916 --> 01:42:51,466
You're nuts. I won't use that.

1327
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:55,400
To reach your boat in the morning.
4-stroke...

1328
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,900
My motor's right here.

1329
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,400
The day I stop rowing, it's over.

1330
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
Thanks anyway, Max.

1331
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,500
Why'd you buy me that?

1332
01:43:10,625 --> 01:43:12,625
No reason.

1333
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:30,708
Like your present?

1334
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:33,833
When does Lea arrive?

1335
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,250
She's got rehearsals.

1336
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:39,391
She's dancing in the new show by...

1337
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:40,691
Découflé.

1338
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:42,791
He is just so talented.

1339
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,125
You heard about Juliette?

1340
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:51,333
What?

1341
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:06,316
Any news?

1342
01:44:06,416 --> 01:44:09,901
This morning,
she said she'd call me in 5.

1343
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:18,771
Sounds complicated,
Lea and her flight.

1344
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:21,958
A real struggle.

1345
01:44:23,416 --> 01:44:25,416
Yeah...

1346
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:33,291
No, I'm struggling.

1347
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:36,625
I don't know why...

1348
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:39,250
I just mess up.

1349
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:44,015
I realize I have no faith in love.

1350
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:47,775
I expect it to go wrong one way or another.

1351
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:51,445
So it's reassuring to be the one to blame.

1352
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:55,441
I worry less about it going wrong
and when it does,

1353
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:57,751
I feel kind of vindicated.

1354
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:01,250
But I never move forward.

1355
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:04,791
Never.

1356
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,291
I'm the same.

1357
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,470
It's not my news to break but...

1358
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:22,291
Let it go now.

1359
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:25,665
It's over with Juliette.

1360
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:28,125
She's marrying him.

1361
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:33,375
You're kidding.

1362
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,625
Am I laughing?

1363
01:45:49,625 --> 01:45:50,733
Is Starckos here?

1364
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:54,573
All of July, but he had to go.
Too much work.

1365
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:59,525
We need a night out.
Can we take your car to go to Bordeaux?

1366
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:01,835
Sure, with pleasure. When?

1367
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,358
Right now.
We're gonna change and go.

1368
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:08,275
No problem.
Just let me get the shopping out of it.

1369
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:10,066
No, take mine.

1370
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:15,606
Jean-Louis will give us a ride
and I'll help you unload your car.

1371
01:46:18,625 --> 01:46:19,525
What?

1372
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:23,790
Nothing, sweetheart.
That's great. And unexpected.

1373
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,041
Are you sure?

1374
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,625
Good luck.

1375
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:29,125
You too.

1376
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,333
See you later.

1377
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,041
Lea, it's me.

1378
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,525
It didn't work.

1379
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:53,625
Stop, please. Go away.

1380
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:57,441
Open up. I need to talk to you.
It's really important.

1381
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:00,650
I'm taking the intercom off the hook.
Go away.

1382
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,750
Don't, Lea. Open up.

1383
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,500
It's me. How are you?

1384
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:28,571
I'm downstairs.

1385
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:30,591
I am.

1386
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,513
I need to talk,
can you come down?

1387
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:38,400
I know but I...

1388
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,500
Hold on a second...

1389
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:45,191
I just want you to hear me out.
It won't take long, I promise.

1390
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:47,291
Surely you can do that.

1391
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:03,083
It's me.

1392
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:08,575
You don't answer,
so it's over, we're through?

1393
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:12,875
Great.

1394
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:15,333
Look at me at least.

1395
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:18,591
I came to see you. Look at me.

1396
01:49:18,658 --> 01:49:22,908
I drove 500 km to see you.
Come to the damn window.

1397
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I love you.

1398
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:35,916
I love you.

1399
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,390
I never did that stuff on purpose.

1400
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:43,876
I didn't know it hurt you.

1401
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:48,191
What do I do now?

1402
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:50,416
What do I do without you?

1403
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,500
I don't get it.

1404
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:09,025
11 years down the pan
to marry a guy you know a year?

1405
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,608
It's not about time.

1406
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:12,708
What is it about?

1407
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,305
And why keep sending me messages?

1408
01:50:16,369 --> 01:50:18,579
If you're getting married?

1409
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,890
It means you're not sure about it.

1410
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:25,333
Are you sure?

1411
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:28,548
You know what marriage means?

1412
01:50:29,583 --> 01:50:31,583
Yes.

1413
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:51,916
I was fooling myself.

1414
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,941
I saw in you what I wanted to see.

1415
01:50:57,041 --> 01:50:59,275
I've changed, for Christ's sake.

1416
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:03,150
Can't you see that?
Can't you see what I'm doing?

1417
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:06,650
Don't you see I believe in myself?
In us.

1418
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:15,833
I have to go.

1419
01:51:16,166 --> 01:51:18,166
You didn't answer me.

1420
01:51:18,625 --> 01:51:22,195
Why the messages
if you're getting married?

1421
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,465
I don't like you being alone.

1422
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:31,375
Don't do it, Juliette.

1423
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:34,791
Your life is with me.

1424
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I'm gonna stay here.

1425
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:49,173
You have all night to decide.

1426
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:54,733
If you don't come out by 7,
you'll never see me again, it's over.

1427
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,650
Okay?

1428
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:59,130
So get out of the car now...

1429
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,941
...and after you close the door,
just do one thing for me...

1430
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:07,546
On the way to that door,
think of all we had together.

1431
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:09,708
All we shared.

1432
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:13,415
When you open that door,

1433
01:52:13,508 --> 01:52:16,908
ask yourself if you want it to end here.

1434
01:56:34,083 --> 01:56:36,483
Hey, everybody. How's it going?

1435
01:56:36,583 --> 01:56:38,583
You're all alone?

1436
01:56:38,708 --> 01:56:39,941
Who's got my car?

1437
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:42,358
Antoine.
He scored a chick in Bordeaux.

1438
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:45,008
Good for him, having some fun.

1439
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,965
We had a totally crazy night.

1440
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:50,691
You weren't bored being third wheel?

1441
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:54,358
I hit the dance floor.
You know I love dancing.

1442
01:56:54,458 --> 01:56:56,498
I saw Ludo this morning.

1443
01:56:56,791 --> 01:56:59,441
He recognized me,
but he's still in bad shape.

1444
01:56:59,541 --> 01:57:01,650
He can't speak,
he's hardly fizzing.

1445
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:03,875
You saw Ludo in Bordeaux?

1446
01:57:19,166 --> 01:57:21,461
No. Because I was in Paris.

1447
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:25,625
She left me.

1448
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:30,153
She left me because I'm a selfish bastard.

1449
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:33,483
The only girl who loved me for what I am...

1450
01:57:33,583 --> 01:57:36,525
And I blew it 'cos I'm a stupid jerk.

1451
01:57:36,625 --> 01:57:38,400
Sure but...

1452
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:41,305
She's right.
I didn't deserve her.

1453
01:57:41,833 --> 01:57:45,743
At 60, I'll end up chasing after 20-year-olds.

1454
01:57:48,291 --> 01:57:50,650
Now I never want to hear another word,

1455
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:53,400
not another word about this, get it?

1456
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,500
Do you get it?

1457
01:57:56,958 --> 01:57:58,998
Will you please say yes?

1458
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:02,791
Please.

1459
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:20,215
We taking the boat out later?

1460
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:24,425
A glass of red'll do you good.

1461
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,541
You okay?

1462
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:02,025
It's just a scratch.
I thought you said it was wrecked.

1463
01:59:02,125 --> 01:59:04,858
Sorry.
We found it like that at the rest stop.

1464
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:07,066
It stands out more in daylight.

1465
01:59:07,166 --> 01:59:09,166
Really?

1466
01:59:09,708 --> 01:59:13,233
We'll see tomorrow.
As Véro says, it's all immaterial.

1467
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:15,333
Hey, how are you?

1468
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:20,275
I didn't expect you to react so well.

1469
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:24,566
The vacation's done me a world of good.
It's so relaxing here.

1470
01:59:24,666 --> 01:59:27,386
It's great to see you.
- You too.

1471
01:59:34,291 --> 01:59:36,926
How are you, babe?
- Yeah, fine.

1472
01:59:37,416 --> 01:59:39,416
Hey, beautiful.

1473
02:00:10,958 --> 02:00:16,058
I know this is pretty weird for you,
but it's weirder for me.

1474
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:18,625
Let's just act normal.

1475
02:00:20,583 --> 02:00:22,108
I'm so happy to be here...

1476
02:00:22,208 --> 02:00:24,441
...and to see you all again.

1477
02:00:24,541 --> 02:00:26,751
We're glad to see you too.

1478
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,066
He'll stop hassling us about texts.

1479
02:00:30,166 --> 02:00:32,166
What's he saying?

1480
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:34,650
What texts? That's bullshit.

1481
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:36,650
Careful, she'll believe you.

1482
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:38,650
You bet. Did you really?

1483
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,750
Would I? Course not.

1484
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,233
This calls for champagne.
You putting the lid behind you.

1485
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:45,525
What did you say?

1486
02:00:45,625 --> 02:00:47,750
We put the lid behind us.

1487
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,510
I'll get you for that, asshole.

1488
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:56,983
You okay?

1489
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,733
Sure.

1490
02:00:58,833 --> 02:01:01,808
Let's party, take your mind off it.

1491
02:01:03,875 --> 02:01:06,150
Party anyone?
- Let's go dancing.

1492
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,983
We haven't been clubbing yet.

1493
02:01:08,083 --> 02:01:09,566
I'm in.
- You haven't?

1494
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:12,249
I'm out.
You go, if you want.

1495
02:01:12,458 --> 02:01:14,458
What about you?

1496
02:01:14,529 --> 02:01:16,529
I'll stay here.

1497
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:19,333
Let's go get changed.

1498
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:23,941
Eric, poker?

1499
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:26,081
No, he's coming with us.

1500
02:01:26,708 --> 02:01:29,343
I'm okay. I don't feel like it.

1501
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:33,085
I wanna win my money back.

1502
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:35,708
Dream on, buddy.

1503
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:45,730
I'll just grab a shower.
Won't be long.

1504
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:47,916
Don't be long.

1505
02:01:58,291 --> 02:01:59,566
I'm pleased for you.

1506
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:01,666
Yeah, I'm pleased too.

1507
02:02:04,166 --> 02:02:06,166
This is how it works.

1508
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:10,490
You talk to each one every day.
We all do it.

1509
02:02:10,545 --> 02:02:11,900
It's not what I thought.

1510
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,066
It's relaxing. Who knew I'd declare
undying love to some rice?

1511
02:02:16,166 --> 02:02:17,525
Is Marie still asleep?

1512
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:21,108
I guess so. We left without her.
It was 4:30.

1513
02:02:21,208 --> 02:02:25,733
I'd no idea you got home so late.
What were you doing till then?

1514
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:30,358
I danced, then I had a gangbang
with 3 surfers on a trampoline.

1515
02:02:30,458 --> 02:02:32,400
The surfer boys rode that wave.

1516
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:33,733
You missed out.

1517
02:02:33,833 --> 02:02:36,638
I don't like you being like that.

1518
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:03,750
Fuck.

1519
02:03:13,083 --> 02:03:15,566
How is she?
- She's in the toilet.

1520
02:03:15,666 --> 02:03:17,666
I'll go.

1521
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:29,358
It's me.

1522
02:03:29,458 --> 02:03:31,458
Are you okay?

1523
02:03:41,666 --> 02:03:44,811
Coming all the way from Valras Beach,

1524
02:03:45,708 --> 02:03:46,775
barefoot,

1525
02:03:46,875 --> 02:03:50,108
she needs no introduction.
She's divine, she's...

1526
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:52,208
Ludovine.

1527
02:06:13,125 --> 02:06:17,290
Careful, you'll hurt him.
Hands off Neptune's son.

1528
02:06:26,416 --> 02:06:28,711
Get off, for Christ's sake.

1529
02:06:29,458 --> 02:06:31,458
You're freezing cold.

1530
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,191
You're getting sand in my face.

1531
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:36,841
Lighten up, we're on vacation.

1532
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,145
I'm cool,
but you got sand in my face.

1533
02:06:41,583 --> 02:06:43,941
I've got one for you, douchebag.

1534
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:46,041
The Z.

1535
02:06:46,291 --> 02:06:48,358
That's not a Z.
- It's my Z.

1536
02:06:48,458 --> 02:06:50,668
Ludo, demonstrate for him.

1537
02:06:57,291 --> 02:06:58,900
Like no one's looking.

1538
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Let's go.

1539
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:10,566
It's not nice, killing live animals.

1540
02:07:10,666 --> 02:07:13,896
You're the best, dude.
You're the best.

1541
02:07:16,208 --> 02:07:18,208
Check it out.

1542
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,750
It's bleeding.

1543
02:07:22,458 --> 02:07:25,518
I’ll leave you to enjoy the night.

1544
02:07:25,625 --> 02:07:28,691
I'll be up tomorrow at sunrise.
It's idyllic.

1545
02:07:28,791 --> 02:07:31,483
You don't have that.
You’ll never know...

1546
02:07:31,583 --> 02:07:33,608
Morning's too much for you.

1547
02:07:33,708 --> 02:07:36,258
I'd love to be there with you.

1548
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:39,150
If I weren't an actor, I'd farm oysters.

1549
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:41,250
No kidding.

1550
02:07:44,333 --> 02:07:45,233
Remember?

1551
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:49,066
I swear I’ll be
at Jean-Louis's oyster beds at 5:45.

1552
02:07:49,166 --> 02:07:51,374
You wanna grab a bite...

1553
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:53,541
Maybe some ratatouille?

1554
02:07:55,166 --> 02:07:57,291
Look at the state of you.

1555
02:07:57,708 --> 02:08:00,258
There we go. He kept his word.

1556
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:04,408
Our hero is aboard.
Nothing stands in his way.

1557
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:09,816
Stop filming me.

1558
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:11,233
Puke stew.

1559
02:08:11,333 --> 02:08:15,668
Puke stew.
A tasty dish consisting mostly of corn...

1560
02:08:15,791 --> 02:08:19,956
...made by our friend Rico,
who looks like he's...

1561
02:08:26,958 --> 02:08:28,816
Give me a slug of beer.

1562
02:08:28,916 --> 02:08:29,816
No.

1563
02:08:29,916 --> 02:08:31,275
C'mon, you big faggot.

1564
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:33,483
Shit, Eric. There are children.

1565
02:08:33,583 --> 02:08:34,441
Sorry.

1566
02:08:34,541 --> 02:08:36,233
What's a faggot?

1567
02:08:36,333 --> 02:08:38,333
Ask your dad, he knows.

1568
02:08:45,875 --> 02:08:47,875
Elliot, come here, son.

1569
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:05,460
Faggot is a very bad word.

1570
02:09:06,375 --> 02:09:09,860
It means a homosexual and a homosexual...

1571
02:09:10,125 --> 02:09:14,233
...is a man who loves another man.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1572
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:16,713
You just have to respect it.

1573
02:09:16,802 --> 02:09:18,842
Because it's still love.

1574
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:21,750
Understand?

1575
02:09:28,791 --> 02:09:30,358
Come with me.

1576
02:09:30,458 --> 02:09:32,025
Kids...

1577
02:09:32,125 --> 02:09:34,590
Jeanne, Arthur, come with me.

1578
02:09:51,791 --> 02:09:53,650
Kids, wait here for me.

1579
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:56,385
Don't move, I'll be right back.

1580
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:09,250
Got something to say?

1581
02:10:09,875 --> 02:10:11,875
Say it.

1582
02:10:12,208 --> 02:10:13,775
Tell them.
- Stop.

1583
02:10:13,875 --> 02:10:15,875
Calm down.

1584
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,066
Let go of me.

1585
02:10:17,166 --> 02:10:19,631
You prefer talking to my son?

1586
02:10:41,125 --> 02:10:43,335
What the hell is all this?

1587
02:10:45,875 --> 02:10:48,765
I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

1588
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:51,125
You saw, didn't you?

1589
02:11:04,791 --> 02:11:07,086
Give me your teddy, please.

1590
02:11:54,583 --> 02:11:56,583
Lift your arm up.

1591
02:15:22,916 --> 02:15:24,916
You okay, pops?

1592
02:15:30,958 --> 02:15:32,958
Okay.

1593
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:36,250
Calm down.

1594
02:15:37,958 --> 02:15:39,958
All my love.

1595
02:16:35,625 --> 02:16:38,005
We can do this another time.

1596
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:42,358
Jean-Louis,
I guess the ban on oyster sales...

1597
02:16:42,458 --> 02:16:45,433
...with the big season coming up...

1598
02:16:46,125 --> 02:16:48,483
If you need any help financially,

1599
02:16:48,583 --> 02:16:51,150
just shout.
I can help, if you want.

1600
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:52,650
I'll be fine.

1601
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:54,750
Are you sure? Why?

1602
02:16:55,708 --> 02:17:00,566
I'd rather you offered in private
without people to impress.

1603
02:17:00,666 --> 02:17:02,666
It's not to impress...

1604
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,441
I don't care about the money.

1605
02:17:06,541 --> 02:17:08,066
I don't care, get it?

1606
02:17:08,166 --> 02:17:10,166
Cut that out now.

1607
02:17:11,958 --> 02:17:14,423
Sorry, but I can't pretend...

1608
02:17:14,708 --> 02:17:17,343
No one's asking you to pretend.

1609
02:17:19,166 --> 02:17:21,166
No, but you all do.

1610
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,066
What's eating you?

1611
02:17:23,166 --> 02:17:26,191
You've spent 2 weeks lying to each other.

1612
02:17:26,291 --> 02:17:27,108
What?

1613
02:17:27,208 --> 02:17:30,066
You earn your living from it.
You made it an art.

1614
02:17:30,166 --> 02:17:32,483
Easy now. What's got into you?

1615
02:17:32,583 --> 02:17:34,858
You guys have.
Right under my skin.

1616
02:17:34,958 --> 02:17:38,650
You show off to everybody,
especially your friends,

1617
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:40,750
flaunting your success.

1618
02:17:40,842 --> 02:17:43,941
Where does it get you?
You don't enjoy it.

1619
02:17:44,041 --> 02:17:46,525
The biggest boat, the swankiest house,

1620
02:17:46,625 --> 02:17:48,066
the goldest gold card...

1621
02:17:48,166 --> 02:17:50,566
But your heart's like everyone else's.

1622
02:17:50,666 --> 02:17:52,791
You can't buy an upgrade.

1623
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:58,475
Worst of all,
you lie to yourselves.

1624
02:18:02,583 --> 02:18:04,623
Every single one of you.

1625
02:18:06,083 --> 02:18:08,718
You buy into each other's lies.

1626
02:18:08,833 --> 02:18:10,873
Call yourselves friends?

1627
02:18:11,041 --> 02:18:12,400
What's friendship?

1628
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:16,775
Leaving a pal in the hospital
'cos your vacation matters more?

1629
02:18:16,875 --> 02:18:18,066
Cut it out now.

1630
02:18:18,166 --> 02:18:19,983
What's your problem?

1631
02:18:20,083 --> 02:18:23,653
You bust our balls with your stupid texts,

1632
02:18:23,731 --> 02:18:27,726
but did you call the hospital
to see how he was?

1633
02:18:32,625 --> 02:18:34,625
He's dead.

1634
02:18:34,791 --> 02:18:38,106
Hear me?
He died this morning all alone.

1635
02:18:38,186 --> 02:18:39,775
I'm sorry, it's...

1636
02:18:39,875 --> 02:18:41,875
Vincent just called me.

1637
02:22:55,291 --> 02:22:58,266
If there's one man I believed in...

1638
02:22:58,833 --> 02:23:00,833
...it's Ludo.

1639
02:23:03,291 --> 02:23:07,286
I'd like to talk about his generosity.
He was...

1640
02:23:09,458 --> 02:23:12,178
You could go to see him anytime,

1641
02:23:12,291 --> 02:23:14,291
he was there for you.

1642
02:23:14,958 --> 02:23:16,958
To talk to you.

1643
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:20,856
Even when he was down,
and he often was,

1644
02:23:22,083 --> 02:23:24,293
he was so generous that...

1645
02:23:24,916 --> 02:23:27,721
...he forgot to think of himself.

1646
02:23:38,333 --> 02:23:39,900
Since we met,

1647
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,145
and in the last few years especially,

1648
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:46,957
you kept telling me...

1649
02:23:48,541 --> 02:23:50,921
...that life is to be lived.

1650
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:54,586
You gave me the strength...

1651
02:23:54,708 --> 02:23:58,278
...to live some extraordinary experiences.

1652
02:24:02,458 --> 02:24:07,728
You gave me the strength
to imagine us living together one day.

1653
02:24:11,541 --> 02:24:14,686
How could I have done it without you?

1654
02:24:14,833 --> 02:24:17,790
How will I keep going without you?

1655
02:24:23,458 --> 02:24:26,093
I always told you everything...

1656
02:24:28,166 --> 02:24:31,566
...and I have so much still to tell you.

1657
02:24:37,458 --> 02:24:40,008
I don't know what to expect...

1658
02:24:42,166 --> 02:24:44,546
...but I'm expecting a baby.

1659
02:24:53,333 --> 02:24:55,628
Have a great journey, Ludo.

1660
02:24:56,083 --> 02:24:58,293
I'll love you all my life.

1661
02:25:11,333 --> 02:25:13,333
Ludo...

1662
02:25:13,458 --> 02:25:15,458
Buddy-o...

1663
02:25:15,550 --> 02:25:17,550
My pal...

1664
02:25:18,541 --> 02:25:20,541
The fun we had. Damn.

1665
02:25:22,875 --> 02:25:25,850
We had some amazing times together.

1666
02:25:37,291 --> 02:25:40,207
I tried, I swear. I tried but...

1667
02:25:53,708 --> 02:25:55,748
I promised I wouldn't...

1668
02:25:57,083 --> 02:25:59,718
You gave us so much. All of us.

1669
02:26:00,708 --> 02:26:03,343
I didn't give you as much back.

1670
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:07,555
I doubt I gave you as much but...

1671
02:26:09,833 --> 02:26:12,128
It was good being with you.

1672
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Being your friend.

1673
02:26:57,375 --> 02:26:59,375
Don't cry.

1674
02:27:04,083 --> 02:27:06,083
Look at me.
