1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,683
<i>Previously on "Second Chance"...</i>

2
00:00:01,718 --> 00:00:03,735
Disgraced sheriff Jimmy Pritchard

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,296
took his own life today.

4
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,476
You're the first to
journey all the way back,

5
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,646
to get another chance.

6
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,073
I know you. You're one of
those rich computer twins.

7
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,711
Otto recoded your white blood cells

8
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:17,248
to fight the cancer in my blood.

9
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,942
You brought <i>me</i>
back to save <i>you?</i>

10
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:22,576
He's stronger than predicted.

11
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:28,454
Why does he think he's my father?

12
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,244
Because he is.

13
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm here about finalizing the merger.

14
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:35,350
I need to know you'll take care of Otto.

15
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,219
After me, you're the only person he trusts.

16
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:39,720
I'll take care of Otto.

17
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,112
What's wrong with him?

18
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,625
The glitch did not exist in
the subject's original code.

19
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,494
His genetic code is evolving.

20
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:48,395
His own body's rewriting it.

21
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:49,630
Mary.

22
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:52,025
The numbers from your
most recent blood labs,

23
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,109
they're improving.

24
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:55,135
His blood is making you better.

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,972
For some reason that defies
me, she connects with you.

26
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:08,082
She will be a beautiful monster.

27
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,930
I'll be back in a few hours.

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,061
Bury the other girl outside while I'm gone.

29
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,317
Make sure the hole is deep enough.

30
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,663
Sleep.

31
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:25,330
Let the drugs hold you down.

32
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:36,303
How many are we going to have
to bury before he gets one right?

33
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:47,160
Where is she?

34
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,696
Damn, lady!

35
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,987
Monsters! They're monsters!

36
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,582
What a day, Otto.

37
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,960
The kind of day that makes you feel young.

38
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:55,916
Well, I am young, but still.

39
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,853
You know the kind of day that just makes
you want to grab it with both hands?

40
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,087
No.

41
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,921
You don't look out there and
think there's just a world

42
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,824
of trouble I can't wait to get into?

43
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,159
No.

44
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,939
Well, you wouldn't. But... where's Mary?

45
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,362
I got the supercharger
hooked up to the Riviera.

46
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:11,184
Maybe she wants to celebrate her
remission by taking a ride up the coast.

47
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,367
Throw back a few clams
and pitchers of beer.

48
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:16,003
Mary doesn't throw back clams or pitchers.

49
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,639
And, anyway, she's in a hotel
having sex with Connor Graf.

50
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,886
She's where, doing what?

51
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,640
She's in a hotel, having sex...

52
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,391
with Connor Graf.

53
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:24,932
Who the hell's Connor Graf?

54
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:29,698
<i>Connor Graf, age 34, C.E.O.
of Incentric Biosystems.</i>

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,844
<i>Estimated net worth... $1.2 billion.</i>

56
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,178
<i>Interests include artisanal
small-batch Bourbon,</i>

57
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,812
<i>rock climbing, French
new wave cinema.</i>

58
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,760
That bothers you?

59
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:41,836
No, I just didn't know
she was seeing someone.

60
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,624
Connor's the man she has sex with.

61
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,399
I don't believe she's seeing him.

62
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:49,568
Hmm. I guess I'll just take a
ride up the coast on my own, then.

63
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,226
Before you do, you might
be interested to know

64
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,628
that there should not be
another glitch in your code.

65
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:55,810
Good to know.

66
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:57,966
I replicated the code in these.

67
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,582
Uh...

68
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,787
Any further changes should
show up in these subjects first.

69
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:09,644
Actually, I'd like to
draw some blood from you

70
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,749
and run a quick series of tests

71
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,327
to ensure that you and
the rats are all lined up.

72
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,178
I needed that.

73
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,674
Needed <i>that</i> or needed <i>me?</i>

74
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,562
You know what I mean.

75
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,957
We need to talk about the merger.

76
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,286
I-I don't want you to
worry about that, all right?

77
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,946
Your company and Otto are
in safe hands, I promise you.

78
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,538
You have enough to deal with,

79
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,664
so I don't want you to worry about that.

80
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,209
Okay?

81
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,559
When we first started
discussing the merger,

82
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,037
I'd just been given six months to live.

83
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,279
Mm.

84
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:10,280
I needed to make sure
Lookinglass was in good hands.

85
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:11,252
Yeah.

86
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:13,570
That Otto's place there would be secure.

87
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:14,664
You know...

88
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,633
But...

89
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,023
...I have more than six months to live now.

90
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,662
What? Remission?

91
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,065
Not fully, but improvement.

92
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,502
My numbers are better.

93
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:28,090
That's great.

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,623
Well, we-we need to celebrate.
We... we need to go somewhere.

95
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:32,446
- We-we need to...
- Connor...

96
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,986
the merger.

97
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:39,225
I don't want to plan for my end anymore.

98
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,251
I need to call off the merger.

99
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,938
I know it was a lot of work.

100
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:48,723
Look, don't... don't even mention it.

101
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,894
It's all lawyer stuff. One
phone call, it all goes away.

102
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,423
Mm!

103
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:57,168
That's perfect. So Davos or Rio?

104
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,434
Neither. Work.

105
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:02,837
I feel good. And I want to work.

106
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,393
Bitch.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,120
Yeah, what do you have?

108
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,524
She said she woke up on a table.

109
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,277
There were three people in the room, but
she only got a good look at one of them.

110
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,627
Can she I.D. him?

111
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,336
I think maybe you should go
ask her that yourself, sir.

112
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:23,584
I'm in the middle of something.

113
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,287
All right, what you working
on? You need any help?

114
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,477
No. I have to go now, all right?

115
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:30,349
Are you, uh... you, Grace, and
Helen still coming to Peng's later?

116
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,941
Look, Gracie's away on a class trip.

117
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,063
Mm, right. Yeah, she is.

118
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,572
Uh, you and Helen, then...
Pritchard family dinner.

119
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:39,900
Sounds good, right?

120
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,402
I'll do my best.

121
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,006
Is that police radio?

122
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,300
Are you on a crime scene, Duval?

123
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,028
Duval?

124
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,481
That was definitely a police radio.

125
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,251
What are you doing, Duval?

126
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:00,421
<i>Agent Duval is currently
investigating a kidnapping case.</i>

127
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,357
Well, now we're talking.

128
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,959
Artie, do any of the deputies
on the scene have those, uh,

129
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,494
body cams?

130
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,933
Artie, if you weren't some
creepy little kiddy cartoon,

131
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,366
I'd kiss you.

132
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,606
Oh, they've got cadaver dogs.

133
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,508
I love cadaver dogs.

134
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,777
Means they're looking for a dead body.

135
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,245
Turn it up.

136
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,816
Helicopters.

137
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:29,733
<i>Ma'am?</i>

138
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,498
What the hell's going on out there?

139
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,088
<i>I'm Agent Pritchard, FBI.</i>

140
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,958
<i>You said you got a good
look at one of the men.</i>

141
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,227
<i>Not men...</i>

142
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,230
<i>monsters.</i>

143
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:42,897
- <i>Monsters?</i>
- Monsters?

144
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,098
<i>Sir?</i>

145
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,334
<i>You should come and see this.</i>

146
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,677
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

147
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,574
<i>Stay with her, okay?</i>

148
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,614
Arthur, what's that address?

149
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,015
How did you find out
about this? Lookinglass.

150
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,294
What, the radios?

151
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:18,299
Body cam?

152
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,865
Yeah. Look, I heard what happened.

153
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,469
Why don't you let me work
this one with you, huh?

154
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,948
This means something to you. Why?

155
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,011
I heard what the witness said.

156
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,010
And I've never seen a real monster before.

157
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,268
And you're not going to now.

158
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:33,314
Look, if what she thinks she saw is real,

159
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,999
these people need to be
stopped, and it's what I do.

160
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,918
So just let me stop them.

161
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,617
There is nothing to do.

162
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:40,722
What, why? You already caught them?

163
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,144
Them? There are no them.

164
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,427
There's nothing out there.

165
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,762
There never was anything out there.

166
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,064
It's empty. Clean.

167
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,732
No DNA. Luminol shows no blood.

168
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:54,750
No body.

169
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:58,599
And certainly no surgical
table or instruments.

170
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:03,574
What we have are the drug-induced
delusions of a party girl

171
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,779
who works part-time for
a high-end escort service.

172
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,907
Test her blood?

173
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:10,462
Mm-hmm. Positive for MDMA.

174
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:12,914
She was high, and she saw monsters.

175
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,690
Okay, well...

176
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,146
I'll let you get back to
whatever it is you were doing.

177
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:18,760
All right.

178
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,628
Uh, dinner at Peng's, though, right?

179
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,630
Yeah, dinner at Peng's.

180
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,056
Great.

181
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,313
You another agent come to
say you don't believe me?

182
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:37,756
I'm not with the FBI. I just
work with them sometimes.

183
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:40,302
I, uh, heard your statement.

184
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,317
That I'm some whore,

185
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,352
high on Molly, seeing things?

186
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,988
You know, that house was empty. It's...

187
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,824
You know what? Screw you and screw this.

188
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,018
There were monsters, they were
real, and they were after me.

189
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:53,561
And now no one's gonna stop them.

190
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,072
Ma'am, I can drive you home now.

191
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,679
Hey, I... I think I can help you.

192
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:59,275
I'm not asking anyone for any more help.

193
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,003
If what you saw is real, you
might want to rethink that.

194
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:17,616
You live here?

195
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:18,783
Yep.

196
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:24,492
Okay, so exactly what kind of
FBI consultant has this home?

197
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,261
It's not his home.

198
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,401
You can't have people here.

199
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh, yeah? Why?

200
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,754
I assume you know why, and you're
baiting me with that question.

201
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,174
What does he mean, not your home?

202
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,421
- He's joking.
- I'm incapable of joking.

203
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:43,878
Who is she, and why is she here?

204
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,504
That's my business. Nothing
to do with you or Mary.

205
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:50,396
It's my business, Otto, and if you
don't mind, I'd like to get back to it.

206
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:53,731
My sister lets you go out
because she thinks you need it.

207
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:55,319

208

_

210
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,198
That was twinspeak.

211
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,963
Why do you live with Otto Goodwin?

212
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,423
I work for them sometimes.

213
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,914
Them? Does Mary live here, too?

214
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,357
Jilly, let's just talk
about last night, huh?

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,583
What's the last thing you remember?

216
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:20,448
I went for a run, and I
ended up in that house.

217
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:23,518
This monster you saw, describe it to me.

218
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,481
Why?

219
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,757
I've seen enough things in my life to...

220
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,392
believe you.

221
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,262
Artie?

222
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:36,373
<i>May I help you?</i>

223
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:40,068
Artie, she's gonna describe something
to you, and I want you to make a sketch.

224
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:41,568
<i>Okay, Mr. Pritchard.</i>

225
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,857
<i>Whenever you're ready, Jilly.</i>

226
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,678
Um, he...

227
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:52,212
it...

228
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,471
it had an oval-shaped face.

229
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,253
And a shaved head.

230
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,122
Horns, little ones.

231
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,726
No, under the skin.

232
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,327
Is this everything?

233
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,212
- Yes.
- From the house?

234
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,637
We watched the Feds from up in the hills.

235
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,701
There's nothing of us left to find.

236
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,281
They think the girl was just tripping.

237
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:16,371
Good.

238
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,971
We'll get someone else for you to work on.

239
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,278
Can't be someone else.

240
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,244
I chose her. It has to be her.

242
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:39,535
He had dark eyes, piercings, I remember.

243
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,166
On his nose and above his eyebrows.

244
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:49,285
I...

245
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,529
I don't think I want to do this.

00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,451
You... you're doing great.
Come on, you got this.

247
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,989
Keep going.

248
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,791
His ears were pointed.

249
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:08,479
Hi.

250
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,184
I just came back to
change in between meetings.

251
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,127
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

252
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:15,666
I'm working, and Pritchard's
upstairs with a prostitute.

253

<i>Initiating

Oh!

255
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,061
It really happened.

256
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,348
You must be the...

257
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:42,654
Jilly. This is Jilly.

258
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,338
You were gonna say "hooker."

259
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:47,982
Just a word. Go ahead, say it.

260
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,419
Jilly's in trouble. I'm helping her out.

261
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:51,066
Is there a problem here?

262
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:54,012
I'll just give you some space.

263
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:58,008
Can I ask, if she's in trouble,
why the police aren't handling it?

264
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:58,964
They don't believe her.

265
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,403
For some reason, you do believe her?

266
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,146
She's in trouble. I brought her home.

267
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,597
I mean, this is <i>my</i> home, isn't it?

268
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,824
If I want to be with someone, I
can bring them back to where I live.

269
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,960
I don't have to sneak off to a hotel.

270
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,706
Wait, are we talking about me now?

271
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,515
Those the same clothes you wore last night?

272
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,933
- What has gotten into you?
- Your brother's code.

273
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,011
Oh.

274
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,629
Sometimes I forget you're...

275
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,398
What?

276
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:24,870
What am I?

277
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,146
You're one of a kind.

278
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,723
You must get lonely.

279
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,545
You must get scared.

I'm gonna go take care of something.

295

Jilly's gonna stay here till I'm done.

Look, I didn't mean to mess up

Yes.

301
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,793
But tea with wine and no tea.

302
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,325
Good idea.

303
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,461
And maybe a change of clothes.

304
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:03,416
First time alone with an escort?

305
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:05,086
I think so.

306
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,711
Yes.

307
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,432
Well, he seemed to know his way around.

308
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:09,967
With escorts?

309
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,700
Yes, I believe he's had
some experience from before.

310
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,519
Before what?

311
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,421
Before he came to live here.

312
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:19,490
Just so you know, uh, he
and I didn't do anything.

313
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,146
That is none of my business.

314
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,163
We're not in a relationship.

315
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,524

Otto?

317
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,196
No. Why would you say that?

318
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,570
Just the way you both were real
unhappy that he brought me back here.

319
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:34,771
I figured he must be
with one or both of you.

320

What do you think of him?

321

00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:45,530
But...

323
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,448
But what?

324
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,885
Something else.

325
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:50,885

00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,752
Do I know you?

328
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,140
This is you.

329
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:17,268
I'm just wondering is
"the" your middle name,

330
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,232
or is "the Widowmaker" your last name?

331
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,567
Where do you think you're going?

332
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:24,772
Just want to ask you a question.

333
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:32,431
I know what you did to
Jilly in that house, Caleb.

334
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,348
Well, he said he'd be here.

335
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,718
He says a lot of things.

336
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:03,483
Maybe we should just go ahead and order.

337
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,628
Look, he grew up not knowing us.

338
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,440
Imagine what it was like for him

339
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:10,330
knowing we were his family
and not being able to see us.

340
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,793
I mean, he's... he's a bastard, Duval.

341
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,563
Yes, Helen, he is a bastard.

342
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,673
If he wants a Pritchard family
dinner, I think he should have one.

343
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,212
Well, if he wants a Pritchard family
dinner, then he should show up for it.

344
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,475
Duval, Helen.

345
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,175
Well, three siblings. Here we are.

346
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,944
Should we order drinks?

347
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,580
The man Jilly saw, he's real.

348
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:33,948
Who's Jilly?

349
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,540
The escort he drove off with
from my crime scene last night.

350
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:38,662
Well, you're not a very
good boss to let that happen.

351
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,218
He's not my boss. We work together.

352
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:42,423
He's not a monster, either.

353
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,759
He's a man, and he works at the Inkwell.

354
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,427
You went after him, didn't you?

355
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:50,613
I'm guessing he's either in the
trunk of your car or long gone.

356
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:52,867
I did lose him.

357
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,069
But I have this.

358
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,304
Oh!

359
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,573
Now it's a Pritchard
family dinner. That's...

360
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,879
He has some kind of elf ear on him.

361
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:03,396
The don't use their real names in
there, but with this, we could find him.

362
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:06,681
You want me to get a DNA sample
of the blood from an elf ear?

363
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,134
No, he tried to grab it back.

364
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:10,945
I want you to run this
bloody fingerprint right here.

365
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,824
Swelling's gone down nicely.

366
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,193
Now, don't be surprised if someone
mistakes you for your daughter.

367
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,194
Oh!

368
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,264
Dr. Lesueur, a patient keeps calling.

369
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,334
I told him you were in a consult,
but he says it's an emergency.

370
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,330
I'll be right back.

371
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,680
I told you never to come here.

372
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:38,873
Some Fed came to the bar asking questions.

373
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,309
What did you tell him?

374
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,536
Nothing. I swear it.

375
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,326
I got away.

376
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,357
Looks like it hurts.

377
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,096
Meet me at the garage, I'll make
everything better, all right?

378
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:04,105
Okay, that fingerprint is
a match to a Caleb Hammond.

379
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,509
First offense.

380
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:09,070
18 years old, killed his neighbor's dogs...

381
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,290
with a garden trowel.

382
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:14,415
Caleb at 21. In for possession.

383
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:18,853
Caleb at 24. Now in for assault.

384
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,144
Can you connect him to the
house they found Jilly in?

385
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,564
Bank owns that house.

386
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:24,525
It's been empty for the past six years.

387
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,931
Caleb's last known address
is here... with his wife.

388
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:29,990
You pay him a visit.

389
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,742
You can flash him your
badge, ask him some questions.

390
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,018
I'll just stay out of it.

391
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:35,844
I will. I'll just stay out of it.

392
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,381
Thank you.

393
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:51,661
Are you leaving?

394
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,804
Yeah. I got to get back to my life.

395
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,191
Which isn't here, you know?

396
00:22:57,226 --> 00:23:00,361
James wanted you to stay. Are you sure?

397
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,000
I have a cab waiting.

398
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,239
I thought he brought
me back here to save me.

399
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,042
And don't get me wrong...

400
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:11,205
he was the only one who believed me.

401
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:14,075
Why did he bring you back here?

402
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,211
To show <i>you</i> he was saving me.

403
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:23,656
Although, him being a man, it's
50-50 if he even knows that.

404
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:26,809
See ya.

405
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,346
We have nothing on the guy who lives here.

406
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,166
Well, he is a dog-killing monster.

407
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,238
Hmm.

408
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:43,905
Took you long enough.

409
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,495
Come on, the sink's this way.

410
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:51,545
You're not the plumbers.

411
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,378
No, ma'am. FBI.

412
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:54,615
It's about Caleb?

413
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,123
I threw him out last year when he
started calling himself the Widowmaker.

414
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:58,613
So whatever he's done, you're gonna have to

415
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,996
go ask whoever it is
he's making miserable now.

416
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:03,558
Is this the, uh, sink
that's giving you trouble?

417
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:04,986
- Yeah.
- Ew.

418
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:08,585
Well... lucky for you, I made sure
Duval knows his way around a J-trap.

419
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,913
Remember the house on Elm when you stuck
a toy soldier down one of these things,

420
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,202
some kind of crazy rescue mission?

421
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:17,338
Your mom had guests over
and it was gonna be...

422
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,342
Well, don't just stand there.

423
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,905
Ask the nice lady where a
wrench is or find a bucket.

424
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:27,200
You have a wrench or a bucket?

425
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:30,517
It's about time. It's throbbing like crazy.

426
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,087
All right. Well, sit down,
and we'll get started.

427
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,223
I thought you liked pain.

428
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,473
Only when I ask for it.

429
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:42,719
Can you tell me why you
asked your husband to leave?

430
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:44,040
He got too weird.

431
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:45,741
How did Caleb get weird?

432
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,402
He'd go on about beauty,

433
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:51,086
how some beautiful people are monsters,

434
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,273
they just don't know it.

435
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:53,508
But he was gonna show them.

436
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,314
Caleb had some bad times.
He had it rough as a kid.

437
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:59,447
But he was putting it all behind him.

438
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,074
All behind him until...?

439
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,077
Until he started hanging
out with this cutter.

440
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:04,339
Cutter? What's a cutter?

441
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:06,988
The illegal doctors who do
the more extreme modifications.

442
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:07,884
Like horns?

443
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,388
Yeah, horns, branding,

444
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:11,826
scarification,
penis-splitting, you know...

445
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,629
W-wait, what was... what was the last one?

446
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,703
These cutters, they use
surgical tools, right?

447
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:19,568
- Yeah, they do.
- You have the name of this cutter?

448
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,876
No names.

449
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,630
That work they do is so illegal.

450
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,705
Caleb was always so
freaking Voldemort about it.

451
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:28,309
Okay, good. Well, what can
you tell us about Voldemort?

452
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:29,610
He's kidding.

453
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:31,239
Oh.

454
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:35,302
You're paralyzed, but
I know you can hear me.

455
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:37,852
I want to thank you for
all you've done, but...

456
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,387
it's all about Jilly now.

457
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,441
You've been in love, you understand.

458
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,158
When she looks at you and
knows you for who you are.

459
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,494
You see, I... I can't risk getting caught.

460
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,420
And that Fed knew you, and you know me,

461
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:51,666
so I'm gonna push this blade
in deeper, and you will die.

462
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,895
Now, I know you only like
pain that you ask for,

463
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,627
so don't worry, my dear
and sweet Widowmaker.

464
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:58,484
It won't hurt.

465
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:14,922
Caleb Hammond, A.K.A. Caleb the Widowmaker,

466
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,734
came under the influence of a
cutter who uses surgical tools.

467
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:19,893
Surgical tools is what Jilly
says she saw at the house.

468
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,243
This is real, Duval.

469
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,397
Yeah. Okay.

470
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,820
First thing we do is
get Jilly somewhere safe.

471
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,929
I didn't exactly like that talk
about Caleb showing beautiful people

472
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,439
how they're really monsters.

473
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:34,350
Well, she is somewhere safe. I
left her at the Goodwin house.

474
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,928
Thanks for coming to get me.

475
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,230
Of course. My pleasure.

476
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,783
You just let her walk out the door?

477
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:06,027
She's a grown woman.
What was I supposed to do?

478
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,565
Did she tell you where she was going?

479
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,162
Did she give me the name of the
man who is going to pay her for sex?

480
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,491
No.

481
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:18,952
So tonight, the usual three hours?

482
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,545
Yes. Why don't you go run a bath,

483
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:21,959
and, uh, I'll get us some drinks?

484
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,075
That sounds really nice.

485
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:41,880
I can't find her phone.

486
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:43,535
You sure you gave me the correct number?

487
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,270
Yes, I'm sure.

488
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:48,540
Even if it's off, you should be able
to push through and find it, right?

489
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,542
Even if the battery's out,
we should be able to find it.

490
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,043
Well, what the hell does it mean?

491
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,394
Who was the last person she contacted?

492
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:11,022
Jilly got a text before she left.

493
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,100
Did you pull it off the cloud?

494
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:14,442
Yes, from a disposable phone.

495
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,406
He must be a regular
client, someone she trusts.

496
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,988
If he's the cutter,
then we got to find him.

497
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:23,408
I've got a more low-tech idea. Let's go.

498
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:29,908
_

499
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:37,489
I have something to ask.

500
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,397
What is it?

501
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:46,167
Will you marry me?

502
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,658
It's beautiful.

503
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:56,364
Just like I always knew it would be.

504
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:58,777
What happened? W-why'd you stop?

505
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:02,514
No, I'm just... I'm having a little
trouble getting into it tonight.

506
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:05,464
Do you mind just giving me a
minute and we can start again?

507
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,099
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay.

508
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,984
A-are you okay? You, uh...

509
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,164
you seem distant.

510
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:12,724
I had this thing happen to me.

511
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,255
What? Were you hurt?

512
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,024
No.

513
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:22,277
But it made me feel like I
couldn't take care of myself.

514
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:25,726
And I've spent my life taking care of me.

515
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,057
No one's gonna take that from me.

516
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,607
Good for you.

517
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,458
That's important.

518
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:41,307
Hmm. What's in this?

519
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:42,983
I know that taste.

520
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,932
Pharmaceutical MDMA.

521
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,018
That's what I put in your water bottle

522
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,730
before you went for
your run the other night.

523
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,063
What?

524
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:53,431
After I left, they said that you cut
yourself free and you... you ran for it.

525
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,742
You <i>can</i> take care of yourself.

526
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:58,004
That only makes me love you more.

527
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,637
We are gonna be so happy together.

528
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,400
- You were there, behind the light.
- Yeah.

529
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:03,875
You were the man behind the light.

530
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:10,315
Ohh.

531
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,349
Oh!

532
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,479
My friend Mr. Widowmaker around?

533
00:30:26,562 --> 00:30:28,705
No, not since you beat the crap out of him.

534
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,196
What do you want?

535
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,871
Oh, uh... I'll take a cutter.

536
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,573
Cutter? Don't know what that is.

537
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,891
Sure you do.

538
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:39,210
The cutters are the ones
who do the extreme work.

539
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,712
Like penis-splitting.

540
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:42,914
Okay. Why don't you act your age?

541
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:44,388
Hmm? Yeah.

542
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:45,950
We just want to have a talk with him.

543
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:47,465
Listen, I can't help you.

544
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,487
We don't mention their names for a reason.

545
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:51,356
They make all this possible.

546
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,792
We turn them in, we go
against our community.

547
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,471
Even if one of them is a killer.

548
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:58,938
We don't say their names. Ever.

549
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,639
There he is.

550
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:04,382
Hey, you know, why don't you just let
me show you a little old Seattle, huh?

551
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,485
Maybe you'll learn something.

552
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Y-you're FBI.

553
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,515
You can't do this!

554
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,237
No, turns out he's not FBI.

555
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:19,951
Then what is he?

556
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:22,620
Oh, you'd need a science
background to understand it.

557
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,772
I just want to show you something.

558
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,398
This is the hospital.

559
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,262
I'm having a little trouble figuring out,

560
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,975
you know, who I am, where I fit in.

561
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,499
But I feel like in this alley,
I fit right in, don't you?

562
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:39,084
I can't give you a name. Please.

563
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:41,172
You see, this guy...

564
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:43,413
this is the morgue.

565
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:49,112
You got a pen?

566
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:55,221
That's how you used to do it?

567
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,623
I'm a monster. I know.

568
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,458
The things that I've done.

569
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,628
Now, I know you saw one of my mistakes.

570
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,864
Right? There were others
before you, I admit it...

571
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:07,413
weaker women.

572
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,000
See...

573
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:11,989
I was looking for someone strong, like you.

574
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:13,972
Because no one deserves to be alone,

575
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,063
even a monster like me.

576
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:17,425
And you said you'd be mine.

577
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,068
You took my ring over and over
and said that you'd share my life.

578
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,983
So if I'm a monster and you love me...

579
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:27,118
you must be a monster, too.

580
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:31,956
I promise you, Jilly, I will
make you a beautiful monster.

581
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,494
But monsters...

582
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:40,698
don't have soft, pure skin.

583
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,524
See, some monsters have leathery skin.

584
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,855
Some have scales.

585
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,775
Some monsters...

586
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,441
well, some monsters
are covered in feathers.

587
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,544
Black feathers.

588
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,848
We'll tattoo the feathers, then
I think we'll implant the claws.

589
00:32:56,882 --> 00:33:00,204
Then we'll take that face of
yours off and give you another.

590
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:05,790
All right.

591
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,341
Pritchards?

592
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:20,276
What... No! Wait, no,
you can't go in there!

593
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,264
Mary, I tried to stop them.

594
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,351
They barged.

595
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:26,186
It's okay, Alexa. You can go.

596
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:29,390
This is about Jilly?

597
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,174
These are the driver's license
photos of the six cutters

598
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,795
that we got from the
bartender at the Inkwell.

599
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,465
We need to know if any of them
has spent any time with Jilly.

600
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:41,444
So use your facial-recognition software

601
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,131
that I'm not supposed to know about

602
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,797
to see if you can put any of them with her.

603
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,043
No.

604
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,597
What?

605
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,213
No.

606
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:57,251
I'm not a monkey that jumps every
time you say "solve a puzzle."

607
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,053
Get on your machine right now.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

608
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,343
_

609
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,166
_

610
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:05,833
_

611
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:07,578
_

612
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,528
- _
- Otto!

613
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,764
I'll do it myself.

614
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:13,765
Arthur?

615
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,269
<i>Yes, Mary?</i>

616
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,747
No. Arthur is mine.

617
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:20,277
No, Mary.

618
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,276
Implement my override.

619
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,652
<i>Override implemented.</i>

620
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,915
<i>Should I use Lookinglass
facial recognition</i>

621
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,227
<i>to associate any of
the photos on your desk</i>

622
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:31,392
<i>to the woman who was
in our house yesterday?</i>

623
00:34:31,427 --> 00:34:33,020
Yes, Arthur.

624
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,022
Go ahead and do that.

625
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,945
That was taken last year. He's
wanted her for a long time.

626
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,137
Now I'm making this official.

627
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,908
You need to go home.

628
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:55,376
What? Go home?

629
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:56,510
Your gut was right.

630
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,991
Now let the people with badges finish this.

631
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:01,315
We'll get him. You go on home now.

632
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,332
He's wanted in Florida
under a different name.

633
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:10,658
Eight dead prostitutes,
all surgically altered.

634
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,260
The coroner said they all
died during the process.

635
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:15,718
We're gonna hit his apartment, his office,

636
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:17,588
and any other known residence.

637
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:18,741
<i>Clear!</i>

638
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,392
<i>Check the bedroom, over here.</i>

639
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,406
<i>Place is empty, sir.</i>

640
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,741
They waited six hours for him to show up

641
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:30,311
hoping he'd lead them to Jilly.

642
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:32,910
But she's not in there.

643
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:37,083
And now he knows the FBI is on to him.

644
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:40,955
Yeah.

645
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,578
What about her?

646
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,378
Jilly?

647
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:47,480
I'll tell you what I used to tell my men.

648
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,297
Sometimes you do everything
right and the bad guys still win.

649
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:54,156
I used to hate giving that speech,
some deputy trying his best not to cry.

650
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:56,676
You're saying the words but, you know
full well that there are bad men...

651
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:59,965
I mean, real bad men out
there just laughing at you.

652
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:02,576
The best thing about my
last few years in this chair

653
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:04,979
is I didn't have to
give that speech anymore.

654
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:08,949
You don't have to be the sheriff.

655
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:11,285
Oh, then I wouldn't know what I was.

656
00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:13,408
It's all I have left of me.

657
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:21,862
I solved it because I couldn't help myself.

658
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,885
So you might as well know.

659
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,430
Solved what, Otto?

660
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:29,103
She said they used a light.

661
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,941
The previous location the doctor was using,

662
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:34,941
the house in the woods,
was owned by the bank.

663
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,844
The banker handling it...

664
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:39,824
is a client of Dr. Lesueur's.

665
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,884
I compiled a list of the other bank-owned
properties handled by the same banker.

666
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,331
They total 136, all empty.

667
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,923
But Jilly said they used a light.

668
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,357
So I had Arthur check to see

669
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,326
if any of those abandoned properties

670
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,395
are now pulling power off the grid.

671
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,564
And we found one.

672
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:06,480
The hard part comes next.
There's always so much blood.

673
00:37:45,442 --> 00:37:46,694
Shh.

674
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,417
Oh, no.

675
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,397
Where is she? She was the one!

676
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:14,122
She loved me! Where is she?!

677
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:16,154
I'm right here.

678
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,721
Aah!

679
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,995
You think killing him
will make this all go away?

680
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,233
It's a start.

681
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,001
I get that, I do.

682
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,137
But if you kill him...

683
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,356
it will change you.

684
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:34,609
There's no coming back from that.

685
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,978
It's up to you.

686
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:39,299
It's your choice.

687
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:05,760
Those tattoos, what he did to you...

688
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,941
...you can get them removed.

689
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,779
These feathers are me now, not him.

690
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:14,916
It's what I've been through...

691
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,763
how strong I can be.

692
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,169
You need to go with him now.

693
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:23,291
Okay?

694
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,262
What am I gonna find in there?

695
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:41,376
Just a couple of guys
who thought they were bad.

696
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,779
But you showed them, didn't you?

697
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:46,291
Now that the merger's off,

698
00:40:46,326 --> 00:40:48,609
I'm not going to be able to get Otto.

699
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:50,573
I can't do the science without him.

700
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:53,314
I-I can't make this work without Otto.

701
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:55,850
You're gonna have to work harder.

702
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:58,686
I tell you everything they tell me.

703
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:02,799
I need you to get me
Otto's lab work and notes.

704
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,074
If I can't have Otto, I
need his work, all right?

705
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,294
All of it.

706
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:08,496
Well, that's inside their house, then.

707
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,520
I'm the only person Mary trusts there.

708
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,068
You're a good person.

709
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:16,591
And you hate to violate her trust.

710
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:20,742
But this is how we get what you want.

711
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,717
Don't forget what you want.

712
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,727
I'm home.

713
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,324
Did you have a good day?

714
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:38,292
Yes.

715
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:44,692
What is it, my dear?

716
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:50,038
Do you think you can do the wrong things

717
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,813
for the right reason?

718
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:02,036
I used to have a scar on this ankle.

719
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:06,548
This body doesn't have it.

720
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,146
The scar you got in the tank is
the only one that doesn't heal.

721
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:13,073
Each time you go back in the tank,

722
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:16,003
you're restored without imperfections.

723
00:42:16,038 --> 00:42:17,999
I got that imperfection
climbing over a fence

724
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:21,053
separating me from a secret swimming hole.

725
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,483
I proposed to my wife that day.

726
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,049
The other day, Duval told me to go home.

727
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:38,008
I came here.

728
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:41,205
This is your home...

729
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:45,301
...if you want it to be.

730
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:52,931
