So tell me ma'am!

4
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,478
Against who you want to
file a complain?

5
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,246
Have you fought with someone?

6
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,255
May i call lady constable?

7
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,319
Did somebody assaulted you?

8
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,391
Ma'am! If you won't speak then
i can't do anything

9
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,238
your phone is ringing,
atleast pick up your phone

10
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,430
if you won't tell us then how
we will understand?

11
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,467
Say something!

12
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,414
Get up!
She want to lodge the complain

13
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,279
we don't want to lodge any complain,
who are you?

14
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,352
I am her secretary!

15
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,415
Get up!

16
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,355
Why did you need to come in
police station?

17
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,310
Have you fought with aryan?

18
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,513
What is the your relationship
with aryan?

19
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,423
What do we say about her?

20
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,223
Wejournalist doesn't feel good
without giving any labels

21
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,328
that's why we gave different names

22
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,461
mahi was a star

23
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,337
but she was totally different
from other actresses

24
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,432
she gave nice interviews

25
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,311
you neverfind out what she will
say anything

26
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,303
she was little bit crazy

27
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,281
why she shouldn't be?

28
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,246
She was from the broken family

29
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,412
parent fighting everyday...
disturbed childhood

30
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,353
then what?

31
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,219
Mahi got the reason to become
more wild

32
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,392
and she escaped to mumbai

33
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:27,265
you already know that how much film
industry likes complicated stories

34
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,360
so mahi arora becomes...

35
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,480
what's happening?
All well!

36
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,291
Cancel all the appointments today,
why?

37
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,323
What happen mahi!

38
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,327
Because i will take rest all day long

39
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,293
so i should look fab for
success party

40
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,433
you always looks fab

41
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,500
by the way have you seen gayatri
on premiere party

42
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,508
she was bitching about you
sitting with riya

43
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,437
these actresses can't be for
another actress

44
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,510
when did i compete with them

45
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,513
and by the way picture is hit and
aadi's line up is good

46
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,448
so who cares what anyone says...
i completely agreed

47
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,258
give me my cigarette packet

48
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,491

i have brought

49
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,496

tonight's party

50
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,329
we will decide it right now,
i don't want to try

51
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,236
give me anything you want

52
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,437
and aryan is also coming
in tonight's party

53
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,284
did he ever came to your
any function

54
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,282

55
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,348

56
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,282
i've heard that you will become
indian cricket team

57
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,411

so if you will

58
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,286
leave cricket discussion on pitch
so that will be better

59
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,485
your and mahi's rivalry is so
famous these days

60
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,263
we have no rivalry

61
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,392
and i am really happy that sameer
and mahi's movie is hit

62
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,230

63
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,509

your biography

65
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,448
why do i need to write my biography?

66
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,225
There are many ex-editors of
magazine and newspapers

67
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,318
somebody will write that

68
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,339
i have told after preview that your
picture is super hit

69
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,311
your new movie custody is released

70
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,242
people are talking about
your performance

71
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,375

time to watch

72
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,250

74
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,330
recently that movie mumbai love
was released

75
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,232
she had a great debut in that movie
that's great

76
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,371
she is also doing two south movies

77
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,401
he didn't come!

78
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,267
I have told you he won't come

79
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,468

80
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,488
i don't watch his movies so how
could i came to his party

81
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,198
party was also about my success

82
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,295
and you have said that you
will come

83
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,398
you asked me so i couldn't refuse

84
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,436
you have done the same to
didn't attend the party

85
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,212
rats also said that you won't come

86
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,288
why you took her so seriously?

87
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,221
Because you don't take me seriously

88
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,297
if you would...
so i could see that

89
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,481

90

i have already send my passport
to your office

91
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,281
because it will take 15 days for
bahamas visa

92
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,349
there are three months left to
go bahamas

93
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,254
this holiday is very important for me

94
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,360
we have never been for
holidays together

95
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,364
where is that?

96
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,451
Coming in 20 minutes

97
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,349

00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,346
Since when he is sick?

100
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,377
He was feeling weak when
he left from the school

101
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,378
i have called the doctor

102
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,356
sleep down!

103
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,308
Akshay was insisting that's why
i had to call you

104
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,338
you are coming from your own house
orfrom mahi's house

105
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,352
why you are asking?

106
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,290
By the way my lawyer called up

107
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,358
divorce papers are ready for sign

108
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,456
so do it!
I will

109
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,491
but i wanted to ask you first

110
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,361
what did you decide about
ben sten house?

111
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,237
Why to think about that?

112
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,406
I have already told you that i will
keep that flat

113
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,309
i have already give you this house and
two houses in goa

114
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,274
but i am not asking for myself

115
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,379
i am asking foryour son

116
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,283
his school is nearfrom bandra

117
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,220
you know that i have bought that
flat for my parents

118
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,388
but you can shift your parents in
malaharflat

119
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,358
3 properties and 10 crores settlement
and you are still hungry

120
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,271
i neverthought that...
i also didn't thought...

121
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,275
but decide about the flat so
we could sign the papers

122
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,299
i was certain that it will be done

123
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,339
there is no chance?

124
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,355
What happen?

125
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,454
Do you know the owner of
panash?

126
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,389
Yeah!
What about him?

127
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,467
Their endorsment contract is
on renewal

128
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,470
and my team is trying from
2 years

129
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,374
but this time they are continuing
with mahi

130
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,406
it's not fine!

131
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,242
If i will get this endorsment

132
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,319
that jai sanwi!
He is a bisexual

133
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,237
i know...

134
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,274
we should open zip and tongue
very carefully

135
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,358
riya mehra got the endorsment of
binaysh travels

136
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,422
i can't do every endorsment

137
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,431
you are taking everything
very lightely

138
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,491
coming in twenty minutes!

139
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,382
I've heard that your movie is hit

140
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,425
when the next release is?

141
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,392
I don't know...

142
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,297
it will be publish in newspapers,
read it!

143
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,235
I have recommended your name
for padmashree

144
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,215
within one month you came to dehli
three times

145
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,379
and you didn't came home once

146
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,358
because if i will stay here then i'll
have to meet minister khurana

147
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,255
and what about your special co-star?

148
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,459
Last time you came here so you said
that he'll get divorce in 6 months

149
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,327
it's been eight months

150
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,230
did you spoke to him?

151
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,341
He is going to marry you or not?
Stop it!

152
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,442
So many questions?

153
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,370
Did i ever ask you about
your relationships

154
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,278
because you are not my mom

155
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:56,310
i know that you are insecure with
this relationship

156
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,289
and one day this insecurity will
turn into obsession

157
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,489
i don't want that in future noryou
have relationship nor career

158
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,491
you are talking about yourself

159
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,269
not mine

160
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,371
i am totally different from you

161
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,307
but remember!

162
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,502
You have said the same thing
in last two relationships

163
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,450
dubbing will be done tonight!

164
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,519

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,341
you have come to take interview
of my director

166
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,240
since you havejoined "mumbai delhi"
you don't call me

167
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,504
it's not like that

168
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,510
i was busy that's all!
Busy!

169
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,247
With riya mehra!

170
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,478
You have put her on cover page twice

171
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,515
and she does alot foryou

172
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,383
free vacations foryourfamily,
new laptop foryou

173
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,420
dubai shopping trips

174
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,330
in fact i know her before
becoming a star

175
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,374
that's why you print all negative
stories about me what she gave you

176
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,248
you are the associate editor
of mumbai dehli

177
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,410
filmstar's friendships are not with you

178
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,453
but with your position

179
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,283
i am having dinner with your
group editor

180
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,486
we will must talk about you

181
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,305
where are you?
You supposed to come here

182
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,405
pack up fortoday!

183
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,419
Today is the last day

184
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,379
tell them that i got food poison

185
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,427
tell the boss that i am in van

186
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,467
you left your shooting and
came to my shooting

187
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,504
without informing me,
you are spying on me

188
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,446
why?
I can't come

189
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,347
this love scene wasn't in script

190
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,309
film is about to release in one month

191
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,316
so suddenly where this scene
came from?

192
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,483
Directorthought that this scene is
important for second half so he added

193
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,257
really?

194
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,251
So why you didn't tell me?

195
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,398
What do you mean?

196
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,435
Since when we discussed our scenes?

197
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,491
Why we can't discuss?

198
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,268
We are getting married

199
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,467
real problem is that...

200
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,401
that you don't want to commit

201
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,348
so you always have your macho
playboy lmage

202
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,281
and you can add these scenes with your
heroines wheneveryou want

203
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,354
i am taking divorce with eesha and
what else you want

204
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,482
you are not taking divorce
because of me

205
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,358
i am with you since one year

206
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,396
and you have filed your divorce
one and half year ago...

207
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,305
it's very dangerous to perform
these stunts

208
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,442
i will also become a hero
like my papa

209
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,506
i will do superman movies

210
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,472
how many times i told you don't
talk to strangers

211
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,510
you started playing with anyone

212
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,250
let's go!

213
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,267
Aryan is with you

214
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,242
he is giving divorce to eesha

215
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,506
so if he won't show her angerto
you then what else she will do

216
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,250
aryan should have control her

217
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,344
he didn't said anything to her

218
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,379
but how he would say something,
he was in the middle of short

219
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,495
whateverthis eesha does?

220
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,261
Aryan is serious about you

221
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,399
what else you want?

222
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,462
If he is really serious about you

223
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,396
then why did he stop you to
come in rohan's party

224
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,333
he didn't said that don't come
in party

225
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,435
hejust said come in the party
when eesha will be gone

226
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,379
rohan is also your good co-star

227
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,449
and he invited you as well

228
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,382
why you can't be there?

229
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,487
Ofcourse! She can go,
but a little later

230
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,504
it's our anniversary and you are
thoughing party in your house

231
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,408
that was zara's idea

232
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,490
these actresses are amazing

233
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,383
she is getting close to the wife

234
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,387
because she is expecting movie
with rohan

235
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,421
she is a fraud

236
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,494
who is not a fraud in this
glamour industry

237
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,362
and by the way sheena was
also an actress

238
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,269
she will make sure that she don't
get any movie

239
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,315
what's the report?

240
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,386
Sameer khan is recommending her

241
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,223
she is a good actress but...

242
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,292
i have heard she doesn't meet anyone
after pack up

243
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,227
you have great knowledge about her

244
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,303
before this romeo got that juliet

245
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,328
i will have to make one movie
with her

246
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,474
it's yourfirst anniversary

247
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,234
otherwise you will need my
divorce lawyer

248
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,320
come on!
After all you are my sister

249
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,422
it's not so easy to spend a year
with rohan

250
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,417
what a surprise?
Why?

251
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,509
You thought i won't come

252
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,419
i have told you don't come here

253
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,380
please leave!
Why?

254
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,479
Rohan is also my friend

255
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,327
i am also invited

256
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,258
please don't be dramatic

257
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,262
and go from here

258
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,431
what's the problem?

259
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,459
Everybody knows about us here

260
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,338
why do you hide?

261
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,236
It's not the right place to
discuss all these things

262
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,273
don't be afraid

263
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,381
no matter what you treat me badly

264
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,382
i will never embarass you

265
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,393
give me a vodka!

266
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,434
You are leaving!

267
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,435
At least finish your drink

268
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,325
it's finished

269
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,237
i am not going anywhere

270
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,471
youjust think about your image

271
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,347
did you everthink what everyone
speak about me

272
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,293
and by the way i was leaving
that place

273
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,328
why did she need to talk to me?

274
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,368
At least finish your drink!

275
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,470
She provoked me

276
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,333
you never said anything to her

277
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,442
so i said it!

278
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,223
Whenever i am talking about our self

279
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,419
you always speak nothing...

280
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,448
i was taking much pressure before
yesterday's sixer

281
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,273
then what you have done?

282
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,418
Whenever i couldn't concentrate

283
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,256
so i sing a song

284
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,349
bowler gone to his runner up

285
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,284
and i started singing

286
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,426
i was singing

287
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,506
my entire team will be thankful to
you my century

288
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,344
and me too

289
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,439
thankful!
Amazing!

290
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,389
Excatly come out from the restaurant
in ten minutes

291
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,263

292
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,303
Shall we?
Sure!

293
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,232
How are you?

294
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,334
How are you mahi?
I am fine

295
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,234
i am shooting on next floor,

296
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,275
i am also shooting on this floor

297
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,411
so why are you sitting here?

298
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,480
Sit in your van,

299
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,370
i think they don't have it

300
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,218
and it'sjust three days work

301
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,320
so they didn't gave me,
they didn't?

302
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,518
You are from production?
Yes!

303
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,260
Where is her van?

304
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,292
Forget it!
What should i tell you?

305
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,199
This producer's wife is having
account for everything

306
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,406
so how do i bring van for
character artist

307
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,442
you tell me!

308
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,440
You come with me,
i'll manage!

309
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,404
When her shot will be ready

310
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,376
then call herfrom my van

311
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,227
why you become so upset?

312
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,228
I am addicted of these things

313
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,433
we didn't had vans in ourtime

314
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,269
where we were

315
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,463
we sat under umbrella

316
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,329
and we started shooting

317
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:49,277
you must had problems in those days
without privacy

318
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,401
i don't know...

319
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,341
entire film unit sit and stood together

320
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,311
directors, hero, heroines,

321
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,347
everybody worked happily

322
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,356
that's why

323
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,352
i neverfelt problem

324
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,224
that's why

325
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:11,229
we gave much values to relationships

326
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,427
fame and success

327
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,301
but we become actresses for
fame and success

328
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,465
yes!
We do...

329
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:23,269
but fame snatch alot from us as
much it gave us

330
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:27,315
we don't see anything in glamour

331
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,451
that how much we have lost?

332
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,479
And when we find out

333
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,253
then it's too late,

334
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,456
everything is going on perfect timeline

335
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,458
in four month we got 7
airline endorsments

336
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,327
11 high profile events

337
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,302
and you are on all cover pages

338
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,300
that's alright but you are a heroine

339
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,540
you should sign a film

340
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:05,454
a heroine got adds and endorsments
from her movies

341
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,357
and it's high time that you sign
a huge movie

342
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,489
he is making a south remake

343
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,423
entire movie will be shoot abroad

344
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
if you will get this movie

345
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,373
but i have heard that he is
considering riya mehra

346
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,444
and gayatri is desperately trying
forthis movie

347
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,347
so what are my chances?

348
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,374
We will find out when you will try

349
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,354
ratheryou defeat riya and gayatri
in this race

350
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,382
rather sitting here and get defeated

351
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,381
i am on shoot,
i will talk to you later

352
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,452
tell him to talk with rasheed bhai
and finalize it in 20

353
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,333
you will charge money to your mom
for a social cause

354
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,360
it's ruling party
they have alot of money

355
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,306
i am taking 20 cause of you

356
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,307
i have promised to pratab

357
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,419
she is celebrating her 25th birthday
from last 5 years

358
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,526
people said like that for
every heroine

359
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,265
you don't know about her

360
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:05,304
i know her when she was a model
for 2000 per day

361
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:10,243
she knows how to reach on time

362
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,505
and she will do anything forthat

363
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,349
anything!

364
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,475
Minimum 31!

365
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,376
She is 31 years

366
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,520
she has changed her age in birth
certificate and passport

367
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,418
i know everything

368
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,429
that bad boys movie was released.

369
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,265
She got her passport before
that movie

370
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,397
i am not interested in her gossip

371
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,372
what i forgot?

372
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,274

373
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,343
Work stress!

374
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,412
If i won't anything soon then my
career will be down

375
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,376
you have offers for many films

376
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,344
you are doing adds

377
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,421
media is writing about us

378
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,417
i have many film offers

379
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,420
but nothing interesting

380
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,465
and nothing happens with adds
and magazines

381
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,402

426
01:16:14,982 --> 01:16:15,971

435
01:17:15,209 --> 01:17:17,177
This was mahi's idea

436
01:17:29,123 --> 01:17:32,058

442
01:18:30,084 --> 01:18:32,985
make a solo poster of gayatri

443
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:36,123

But...

444
01:18:37,024 --> 01:18:38,013
mahi is the heroine

445
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:45,054
i am handling the entire movie

446
01:18:46,067 --> 01:18:47,034

450
01:20:26,067 --> 01:20:28,160
nobody can stop it,
you were recommending mahi in our movie

451
01:20:29,136 --> 01:20:31,195
she have 8 scenes in movie and she
couldn't do that properly

452
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:36,031
we need actress

453
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,189
you have done that song besides
your busy schedule

454
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:09,065

It's not fair...

455
01:21:11,112 --> 01:21:12,101
i am not in movie

456
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,174
you know abbas

457
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:20,111
after movie shooting he controls from
editing to publicity design

458
01:21:21,055 --> 01:21:22,215
he didn't let me sit in editing

459
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:28,028
look at the public reaction

460
01:21:29,196 --> 01:21:32,131
trade pandits are saying that this
movie will make 150 crores

461
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:34,059
now whoever is hit in this industry

462
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:43,076

463
01:21:54,989 --> 01:21:56,217
mind blowing!
That will hit 100 crores

464
01:22:10,204 --> 01:22:11,967
mahi looks upset!

465
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:13,969
Her role has been cut

466
01:22:14,008 --> 01:22:15,236
what will happen to being upset

467
01:22:16,143 --> 01:22:17,110
she messed up with abbas

468
01:22:19,213 --> 01:22:21,113
if she will upset the heroes

469
01:22:22,082 --> 01:22:24,141
then she will be on stamp size
on posters

470
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:39,224
not a single review praised me

471
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:43,170
every critics said that abbas is a star
and mahi is a show piece

472
01:22:50,144 --> 01:22:52,112
you have already got three calls
for endorsments

473
01:22:52,213 --> 01:22:54,113
you had offers of two big movies

474
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:05,147

475
01:23:14,068 --> 01:23:15,092
Am i a good actress?

476
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:20,040
You are a star!

477
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:22,107
You don't need to be an actress

478
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:24,075
yes!

479
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:26,944

01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:49,192
You know that i am a century film maker

483
01:23:51,138 --> 01:23:54,164
my movie is about prostetution

484
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:58,006
it has sex, abuses...

485
01:23:59,246 --> 01:24:01,043
i make realistic movies

486
01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:04,050
and you are the commercial heroine

487
01:24:05,953 --> 01:24:07,079
my movie budget is low

488
01:24:08,255 --> 01:24:11,986
and big heroines like you have
big attitudes

489
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,028

494
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,115

495
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:43,979
You are such a good actress

496
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,180
that pain inside you

497
01:35:49,055 --> 01:35:52,218

will touch you

498
01:35:59,966 --> 01:36:01,024
how many bo yfriends you have?

499
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:05,972

501
01:36:20,987 --> 01:36:21,248

503
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,106

504
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:26,018

506
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,114
It was nothing

507
01:37:59,052 --> 01:38:00,110
now listen!

508
01:38:01,955 --> 01:38:02,979
Awhore had four lovers

509
01:38:04,124 --> 01:38:04,988
one was inside

510
01:38:05,225 --> 01:38:06,089
one was outside

511
01:38:07,026 --> 01:38:07,993
third lover was sick

512
01:38:08,194 --> 01:38:10,025
and fourth was ready

513
01:38:16,035 --> 01:38:18,026
get off from here

514
01:38:19,973 --> 01:38:20,997
you are stealing tarannum's money

515
01:38:45,965 --> 01:38:46,932
listen to me!

516
01:38:50,003 --> 01:38:50,970
Whatever happened that day...

517
01:39:07,153 --> 01:39:09,121
anyway!
That special appearance

518
01:39:11,024 --> 01:39:11,991
that's finished today

519
01:39:13,059 --> 01:39:13,991
i am going back to calcutta

520
01:39:14,994 --> 01:39:16,120
it was really nice working with you

521
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,093
i am sorry that we couldn't
be friends...

522
01:39:37,116 --> 01:39:38,083
take care!

523
01:39:53,132 --> 01:39:54,156
We had a nice weekend

524
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:57,999
i don't know why did i came airport
to drop you

525
01:39:58,037 --> 01:39:59,971
nothing will happen to irretate

526
01:40:00,206 --> 01:40:02,003
you know that i am telling the truth

527
01:40:02,141 --> 01:40:05,008
and you know it's not easy to take
these decisions

528
01:40:05,144 --> 01:40:06,202
but why it's not so easy?

529
01:40:07,113 --> 01:40:10,082
You always said that aryan is not
ready to give you commitment

530
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,041
and now angat wants to marry you

531
01:40:13,186 --> 01:40:15,154
then what's the problem?
Don't you love him?

532
01:40:16,089 --> 01:40:17,078
Ofcourse i love him

533
01:40:18,157 --> 01:40:20,216
but right now i want to concentrate
on my career

534
01:40:21,961 --> 01:40:22,985
and he also have a career

535
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,122
so what's the hurry for marriage?

536
01:40:29,102 --> 01:40:32,128
It's your decision to get married
or not with angat

537
01:40:33,273 --> 01:40:35,207
but i am clearly telling you one thing

538
01:40:36,075 --> 01:40:38,100
what's inside in your heart,
just tell him clearly

539
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:42,946
what aryan has done with you don't
do that with him

540
01:40:55,962 --> 01:40:58,226
everyone told me that you won't
marry with me

541
01:41:03,069 --> 01:41:04,229
i didn't refuse for marriage

542
01:41:05,204 --> 01:41:08,002
ljust said that right now we need to
give time to our careers

543
01:41:09,008 --> 01:41:10,032
so what's the hurry of wedding?

544
01:41:13,112 --> 01:41:15,103
You have ruined my entire year
to said it

545
01:41:16,249 --> 01:41:17,978
how much more time you need?

546
01:41:20,253 --> 01:41:21,185
It's all your excuses

547
01:41:22,955 --> 01:41:25,924
when you heroines got love so you
need career

548
01:41:25,992 --> 01:41:27,084
and when you got career so
you need love

549
01:41:29,962 --> 01:41:31,987
and your career is not gonna over
to get marry with me

550
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:34,131
i was a fool

551
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:37,966
i thought you are different
from everyone

552
01:41:39,138 --> 01:41:41,003
there is nothing in this
film industry

553
01:41:42,275 --> 01:41:44,004
i wanted to take you along

554
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:53,950
but enough!

555
01:42:00,093 --> 01:42:02,061
You actresses can't do the real love

556
01:42:03,096 --> 01:42:04,222
only you can act for love

557
01:42:06,966 --> 01:42:09,093
please! Relax!
You can only use the people

558
01:43:02,155 --> 01:43:03,122
you can't do it

559
01:43:03,256 --> 01:43:05,019
how could you stop this movie

560
01:43:05,992 --> 01:43:07,016
i can do everything

561
01:43:09,095 --> 01:43:11,222
he is teaching film making to
national award winning film director

562
01:43:12,064 --> 01:43:13,190
sometimes he said that film
is very serious

563
01:43:13,232 --> 01:43:15,063
sometimes he said put some
comedy track in the film

564
01:43:15,134 --> 01:43:16,226
sometimes he said put an item
song in the film

565
01:43:17,203 --> 01:43:19,000
now he is teaching me film making

566
01:43:19,138 --> 01:43:20,070
i will talk to him

567
01:43:20,106 --> 01:43:21,164
everything will be sort out,
no!

568
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:23,230
Nothing will sort out!

569
01:43:24,143 --> 01:43:26,008
I have decided that i won't
do this film

570
01:43:28,214 --> 01:43:30,944
how could you leave this film?

571
01:43:31,184 --> 01:43:33,175
I haven't got another work
forthis movie

572
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,178
no films, no endorsments.

573
01:43:36,189 --> 01:43:38,089
And you will drop this movie
in the middle

574
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:49,059
i know that you worked hard for
this movie

575
01:43:52,104 --> 01:43:54,004
this experience you got
in this film

576
01:43:58,044 --> 01:43:59,033
then you will miss me

577
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:30,065
stop it!
I don't want to go anywhere...

578
01:44:37,016 --> 01:44:39,951
you have to be a good friend to make
a true friend

579
01:44:41,053 --> 01:44:44,955
and filmstars couldn't think about
anyone else

580
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:48,093
if mahi would have her own that

581
01:44:48,961 --> 01:44:50,087
she won't be afraid from inside

582
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,997
she wouldn't made so many mistakes

583
01:44:56,202 --> 01:44:58,102
and mahi is giving it'a punishment
to her own self

584
01:45:01,007 --> 01:45:03,134
old rivals and new girls took
her place

585
01:45:04,143 --> 01:45:07,135
finally there was only shagufta rizvi

586
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,106
where mahi felt betterto meet her

587
01:45:10,182 --> 01:45:11,979
when she met her in those days

588
01:45:12,985 --> 01:45:16,045
i have written that mahi is responsible
of her own condition

589
01:45:17,089 --> 01:45:18,989
but either it's your or someone
else mistake

590
01:45:20,026 --> 01:45:21,118
you feel the same pain

591
01:45:23,162 --> 01:45:27,963
she have done everything to
get rid of that pain

592
01:45:28,134 --> 01:45:29,158
so what did you decide?

593
01:45:30,102 --> 01:45:32,093
I have heard that you are taking
psychactrict treatment

594
01:45:33,973 --> 01:45:36,100
and you have mentioned in form

595
01:45:37,043 --> 01:45:38,237
that you are alcohol addicted

596
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:44,205
yourfamily background and
professional life

597
01:45:45,117 --> 01:45:49,213
after scrutinise both our panel
has decided

598
01:45:50,156 --> 01:45:52,989
that you are not able to become
singal parent

599
01:45:57,096 --> 01:45:58,063
i am not able...

600
01:46:02,101 --> 01:46:03,125
how did they decide?

601
01:46:05,037 --> 01:46:06,004
Did they ever seen me?

602
01:46:07,173 --> 01:46:08,140
Did they ever met me?

603
01:46:09,175 --> 01:46:12,167
After giving these papers how did
you decide that i am not able?

604
01:46:19,085 --> 01:46:23,146
You need patience and emotional
control to become a good parent

605
01:46:25,157 --> 01:46:27,125
and you don't have both qualities

606
01:46:28,995 --> 01:46:30,053
practice for more few years

607
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:32,998
apply again

608
01:46:36,969 --> 01:46:37,230
you can't do it

609
01:46:51,217 --> 01:46:53,082
i am not able to become a mom

610
01:47:06,165 --> 01:47:07,097
what is this?

611
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,134
You should be happy

612
01:47:10,102 --> 01:47:12,195
so what if you couldn't have adaption?
After all you are front page news

613
01:47:13,139 --> 01:47:15,130
nowadays you will have to pay for
these coverage

614
01:47:18,244 --> 01:47:20,109
how did you gave this story without
my permission

615
01:47:23,049 --> 01:47:24,175
now i will need have to ask
foryour permission

616
01:47:26,152 --> 01:47:27,084
you forgot that time

617
01:47:31,123 --> 01:47:32,112
so you didn't had any objection

618
01:47:36,062 --> 01:47:37,188
because it's my personal life

619
01:47:42,134 --> 01:47:45,069
in our industry there is no difference
between personal and professional life

620
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:48,206
your life is a public property

621
01:47:49,075 --> 01:47:51,009
whom i have used and plan for
your comeback

622
01:47:52,011 --> 01:47:53,103
what you have totally ruined

623
01:47:55,214 --> 01:47:58,047
these are my p. R skills that you are
still in news

624
01:47:58,984 --> 01:48:01,145
so you got publicity and you should
become little bit interesting

625
01:48:02,221 --> 01:48:03,210
otherwise what else you have?

626
01:48:17,002 --> 01:48:17,969
Get out right now!

627
01:48:32,184 --> 01:48:33,151
You couldn't hearthe truth

628
01:48:34,987 --> 01:48:35,954
someone said the right!

629
01:48:37,022 --> 01:48:37,989
There are humans...

630
01:48:49,068 --> 01:48:51,195
mahi gave you two super hit movies

631
01:48:52,204 --> 01:48:53,228
one with mr. Rohan...

632
01:48:55,074 --> 01:48:57,065
she have right to do another
movie with you

633
01:48:58,110 --> 01:48:59,202
you know very well

634
01:49:00,045 --> 01:49:02,104
industry's equation is depend on
friday to friday

635
01:49:03,182 --> 01:49:05,980
and mahi's last hit film was
abbas film

636
01:49:06,218 --> 01:49:07,185
and that was one year ago

637
01:49:08,988 --> 01:49:10,046
and her problems with heroes

638
01:49:11,123 --> 01:49:13,114
not another hero would like
to work with her

639
01:49:16,028 --> 01:49:16,995
her madness,

640
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:20,994
which prostitute movie sha had done

641
01:49:23,102 --> 01:49:24,228
she has wasted nine months

642
01:49:25,237 --> 01:49:27,205
and in these nine months so many
fresh faces have arrived

643
01:49:28,107 --> 01:49:29,972
and industry doesn't wait
for anyone

644
01:49:31,177 --> 01:49:32,166
nor mahi is professional

645
01:49:33,112 --> 01:49:34,977
neither she have box office success

646
01:49:35,147 --> 01:49:36,978
listen to my advice

647
01:49:37,149 --> 01:49:39,083
tell mahi that get any
reality show

648
01:49:40,019 --> 01:49:42,078
or marry with rich n.i. R...

649
01:59:47,159 --> 01:59:49,059
this movie has investment of 150 crores

650
01:59:52,164 --> 01:59:54,098
we can't make it more risky to
take mahi in this movie

651
01:59:56,268 --> 01:59:57,166
what did you said?

652
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:05,974
But our company is new,
this is our launcing movie

653
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:10,011
everything should be new...

654
02:00:11,249 --> 02:00:13,114
and audience have already seen
you and mahi

655
02:00:14,052 --> 02:00:15,952
and audience like us alot,
people like you

656
02:00:18,256 --> 02:00:21,054
you also know that audience always
need fresh pairing

657
02:00:22,027 --> 02:00:23,153
and i have spoke to distributor

658
02:00:24,029 --> 02:00:25,223
they are excited if we take
shaheen khan

659
02:00:27,132 --> 02:00:29,100
she gave two super hit movies

660
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:34,205
you have already spoke to her

661
02:00:36,975 --> 02:00:39,034
i havejust spoken to her secretary

662
02:00:44,149 --> 02:00:47,050
look! I have promised this movie
with mahi

663
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,018
that's why you are become
very emotional

664
02:01:00,131 --> 02:01:03,032
i was suggest that keep seperate your
professional and personal life

665
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:08,105
besides i am not refusing you that
don't work with mahi

666
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:10,232
we will adjust her in next movie

667
02:01:11,977 --> 02:01:14,172
but she is not good for his movie
as per budget

668
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:19,979
so less media is here

669
02:01:20,151 --> 02:01:21,049
what we will talk?

670
02:01:21,987 --> 02:01:22,214
What we do?

671
02:01:23,088 --> 02:01:24,020
There are two big events today

672
02:01:24,155 --> 02:01:25,122
i think everybody is gone there

673
02:01:25,223 --> 02:01:26,986
they have promised that they
will come

674
02:01:28,226 --> 02:01:30,023
you should have change the
conference date

675
02:01:30,962 --> 02:01:32,190
what's the meaning of
incomplete conference

676
02:01:40,972 --> 02:01:43,031
i have heard that you and aryan
are getting married

677
02:01:43,975 --> 02:01:46,136
so it means that you are going
to be retired

678
02:01:48,179 --> 02:01:50,113
we have come to speak about
this movie

679
02:01:53,051 --> 02:01:54,951
i don't want to answer any
personal questions

680
02:01:56,021 --> 02:01:57,079
i have request to you

681
02:01:58,089 --> 02:01:59,954
thatjust ask me professional questions

682
02:02:00,058 --> 02:02:01,025
you are right!

683
02:02:01,993 --> 02:02:04,086
So we came here for any
professional discussions

684
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:06,220
so please answerthe
professional question

685
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:11,100
rumours are that you have been
signed for aryan's home production

686
02:02:12,003 --> 02:02:14,062
but now shaheen khan has
replaced you

687
02:02:14,973 --> 02:02:18,136
this decision has been taken because
of your law market position

688
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,099
your response!

689
02:02:21,046 --> 02:02:22,980
You media person should write
film scripts

690
02:02:24,049 --> 02:02:25,209
to take out your personal enmity

691
02:02:26,084 --> 02:02:27,051
you make stories

692
02:02:30,021 --> 02:02:30,988
if heroine got the car

693
02:02:31,156 --> 02:02:32,180
so businessman gifted her

694
02:02:33,024 --> 02:02:35,049
she bought a diamond so
she got engagement

695
02:02:35,961 --> 02:02:37,189
if she is gone to hospital for check up
so she got abortion

696
02:02:37,262 --> 02:02:39,093
if she is gone to l. A so she
got plastic surgery

697
02:02:40,165 --> 02:02:41,189
and god forbid if she is gone to dubai

698
02:02:42,167 --> 02:02:43,156
so you made her rate card

699
02:02:45,103 --> 02:02:46,229
people should learn from you
to make stories

700
02:02:47,105 --> 02:02:48,231
you are getting digrace

701
02:02:49,174 --> 02:02:51,142
you are still not answering
the answer

702
02:02:52,043 --> 02:02:55,171
you know that you have been out
from aryan's home production

703
02:02:56,982 --> 02:02:57,971
this rumour is wrong

704
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,047
i am the heroine of
aryan's movie

705
02:03:04,022 --> 02:03:05,011
have you got your answer?

706
02:03:09,094 --> 02:03:10,186
And do you have any question
regarding this movie?

707
02:03:13,064 --> 02:03:14,031
Do you have any question?

708
02:03:18,203 --> 02:03:19,135
I guess not!

709
02:03:31,016 --> 02:03:34,076
I am trying since long,
why you're not picking up the phone?

710
02:03:34,185 --> 02:03:35,152
I was in press conference

711
02:03:36,121 --> 02:03:37,213
i wanted to talk about that

712
02:03:38,223 --> 02:03:41,192
there is a buzz in entire media that
shaheen is replacing you

713
02:03:43,194 --> 02:03:45,992
that tamanna has asked me,
story is right

714
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:48,190
you know ljust spoke to
shaheen's secretary

715
02:03:48,967 --> 02:03:49,991
even dates are also discussed

716
02:03:50,969 --> 02:03:53,028
and shaheen is doing aryan's movie,
not you!

717
02:04:16,027 --> 02:04:16,994
I have to talk to you

718
02:04:29,207 --> 02:04:30,174
did you speak with alex?

719
02:04:31,009 --> 02:04:32,067
I have told you that i didn't
speak with alex

720
02:04:35,213 --> 02:04:36,145
so i am still in the movie

721
02:04:40,151 --> 02:04:41,209
i have spoken to alex

722
02:04:46,057 --> 02:04:48,958
but we didn't take any decision,

723
02:04:49,094 --> 02:04:50,994
he wanted that we should
sign shaheen

724
02:04:51,062 --> 02:04:53,053
and after hearing shaheen's name
you have gone insane

725
02:04:54,132 --> 02:04:56,032
you couldn't say that i am
in this movie

726
02:04:56,101 --> 02:04:57,068
this movie is still yours

727
02:04:58,103 --> 02:04:59,195
just let me talk to alex

728
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:07,976
everything will be fine

729
02:05:10,215 --> 02:05:12,115
you have said it on eesha's time

730
02:05:13,118 --> 02:05:14,210
i shouldn't trust you

731
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:23,120
it's not a big deal like you
are making

732
02:05:26,998 --> 02:05:27,225
so why don't you say...

733
02:05:28,166 --> 02:05:29,190
that i am the heroine of this movie

734
02:05:30,101 --> 02:05:31,125
because i will have to speak
with alex

735
02:05:32,137 --> 02:05:35,072
we will have to take many decisions,

736
02:05:36,074 --> 02:05:38,133
i am still saying i will sort
out everything

737
02:05:39,077 --> 02:05:40,977
today i am not a heroine of a
big movie

738
02:05:43,148 --> 02:05:44,172
that's why you are doing it all

739
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,018
then tell me

740
02:05:52,056 --> 02:05:53,114
tell me that i am the heroine of
this movie

741
02:05:57,195 --> 02:05:58,992
i am the heroine of this movie

742
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:03,098
for me yes

743
02:06:07,205 --> 02:06:08,934
what an answer?

744
02:06:11,976 --> 02:06:13,000
You can't be loyal to anyone

745
02:06:43,174 --> 02:06:44,198
you know the media

746
02:06:45,176 --> 02:06:47,144
discuss anything and media make
it news

747
02:06:50,081 --> 02:06:51,173
nobody else knows this thing

748
02:06:54,252 --> 02:06:56,015
i will make this movie only
with mahi

749
02:06:56,221 --> 02:06:58,212
why you are become so emotional
with mahi

750
02:06:59,057 --> 02:07:00,183
it's not an emotional decision

751
02:07:01,159 --> 02:07:02,057
read the script!

752
02:07:04,162 --> 02:07:06,187
If this movie will be made so it will
be made with mahi

753
02:07:40,131 --> 02:07:40,961
what happen?

754
02:07:42,133 --> 02:07:43,100
Your dehli ticket!

755
02:07:43,201 --> 02:07:45,066
You will have to leave from here,
you are getting late

756
02:07:47,071 --> 02:07:48,003
cancel it!

757
02:07:48,139 --> 02:07:50,198
How could we cancel?
People are waiting there

758
02:08:10,061 --> 02:08:11,028

759
02:08:51,202 --> 02:08:52,100
Yes!

760
02:08:53,137 --> 02:08:54,001
Where are you?

761
02:08:54,205 --> 02:08:55,194
I am at home

762
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,072
come at my house

763
02:09:08,219 --> 02:09:09,948
i will tell you at home

764
02:09:11,022 --> 02:09:12,148
how do i come at this time?

765
02:09:16,094 --> 02:09:17,152
Come at my house

766
02:09:25,203 --> 02:09:26,966
he got shaheen in that movie

767
02:09:38,049 --> 02:09:39,016
i can't do anything...

768
02:14:40,117 --> 02:14:41,175
film got the bumper opening

769
02:14:42,053 --> 02:14:44,044
multiplex and single screens
are rocking

770
02:16:05,136 --> 02:16:06,160
you also thinks that this is wrong

771
02:16:07,972 --> 02:16:08,199
who cares?

772
02:16:11,075 --> 02:16:13,168
Film got the bumper opening

773
02:16:15,179 --> 02:16:19,138
95./. In multiplexes and single screens

774
02:16:21,218 --> 02:16:23,118
if it's the matter of right and wrong

775
02:16:25,256 --> 02:16:26,188
i don't know...

776
02:16:28,125 --> 02:16:31,219
ljust know that from which mahi
i met 10 years ago

777
02:16:32,196 --> 02:16:33,026
that mahi...

778
02:16:34,231 --> 02:16:37,223
should ask this question before
it's all done

779
02:16:39,103 --> 02:16:39,967
not later...

780
02:16:45,042 --> 02:16:46,168
here's the dates diary

781
02:16:50,047 --> 02:16:51,071
you don't need me anymore

782
02:17:18,075 --> 02:17:19,099
media is waiting outside

783
02:17:21,178 --> 02:17:22,167
you will have to say something

784
02:17:25,149 --> 02:17:26,081
did mahi's movie succeed?

785
02:17:28,252 --> 02:17:30,220
After such a big scandal movie
must have to succeed

786
02:17:34,191 --> 02:17:35,158
then what else we have to speak

787
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:34,017
she couldn't talk

788
02:18:34,184 --> 02:18:35,981
but i will must give heryour message

789
02:18:41,158 --> 02:18:44,992
she is getting so many offers that
mahi is going to be busy for 2 years

790
02:18:55,205 --> 02:18:56,069
did you see?

791
02:18:57,007 --> 02:18:57,974
That's our industry!

792
02:19:07,017 --> 02:19:08,177
Did you decide which dress you
will wear in success party

793
02:19:21,065 --> 02:19:22,032
people won't remember it all

794
02:19:24,001 --> 02:19:25,969
people will forget this controversy
in few days

795
02:19:29,073 --> 02:19:30,040
you should also forget that...

796
02:21:05,002 --> 02:21:07,095
entire media was looking for mahi

797
02:21:07,171 --> 02:21:09,196
and she came in shagufta's funeral

798
02:21:10,974 --> 02:21:12,100
tell everyone to send theirteams

799
02:22:36,126 --> 02:22:37,184
please tell us!

800

What's the secret of sex scam?

801
02:25:20,157 --> 02:25:21,124
Are you mahi arora?

802
02:25:28,231 --> 02:25:32,133
And this answer has solved
mahi's complicated life

803
02:25:33,136 --> 02:25:37,004
which happiness she was looking
in the sky

804
02:25:37,975 --> 02:25:40,967
she found that happiness to become
a part of crowd...
