1
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,001
Hey.

2
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,710
You haven't changed. Please, take a seat.

3
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,630
How is your sister?

4
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,881
I have three sisters.

5
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,635
The one with the big tits.
The one I always wanted to fuck.

6
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,475
I hear good things, Latif.

7
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,432
It says here you can shoot straight.

8
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,560
Officer material, promoted already.
Lieutenant.

9
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,234
Please, help yourself.

10
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,905
Juice?

11
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,661
I won't keep you guessing, Latif.

12
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,371
I want you to come and work for me.

13
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,507
- Work for you?
- Here, in Baghdad.

14
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,342
Like old friends.

15
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,341
- We were friends, weren't we, at school?
- Classmates.

16
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,433
Didn't you once paint a picture
of my father?

17
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,134
- You still have it?
- I gave it to you.

18
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,352
I have an awful feeling
I told him I did it myself.

19
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,275
Do you know who this is?

20
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,228
- Of course.
- No, no, no.

21
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,109
It is not who you think it is.

22
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,065
His name is Faoaz al-Emari.

23
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,990
Not Saddam. I see him all of the time.

24
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,823
In the newspapers, in the magazines,
on television.

25
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,704
Even I cannot tell who is who.

26
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,036
It is not so unusual, Latif.

27
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,748
Stalin had a double. He had dozens.
So did the Shah.

28
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,207
The country is at war.

29
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,384
My father cannot be expected
to be everywhere at once.

30
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,214
Half the time there is no good reason,
but the people, they expect it.

31
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,550
Add to that there is always the chance
some fucked-up Shi'a scum

32
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,601
will take a shot at him.

33
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,847
Look at yourself, Latif.

34
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,274
Look. Look, look.

35
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,397
Look at me.

36
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,944
We could be twins, no?

37
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,984
You are taller.

38
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,066
How much? This much?

39
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,032
Didn't they used to say
you looked like Uday Saddam Hussein?

40
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,159
Didn't they used to say that at school?

41
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,241
I want you, Latif.

42
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,086
I want you to be my fidai.

43
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,249
I want you to be my brother.

44
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,423
Don't say anything.

45
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,596
Take 10 minutes.

46
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,674
Think it over.

47
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,261
What happens if I say no?

48
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,017
T en minutes.

49
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,333
He is shitting bricks.

50
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,958
His grandfather was a Kurd. It's a pity.

51
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,756
But the family's been in Baghdad
a long time.

52
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,379
His father's done well.

53
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,095
I believe he sells domestic appliances.

54
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,924
He's never said a word against the party.

55
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,558
Latif is the best we could find.
And we looked.

56
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,639
Well, I have to have him.

57
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,320
You will have whatever you want.

58
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,740
Everything I own will belong to you.

59
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,985
Uday,

60
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,950
I am my father's son.

61
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,663
I would give my last drop of blood for Iraq.

62
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,710
But when this war is over,
I'm going to work in his business.

63
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,259
I am the eldest son.

64
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,881
I have brothers and sisters.
I have given them my word.

65
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,971
- Sleep on it.
- Uday...

66
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,474
You are asking me to

67
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,602
extinguish myself.

68
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,206
Thought it over?

69
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,078
Please be clear about this, Latif.

70
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,000
Uday has chosen you. You belong to him.

71
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,962
You have about five minutes
to think about this

72
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,550
before a car pulls up
outside your house in Al-Adhamiya

73
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,960
and your family, every one of them,

74
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,390
your father, your mother,
your sisters and brothers,

75
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,972
is thrown into Abu Ghraib.

76
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,305
God willing, they will die quickly.

77
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,898
I've said too much.
You have about two minutes left.

78
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,911
You'll have a cook and four maids.

79
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,831
These pretty girls will get you
anything you feel like.

80
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,582
Strawberries in winter, figs in July.
Just ask.

81
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,883
But lay a finger on one of them
without prior permission

82
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,508
and you'll never walk upright again.

83
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,304
And these are Uday's rooms.

84
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,853
He wants you to use them,
now that you are to be his brother.

85
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,983
Leather sofas, Italian marble,
all designed by Gianfranco Giannelli.

86
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,316
Handmade shoes, suits,

87
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,490
Brioni, Versace, Armani, of course.

88
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:10,286
Silk ties, watches. Breitling, Cartier, Rolex.

89
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,079
Silk pajamas.

90
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,533
These are very nice.

91
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,243
Poor child never knows what to wear.

92
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,124
He changes his mind every five minutes.

93
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,921
Depends on what car he's driving.

94
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,752
Honestly, habibi, that boy, he wears me out.

95
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,462
You should probably clean yourself up.

96
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,114
No calls.

97
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,662
Incoming, yes. Outgoing, no.

98
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,720
My name is Munem Hammed al-Tikriti.

99
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,933
We're going to be seeing
a lot of each other.

100
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,688
I write to my mother once a week.

101
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,107
She's going to think that I got killed in Iran.

102
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,821
Inshallah.

103
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,774
Inshallah?

104
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,609
My family are going to think that I'm dead.

105
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,867
Let them think you died a martyr.

106
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,664
I know it's difficult,
but it's what Uday wants.

107
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,458
He will accept nothing less.

108
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,379
She will be knocking on the door
of every hospital in Baghdad.

109
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,424
When you say your prayers tonight,

110
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,049
when you turn out the light
and close your eyes,

111
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,721
this is what
you should be saying to yourself,

112
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,222
"Latif Yahia is dead. He died in Iran.

113
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,145
"May God have mercy on him.

114
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,937
"Now I am Uday Saddam Hussein."

115
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,312
Guten Tag.

116
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,649
Take off your clothes, please.

117
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,663
Cough.

118
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,208
One more time.

119
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,924
And one more time, please.

120
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,185
Uday is three centimeters taller.

121
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,100
We can use built-up shoes.

122
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,572
Look at that. He is perfect.

123
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,697
- Uday, this is boring.
- Shut up.

124
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,036
How can you sit here all night
looking at yourself?

125
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,912
- He looks great.
- He doesn't even look like you.

126
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,166
What?

127
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,997
His cock's too big.

128
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,963
What do you mean, his cock is too big?

129
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,144
Uday's life story. Learn it.

130
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,325
Come on, come on, tell me.

131
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,328
Shape of face, hair, nose, physique,
all in the high 90s.

132
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,751
- Good.
- Your eyes are five millimeters bigger.

133
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,454
- They can use make-up.
- And the teeth? What about the teeth?

134
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,453
Two peas in a pod.

135
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,841
- I was just trying the teeth.
- Smile. Go on, smile.

136
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,169
No, no, no. Like this.

137
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,221
And do the hair. Do the hair.

138
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,098
You like the Rolex.

139
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,429
Keep it.

140
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,236
You look good in blue.

141
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,616
Yes, it definitely suits you.

142
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,532
Latif, hurry up.

143
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,709
- There's too much ice.
- Can I say blue is your color?

144
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,911
Shut up.

145
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,118
I like the way you fight.

146
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,194
You fight like me.

147
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,994
He fights like me.

148
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,872
I had a word with Dr. Linz.

149
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,127
He says your cock's too big.

150
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,834
We need to make a surgical reduction.

151
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,554
- A what?
- Chop a bit off.

152
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,761
- What?
- Not much.

153
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,509
Just a teeny-weeny.

154
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,515
Not much?

155
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,064
My cock is well-known in Baghdad.
The women, they talk.

156
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,810
I'm joking with you, you fuck.

157
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,703
This is Said Kammuneh.

158
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,752
He's a member
of the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

159
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,088
He has something to show you.

160
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,690
This is from the personal collection
of Uday Saddam Hussein.

161
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,659
That guy, he was a police officer.

162
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,166
We were on the same football team.

163
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,791
Great left foot. Good in the air.

164
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,967
I shot this myself. Wait a minute.

165
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,269
Good work, huh?

166
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,689
We got a lot of this shit
from the East Germans and the Russians.

167
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,356
See that guy? That's Rakti, the wrestler.

168
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,654
He won a bronze medal in Moscow.

169
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,486
The President calls him
the sharp sword of the Republic.

170
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,528
You know that gas station
on Haifa Street by the lights?

171
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,738
The President gave him that.

172
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,116
The fat fuck's making 20 grand a month.

173
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,665
That's good money.

174
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,756
Look, I'll leave this with you.

175
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,645
- Seen enough?
- Enough?

176
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,818
Have I seen enough?

177
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,073
I remember the day Saddam Hussein
became president of this country.

178
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,788
I was still in short trousers.
We ran through the streets, shouting,

179
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,367
"Saddam! Saddam Hussein!
Saddam Hussein!" Firing our guns.

180
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,458
Even my father. Even my father.

181
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,958
This stuff, Munem...

182
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,382
These people...
I hope Said said something about this.

183
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,676
They're criminals, deserters.

184
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,095
Pornographers, counterfeiters,
murderers, of course.

185
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,219
Putschists. Enemies of the Republic.

186
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,973
Saddam Hussein built this country.
Never forget that.

187
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,022
The schools, the roads, hospitals,
the mosques.

188
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,766
He gave the Iraqi people
everything they want.

189
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,523
He demands only one thing in return.

190
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,526
Never raise a hand against his family.

191
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,696
Do so and you will suffer.

192
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,449
The people you love will suffer.

193
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,616
Do well here, work hard
and you'll be one of the family.

194
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,166
One day all this will be over. Inshallah.

195
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,168
Inshallah?

196
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,383
Only God knows when.

197
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,771
Come, come, come, come, come.

198
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,867
Munem disapproves. Look at him.

199
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,421
He's angry with me.
He thinks I should leave you at home.

200
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,959
- Who's this?
- Latif? He's my brother.

201
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,847
Nobody must know this,
but Saddam, he has three sons.

202
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,050
You tell anybody this,

203
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,887
I will have to cut your tongue out
with a razor and feed it to the cat.

204
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,441
Everything I own, I give to him.

205
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,901
You don't own me.

206
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,942
Sarrab, best fuck in Beirut.

207
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,870
Loosen your tie. Let me do it for you.

208
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,836
There. Isn't that better?

209
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,883
Be careful what you say.

210
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,378
I can read your mind.

211
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,091
Are you really the President's son?

212
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,347
You know what they say on TV.

213
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,054
We are all the President's sons.

214
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,773
Hey!

215
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,358
Hey!

216
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,374
Look at him.

217
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,378
He can't keep his hands off that drag queen.

218
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,426
Poor Uday.

219
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,849
Sometimes I think he wants
to fuck himself to death.

220
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,894
Will you excuse me a moment?

221
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,485
Keys.

222
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,405
Give me the keys.

223
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,284
Give me the fucking keys!

224
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,001
Baby, I so love your tits!

225
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,504
I hope so, lover. You paid for them.

226
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,650
What have you done with my brother?

227
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,967
You see, Munem?

228
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,510
Discipline. We must have discipline.

229
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,687
If we do not have discipline,
we have no control.

230
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,856
If we have no control, we have chaos.

231
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,434
If we have chaos, we have disorder.

232
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,409
You do understand, Latif? It is quite simple.

233
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,909
We must have discipline.

234
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,870
Got it?

235
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,172
Got it?

236
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,383
Good.

237
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,273
Latif. Five minutes.

238
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,167
Latif.

239
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,368
- No, no, no!
- We must have discipline!

240
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,537
Discipline! We must have discipline!

241
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,723
How was that, Munem?

242
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,559
Excellent.

243
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,017
Sorry.

244
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,238
Good.

245
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,771
Empty your pockets.

246
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,147
My grandfather,

247
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,156
he talks to me the same way he did
when I was 10 years old.

248
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,816
God is great.

249
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,061
He gave me two sons.

250
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,856
Now I have three.

251
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,886
Make sure you give me no reason
to be angry with you.

252
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,471
And?

253
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,691
Uday, you owe me 50 dinar.

254
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,530
50 dinar?

255
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,152
You see?

256
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,987
Trying to get money from your brother
is like trying to get blood from a stone.

257
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,914
What?

258
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,581
It's not him.

259
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,038
What?

260
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,480
It's your turn, brother.

261
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,184
Fuck them. Fucking Kuwaitis.

262
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,071
I hate them all.

263
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,022
Worse than horseflies.

264
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,332
My brothers, welcome to Baghdad.

265
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,881
Fuck!

266
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,263
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

267
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,557
Fucking Kuwaitis!

268
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,475
I fucking hate Jews, I hate horseflies

269
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,972
and I hate fucking Persians,

270
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,555
but I hate fucking Kuwaitis more!

271
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,060
They insult us.

272
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,643
They are filth. They maul our women.

273
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,571
The Kuwaitis have been
stealing $280 million a year

274
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,239
from the oilfields at Rumaila.

275
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,827
$280 million a year!

276
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,951
You know we traced the weapon.

277
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,250
I just know the fucking Kuwaitis
are behind this!

278
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,668
I hope my father wipes them out.

279
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,126
No, I'm telling you this.
I don't care who knows it!

280
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,050
The age of the sheikhs is over. Over!

281
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,928
- What?
- It's me, habibi.

282
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,595
What are you doing right now?

283
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:32,055
I'm getting my nails done. Nice and sharp.

284
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,013
The better to scratch you with.

285
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,602
Did I ever tell you
how much I love your ass?

286
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,610
It's the best ass in Baghdad.
I'll see you soon.

287
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,694
Hey, you, you!

288
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,114
You'll meet many women.

289
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,205
Whores, wealthy women from Al Mansour

290
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,409
who come looking for a favor
and offer you favors in return.

291
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,337
Schoolgirls he snatches off the street.

292
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,421
- You'll be given your fair share.
- Ready, guys?

293
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:05,800
Never even speak to a woman
Uday has chosen for himself.

294
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,264
He is insane.

295
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,768
You know it, Munem.

296
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,065
He's insane.

297
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,144
You turn a blind eye. You have no choice.

298
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,317
I understand that.

299
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,616
You are a good man in a bad job.

300
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,819
Look at him.

301
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,700
He's psychotic.

302
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,703
Come on, kiss. Kiss more. More. Kiss, kiss.

303
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,082
Who wants to sleep with me tonight? You?

304
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,654
Through the window
of a British worker's flat,

305
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,532
the Battle of Kuwait unfolds.

306
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,209
Saddam Hussein, very simply,
you cannot bully your neighbor.

307
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,832
You cannot wipe him out,
a member of the Arab League,

308
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,288
a member of the United Nations.

309
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,294
Saddam H ussein!
The hero of the Battle of Qadisiyyah.

310
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,879
The knight of the Arab nations.

311
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,137
Direct descendant of the prophet.

312
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,184
Saddam the noble fighter.

313
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,643
Scion of the family of Imam al-Hussein.

314
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:44,569
Ladies and gentlemen,
Uday Saddam Hussein.

315
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,668
The age of the sheikhs is over!

316
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,004
With the help of Almighty God,

317
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,589
Kuwait has come home!

318
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,196
Hey, you. The teeth. You with the teeth.

319
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,039
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

320
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,994
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You!
No, no, no, no. You, you, you.

321
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,715
Hey, you.

322
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,961
Don't be scared. Come for a ride.

323
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,215
Come on, get in the car.
I'll give you a lift home.

324
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,016
I'll take you back.

325
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,307
Hey, don't be scared.
Why do you run? Why do you run?

326
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,608
Come on. Why are you running?
I'll take you home.

327
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,524
Come on.

328
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,489
Hey. How about you?

329
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,867
I love what you've done with your hair.

330
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,037
Hey, hey, hey!

331
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,621
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

332
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,127
It's all right.

333
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:14,052
You're beautiful. Don't be scared.
I'm not going to hurt you.

334
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,879
Brother, she's beautiful. You want her?

335
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,007
- Take.
- No!

336
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,641
What? What?
Don't fucking look at me like that.

337
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,312
- Like what?
- Like that.

338
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,766
I know that fucking look.
I know what you're thinking.

339
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,146
Think what the fuck you like.
I like cunt. I want cunt.

340
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,024
I see a cunt, I want to fuck it. I don't care.

341
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,356
I love my country,
I love my mother, my father.

342
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,066
But I love cunt more than I love God!

343
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,135
Does her mama know that she's out?

344
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,308
You know this man?

345
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,648
This is Kamel Hannah.

346
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,026
He's my father's greatest friend.

347
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,823
He tastes his food.

348
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,532
Did she get a note from her teacher?

349
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,373
See this watch?

350
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,916
You see this watch?

351
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,588
How much you think a watch like this costs?

352
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,758
How much? How much you think
a watch like this costs? $10,000.

353
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,633
It's a $10,000 watch.
My father bought him that watch.

354
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:26,058
Why? Why did my father buy Kamel Hannah
a watch like this?

355
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,760
Shall I tell you why? Shall I tell you why?

356
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,312
Shall I tell you why my father
loves Kamel Hannah so much?

357
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,516
- Because he gets his whores for him.
- Rubbish.

358
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,313
Our mother... Our mother
sits around the house and weeps

359
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,524
because of the whores
this man brings my father.

360
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,695
She wanders, she walks around the palace,

361
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,322
walks around the palace,
staring in the mirrors,

362
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,702
staring in the mirrors,
looking at herself like a fucking zombie

363
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,207
because of the whores
this man brings my father!

364
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,212
- Shall I kill him, brother?
- Uday.

365
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,053
What do you think, brother?

366
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,055
What do you think? Shall I kill him?

367
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,140
Kill your father's greatest friend?

368
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,894
He is a twittering little pimp
that has driven my mother mad.

369
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,898
- Maybe I'll let you kill him for me.
- Uday.

370
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,067
No.

371
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,150
I don't know him. It's meaningless.

372
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,702
If I am going to kill somebody,
I want to know why I'm going to do it.

373
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,582
Uday.

374
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,294
Uday.

375
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,918
- You fucker!
- Easy, easy.

376
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,921
You should be ashamed of your...

377
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,600
Motherfucker.

378
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,222
Come into my bedroom. Come on.

379
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,395
Would you like a drink? A nice drink?

380
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,190
I like to drink whiskey.

381
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,652
Take it, here, here.

382
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,702
Would you like some?
Would you like some?

383
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,213
That's it. In just one. In one. In one.

384
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,144
You're very beautiful.
You're a very beautiful girl.

385
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,730
Beg me... Beg me to fuck you.

386
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,729
Beg me. Go on, beg me to fuck you.

387
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,820
He humiliate me.

388
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:53,832
Why not? Just say it.
Beg me. Beg me to fuck you.

389
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,079
- I can't.
- Come on.

390
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,910
- I...
- Yes?

391
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,122
- ...beg...
- ...beg...

392
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,173
...you... I can't.

393
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,126
- Go on.
- No.

394
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,680
- Beg me. Beg me.
- No.

395
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,352
Beg me! Beg me to fuck you.

396
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,150
Beg me to fuck you.

397
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,484
Beg me to fuck you.

398
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,030
Beg me to fuck you! Beg me!

399
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,995
- Beg! Beg! Beg!
- I beg...

400
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,375
Yassem! Yassem!

401
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,380
- Who's doing that?
- That pig, Kamel Hannah. He won't stop.

402
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,882
He says he doesn't take orders
from faggots.

403
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,193
Stop!

404
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,405
- Fuck you.
- I order you to stop!

405
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,155
I don't take orders from you!
I take orders from Saddam Hussein.

406
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,346
Uday, Uday...

407
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,104
No! No!

408
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,446
Boss, come on. Let's go.

409
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,996
Just get her out of here, okay?

410
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,589
He took pills, sleeping pills.

411
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,079
Give me the knife.

412
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,258
You'll kill him.

413
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,342
The loss of blood and...

414
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,293
I should have gelded him at birth.

415
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:06,612
At 7:00 tonight the armed forces
of the United States began an operation

416
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,322
at the direction of the President

417
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,293
to force Saddam Hussein
to withdraw his troops from Kuwait

418
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,291
and to end his occupation of their country.

419
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,768
That's the latest Tomahawk cruise missile

420
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,811
to fly just over our position here.

421
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,224
Anti-aircraft gunners all around
have been trying to shoot them down.

422
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,480
I have said to the people of Iraq

423
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,906
that our quarrel was not with them,

424
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,243
but instead with their leadership

425
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,742
and above all with Saddam Hussein.

426
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,391
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.

427
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,594
Millions of dollars a year.

428
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,475
Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars.

429
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,022
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.
Millions of dollars a year.

430
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:23,026
From the oilfields.
From our oilfields at Rumaila.

431
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,032
Kuwait.

432
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,410
Kuwait, Kuwait.

433
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,113
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

434
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,291
Millions of dollars a year
from our oilfields at Rumaila.

435
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,835
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

436
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,498
Take the glasses off.

437
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,128
What are you doing here?

438
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,086
- How did you get in?
- Do you want me to go?

439
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,179
Why are you wearing Ray-Bans
at 1 :00 in the morning?

440
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,726
Take them off.

441
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,639
- I want to be sure it's you.
- Are you sure?

442
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:58,899
I can always tell.

443
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,022
You cannot stay here.

444
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,729
Have you seen what's going on outside?

445
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,777
Hear what Saddam said on television?
"The mother of all battles."

446
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,623
Iraqi people are not stupid.
Nobody believes that crap.

447
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,663
Iraq is going to burn to the ground.
We won't see that on TV.

448
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,839
And Uday? Is he reporting for duty?

449
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:30,090
No. Uday has gone to bed
with a splitting headache

450
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,348
because Yassem Al-Helou forgot
to press his tweed hunting breeches.

451
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,313
He's a child. He'll tire of you.

452
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,020
He tires of everything.

453
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,194
One day soon, he'll tire of me

454
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,819
and I'll end up
at the bottom of the lake with the fish.

455
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:58,617
Today he's infatuated with you.
He's quite dazzled.

456
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,625
He thinks he made you up,
just like that, out of the dust.

457
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,799
Tomorrow he snaps his fingers
and you vanish.

458
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,093
But you can leave, Sarrab.

459
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,387
If I run away, he'll find me.

460
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,600
If he can't find me, he'll find my sister.

461
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,681
Who's going to protect me
from Uday Hussein? You?

462
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,685
This is the way it is in Iraq.

463
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,986
It's him.

464
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,915
Latif?

465
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,834
I cannot sleep.

466
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,090
Take a pill.

467
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,689
You may kiss me now.

468
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,212
You must go to Basra, my son.

469
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,807
- What did he say?
- It's not him.

470
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,685
- Of course it's him.
- You don't know your own father?

471
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,233
- It wasn't him.
- Of course I do. What did he say?

472
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,605
Basra.

473
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,437
Basra?

474
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,648
Fuck Basra.

475
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,609
Don't expect me to go.

476
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,769
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

477
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:22,025
Millions of dollars a year
from the oilfields at Rumaila!

478
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,158
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

479
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,707
What is Kuwait?
Who made up this country?

480
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,167
The thieving British!

481
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:40,213
In 1935 they picked up a pen
and drew a line in the sand.

482
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,629
Kuwait is a fantasy!

483
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,008
- Look, Mother. It's me.
- Kuwait is a lie!

484
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,895
Kuwait is the province of Iraq!

485
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,998
The age of the sheikhs is over!

486
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,171
- Qusay?
- Uday.

487
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,924
- Are you watching?
- He didn't fool me, my brother.

488
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,097
You can tell? How?

489
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,682
For one thing he's sober, and second
he's not foaming at the mouth.

490
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,334
It's a hit!

491
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,833
- Let's go!
- Go! Go! Go!

492
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,368
You've lost a lot of blood.

493
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,700
We might have to lose the little finger.

494
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,247
Who's going to tell Uday?

495
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,295
Take more. Take more.

496
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,672
Monsieur.

497
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,924
What? What?

498
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:35,555
The little finger. Right hand.
They're doing their best.

499
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,602
Fuck!

500
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,205
Is it you?

501
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,420
It's me.

502
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,683
The Americans are saying
Uday has been shot by the Shi'a.

503
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,730
But I know Uday is in Geneva,
gambling with his uncle.

504
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,183
He called me last night.

505
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,062
Yes, it is you.

506
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,747
- Where's Latif? Latif, with the finger?
- I'm busy. People are dying.

507
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,175
People are dying! People are dying!
People are fucking dying!

508
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,880
I know people are dying!
I know they are dying!

509
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:39,678
Men, women, Iraqi soldiers losing arms
and fucking legs. Brave people.

510
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,227
I don't give a fuck! Do you understand me?

511
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,771
Do you understand me? Fuck them!

512
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,975
- I don't give a fuck!
- You must go. Now.

513
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,605
Go, go, go, go. You must go.

514
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,700
Save his finger.

515
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,413
If you fail to save this man's finger,

516
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,541
I will kill every one of you.

517
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:19,135
Iraq's army is defeated.
Our military objectives are met.

518
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,807
Kuwait is once more
in the hands of Kuwaitis,

519
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,227
in control of their own destiny.

520
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,477
Oh, my God. Look at that.

521
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,102
I cou Id fuck that. I cou Id real ly fuck that.
Could you fuck that?

522
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,273
Yassem.

523
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,321
I wonder if she's a virgin.

524
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,858
Do you think she's a virgin?

525
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,121
It's her wedding day. It is the best day
of her life. She is the man's bride.

526
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,324
Do you think she'll let me
stick my finger up her ass?

527
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,502
You think?

528
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,375
Come over. Come on.

529
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,798
Come.

530
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,967
I do like that dress.

531
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,385
Come here, darling.

532
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,969
You're beautiful, very, very beautiful.

533
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,675
You having a nice day?
Come, let me kiss you.

534
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,520
Very good. My brother.

535
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,889
Nothing serious.
As you can see, rumors of my death

536
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,556
- are scandalous lies...
- It's me.

537
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,259
...put out by the Americans.

538
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:13,723
Scandalous lies that insult
the intelligence of the Iraqi people.

539
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,695
Allahu akbar.

540
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,615
Allahu akbar?

541
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,284
Allah gives me nothing.

542
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,784
Everything I want I just take for myself.

543
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,595
Look at me.

544
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,764
I'm a fucking war hero.

545
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,438
Well, she's dead.

546
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,401
Find out who she is. Send them some
dinars for the damage. Are you deaf?

547
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:51,445
I said pick up the phone,
get hold of Said at the Olympic Committee.

548
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,404
- Do what I tell you.
- Do it yourself!

549
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,123
What? What did you say?

550
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,044
I said do it yourself.
I will not be part of this madness.

551
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,148
I will never let you go.
I will never let you go.

552
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,896
I love you too much.

553
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:31,905
Yassem.

554
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,094
I should have put a bullet in his head.

555
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,388
Then you would be just like him.

556
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,888
And you're not.

557
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,641
Praise God for that.

558
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,347
You're my Latif.

559
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,326
- You must go.
- No, he's gone. He's gone.

560
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,079
I know, but he'll be back. You must go.

561
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,752
How can you stand it?
Why do you choose to live like this?

562
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,425
I didn't choose.

563
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,929
He chose me, just like he chose you.

564
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,499
You have a visitor.

565
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,304
I want you to do something for me.

566
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,825
I will look into this complaint.

567
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,494
If need be, I will talk to my father.

568
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,369
I'm a tired man.

569
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,951
I have a heart condition.

570
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,163
Look into my eyes. Look deep.

571
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,624
Can you see the pain there?

572
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,756
This is the pain you give
to the people of Iraq.

573
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,384
Pain that never ends.

574
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,516
Today I have come to seek justice.

575
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,973
Will I be shown any compassion?

576
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,559
Justice. Compassion.

577
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,236
Fuck this!

578
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,904
Is this him?

579
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,530
Your daughter was a whore. She enjoyed it.

580
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,375
She was 14 years old.
No man has ever touched her.

581
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,124
God gave her beauty.
This was her downfall.

582
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,298
This is too much. You are a criminal.

583
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,593
- All of Iraq knows your crimes.
- You are a good man.

584
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,798
Give him 1,000 dinars for her time.
That is good money for a whore.

585
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,975
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

586
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,303
I'll put a fucking bullet
in your fucking head!

587
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,889
You, you, put a bullet in his head now.
Now!

588
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,849
- What has he done?
- What has he done?

589
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,811
- He's a man who has lost his daughter.
- You heard what he said about you?

590
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,396
- About me?
- About you, Uday Saddam Hussein.

591
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,106
It was not me who snatched her
off the street.

592
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,659
I didn't beat her.
If you want to kill him, kill him yourself.

593
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,078
You think you can pick and choose?
You think you can pick and choose?

594
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,326
You are nothing!
Without me, you'd be hanging

595
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,079
from a fucking lamppost on Haifa Street.

596
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,502
I made you, Latif. I made you.
I gave you life.

597
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,205
If I want, I'll fucking take it away.
Now put a bullet in his head.

598
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:17,753
I'm not going to kill this man.
Kill me if you want.

599
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,381
- I don't care.
- You would die to save this man?

600
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,807
Go on, what are you waiting for?
Kill me. Put a bullet in my head.

601
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,135
You're going to do it one of these nights
when the mood takes you.

602
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,936
Why not now?
Go on, put a bullet in my head.

603
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,606
Never. I love you too much.

604
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,893
No.

605
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,944
You love Uday.

606
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,532
You are not afraid to die?

607
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,950
You forget.

608
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,908
I died the day I came here.

609
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,122
You do not fear God.

610
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,168
Let me make this easy for you.

611
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,717
I don't believe it.
Somebody get this on tape.

612
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,214
Yassem! Come film this.

613
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,422
- This is better than a porno movie!
- Get me the hospital.

614
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,724
- Get out of my way.
- Yassem, film this. Film this.

615
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,013
Yassem! Yassem!

616
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,730
Yassem!

617
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:14,813
Get help.

618
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,154
He's the last person I'd be going out with.

619
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,911
- But he's my best friend.
- Well, you go out with him, then.

620
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,668
- Go out with who?
- Nobody, Baba.

621
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,041
Am I missing something here?

622
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,003
- I'll get it.
- Yes, Baba.

623
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,880
Gallalha's getting married next week.

624
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,048
Is she? That's good.

625
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,012
Makes life much easier for me.

626
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,798
Baba!

627
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,508
It's Latif!

628
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,650
Ju'an, run along, habibi.

629
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,525
Uday Saddam Hussein
invites you to a party.

630
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,950
His birthday.

631
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,115
He is never going to stop.

632
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,620
Son,

633
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,790
I don't want to know what you've done.

634
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:44,295
I want you to know
that I absolutely trust you.

635
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,595
And I am proud of you.

636
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,306
One day, when God wills it,

637
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,133
we'll have justice.

638
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,647
You must go.

639
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,901
You must leave this country,
go as far away as you can,

640
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,355
and don't come back
until Uday Hussein is dead and buried.

641
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,566
He will come looking for me.

642
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:14,113
He will come here. You know that.
He will come looking for you.

643
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,710
Go to this party, drink his whiskey.
We must look for the right moment.

644
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:24,541
- Don't ask me to do this.
- Latif, I am an old man.

645
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:28,469
My life is here.
Everything I have made of my life.

646
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,635
God gave me life, my son.

647
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,676
When he wills it, he'll take it away.

648
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,850
You will do as you are told.

649
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,250
You.

650
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,629
You, you, in the blue dress.
In the blue dress.

651
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,713
Get it off. Get it off, all of it.
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

652
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,472
Go on, take, take, take.

653
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,267
All of you, all of you. You, in the gold.

654
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:22,060
Give me... Take off your dress.
Take off your dress!

655
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,731
It's Uday's birthday party for my friends

656
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,905
and I want to see all of you naked,
all of you!

657
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:33,234
Come on! Come on, naked.
More. Blue clothing. Take it off!

658
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,445
Now, off. All of it. Take your knickers off.

659
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,746
Beautiful ass. Beautiful ass.

660
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,872
Come on! Take it off!
This is birthday celebration!

661
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,395
Good, good, good. I like it.

662
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,644
And you. Don't hide yourself.
Let me see you.

663
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:13,320
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You should show yourself.

664
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,028
It is a lot of beautiful people
for my birthday.

665
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,159
- That Mercedes...
- It's not for sale.

666
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,709
I heard you'd take 30,000.

667
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,662
There are two things I never do, Said.

668
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,499
I never pass wind in the presence
of the President of the Republic

669
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,379
and I never do business with pimps like you.

670
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:45,598
Latif! Latif!

671
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:46,977
God is great.

672
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,355
He gives my brother back to me.

673
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,826
- You didn't?
- I did. Come.

674
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,997
Come, come, come, come, come.

675
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,950
I quite enjoyed it.

676
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:08,003
It hurt like hell.
I thought I would need stitches.

677
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,248
What is Sarrab going to say?

678
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,010
Sarrab?

679
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,843
What is Sarrab going to say?

680
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,175
Why the fuck should you care
what Sarrab is going to say?

681
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,514
Look at him.
Latif thinks because he looks like me,

682
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,849
he dresses like me, he sleeps in my bed,

683
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,559
he thinks he can fuck like me.

684
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,519
You think you can fuck my women?

685
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,229
He's jealous.

686
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,358
He wants to fuck you himself.

687
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,653
You know what this fucking Kurd
said to me?

688
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,614
I offered him 30,000 dinars
for that Mercedes.

689
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,576
He said he wouldn't sell it to a pimp.

690
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,127
Pimp? You called this gentleman a pimp?

691
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,296
- Gentleman?
- He called you a pimp?

692
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,339
- Uday's.
- Uday's pimp? Uday's pimp?

693
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,793
- You called this man Uday's pimp?
- He's lying.

694
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,173
This man is my friend.

695
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:59,884
He is one of this country's
most successful businessmen.

696
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,681
Businessmen?

697
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,975
What business is that? Cunt?

698
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:05,886
- Sit down.
- I'm leaving.

699
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,064
- Sit down.
- Are you leaving? No?

700
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,311
I am leaving.

701
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,983
Sit down. I'm talking to you.

702
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,021
What do you want from me, Uday?

703
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:20,075
You belong to me, Latif.
You do as I say. Sit down.

704
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,572
You are going to have to shoot me
in the back.

705
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,823
Stop!

706
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,823
Stop! I order you to stop!

707
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:42,972
Fuck!

708
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:45,684
Take me with you.

709
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,978
You can't leave me here.

710
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,619
Kill him. He'd kill you.

711
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,123
I am not Uday.

712
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,747
Come on.

713
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,961
Keys.

714
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,644
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

715
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,444
You let him go.

716
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:40,397
He had a gun.

717
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,574
You had a gun.

718
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,992
He took it.

719
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,510
Fuck.

720
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:55,313
Second thoughts?

721
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,935
I should've put you out back there.
Would've been the smart thing to do.

722
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,443
- That's what Uday would have done.
- Not so smart.

723
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,865
Uday would have killed me first.

724
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,823
- Do you have any money?
- No.

725
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,405
- Nothing?
- I'm not a prostitute.

726
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,583
Too bad.

727
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,491
Do you ride?

728
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,091
Well, what does it say?
What does it say, Munem?

729
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,973
Uday Saddam Hussein has fled Iraq.

730
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,231
Sit down.

731
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,356
Who is this woman?

732
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,819
Some whore he met.

733
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,048
Uday will make an appearance
on the news at 1 :00.

734
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,135
They're on their way here now.

735
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,339
She has no shoes on her feet.

736
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,731
This is what happens.

737
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,147
You give people an opportunity,

738
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,275
Iift them up, let them eat at your table,

739
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,778
sleep in your bed.

740
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:57,404
And this is how they repay you.

741
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,698
Who is this?

742
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:43,784
I'm sitting here watching Ali
fuck your sister up the ass.

743
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,245
I'm not joking with you, Latif.

744
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,791
Come back to Baghdad.

745
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,468
We can smoke a pipe together.

746
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,888
Fuck some women, drive some cars.

747
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,634
Don't tell me you need time to think.
Don't keep me waiting, brother.

748
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,312
Don't force my hand.

749
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,849
Come back, Latif.

750
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,228
I miss you.

751
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,655
I've got no one here to talk to.

752
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,317
Think of your mother and your father.

753
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,822
How did he get this number?

754
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,668
We just walked through the door.

755
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,916
Uday knows everybody.

756
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,794
These people in Malta
have a lot of business in Baghdad.

757
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,591
Half the people I know have money here.

758
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:34,918
They come to get their tits done.

759
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,720
We've got to get out of here.
We cannot stay here.

760
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,934
We walk through the door
and he's on the phone.

761
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,353
He will never leave us alone.
I know him, he's a fanatic.

762
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,680
He will never stop.
You're not listening to me!

763
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,644
Stop shouting at me!

764
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,198
I have a child.

765
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,365
A little girl.

766
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,159
Tara.

767
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:11,830
Nobody knows this, not even Uday.

768
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,550
She's with my sister in Samarra.

769
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:18,878
You have to help me.

770
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,637
You have to do something, Latif.
She's three years old.

771
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,217
I can't leave my daughter in Iraq.

772
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,600
You tell me this now?

773
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,982
I was too frightened.

774
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:34,561
- I didn't know what you'd do.
- This is insane.

775
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,112
You are insane.

776
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:40,651
- What kind of a woman are you?
- There's nothing else, wallahi, I swear it.

777
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,945
What do you expect me to do?

778
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,410
Who is the father?

779
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,742
Talk to him.

780
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,246
Do you even know who the father is?

781
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:59,298
Now that's Uday talking. I can hear it.

782
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,264
He's dead.

783
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,385
I spoke to my sister.

784
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,974
She knows a man who can drive
Tara to Amman. He wants US dollars.

785
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,561
It was you.

786
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:42,689
What do you mean?

787
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:49,030
How else did Uday know where I was?
There is no other way.

788
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,537
You never say anything nice, do you?

789
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:01,712
You never say I look pretty.

790
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:04,878
You never ask me how I'm feeling.

791
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:08,507
You never tell me you love me.

792
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:13,929
When you make love to me,

793
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,810
you're tender.

794
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,232
Only then.

795
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,569
Look at me, Latif.

796
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,411
Look at me.

797
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:32,788
What do you see?

798
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,499
Uday's whore?

799
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,709
- Is that what I am to you?
- I spoke to the operator.

800
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:45,798
He gave me a list of outgoing calls.

801
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,717
I didn't call the Iraqi Embassy three times.

802
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,645
It wasn't me
who called the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

803
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,347
I got scared.

804
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,524
I was calling my sister.

805
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,021
- I was scared for my daughter.
- It was you, Sarrab.

806
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,611
You.

807
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,989
You called Uday. You told him where I was.

808
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,448
It was you.

809
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,714
Take what you want, Sarrab.

810
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,589
There is money in the hotel room.

811
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,558
My poor Latif.

812
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,003
And how is Sarrab?

813
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:56,224
Did she tell you about her daughter
living with her sister?

814
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:00,303
And you believed her.

815
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:02,935
Don't hang up the phone, motherfucker.
I have your father in my office.

816
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,859
Let me speak to him.

817
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,811
Come home, Latif.

818
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,152
Think of your father.

819
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,363
Come back to Baghdad.

820
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,737
I'm going to put your father on the phone.

821
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:21,199
I want you to listen
to what he has to say to you.

822
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,751
He's going to tell you what to do.

823
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:26,962
Here.

824
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,378
Speak to your son.

825
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,927
Are you well, my son?

826
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:42,061
Yes, I'm fine. Listen, I have a plan.

827
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:46,767
I'm going to say this once,
and it's my final word.

828
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:54,278
You will do as I tell you
or you are no longer my son.

829
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:02,373
Tell this evil son of a bitch

830
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,950
to go to hell.

831
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:10,957
Speak up, Latif.

832
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,050
What is it to be?

833
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,222
Go to hell.

834
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,352
Latif Yahia.

835
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:24,455
They took my father
to Uday's office that morning.

836
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:29,536
They dropped his body off
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

837
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:35,549
My mother was forbidden
to give him a decent burial.

838
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:40,842
She was told to bury him in the garden.

839
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:48,558
Nothing will bring my wife back.
Or your father.

840
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,398
Why have you come here?

841
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,356
What do you want?

842
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:41,657
Hey, girls! Girls!

843
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:43,701
You, come and talk to me.

844
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,298
Hey, you. Come here.
Come. I'll take you home.

845
01:40:57,385 --> 01:41:00,798
With the pretty hair.
You're very pretty. No, you are.

846
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,385
Please, come on. Where are you from?

847
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,025
Trying to get away from me, huh?

848
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,569
He's stopped.

849
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:28,996
Come on. Are they your friends?

850
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,332
Move. Ali. Ali, Yassem.

851
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:23,550
Get the fuck out! Move!

852
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:29,173
Yassem! Yassem!

853
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,758
Ali! Ali! No!

854
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,889
- No! Yassem! Yassem!
- This is for my wife!

855
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:55,995
Latif?

856
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:00,337
No! Please stop!

857
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:04,800
No! No!

858
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,763
Out of my way!

859
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:23,231
Move!

860
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:29,908
You, stop!

861
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:31,485
Move, move!

862
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:33,620
Stop!

863
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,640
Clear the area!

864
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,562
Clear the area!

865
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,106
Move!
