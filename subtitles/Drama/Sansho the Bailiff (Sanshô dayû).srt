00:01:51.96,00:02:01.55
The origin of this legend of Sanshô dayû[br](The Bailiff) goes back to medieval times.

00:02:02.55,00:02:09.00
Japan had not yet emerged from the Dark[br]Ages and mankind had yet to awaken as human beings.

00:02:09.80,00:02:15.67
It has been retold by the people for centuries...

00:02:16.00,00:02:21.00
and is treasured today as one of the[br]epic folk tales of our history.

00:02:53.04,00:02:55.39
- Zushio, be careful.[br]- Okay

00:03:11.00,00:03:13.53
- Mother![br]- What is it, dear?

00:03:14.28,00:03:18.79
How did it happen that Father[br]ended up in faraway Tsukushi?

00:03:23.40,00:03:26.11
He's a great man, isn't he?

00:03:27.00,00:03:31.19
Certainly. He is a man of justice,[br]a fine man.

00:03:31.40,00:03:32.95
I thought so!

00:03:33.60,00:03:35.31
Father!

00:03:48.00,00:03:51.00
Zushio-sama! Zushio-sama!

00:03:51.72,00:03:53.99
We want to see the Master!

00:04:03.56,00:04:05.91
Don't be wild! Step back!

00:04:06.24,00:04:08.23
We're not trying to do anything wild.

00:04:08.34,00:04:09.63
We came to appeal.

00:04:09.84,00:04:11.95
Then calm down!

00:04:12.20,00:04:14.87
You're the General?

00:04:15.36,00:04:17.31
Master, please show us your face!

00:04:17.52,00:04:19.79
We're all here for you!

00:04:20.04,00:04:21.15
What good will that do?

00:04:21.32,00:04:24.27
We'll have Master's transfer cancelled!

00:04:24.52,00:04:27.47
Transfer is a pretence![br]It means exile!

00:04:27.87,00:04:29.47
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:04:30.00,00:04:33.87
They punished him because of us![br]We can't be silent!

00:04:34.37,00:04:36.30
Let's all go to the General's office!

00:04:37.44,00:04:38.39
Wait, hold it!

00:04:38.60,00:04:42.27
I know you love our Master.

00:04:42.48,00:04:44.51
But this would be against his wish!

00:04:45.44,00:04:47.23
Be sensible and listen to me.

00:04:47.76,00:04:51.67
For thirteen years,[br]famine has caused you suffering.

00:04:52.48,00:04:56.91
To live,[br]you need every working man here.

00:04:58.00,00:04:59.79
That was why the Master[br]opposed the General's demand...

00:05:00.04,00:05:02.71
for more soldiers,[br]and more rice to tax.

00:05:02.92,00:05:06.03
His attempt to help you was overruled.

00:05:08.04,00:05:10.39
If you make a false step now,[br]you too will be punished!

00:05:10.60,00:05:12.39
That's right!

00:05:12.60,00:05:14.39
If you riot, he'll be blamed!

00:05:16.48,00:05:20.83
He'll be accused of rebellion!

00:05:21.60,00:05:24.03
So return to your homes!

00:05:30.16,00:05:34.43
You're too lenient![br]This is a revolt!

00:05:34.92,00:05:36.31
Kill them!

00:05:36.52,00:05:37.71
Madness!

00:05:37.92,00:05:40.11
I prohibit such injustice!

00:05:43.04,00:05:45.99
What insolence![br]You are no longer Governor here!

00:05:46.84,00:05:48.99
Do not interfere again!

00:06:46.80,00:06:48.27
Master Zushio!

00:06:51.80,00:06:52.95
It's cooked nicely.

00:07:18.76,00:07:21.63
I'm sorry I've caused you[br]trouble, Uncle.

00:07:21.80,00:07:23.83
You've involved us all.

00:07:24.04,00:07:26.99
Aren't you sorry for[br]your wife and children?

00:07:28.28,00:07:32.17
Peasants are to be pitied as well.

00:07:32.25,00:07:33.27
What nonsense!

00:07:33.84,00:07:36.95
Peasants are peasants!

00:07:37.80,00:07:39.51
You fool!

00:07:51.24,00:07:56.75
- Take the children to your parents' home.[br]- Yes.

00:07:58.12,00:08:03.61
Tell them... I'm sorry that[br]they trusted a man like me.

00:08:06.96,00:08:12.63
Zushio. Will you become[br]a stubborn man like me?

00:08:14.52,00:08:19.64
You may be too young to understand.[br]But listen.

00:08:20.40,00:08:24.91
Without mercy,[br]a man is not a human being.

00:08:25.32,00:08:28.83
Be hard on yourself,[br]but merciful to others.

00:08:29.08,00:08:34.91
Men are created equal.[br]Everyone is entitled to happiness.

00:08:55.20,00:08:57.99
Our family treasure..

00:08:58.44,00:09:01.31
The Goddess of Mercy.

00:09:02.56,00:09:07.47
Keep it as a remembrance of[br]my principles...and of me.

00:09:10.40,00:09:12.51
Now repeat what I've just told you.

00:09:12.88,00:09:17.07
Without mercy,[br]a man is not a human being.

00:09:17.40,00:09:21.39
Be hard on yourself,[br]but merciful to others.

00:09:34.64,00:09:38.31
Men are created equal.

00:09:39.60,00:09:42.43
Everyone is entitled to happiness.

00:09:46.16,00:09:50.23
- Do you remember father's face?[br]- Yes, Mother.

00:09:51.96,00:09:56.03
- And his teachings too?[br]- Yes, Mother.

00:10:30.28,00:10:34.15
Zushio, you have to say[br]goodbye to Father now.

00:10:36.60,00:10:40.11
You will be a lovely lady, Anju.

00:10:43.20,00:10:45.79
- Take care of your sister and mother.[br]- Yes, Father.

00:10:56.20,00:10:58.55
We're not parting forever.

00:10:58.96,00:11:01.63
Be hopeful and brave.

00:11:05.96,00:11:10.07
I never dreamed that I might[br]have to leave this province.

00:11:24.16,00:11:27.19
Governor![br]Master!

00:11:27.56,00:11:30.83
Master, don't leave!

00:12:42.24,00:12:44.03
Come on, let's hurry!

00:12:45.04,00:12:47.71
We must find an inn for the night.

00:12:56.80,00:13:02.95
We are travelling, children,[br]the road that Father walked.

00:13:06.95,00:13:07.95
Father...

00:13:19.95,00:13:20.95
My lady!

00:13:22.55,00:13:23.35
My lady!

00:13:28.80,00:13:32.55
No lodging is available in this area.

00:13:32.80,00:13:34.83
Why is that?

00:13:35.44,00:13:39.03
Bandits and slavers frequent this place,[br]posing as travellers.

00:13:39.20,00:13:42.23
They've been kidnapping[br]women and children.

00:13:42.68,00:13:47.27
So the Governor has prohibited[br]accommodating travellers.

00:13:48.48,00:13:50.51
Bandits and slave dealers?

00:14:03.72,00:14:05.91
What trouble we're in.

00:14:06.24,00:14:07.95
What can we do?

00:14:08.16,00:14:12.67
Let's find a place to camp.[br]We have no other choice.

00:14:13.04,00:14:15.15
Camp, ma'am?

00:14:15.32,00:14:20.91
Yes. Let's build a[br]shelter before it gets dark.

00:14:22.12,00:14:25.71
Zushio, Anju, will you help us?

00:15:05.20,00:15:07.39
- Here you go.[br]- Mother, do you need more?

00:15:08.08,00:15:11.83
Yes, get more thatch[br]and soft grass for our beds.

00:15:14.20,00:15:16.15
- Come, Anju.[br]- Yes, Brother.

00:15:52.16,00:15:54.51
This branch, Brother.

00:15:54.96,00:15:57.07
You can't break it by yourself, Anju.

00:16:09.88,00:16:11.43
Mother is calling us.

00:16:11.72,00:16:13.99
- Come on, it's just the the wind.[br]- No, it's Mother!

00:16:17.32,00:16:19.43
Anju

00:16:19.88,00:16:22.63
Come back here quickly!

00:16:25.48,00:16:27.43
Zushio!

00:16:45.12,00:16:47.39
You two must be famished.

00:16:47.68,00:16:50.35
This should help some.

00:16:55.84,00:16:57.15
What's that?

00:16:57.48,00:16:59.75
Wolves, ma'am.

00:17:00.44,00:17:04.71
Don't worry.[br]They won't come near a fire.

00:17:05.20,00:17:07.63
Stop worrying.[br]It's all right, dear.

00:17:20.80,00:17:25.07
I'm sorry we have no hot food.

00:17:32.52,00:17:35.95
I'll get some rice gruel[br]from a farmer.

00:17:37.44,00:17:40.63
And some bedding, if I can.

00:17:43.60,00:17:45.71
I'll be right back.

00:17:46.48,00:17:48.27
I appreciate your effort.

00:18:34.16,00:18:35.35
Who is it?

00:18:42.60,00:18:45.43
What on earth are you doing here?

00:18:47.76,00:18:49.63
We are travellers.

00:18:50.24,00:18:53.11
We're here because[br]no lodging is available.

00:18:54.84,00:18:57.47
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:18:58.12,00:19:02.31
The cold night wind[br]is harmful to children.

00:19:05.32,00:19:07.51
Come to my place.

00:19:07.72,00:19:10.28
I can give you some hot gruel.

00:19:10.52,00:19:15.95
I appreciate your kindness.[br]But I don't want to involve you.

00:19:16.20,00:19:19.07
Just come quietly.

00:19:19.36,00:19:23.47
The authorities will overlook us,[br]if it's only for a night, I'm sure.

00:19:23.76,00:19:25.71
Come, quickly.

00:19:25.88,00:19:27.67
Thank you.

00:19:28.08,00:19:30.51
But there is one more person with us.

00:19:30.68,00:19:32.63
Another person?

00:19:33.40,00:19:37.43
Is this person...[br]a man or a woman?

00:19:37.72,00:19:40.91
A woman, the children's nurse.

00:19:42.52,00:19:47.91
Then it's all right.[br]Imagine a man lodging with a priestess!

00:19:51.32,00:19:55.99
I was able to get straw mats,[br]but no food, my lady.

00:19:56.32,00:19:57.79
That's all right.

00:19:57.96,00:20:02.79
The priestess has generously[br]offered us shelter.

00:20:05.16,00:20:07.11
- Oh, really?[br]- All right, let's go.

00:20:07.48,00:20:08.87
Thank you.

00:20:09.04,00:20:11.87
We are so very grateful to you.

00:20:20.12,00:20:22.79
How can I ever thank you enough!

00:20:23.00,00:20:24.55
No problem.

00:20:24.84,00:20:28.51
Better than wasting my time[br]serving God...

00:20:29.20,00:20:32.23
Even my family can no longer help us.

00:20:33.70,00:20:35.23
Hard times...

00:20:40.32,00:20:45.67
You spent six years at your[br]brother's house in Iwashiro?

00:20:46.22,00:20:47.77
That's right.

00:20:49.24,00:20:53.59
Even brothers and sisters,[br]when they get married...

00:20:53.92,00:20:58.35
Thanks to your meal,[br]they could fall asleep.

00:21:05.40,00:21:08.59
Do you plan to go by road[br]in the morning?

00:21:10.00,00:21:10.70
Yes.

00:21:10.84,00:21:13.95
Go by sea.[br]By land it's impossible.

00:21:14.40,00:21:17.35
Huge waves snatch the travellers[br]away from the shore road.

00:21:17.52,00:21:21.19
And the hills are infested with bandits.

00:21:21.52,00:21:23.55
Is the sea quite safe?

00:21:23.80,00:21:26.95
Certainly.[br]I know reliable boatmen.

00:21:28.06,00:21:30.57
- I'll ask them for you.[br]- Thank you.

00:21:35.96,00:21:41.27
I made the arrangements while you slept.

00:21:42.36,00:21:45.19
How can we thank you?

00:21:45.36,00:21:46.87
Not at all.

00:22:06.28,00:22:10.87
Here they are.[br]Please take good care of them.

00:22:13.52,00:22:15.43
Come this way.

00:22:33.20,00:22:35.07
Please get on the boat.

00:22:35.32,00:22:37.88
I'll never forget your kindness.

00:22:38.28,00:22:41.11
Zushio, Anju, thank the lady.

00:22:41.28,00:22:43.47
- Thank you, ma'am.[br]- Farewell.

00:22:44.12,00:22:45.67
Farewell.

00:22:45.84,00:22:49.75
I'll be praying for your safe voyage.

00:22:51.00,00:22:53.27
Come, lady, you are first.

00:23:04.24,00:23:07.11
Miss Anju, Master Zushio. Hurry.

00:23:07.28,00:23:09.55
Get back, I'll help the children.

00:23:10.60,00:23:13.29
The children will ride this boat.[br]Sailing is faster with fewer people.

00:23:13.48,00:23:17.23
That won't do.[br]We must all ride in the same boat.

00:23:18.52,00:23:21.08
- Please![br]- Shut up!

00:23:22.56,00:23:26.23
Priestess,[br]are you sure they're reliable?

00:23:26.44,00:23:28.55
You'll be taken together[br]to the right place!

00:23:39.24,00:23:41.35
I'll give you all the money.[br]Please go back.

00:23:41.60,00:23:43.79
Please row back. Please!

00:23:52.92,00:23:55.48
Row back. Please!

00:24:01.44,00:24:04.11
Mother! Mother!

00:24:24.96,00:24:26.51
Those kids.

00:24:35.02,00:24:37.43
These kids?[br]They're too small!

00:24:37.68,00:24:41.19
They're smart, very useful.

00:24:41.28,00:24:41.99
How much?

00:24:42.16,00:24:45.19
Four-fifty for one.[br]Eighty for two.

00:24:45.52,00:24:47.07
They look weak.

00:24:52.80,00:24:55.55
They're sick! No way.

00:24:59.36,00:25:01.71
Enough sobbing.

00:25:02.12,00:25:04.15
Your Ma's been sold to Sado Island.

00:25:04.52,00:25:07.47
She can't hear your crying.

00:25:08.00,00:25:11.27
Stop it![br]Or you'll get no food!

00:25:20.00,00:25:22.87
Please, I must be rid of them.[br]Have a heart!

00:25:23.36,00:25:26.63
Go to Tango. See Bailiff Sansho.

00:25:26.92,00:25:28.03
Bailiff Sansho?

00:25:28.24,00:25:31.11
He's the richest there.

00:25:32.76,00:25:35.03
He'll buy from you.[br]Don't waste your time here.

00:25:45.80,00:25:47.19
Hurry! Don't stand around!

00:26:13.92,00:26:16.11
The kids are here.

00:26:26.62,00:26:28.01
Bow to Master.

00:26:29.04,00:26:32.79
I paid for these weaklings?[br]You fool?

00:26:33.32,00:26:35.03
What can they do?

00:26:35.88,00:26:40.95
They're unfit for rough work, Pa.[br]Let them sweep the yard.

00:26:41.24,00:26:45.35
No; they cost me money.

00:26:45.76,00:26:46.87
They have to work!

00:26:48.40,00:26:49.67
What are your names?

00:26:50.40,00:26:52.27
They won't tell, Master.

00:26:52.76,00:26:54.15
Why not?

00:26:54.36,00:26:56.79
Stubborn kids, eh?[br]Take them away.

00:27:00.72,00:27:03.23
Stand up! Go!

00:27:04.60,00:27:06.47
Have no mercy on them!

00:27:15.64,00:27:17.11
Walk! Walk!

00:27:21.12,00:27:22,23
The new meat...

00:27:22.50,00:27:24.03
- Brother![br]- Anju!

00:27:26.13,00:27:27.50
Brother!

00:27:32.80,00:27:36.47
Where are you going?[br]Get over there!

00:27:39.20,00:27:41.23
Kayano, get this newcomer started.

00:27:41.64,00:27:43.51
- She should be playing with dolls![br]- What?

00:27:45.08,00:27:47.09
Don't argue and put her to work.

00:27:47.49,00:27:49.09
I can't believe this!

00:27:56.32,00:27:58.43
- Come try.[br]- Okay.

00:28:01.20,00:28:02.99
- Can you walk?[br]- Yes.

00:28:04.16,00:28:06.35
Beast! That heartless demon!

00:28:14.36,00:28:16.79
I don't know who sold you, but...

00:28:18.60,00:28:19.95
Poor thing!

00:29:07.24,00:29:08.95
Get up. Come on.

00:29:22.72,00:29:24.43
Brother!

00:29:52.20,00:29:53.59
Forgive me please! I beg you!

00:29:59.44,00:30:01.23
I wasn't trying to escape!

00:30:01.40,00:30:03.75
I really wasn't!

00:30:04.96,00:30:06.75
Those kids reminded me of[br]my own back home.

00:30:07.16,00:30:10.27
I just went to the third gate.

00:30:11.84,00:30:14.19
Fool![br]That's as bad as trying to escape!

00:30:14.72,00:30:16.99
Forgive me! Forgive me!

00:30:21.44,00:30:23.31
What are you going to do?

00:30:23.52,00:30:26.03
Give her what's due, of course.

00:30:29.60,00:30:31.31
Namiji, eh?

00:30:32.20,00:30:33.67
Will they kill her?

00:30:34.12,00:30:37.95
Of course not. They won't kill us.[br]They hate to lose a worker.

00:30:38.28,00:30:39.31
Confine her?

00:30:39.52,00:30:44.71
Don't you know what a runaway gets?[br]Look at this.

00:30:50.00,00:30:52.95
I won't do it again!

00:30:53.96,00:30:57.63
She's apologizing.[br]You don't need to stigmatise her!

00:30:58.04,00:31:00.83
Those ones should be given a lesson. 

00:31:01.08,00:31:02.79
You do it, Taro.

00:31:04.44,00:31:06.39
You weakling.

00:31:21.68,00:31:23.11
Don't look.

00:31:27.40,00:31:29.83
Eat your supper and[br]start your night work!

00:31:47.68,00:31:50.24
You can stay in here.

00:31:54.68,00:31:56.11
Where were you sold from?

00:31:56.92,00:31:58.31
Come here... Tell me.

00:31:59.64,00:32:01.27
Don't be afraid.

00:32:09.48,00:32:13.15
You got parents?[br]They sold you?

00:32:13.44,00:32:15.71
My father never would!

00:32:16.48,00:32:18.67
"Father" you say?

00:32:19.00,00:32:21.27
Evidently no peasant's kids.

00:32:21.44,00:32:25.11
How were you sold?[br]Tell me everything.

00:32:35.60,00:32:37.95
Here, have some rice cake.

00:32:39.64,00:32:41.59
It's well cooked.

00:32:53.36,00:32:54.87
When a messenger from[br]the Minister of the Right comes,

00:32:55.84,00:33:00.43
Taro chooses to disappear!

00:33:01.03,00:33:02.73
Hey, Kichiji!

00:33:04.68,00:33:07.55
Where is Taro?[br]Go find him!

00:33:07.84,00:33:12.03
The visitor will be here any moment.[br]Bring the women; put some make-up on them!

00:33:22.40,00:33:24.01
Bring some sake!

00:33:25.40,00:33:27.52
Children like you are bought and sold...

00:33:28.28,00:33:32.35
...treated like animals[br]and nobody questions it.

00:33:33.88,00:33:35.67
What a horrible world!

00:33:41.92,00:33:44.87
Tell me your father's words again.

00:33:46.00,00:33:49.67
"Without mercy,[br]man is not a human being."

00:33:50.16,00:33:53.91
"Be hard on yourself,[br]but merciful to others."

00:34:07.44,00:34:09.47
I wish I could get you[br]to your parents.

00:34:09.64,00:34:14.15
But Sado is far,[br]and Tsukushi is further. 

00:34:14.88,00:34:17.23
Too far for children.

00:34:18.88,00:34:23.47
Wait until you grow up![br]Meanwhile, be patient!

00:34:27.72,00:34:32.07
I see why you kept your name secret.

00:34:32.72,00:34:37.39
But you'll need names just the same.[br]I'll name you.

00:34:38.52,00:34:43.67
You're... Young Mutsu,[br]after your birthplace.

00:34:44.84,00:34:49.59
You'll have hardships to bear,[br]so Shinobu, "to endure".

00:34:51.40,00:34:53.30
- Alright?[br]- Yes

00:34:58.16,00:34:59.95
Master Taro!

00:35:03.28,00:35:06.23
The messenger from the Minister is coming.

00:35:06.52,00:35:08.07
You have to go back to the Hall.

00:35:08.28,00:35:09.71
Tell my father that you couldn't find me.

00:35:09.88,00:35:13.31
He's an important guest from Kyoto!

00:35:16.72,00:35:18.67
Come with me.

00:35:23.32,00:35:28.07
I thought you came unannounced[br]to reprimand us, sir.

00:35:28.28,00:35:32.03
Nonsense. Why reprimand you?[br]We have to thank you.

00:35:32.52,00:35:34.95
You collect our rice and[br]taxes most efficiently.

00:35:35.48,00:35:42.19
You send us more and more gifts[br]and bribes each year.

00:35:43.19,00:35:45.19
I feel honoured, sir.

00:35:46.36,00:35:51.03
You're the most trusted man[br]among all his bailiffs.

00:35:52.04,00:35:57.63
I've been instructed to study[br]your handling of men.

00:35:59.03,00:36:00.62
Oh, heavens...

00:36:00.92,00:36:02.95
I hardly deserve such praise.

00:36:03.44,00:36:08.95
I'm only doing my duty[br]managing his Lordship's manor.

00:36:09.20,00:36:11.95
Which is seldom done nowadays.

00:36:12.32,00:36:14.91
The Minister appreciates[br]your work so much...

00:36:15.16,00:36:19.91
...he said he'd like to[br]invite you to Kyoto as a reward.

00:36:16.88,00:36:19.91

00:36:20.88,00:36:22.59
- Oh, is that right, sir?[br]- Yes.

00:36:23.89,00:36:25.59
My goodness!

00:36:26.89,00:36:28.89
I appreciate his kindness.

00:36:31.44,00:36:34.39
Kichiji, bring the chest here!

00:36:42.56,00:36:46.31
As a humble token of my gratitude, sir.

00:36:46.96,00:36:48.47
I appreciate it.

00:36:49.20,00:36:50.99
May I present my son Taro.

00:36:51.52,00:36:53.23
I offer cordial thanks.

00:36:53.88,00:36:56.23
You are lucky to have[br]such a good father.

00:36:56.44,00:36:58.31
Be a dutiful son.

00:36:59.36,00:37:01.55
Begin your dance, girls.

00:38:21.36,00:38:23.07
Gone to sleep?

00:38:51.28,00:38:53.07
Take care of yourselves.

00:39:03.76,00:39:05.23
Open the gate.

00:39:05.60,00:39:08.03
- Where to so late?[br]- Shut up.

00:39:39.88,00:39:43.15
After ten years,

00:39:43.40,00:39:47.43
The children have developed sturdily,[br]despite their long hardship and misery.

00:39:47.84,00:39:51.03
The winter finds Zushio,[br]alias Mutsu, 23 years old.

00:39:51.84,00:39:55.03
Anju, known as Shinobu, is 18.

00:40:21.48,00:40:22.95
Brother, brother.

00:40:23.78,00:40:26.35
- What?[br]- The alarm.

00:41:02.04,00:41:06.15
- That way! He ran that way![br]- This way! This way!

00:41:24.20,00:41:25.00
Let me go!

00:41:26.50,00:41:27.50
Let me escape!

00:41:28.70,00:41:30.55
I've worked here for fifty years!

00:41:31.50,00:41:34.85
I'm seventy.[br]My days are numbered!

00:41:35.70,00:41:37.03
Let me die a free man...

00:41:43.70,00:41:45.03
Let me die a free man...

00:41:45.70,00:41:47.03
...even in a ditch.

00:41:49.92,00:41:51.55
Young Mutsu, you handle this.

00:42:12.04,00:42:13.15
Who did the branding?

00:42:13.68,00:42:15.31
Young Mutsu.

00:42:15.64,00:42:17.91
How cruel of him!

00:42:18.36,00:42:20.87
He'll die a miserable death.

00:42:21.16,00:42:23.03
Mutsu is a bad one.

00:42:23.32,00:42:25.03
Must be the son of a bandit or brigand.

00:42:39.12,00:42:42.71
You're not to blame,[br]so stop worrying.

00:42:44.28,00:42:47.55
- Instruct this newcomer.[br]- Pleased to meet you.

00:42:55.16,00:42:56.59
Take care of her.

00:43:20.00,00:43:21.79
Look. This way...

00:43:23.40,00:43:25.11
Try it.

00:43:33.16,00:43:35.91
- What's your name?[br]- Kohagi.

00:43:36.08,00:43:38.67
- Your age?[br]- 16.

00:43:38.84,00:43:40.95
- From a peasant family?[br]- Yes.

00:43:42.12,00:43:44.39
- Where were you sold from?[br]- Sado.

00:43:45.40,00:43:46.83
Sado?

00:43:48.00,00:43:52.19
- Do you know a woman named Tamaki?[br]- No.

00:43:53.60,00:43:57.67
She was sold to Sado ten years ago.

00:43:57.96,00:44:00.47
She was thirty-five...[br]She must be forty-five by now.

00:44:00.68,00:44:04.87
I don't know. Sado is a big island.

00:44:17.44,00:44:19.87
Feeling pain again Namiji?

00:44:20.44,00:44:23.71
I feel as though[br]a heavy stone's in my stomach.

00:44:23.92,00:44:25.87
But you're getting worse...

00:44:26.44,00:44:29.31
We can't rest until we die.

00:44:29.80,00:44:32.67
We're not human beings.

00:44:35.64,00:44:39.51
Why does the rest of[br]the world turn its back on us?

00:44:40.68,00:44:44.75
Don't be silly.[br]You're talking like a newcomer.

00:44:48.52,00:44:51.63
Now work hard or you too will be...

00:45:09.64,00:45:13.07
"How I long for you, Zushio..."

00:45:13.44,00:45:17.87
"Isn't life a torture..?"

00:45:23.40,00:45:28.07
"How I long for you, Anju..."

00:45:39.12,00:45:42.63
"Isn't it so hard?"

00:45:44.52,00:45:47.15
One moment.[br]What was that song?

00:45:49.24,00:45:51.35
Sing it again, will you?

00:45:51.88,00:45:55.15
It goes,[br]"How I long for you, Zushio and Anju."

00:45:55.40,00:45:57.35
Who taught you that?

00:45:57.56,00:45:59.67
It was once popular in Sado.

00:45:59.88,00:46:02.71
Who first sang such a sad song?

00:46:02.88,00:46:04.00
A courtesan, they say.

00:46:04.28,00:46:07.99
- Courtesan?[br]- One named Nakagimi.

00:46:08.36,00:46:11.87
Do you think she's still alive?

00:46:13.72,00:46:15.51
Well...I don't know.

00:46:15.76,00:46:18.71
You say it goes... 

00:46:18.76,00:46:20.81
"How I long for you, Zushio and Anju"

00:46:20.96,00:46:22.71
- Right?[br]- Yes.

00:46:23.00,00:46:24.87
- Sing it again.[br]- Yes.

00:46:27.88,00:46:31.87
"How I long for you, Zushio..."

00:46:43.04,00:46:47.15
"Isn't life a torture..?"

00:46:52.00,00:46:56.67
"How I long for you, Anju..."

00:47:11.28,00:47:12.75
It's Mother!

00:47:16.24,00:47:20.67
"Isn't it so hard?"

00:48:10.88,00:48:12.27
Wait for me![br]Wait for me!

00:48:15.52,00:48:18.19
Take me along![br]Please take me!

00:48:19.04,00:48:21.71
Here, take this!

00:48:22.34,00:48:25.11
Row off quickly![br]Quick! Please!

00:48:31.92,00:48:34.55
Too bad Nakagimi.[br]You won't see the mainland today!

00:48:40.92,00:48:42.56
She's impossible!

00:48:43.28,00:48:45.31
Cut her tendon so she can't run away.

00:48:47.48,00:48:51.91
Please, Boss I won't do it again![br]Have mercy on me!

00:49:16.88,00:49:21.23
Shut up!

00:50:00.56,00:50:01.99
Forgive me!

00:50:02.40,00:50:05.27
Watch this, girls.[br]All runaways meet this fate.

00:51:33.72,00:51:35.19
Stop it, Anju!

00:51:35.96,00:51:37.91
It's useless!

00:51:40.12,00:51:43.39
That was the first news about Mother.

00:51:44.48,00:51:46.43
You speak with cruelty.

00:51:46.76,00:51:49.63
Don't you think of Father[br]and Mother anymore?

00:51:50.96,00:51:52.67
Don't you long for them?

00:51:53.48,00:51:55.83
What's the use of longing for them?

00:51:58.28,00:52:01.47
If we escape from here...[br]there'll be...

00:52:01.64,00:52:03.07
How?

00:52:03.32,00:52:07.27
Without any money,[br]how will we look for them?

00:52:07.88,00:52:11.15
Look at us now![br]Better not to see them at all.

00:52:11.48,00:52:14.15
So, we'll go to Kyoto first[br]and become somebodies.

00:52:14.48,00:52:15.51
Somebodies? Fantastic.

00:52:15.68,00:52:20.11
We're servants, despite our birth.

00:52:20.28,00:52:21.59
Slaves!

00:52:21.96,00:52:23.99
Who'd bother with us?

00:52:25.48,00:52:28.43
You'd be sold to a brothel.

00:52:28.60,00:52:32.03
I'd become a thief.[br]Or we'd both be beggars.

00:52:32.60,00:52:37.67
You've the heart of a bandit already![br]A soul baser than that of a beggar!

00:52:39.64,00:52:42.20
How could you brand[br]a man's forehead like that?

00:52:42.36,00:52:47.87
How could you be so brutal?

00:52:48.84,00:52:50.79
Did you forget Father's words?

00:52:51.08,00:52:53.95
Aren't you ashamed before the image[br]you keep close to your heart?

00:53:00.92,00:53:03.03
Zushio! How could you?

00:53:03.20,00:53:05.76
The goodness did me no good!

00:53:06.60,00:53:11.19
It's better to be loyal to[br]the Bailiff and look for his favour.

00:53:12.16,00:53:15.27
You have changed.

00:53:42.40,00:53:43.91
Namiji is past cure.

00:53:44.08,00:53:47.11
Dump her in the forest.

00:54:00.76,00:54:03.79
Namiji is like our sister.

00:54:05.20,00:54:07.79
Please let her breathe her last here.

00:54:14.80,00:54:16.51
- Take her, Mutsu.[br]- Yes.

00:54:18.40,00:54:20.59
Don't take her, Brother.

00:54:21.44,00:54:25.55
She's still alive.[br]Don't give her to wild birds.

00:54:25.76,00:54:27.95
It's the Bailiff's order.

00:55:02.56,00:55:04.27
Another dead one?

00:55:05.68,00:55:07.63
This one's still alive.

00:55:08.63,00:55:10.76
- You take her![br]- Yes!

00:55:13.76,00:55:15.19
Open the gate.

00:55:30.84,00:55:32.79
Not you!

00:55:42.76,00:55:47.75
Next time you're reborn,[br]come to a family like the Bailiff's!

00:55:50.84,00:55:53.71
Remember![br]Be reborn to a rich family.

00:56:22.00,00:56:23.87
Hey, hurry up.

00:56:33.56,00:56:38.71
I tied this to the Buddha,[br]so hold it tight.

00:56:45.12,00:56:48.15
And this is an image of[br]the Goddess of Mercy!

00:56:48.56,00:56:52.83
You'll be reborn fortunate[br]in the world to come.

00:57:10.60,00:57:11.35
Ready?

00:57:11.52,00:57:17.11
That's too ruthless.[br]Can't I cover her against the frost?

00:57:18.04,00:57:20.31
Then, do it quickly.

00:57:20.76,00:57:22.55
Brother...
