1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,470
"I always have the feeling that\NI'm losing something," she said.

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,030
I was just a middle school student at that time,

3
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,020
so I couldn't possibly understand what she meant.

4
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,930
But still,

5
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,060
her words moved me.

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,940
It was before the war,

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,450
when the huge island called Ezo

8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,040
was still a foreign territory.

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,470
Amazing!

10
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,740
An airplane!

11
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,330
On that day long ago,

12
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,470
beyond those clouds,

13
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,490
lies the place of our promise.

14
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,400
"In your delirious fever, panting,

{\fad(300,300)}She recites a poem by Miyazawa Kenji \N "Eiketsu no Asa" or "Morning of Final Farewell"

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,210
you asked me for

17
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,710
the last bowl of snow that fell from the sky,

18
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,640
galaxy, sun and atmospheric strata

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
...Between two pieces of granite

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,890
sleet makes a solitary puddle.

21
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,520
I stand on them, precariously,

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,560
keeping the pure, white,

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,230
two-phased balance of snow and water,

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,250
and get for my gentle sister her last food..."

25
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,140
In those days, we admired two things.

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,770
How much longer?

27
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,600
We still have time.

28
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,480
Here!

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
That's hot!

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
Thank you.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
Hiroki, when do you work next?

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,890
Well, I've got club activities today and\Ntomorrow, so maybe the day after.

33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,260
How about you, Takuya?

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,550
Tomorrow morning's my last day of training too.

35
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,830
Then it's decided, the day after tomorrow, okay?

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,950
Okay.

37
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,670
One of the things that we admired\Nwas our classmate, Sayuri Sawatari.

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,600
And the other was that enormous tower that rose beyond the border across the Tsugaru Strait.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,370
I didn't know how to solve that problem at all,

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,190
I was always looking up at that tower.

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,280
so I asked the teacher and...

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,420
And?

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,540
I felt something very important\N to me was waiting there.

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,440
I was filled with yearning.

45
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,630
Someday...

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,940
Someday,

47
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,650
I will go there.

48
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,160
Shirakawa-senpai!

49
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,270
We'll go on ahead.

50
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah, sorry.

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,340
Well, you seniors are stepping down today, so...

52
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,240
There's something we'd like to give you.

53
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,780
Go on, Kana-chan!

54
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,140
What? Hey...

55
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
Well...

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,710
Here!

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,080
So you turned her down?

58
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,680
Just like the others.

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,050
Yeah...

60
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,030
Matsuura, huh? That's a shame.

61
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,530
She's pretty cute.

62
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,100
Then you go out with her, Hiroki.

63
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,530
What?!

64
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,440
Would you have hooked up with her?

65
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,670
What? No... Why would I?

66
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,870
You like someone else, is that it?

67
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,440
What? Why?

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,080
No, well, I mean... I think she's cute and all, but...

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,580
I don't really know what to do

70
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,540
when you're, uh, dating someone.

71
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,990
You're not the one she confessed to, you know?

72
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,580
Hey, you asked!

73
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,820
Sawatari...

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Fujisawa-kun!

75
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,160
Sawatari...

76
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,860
You're going home late today.

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,170
Yeah, I stayed behind. I was practicing...

78
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,200
Violin?

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah...

80
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,470
Shirakawa-kun's not with you?

81
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,470
No. I was practicing too. For my club.

82
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,770
I notice you sometimes practice archery alone.

83
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,510
Y-Yeah...

84
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,180
Oh, I'm not any good,

85
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,780
so I get distracted easily, so...

86
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,190
Do you have any plans for spring break, Fujisawa-kun?

87
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,090
Yeah.

88
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,390
Takuya and I have a part-time job lined up.

89
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,900
A job? I'm so jealous! Where is it?

90
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,230
A factory in Hamana. They do subcontracting for the military.

91
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,170
We'll be putting together guided missiles and stuff.

92
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,900
I see. It's great that you've got a job.

93
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,110
All I've got are my club activities...

94
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,210
Oh yeah?

95
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah...

96
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,790
The next station is Nakaoguni, Nakaoguni.

97
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,160
After Nakaoguni, we'll stop at Oodaira.

98
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
We're already at my station.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,830
You know what?

100
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,950
Last night, I had a dream that\NI would go home with you like this.

101
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,910
Bye-bye! I'll see you next semester!

102
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,030
Okay...

103
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,877
Meanwhile, it appears tensions raised by

104
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,680
NJapan's response to the North-South problem

105
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,280
will be the focus of the 11th Summit,

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,614
a proposed three-day meeting between America

107
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,790
Nand the Union set to begin on the 12th.

108
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,128
The Union government voiced deep concern

109
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,760
N regarding the reinforcement of Misawa Base

110
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,914
and other American facilities,

111
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,500
N while the American government ...

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,060
expressed apprehension that the Union

113
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,102
has yet to reveal the purpose of the enormous

114
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,030
NTower facility built on Ezo territory.

115
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,530
Hello!

116
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,060
Alright! Tea time, huh?

117
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,580
Sure is, come have a seat.

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,790
Okay.

119
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
You're late, Hiroki.

120
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,140
Sorry.

121
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,770
Hiroki, I heard what you did.

122
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,810
{\fad(200,200)}A Chukar is an Asian bird similar to the European pheasant

123
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,810
You guys went and stole a Chukar\Ntarget drone from the MSDF?

124
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,240
Like I said...

125
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,580
That's not true!

126
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,180
We didn't steal it.

127
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,580
We found it in Amagamori!

128
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,520
So you stole it.

129
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,600
Well, they are flying a lot of drones in\N their training exercises these days,

130
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,090
I guess it'll be all right.

131
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,920
Just make sure they don't trace it back to you.

132
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,090
That's right.

133
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,290
The Public Safety Commission\Nalready keeps an eye on this place.

134
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,130
Don't say things that could damage my reputation!

135
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,000
Back to work! Work!

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,470
Yes, Sir.

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,070
See you later.

138
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,600
Okay.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,040
Okay.

140
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,740
And you two. Starting tomorrow,\N you show up ready to work, okay?

141
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,780
I'll be workin' you for the cost of\N those materials and then some.

142
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,150
Yes, Sir.

143
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,080
Well then...

144
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
If you'll excuse us.

145
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,950
Okay.

146
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,110
There was a reason we started working.

147
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,380
I heard that when Ezo was still called Hokkaido,

148
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,590
and it was still part of this country,

149
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,590
there were plans to dig a tunnel under the Tsugaru Strait.

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,440
It ended up being interrupted due to the\NSeparation between north and south,

151
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,170
but in the mountains around here,

152
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,930
you can sometimes find tracks and abandoned stations,

153
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,060
remnants of the old construction days.

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,610
Last year, we started building something in an abandoned station at the top of this mountain.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,140
Emishi Manufacturing does \Nsubcontracting for the US military,

156
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,650
and we started working there so we could buy parts for this thing.

157
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,930
The place that looks so close it's like you could reach out and grab it,

158
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,230
but you can never actually get to.

159
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,570
We wanted to see it with our own eyes...

160
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,400
that strange island and the enormous Tower that rose from it.

161
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,040
A lot of the snow has melted away, huh? I'd like to get started again soon.

162
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,350
Here's hoping we don't get any more snow...

163
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,290
In any case, we'd better try and\Nget all the remaining materials.

164
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,390
We still don't have the exterior\N nanonet or the self-starting motor.

165
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,500
The superconducting motor's the main thing, right? And we're also gonna need kerosene...

166
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,140
Even with this part-time job,

167
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,970
we may not be able to make enough money.

168
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,140
Don't worry. It'll work out.

169
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,170
There's always summer break.

170
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,160
Yeah, that's true.

171
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,280
We were planning to fly in this\N airplane we named Bella Ciela

172
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,110
to that Tower beyond the border.

173
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,090
That same dream again...

174
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,000
Sawatari.

175
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,680
Takuya-kun...

176
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,740
Um...\NSo, anyway...

177
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,540
Oh, sorry.

178
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,440
That's okay.

179
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,770
Hiroki said...\NHiroki said...

180
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,780
We haven't talked that much, have we?

181
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Just the two of us.

182
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
Guess not.

183
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,590
Takuya-kun, do you like physics?

184
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,720
What? Oh, this book?

185
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,770
Yeah, it's kinda interesting.

186
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,470
That's amazing.

187
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,040
They say my grandpa was a physicist.

188
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,710
Really? That's more amazing.

189
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,580
I've never met him, though.

190
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,980
Because of the Separation?

191
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah...

192
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,950
Oh...

193
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,750
The train bound for Hirosaki\Nis arriving at Platform 3.

194
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,520
Hey, do you guys still have that job?

195
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,690
Is it fun?

196
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,130
I don't know.

197
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,900
It's run by this scary old man.

198
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,560
He yells at us and makes us work hard.

199
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,200
Is he really that scary?

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,570
He's like a demon or something.

201
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,740
Really?

202
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,040
You wanna come and see for yourself?

203
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,030
Well...

204
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,270
But won't I be in your way?

205
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,680
No, I bet Hiroki will be happy to see you too.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,340
Okay! I'll come by!

207
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,210
The train bound for Kanita and Minmaya\Nis arriving at Platform 2.

208
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,310
Please step back and wait\N behind the white line.

209
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,880
Hey, Takuya-kun?

210
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,190
This may sound strange, but promise that you won't laugh?

211
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,060
What is it? I won't laugh.

212
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,290
Then I'll tell you. It's...

213
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,950
Why did you go and do something like that?

214
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,350
What could I do?

215
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,780
The conversation just kind of went in that direction.

216
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,830
What do we do?

217
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,870
Do we tell her about flying to the Tower too?

218
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,730
Bad idea.

219
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,340
Yeah...

220
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,040
But what do we do if she asks us where we're going?

221
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,810
Um...

222
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,970
Hey...

223
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,780
Yes?

224
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,730
Hello.

225
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,730
Hey, it's hot today, huh?

226
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,430
Hello. I hope you don't mind me stopping by.

227
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, sorry.

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,600
Thanks for always looking after these two morons.

229
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,480
So... Do you think Okabe-san is single?

230
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,420
Nah, I heard a rumor that he's divorced.

231
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,820
Somehow that makes sense.

232
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,960
I didn't know there was a place like this here!

233
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,590
It's so big!

234
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,250
Amazing!

235
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,010
An airplane?

236
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,070
That's right.

237
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,250
You two are building this yourselves?

238
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,690
Yeah... We've been working on it little by little\Nsince our eighth grade summer  vacation.

239
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,260
We've been working at that\N factory back there to get parts

240
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,430
and advice from Okabe-san.

241
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,230
Right?

242
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,360
Yep...

243
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,560
It's still far from complete though.

244
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,030
It's amazing...

245
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,610
Hey, this is really amazing!

246
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,210
Thanks...

247
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,640
Hey...

248
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,700
When do you think it will be done?

249
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,510
We'd really like to finish it\Nduring summer vacation, but...

250
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,930
That's probably not gonna happen.

251
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,550
It looks like it's gonna take a lot more time.

252
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,450
I guess we're hoping to finish\Nit before the end of the year.

253
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,680
Oh...

254
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,620
Say, where are you going to fly it to?

255
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,550
To the Tower.

256
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,090
Tower?

257
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,090
Do you mean the Union's Tower?

258
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,090
Yep...

259
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,070
We think it'll take about forty\Nminutes to fly to the Tower.

260
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,900
The real problem is how we're\Ngoing to cross the border,

261
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,940
but we've got some ideas about that too.

262
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,000
Wow! Hokkaido sounds great!

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,930
Do you wanna go too, Sawatari?

264
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,860
What? Would that be okay?

265
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,230
Sure!

266
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,980
Really? Okay, I'll go! I really wanna go!

267
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,490
Wow! Thank you!

268
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,920
But I don't know if it'll even fly, though.

269
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Don't worry! It'll fly for sure!

270
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,860
Yeah!

271
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,030
We're going, then! It's a promise, okay?

272
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,560
Yeah.

273
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
It's a promise.

274
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,500
Okay!

275
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,250
In those days, I felt at that time...

276
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,170
that place would remain unchanged for the rest of my life.

277
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,770
The Tower that stood beyond the clouds

278
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,440
became an important promised place to me...

279
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,660
At that moment, we weren't afraid of anything.

280
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,370
The truth was that the world... history was changing.

281
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,680
But in those days, the smells of\Nthe night wafting into the train,

282
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,090
the trust I had in my friend, and the presence of Sayuri that lingered in the air...

283
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,540
these were everything in the world to me.

284
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,960
US-Japanese and Union forces clashed\Nin a minor armed conflict last night

285
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,930
until just before dawn this morning.

286
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,600
The skirmish occurred in the buffer area between\Nthe Tsugaru Strait and the 42nd latitude.

287
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,840
Upon hearing this, the Metropolitan Police Department announced\N that they will deploy 3300 guards in Tokyo prefecture

288
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,040
as a precaution against terrorist activities directed toward the Union Embassy by organizations such as the Uilta Liberation Front.

289
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,970
Yeah

290
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,020
If you've got the money, I'll sell\Nyou kerosene or whatever,

291
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,120
but jet fuel's gonna be expensive.

292
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,140
Why don't you guys just use a\Nreciprocating or large electric motor?

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,700
You know how to do the rest?

294
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,360
Yes.

295
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,590
All right. Take care of it.

296
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,650
Why do you wanna go through all the \Ntrouble of using a jet engine anyway?

297
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,150
'Cause it's cool!

298
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,650
That's the only reason?

299
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,920
Hold on a second, we had other reasons, right?

300
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,620
Let's see... Oh, yeah! That one!

301
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,390
'Cause we were lucky enough to find it!

302
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,670
That's not it!

303
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,750
What was it?

304
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,660
Remember, the reason we made it a dual engine?

305
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,730
There was a good reason for it.

306
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,330
Oh, that's right!

307
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,870
'Cause we wanted it to transform!

308
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,100
That's not it!

309
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,640
Whatever... I don't care what it was.

310
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,020
Just don't kill yourselves, all right?

311
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,650
It'll be a hassle for me.

312
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,350
Oh, yeah. You two be sure to come here\Nevery day when summer vacation starts.

313
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,280
Yes, Sir!

314
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,250
So...

315
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,920
You really want me to play it?

316
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,320
Yeah, we'll come see you after school.

317
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,830
I'm not that good, though.

318
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,460
Don't worry.

319
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,720
I've never even seen someone play a violin.

320
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,570
Let me hear it.

321
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,190
I'd like to hear too.

322
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm so nervous...

323
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,920

324
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,500
Nanonet doesn't reflect radar, right?

325
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,740
But we'll be flying into the buffer area.

326
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,410
Nanonet trim or not, if we aren't careful,

327
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,770
the US military will spot us even before the Union can.

328
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,120
I guess we'll have to fly as low as possible,

329
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,350
so we can blend in with the waves\N and the contours of the land.

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,290
If we leave early, we can use\Nthe morning haze as cover too.

331
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,430
Do we have a map of Ezo?

332
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,830
This is the only detailed one we've got.

333
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,160
We won't know the landscape\N until we get there,

334
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
so we have no choice but to measure\Nthe altitude once we're over land.

335
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,670
But as long as we're over land,\NUnion radars won't spot us, right?

336
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,010
The Bella Ciela's radar profile\Nshould be smaller than a bird.

337
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,980
Yeah... Unless we're really unlucky.

338
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,750
Sawatari!

339
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,750
Hold on!

340
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,340
It's all right. It's not that high.

341
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,720
We've done this before...

342
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,630
I'm glad I made it in time. I'll just...

343
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,240
Are you all right?

344
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Yeah...

345
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,820
Sorry.

346
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,750
Thank you.

347
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,480
Hey!

348
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,790
Ha! He wasn't expecting that!

349
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,760
What did you do that for?!

350
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,090
Stop it, Hiroki-kun!

351
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,400
Sorry, I just had to.

352
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
What did you say?!

353
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,470
What the heck are you thinking, anyway?

354
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,110
C'mon, don't be so angry.

355
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,780
I'm angry all right!

356
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,710
Just stay there!

357
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,680
Let's go, Sawatari.

358
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,150
Takuya...

359
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,750
Sawatari, say something to him!

360
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,450
Sorry, Takuya-kun.

361
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,490
Hiroki's stupid.

362
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,820
Forget about him and let's just go.

363
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,450
Hey, Takuya...

364
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,040
Earlier, for just a second,

365
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,310
I was having a dream.

366
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,040
A dream? What kind of dream?

367
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,180
I forgot.

368
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,020
But it was probably about that Tower.

369
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,660
It's an unbelievable view, isn't it?

370
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,920
The Union is incredible.

371
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,290
The tip of the Tower looks like it might\Neven lead to some other world.

372
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,040
The sun... It's setting so slowly, isn't it?

373
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,920
That summer was truly special...

374
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,830
But from that point on, the world around me would betray me many times over.

375
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,560
It's been three years since that day...

376
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,170
since I last saw Sawatari.

377
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,080
Pay no mind to our visitors, all right?

378
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,630
First phase completed.

379
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,490
Next phase.

380
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,180
Okay!

381
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,590
Next is the filtering stage.

382
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,590
Commencing second phase.

383
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,100
Directional resolution is 25 percent higher than before.

384
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,970
That's good. I wonder if we can do it this time?

385
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,300
Choose a good algorithm, okay?

386
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,770
Yes, Sir.

387
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,270
How's that algorithm, Shirakawa?

388
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,770
I modified the filtering for group sampling.

389
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,610
This idea's based on Ekusun Tsukinoe's thesis.

390
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,110
Ekusun Tsukinoe?

391
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,240
From the Union?

392
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,110
Yes.

393
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,650
What? How did you...

394
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,670
A moment, please.

395
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,120
Reaction is starting to increase.

396
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
Who's that?

397
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,690
The Union researcher who first proved\Nthe existence of parallel worlds.

398
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,460
They say he designed the Tower.

399
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,630
I have it!

400
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,210
Exposure reactions confirmed\Nin orientations XA, YC and ZC.

401
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,130
There are five, no, six branch universes!

402
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,470
Six? Begin harmonization stage.

403
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,970
Get us a link, all right?

404
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,300
Commencing third phase.

405
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,640
Each of you try connecting with the closest\Nparallel world. Begin your approach.

406
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,470
Yes, Sir!

407
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,610
He's fast!

408
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,520
Shirakawa-kun is the closest.

409
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,150
Twelve more Exa to reach the connectable territory,

410
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,160
11... 10... 9.4... 9.2...

411
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,540
We have a connection!

412
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,430
We've successfully connected\Nto a nearby branch universe.

413
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,030
The exposure reactions are stable.

414
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,330
Good, let's move on to the conversion stage.

415
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,140
Commencing fourth phase,

416
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,540
spatial displacement with the parallel world.

417
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,990
That spiral is the tower?

418
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,530
Yes, that's right.

419
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,670
We're going to switch this minute center section with that of a separate universe.

420
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,750
Disparate matter conversion confirmed.\NRadius is 60 nanos. It's expanding rapidly.

421
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,020
We'll soon be able to confirm visually.

422
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,390
That part is completely different matter,\Ncomposed of a totally different universe.

423
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,180
You mean like the experiments done on the Ezo Tower?

424
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,640
Yes, but that was on a much larger scale...

425
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:38,900
We succeeded once out of many tries to replace\Nthe space the size of a particle of sand.

426
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,310
This isn't good.

427
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,880
It's no good!

428
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,550
Exposure reactions are decreasing.

429
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,390
We can't maintain the connection\N with the parallel world any longer.

430
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,060
Wave function has converged.

431
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,430
The branch universes have completely disappeared.

432
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,160
We succeeded in replacing approximately\Na 1.3mm radius of disparate matter.

433
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,010
Good work.

434
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,910
Thanks.

435
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,420
Professor Tomizawa, is Shirakawa-kun free now?

436
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,820
He is. I swear, you two are always together.

437
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,220
You were the one who asked me to stay close\Nto him until he gets used to this place.

438
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,560
I said that?

439
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,800
By the way, Maki-chan, I'm going\N to Tokyo tomorrow on business.

440
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,730
That meeting to discuss our\Nresearch findings, right?

441
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,430
That too, but it seems they found the key.

442
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,500
The key? You mean the one\Nyou told me about before?

443
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,440
Yeah.

444
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,670
Things could get busy for you and\Nthe rest of the Brain Science team.

445
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,710
Maki-san...

446
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,820
There've been a lot of military\N officers here recently, huh?

447
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,230
The one in the suit is probably with the NSA.

448
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,690
NSA?

449
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,290
The National Security Agency.

450
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,920
Oh... Well, there have been a lot\N of rumors about terrorism lately.

451
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,170
Did it go well today?

452
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,870
Still not well enough.

453
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,710
We've just barely managed to replace\Nenough matter to see with the naked eye.

454
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,040
We're a long way from the Union's Tower.

455
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,810
Well, that can't be helped.

456
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,690
They had a big head start on \Nus, right from basic physics.

457
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,690
I saw that Ezo aerial photo too.

458
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,720
What we don't know is why the disparate matter\Nconversion stops at a 2km radius from the Tower.

459
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,100
If the Tower was built to be used as\N a weapon, it doesn't make sense.

460
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,790
Maybe an accident or something\Nknocked it out of commission...

461
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,040
Or maybe it's nothing more than\Na simple experimental facility.

462
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,310
Either that, or the matter conversion is\Nsomething the designer didn't even intend.

463
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,810
Professor Tomizawa says there may be some external factor keeping the Tower from functioning properly.

464
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,760
Say, Shirakawa-kun... What are you doing tomorrow?

465
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,730
High school's on break too, right?

466
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,130
Uh, I kinda need to do some research.

467
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,130
At the library?

468
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,770
No. At a factory that someone I know runs...

469
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,140
Someone wants to see the factory?\NWe don't offer tours, y'know!

470
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,250
Huh? What was that?

471
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,140
A girl? How old is she?

472
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,730
How should I know?

473
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,150
But I'd say she's pretty... probably.

474
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,210
Okay, then! I'll be waiting.

475
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,630
Wow!

476
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,160
What amazing antennas!

477
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,810
Well, some of them are a little illegal,

478
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,830
but they can pick up signals from \Nsome pretty interesting places.

479
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,620
So you specialize in brain research, Maki-san?

480
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,630
Yes. Things like memories, sleep and dreams.

481
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,160
But you and Takuya work at the same lab?

482
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,530
I thought you were studying the Tower.

483
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,260
I am... I do research on the Tower and...

484
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,900
How can I put this?

485
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,130
Both of our research deals with parallel worlds.

486
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,760
Parallel worlds?

487
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,380
You know how a person will have dreams at night?

488
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,640
Well, the universe has "dreams" too.

489
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,370
Our world hides all these different possibilities,

490
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,880
things that could have been, inside dreams.

491
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,180
We call these "parallel worlds" or "branch universes".

492
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,760
My research involves studying the effects that these\Nparallel worlds have on people's brains and dreams.

493
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,700
A popular theory states that the Union's \NTower is observing these same things.

494
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,670
Technology has allowed us \Nto view the parallel worlds,

495
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:08,310
but the nervous systems of various life forms may\Nhave subconsciously sensed them for millennia.

496
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,360
What we call "precognition" or "premonitions" may\N actually be a kind of exchange of information

497
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,610
about the branch universes that occurs\Nat the quantum level within the brain.

498
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,890
That's the kind of research that I do.

499
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,190
Wow.

500
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,910
The dreams of the universe...

501
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,790
Sounds romantic, huh?

502
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,660
Romantic?

503
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,630
Got a problem with that?

504
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,620
Nope... No...

505
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,770
I think you're amazing, Maki-san.

506
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,170
Imagine, being a researcher at a facility that does consultation\N work for the government at such a young age!

507
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,340
Please, it's nothing special.

508
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,770
The Tower fascinates me, it's fulfilling work.

509
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,550
To tell you the truth, it\N used to fascinate me too.

510
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,780
Anyway, the one who's really\Namazing here is Shirakawa-kun!

511
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,270
He's not just the youngest outside researcher\Nwe have, he's the most enthusiastic one!

512
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,790
Right from the start, I thought he was really cool!

513
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,270
What? No...

514
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,090
I'm not like that at all.

515
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,270
I'd better be going now.

516
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,540
Oh, I'm sorry. It looks\N like I ate most of them.

517
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,000
Don't worry about it.

518
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,240
Takuya,

519
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,010
you going to the city?

520
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,150
Yes, I'm taking Maki-san home.

521
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,610
Give me a ride too.

522
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,550
Huh?

523
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,120
Okay.

524
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,310
What?!

525
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,800
Can you drop me off at the station?

526
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,670
Aren't you going home, Okabe-san?

527
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,830
No, I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow on business.

528
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,300
Okabe-san ...

529
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,240
Huh?

530
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Have you thought about that favor I asked?

531
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,780
What was it again?

532
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,180
Uilta.

533
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,220
Ah. Persistent, aren't you?

534
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,090
Anyway, it looks like the lab\Nis keeping you pretty busy.

535
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,890
And the work is good, right?

536
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,690
That's not really the point.

537
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,360
I just want to settle this Tower business...

538
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,760
and soon.

539
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,500
What's the matter?

540
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, no.

541
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,770
Well, I didn't think you could\Nsee the Tower from Tokyo too.

542
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,740
Well, there are days like that sometimes.

543
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,810
But the air is quite clear today.

544
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,780
This way, please.

545
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,820
That's the progression of her condition\Nsince she was admitted to this hospital.

546
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,450
She began showing symptoms in\N the summer of her eighth grade.

547
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,450
Cause: unknown.

548
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,660
Her sleep cycles gradually grew longer\Nand in just the first two months

549
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,130
she was only able to stay awake\Nfor limited periods of time.

550
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,530
She's been sound asleep for the past three years.

551
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,240
So she's been having some sort of dream?

552
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,300
That's what the brain waves\Nwe've recorded would indicate.

553
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,470
Ah. And what about the DNA test?

554
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,630
On page six.

555
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,940
I see...

556
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,610
Her family's separated, eh? Fine.

557
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,020
Thank you.

558
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,190
These are the documents requested from\N the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

559
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,590
You'll receive the official documents as\N soon as the transfer date is decided.

560
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,870
What's this letter?

561
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,920
The patient wrote this letter when she first arrived.

562
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Have you read it?

563
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,380
No.

564
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,380
Emishi Manufacturing...

565
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,430
Thus, by analyzing the deviations\Nbetween the multiple universes,

566
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,860
it becomes possible to render a highly\Naccurate prediction of our own future.

567
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,930
Herein lies the ultimate goal of\N my own research laboratory.

568
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,250
This is not a conventional theoretical \N model or probability theory,

569
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,870
this is information based entirely\Non the results of an actual future.

570
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,900
The influence it could have on decision-making

571
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,920
in the political and military \Narenas will likely be incalculable.

572
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,880
However, to be perfectly rational,\N we must also consider

573
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,930
that the Union has already applied quantum gravity\N theory to technology far superior to our own.

574
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,100
Construction of the symbolic Ezo Tower is thought to have started in 1974,

575
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,050
immediately after the North-South Separation.

576
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,430
Its operation started in 1996 or so.

577
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,550
It is ironic to us, in the Alliance,\N  that Ekusun Tsukinoe,

578
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:37,290
said to have played a central role in its design, is originally from the mainland.

579
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,880
So...

580
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,980
Next, I'll explain some of the technological innovations...

581
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,630
that we've already used to glean\Ninformation on the parallel worlds.

582
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,750
When I saw you, I thought, "Now\Nthere's a guy with a bad attitude."

583
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,670
Hey, I was listening.

584
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:02,400
Basically, you wanna have a peek at God's\Ndreams and do a little analyzing, right?

585
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,830
Well, that's more or less correct.

586
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,940
What's this, Oka-chan? You find this interesting?

587
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,970
I've done my homework.

588
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,050
Let's do something tonight?

589
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,490
It's been a while.

590
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,250
Shirakawa is excellent.

591
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,080
He's definitely got talent.

592
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,990
You're glad you talked to him, right?

593
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,790
Yeah. But tell me, Oka-chan,

594
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,160
just when did you start helping students find jobs?

595
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,460
Well,

596
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,430
...these two are a little special.

597
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,460
These two?

598
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,230
Yeah. There's another one who\Nshould be in Tokyo by now,

599
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,100
but I can't get hold of him.\NI'm a little worried.

600
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,800
Y'know, those two were building their own airplane.

601
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,710
Hey, that brings back memories!

602
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,810
Wait. You came to Tokyo for that?

603
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,110
I thought you were here for\Nsomething completely different.

604
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,980
Like what?

605
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,450
Uilta.

606
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,880
Actually, you're right.

607
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,620
That's the main reason.

608
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,790
We're going to get our hands\Non a PL outer-shell bomb.

609
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,720
Don't ask from where.

610
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,190
I don't have to. I already\Nmore or less have an idea.

611
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,690
So what are you getting at?

612
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,660
Don't tell me you're asking\Nif it'll work against the Tower?

613
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,790
Bingo.

614
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,700
I'm sure it will.

615
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,740
The exterior of the Tower \Nwill likely vaporize instantly.

616
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,300
The interior is supposedly made up of huge nanonet ribbons,

617
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,800
but it'll probably go down in flames too.

618
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,690
Yeah...

619
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,820
A PL outer-shell bomb may be\N the best suited for the job.

620
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,010
I see.

621
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,020
You know...

622
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,620
You might want to reconsider. If Uilta does this,

623
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,260
it will increase the chances of starting a war.

624
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,590
That's why we're doing it.

625
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,260
It's already been decided on?

626
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,530
More or less.

627
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,040
A lot of powerful people are eager for war.

628
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,240
I thought Uilta's philosophy was\Nreunification with the North.

629
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,310
Still is.

630
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,340
It just feels like destroying\Nthe Tower would be such a waste.

631
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,610
From the Alliance standpoint, it's the\Nproduct of unbelievable technologies.

632
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,502
Besides, it's just standing there.

633
00:40:57,503 --> 00:40:59,450
NIts impact on us is negligible...

634
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,820
Don't be coy with me.

635
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,080
The Tower appears to currently be out of commission,

636
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,190
but it's possible that it's an extremely powerful weapon...

637
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,090
one that can turn the space around it inside-out.

638
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,430
You knew about that?

639
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,300
Yeah.

640
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,770
It sure makes for a beautiful view, though...

641
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,520
Every once in a while,

642
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,360
there's bound to be a romantic who thinks like you.

643
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,770
Can I ask you a question, Oka-chan?

644
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,040
Not too long ago,

645
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,680
they found someone who might be\N connected to the secrets of the Tower.

646
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,080
Is that so?

647
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,120
A girl, still in her teens.

648
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,110
I see. And?

649
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,590
You know her, don't you, Oka-chan?

650
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm not trying to pester you,

651
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,720
but it'd be better to keep this from Shirakawa-kun

652
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,760
until we know more about her.

653
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,110
Especially if they were close.

654
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,970
He'll find out eventually.

655
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,540
Even so, we don't have to\Nworry him about it now, right?

656
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,690
And anyway, this has already fallen under the NSA's jurisdiction.

657
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,570
It'd be best if you stayed out of it.

658
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,710
What kind of dreams does the universe have?

659
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,180
I'd like to have them too...

660
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,650
A cold, deep wind blew there,

661
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,780
a wind that seemed as if it had\N come from a distant universe.

662
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,640
Even the air had the smell\N of a different universe.

663
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,090
The sky...

664
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,400
The clouds...

665
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,100
A city in ruins...

666
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,690
There are no people, no matter how far I walk.

667
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,560
I'm cold...

668
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,170
What am I doing in a place like this?

669
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,040
Someone... Someone!

670
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,350
Hiroki-kun...

671
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,660
That dream again...

672
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,040
We ended up not flying the Bella Ciela, after all.

673
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,950
It was kind of a shock when Sayuri disappeared\Nwithout saying anything three years ago.

674
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,730
Because of that, we stopped working on the plane,

675
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,290
and I think that in turn made us angry at ourselves.

676
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,090
After graduating from middle school,

677
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,020
Takuya entered a high school in Aomori Prefecture,

678
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,420
and I entered one here in Tokyo.

679
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,740
From here, I thought,

680
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,770
I wouldn't have to look at the Tower anymore.

681
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,040
But I was in for a disappointment.

682
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,370
Sometimes, when the weather is nice,

683
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,410
I can still see it in the distance...

684
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,400
and I'd be overwhelmed by a depression

685
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,420
that would last all day.

686
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,860
These tanks

687
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,200
are going all the way to your hometown, right?

688
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,330
Yeah, I guess.

689
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,570
This looks slow enough to jump on, don't you think?

690
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,160
What do you say we hop a ride to Aomori together?

691
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,670
Sometimes Okabe-san would send me letters,

692
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,770
letting me know how things were going.

693
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,240
I've never once written back to him.

694
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,180
Every time I get to my room and shut the door,

695
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,830
I feel a stabbing pain in my heart

696
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,780
as if all the bones in my body

697
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,360
are breaking through my skin.

698
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,490
And I wonder when it was that I became burdened with something like this.

699
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:19,540
And now the latest news on the highly\Ntense international relations.

700
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,710
At the UN Security Council held on the 19th,

701
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,210
America once again demanded that the Union allow\Na UN inspection group into its Ezo Tower facility.

702
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,920
In response to this, the Union Government\N stubbornly maintained their staunch refusal...

703
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,050
I was living alone and the nights felt long.

704
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,060
When I couldn't find anything to occupy my time,

705
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,290
I would walk to the nearby station

706
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,830
and pretend I was waiting for someone.

707
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,940
Once l grew bored of that,

708
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,930
I'd walk back to my room as slowly as possible.

709
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,810
I had friends at high school,

710
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,440
but I found that other than\N when I was wearing the uniform,

711
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,710
I really didn't want to be around them.

712
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,720
Come to think of it, in a city of\Nmore than thirty million people,

713
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,720
there wasn't a single person\NI wanted to see or talk to.

714
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,190
Sometimes, on days like those,

715
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,720
I would dream of Sayuri.

716
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:23,270
I'd dream that she was in some cold place all by herself. I would look for her, frantically...

717
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:28,040
But in the end, I never find her.

718
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,080
Even after I awoke, however,\N I could feel Sayuri's presence

719
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,810
lingering inside me, and it\N would make my heart tremble.

720
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,410
One day, I realized it was my\Nthird winter since I'd come to Tokyo.

721
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:50,520
It was as if I was holding my breath\Nunderwater... Cold, deep water.

722
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,370
And it was like that every day.

723
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm the only one...

724
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,600
I'm the only one left in the whole world...

725
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,070
That's how it feels.

726
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,530
It was my dream to come to Ezo someday.

727
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,000
Now here I am, easy as that.

728
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah. It's just the southern tip, though.

729
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,340
You have family on the Union side or something?

730
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,360
No, it's nothing like that.

731
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,540
Your generation was born after the Separation,

732
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,710
so I can understand your fascination with it all...

733
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,550
But the boss got taken away from\Nhis family because of the Separation,

734
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,550
so I'll bet he feels differently about the issue.

735
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,180
Really?

736
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:51,690
Still, I didn't expect this.

737
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:52,860
Huh?

738
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,070
I didn't think that the boss would involve you in this.

739
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,070
I begged and pleaded.

740
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,540
And I said that if he didn't bring me along,

741
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,070
I'd file a report with the Public Safety Commission.

742
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,800
What a dangerous thing you said...

743
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,550
Boss!

744
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,840
This is not funny!

745
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,700
What a stupid official!

746
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,050
They found out about our communication!

747
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,990
Ship us out!

748
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,100
That was a little too close this time.

749
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,020
Yeah, but now we're that much closer

750
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,070
to infiltrating their airspace.

751
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,940
I guess it was a good thing we came all the way out here.

752
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,210
Right?

753
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,110
Boss, there's a ship!

754
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,580
It's a patrol boat!

755
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,350
Your ship is in our territorial waters.

756
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:55,120
Halt, or we will open fire.

757
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,120
It's already decided that we're goin' to war anyway...

758
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,320
We repeat...

759
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,320
What're they taking their jobs so seriously for?!

760
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,120
This is not good. Lose them!

761
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,020
Yes, Sir!

762
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,460
Three more minutes 'til the border!

763
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,660
Sato, Miyagawa, get to the gun emplacement!

764
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,290
Halt, or we will open fire.

765
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,810
Takuya!

766
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,150
Are you all right, Takuya?!

767
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,670
Those wings...

768
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,700
I know them!

769
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,050
When I wake up, for a second...

770
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,190
I don't quite know where I am.

771
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:15,160
Sometimes, I think that maybe\NI came to the wrong place.

772
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,820
By now, I feel the dream about Sayuri...

773
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,370
is more real than reality itself.

774
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,620
She's in a hospital?

775
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,890
Sayuri...

776
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,830
Hiroki-kun... Takuya-kun...

777
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,800
I'm sorry for leaving without saying anything.

778
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,840
It makes me sad... I wanted to\Nspend the summer with you.

779
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,650
When I woke up, I was in a hospital in Tokyo, and I've been here ever since.

780
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:40,050
The people here tell me I should sever all the ties I had from before,

781
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:44,180
but I begged them and so now\N I'm writing you this letter.

782
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,450
I'll send this to Okabe-san so\Nthe two of you will read it.

783
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,600
But I don't quite know what I should write.

784
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,910
I've been having the same dream, over and over.

785
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:21,830
A dream where I'm all alone in an empty universe.

786
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:30,080
I'm so alone that my fingers, cheeks, fingernails, heels and even the ends of my hair,

787
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,070
everything aches from the loneliness.

788
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,760
The times we spent together

789
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,030
in a world filled with warmth

790
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,040
seem more like a dream to\N me now than my dream.

791
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,230
But so long as I don't lose\N the memories of those days,

792
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:56,020
I think that, even if just a little,\N I can stay connected to reality.

793
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,200
She was transferred?

794
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,670
Yes, about a week ago.

795
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:05,170
The hospital she was transferred to would be able\Nto tell you more, if you'd care to ask them.

796
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,620
Okay...

797
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,800
Oh, which room was she in?

798
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,680
Hiroki-kun... Takuya-kun...

799
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,000
Did that beautiful white airplane of yours

800
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,820
make it to the Tower beyond the sea?

801
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,960
What is this?

802
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,360
It feels like my dream...

803
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,210
Sawatari...

804
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,440
Are you there?

805
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,560
I've been looking for you...

806
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,480
...looking for you...

807
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,060
...for a long time.

808
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,120
Sawatari...

809
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,890
I really want to keep my promise this time.

810
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,700
I'm going to fly you

811
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,620
to the Tower in the Bella Ciela.

812
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,660
I feel if I do that, we'll meet again.

813
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,060
I won't leave you alone.

814
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,230
And I won't give up anymore on anything.

815
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,290
I'll protect you forever. I promise.

816
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,600
Yes, it's a promise.

817
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,170
Let's fly to the Tower... together.

818
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,990
Professor! Please come over here!

819
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,970
Operational levels at the Tower\Nhave suddenly increased!

820
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,170
The range of the disparate matter\Nconversion is also expanding rapidly!

821
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:22,440
Conscious activity in the subject\Nis increasing at the same rate!

822
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,910
This could be an indicator\N that she's waking up.

823
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,140
Does this mean...

824
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,690
Disparate matter conversion is \Nnow in excess of a 20km radius.

825
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,140
Do they...

826
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:35,200
Do they plan on overwriting the entire world?

827
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,700
Conscious activity in the\N subject is decreasing!

828
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,960
Disparate matter conversion\N is also slowing down...

829
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,890
It's going to stop.

830
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,240
An area of approximately a 26km radius \Nhas been overwritten with a parallel world.

831
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,470
Conscious activity in the subject\Nhas returned to normal.

832
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:58,240
The subject's sleep\N is stabilizing again.

833
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,250
Professor Tomizawa...

834
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,110
Yeah.

835
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:06,150
As we thought, it's the subject's sleep that has\Nbeen keeping the Tower's activity in check.

836
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,420
For now, information that the Tower\Nacquires from the parallel worlds

837
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,690
is being discharged into the subject's dreams\Nrather than eroding the surrounding space.

838
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,590
We have no choice but to ensure that\NSayuri Sawatari keeps dreaming.

839
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,160
It might have just been a dream...

840
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,220
But even so, the places where Sayuri

841
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,800
brushed my skin remained warm.

842
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,310
On that distant day,

843
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,840
we made a promise that we couldn't keep.

844
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,940
Hey, Takuya-kun...

845
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,950
This may sound strange, but\N promise that you won't laugh?

846
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,340
What is it?

847
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,680
I won't laugh.

848
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,920
Okay, I'll tell you.

849
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,420
Listen...

850
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,630
It's about a dream

851
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:58,890
I've been having a lot lately.

852
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,570
A tall tower?

853
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,630
You mean, like the Union Tower?

854
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,880
No. It's more... crooked.

855
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,700
It's a really strange shape.

856
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,430
I'm inside it,

857
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,100
but there's a bunch of others just like it all around.

858
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,420
For some reason, I know that

859
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,940
each one is a different world...

860
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,470
A dream that this universe is having.

861
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,650
I haven't been able to leave

862
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,310
that place for a long time.

863
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,850
I've been all by myself and very, very lonely.

864
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,190
And then...

865
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:34,790
just when I feel like I'm going to lose myself...

866
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,280
I see a white airplane in the sky.

867
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,300
A white airplane?

868
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,730
Yeah...

869
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,600
And then?

870
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,060
That's the end of the dream.

871
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,840
Thank goodness!

872
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,620
Shirakawa-kun, you're awake.

873
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,660
Maki-san...

874
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,720
I was really worried.

875
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,260
Um... why?

876
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,990
Does your shoulder still hurt?

877
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:13,860
No.

878
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,530
Pardon me.

879
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,100
It looks like your fever's come down too.

880
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,560
Say, are you hungry?

881
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,070
Do you want something to eat?

882
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,420
I've got apples and bananas.

883
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,240
I even went and bought some cakes.

884
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,870
What would you like?

885
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,840
You can't get in there with that ID card, Shirakawa-kun.

886
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,030
How's that shoulder? Better?

887
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,870
Yes. Sorry for making you worry.

888
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,830
Um...

889
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,350
So Maki-chan told you, eh?

890
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,810
You want to see her?

891
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,330
They say she stays asleep because\N the Tower is feeding her information

892
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,880
from the parallel worlds \Nand her mind can't cope.

893
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,820
Personally, I think if her sleep is broken,

894
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:16,760
the parallel worlds will swallow up this one in the blink of an eye... starting with that Tower.

895
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,360
Still,

896
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:24,300
we don't even know how we could wake her up.

897
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,300
With the war about to begin, they've decided to transfer her

898
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,040
to NSA headquarters in a couple of days.

899
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,480
The Alliance has really fallen behind in this field,

900
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,870
so this girl's a valuable sample.

901
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,380
Why did it have to be Sawatari?

902
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,450
There's a lot more we don't know that they do,

903
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:49,190
but it's probably no coincidence.

904
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,740
Ekusun Tsukinoe, the designer of the Tower,

905
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,450
is her grandfather.

906
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,250
As you've heard, it's clear now\Nthat the Tower is a weapon.

907
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:07,010
Over the past twenty-five years, the Tower has become a part of the everyday scenery and it symbolizes many things.

908
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:08,220
{\fad(300,300)}Another tribute from the director to Kenji Miyazawa. \N Iwanami Shoten is a famous Japanese publisher (est. 1914). \N Iwanami Bunko is a series of West and East classics published in 1927.

909
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,880
Nation. War. Race. Despair. Even admiration.

910
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,694
How it's interpreted differs

911
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:15,250
Nbetween generations...

912
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:20,180
But the one constant is that everyone sees it \Nas a symbol of something beyond their reach.

913
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,990
Something that can't be changed.

914
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,650
And as long as they do,

915
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,760
this world probably won't change, either.

916
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,650
Three days from now, early in the morning,

917
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,840
the American government will\Ndeclare war on the Union.

918
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,790
We're going to take advantage of the confusion

919
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,070
and blow up the Tower.

920
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,870
We'll enter Ezo airspace with an unmanned Predator,

921
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:45,200
and hit the Tower with a Seeker missile fitted with a PL outer-shell warhead.

922
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,800
The Uilta Liberation Front will\N be disbanded on the same day.

923
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,710
As of now, this factory is shut down.

924
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,020
Okay.

925
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,470
Okay, got it.

926
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,050
See you tomorrow.

927
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,740
Hey.

928
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,340
It's been three years, hasn't it, Takuya?

929
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,150
When did you get here?

930
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,230
The day before yesterday.

931
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:26,890
I've been sleeping in the abandoned station.

932
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,190
In the station?

933
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,190
Yeah.

934
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,390
What happened to your arm, Takuya?

935
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,060
Oh. Just a little accident.

936
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,030
What do you mean, an "accident"?

937
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,330
I'll tell you later.

938
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,240
I guess it's closed again today.

939
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:43,910
Hey...

940
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,510
Chobi! How are you?

941
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,070
It's been a while, huh?

942
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,330
You want to fly the Bella Ciela?

943
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,710
With Sawatari on board?

944
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,930
Yeah.

945
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:22,180
Another day or so and I'll \Nbe done putting it together.

946
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,710
All that's left will be the bug in\N the control software to deal with.

947
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:25,470
Wait a minute.

948
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,380
Did you even hear what I said?

949
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,720
Sawatari just stays asleep and the Tower is...

950
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,590
The Tower is going to be

951
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,960
the target of the terrorist attack, right?

952
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,220
That's why I need your help!

953
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,390
I told you already...

954
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,750
If I fly her to the Tower,

955
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,690
I think she'll wake up.

956
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,840
You...

957
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,900
You came back here for something like that?

958
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,470
"Something like that"?!

959
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:55,930
We made a promise!

960
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,970
I have a dream about Sawatari...

961
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,920
It repeats, over and over.

962
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,770
She's by herself,

963
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,190
in a place that's completely deserted.

964
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,020
She says she can't remember anything.

965
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,650
But she remembers the promise.

966
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,800
I promised her again in the dream,

967
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,130
that I'd really take her to the Tower this time.

968
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,970
I can't believe it's just a dream.

969
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,510
You come waltzing back into town...

970
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,050
Here I was wondering what it was about, \Nand you tell me it's about some dream?

971
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,810
You tick me off just looking at you.

972
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,420
I don't have time for these games.

973
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,350
The problem is you've been obsessed\N with something like this.

974
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,690
I'm gonna help you forget.

975
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,570
Don't!

976
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,150
Takuya!

977
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,890
It's either save Sayuri

978
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,860
or save the world.

979
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,570
Oh. I, uh, forgot something.

980
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:12,740
You did?

981
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,920
Aren't you gonna go home, Sawatari?

982
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,220
Yeah. I will.

983
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,290
Hiroki-kun...

984
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,210
What happened to your cheek?

985
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,930
I kind of had a fight with Takuya.

986
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,140
Is everything okay?

987
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,570
Yeah, it's fine.

988
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,480
We'll make up soon.

989
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,570
Probably.

990
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,280
Okay. Good night.

991
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,460
Hiroki-kun!

992
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,480
Are you going to the station?

993
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,450
I always have the feeling...

994
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,430
that I'm going to lose something.

995
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,490
The world is really beautiful...

996
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,990
...but it's like I'm so far away from it...

997
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,930
...all alone

998
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,000
But to me,

999
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:21,870
Sayuri looked like she was at\Nthe center of the brilliant world.

1000
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,510
Ah, I see.

1001
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:29,430
I just felt like I sort of understood...

1002
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:33,290
...something very important, but it's gone...

1003
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,900
Hello!

1004
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,210
Is anyone home?

1005
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,320
Okabe-san!

1006
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,560
It's me, Hiroki.

1007
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,970
Okabe-san!

1008
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,970
I can at least find out how to get hold of him.

1009
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,250
Hiroki... I thought it was you.

1010
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,450
You've grown.

1011
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,250
Okabe-san?

1012
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,250
Hey, what's this?

1013
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,720
Takuya told me everything.

1014
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,750
Show me just how determined you are.

1015
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,390
You guys destroy the Tower.

1016
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,880
I wonder if the rumor

1017
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,000
about the terrorist bombing is true?

1018
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,060
Who knows.

1019
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,340
But the war is probably right \Nabout to begin and when it does,

1020
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:49,170
researching the Tower could be\N the very last thing on our minds.

1021
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:54,040
In terms of protesting the Separation, I get the feeling that what Tsukinoe's doing

1022
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,880
is no different from terrorist organizations like Uilta.

1023
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,530
You're a little mysterious, aren't you, Shirakawa-kun?

1024
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,030
I bet you have a lot of secrets.

1025
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:08,860
No, not at all...

1026
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,830
Sorry. I'll make some tea.

1027
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:14,320
And let me take a look at that cheek, okay?

1028
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,040
Shirakawa-kun...

1029
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,550
You get hurt a lot these days.

1030
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,700
Sorry...

1031
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,910
Are you in trouble or something?

1032
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:27,980
No.

1033
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,550
I'm fine.

1034
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:30,940
Sorry...

1035
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,390
He was my best friend.

1036
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:40,150
What?

1037
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,020
The one I had a fight with.

1038
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,810
We both longed for the same thing...

1039
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,750
We had the same goal...

1040
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:51,770
But we went in different directions and...

1041
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,100
How can I put this?

1042
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,100
I was filled with an energy, a drive I didn't understand...

1043
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,440
but I ended up not knowing which way I should go.

1044
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,640
That's why I was so relieved

1045
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,970
that I could join this research lab,

1046
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:11,020
because I felt like I had found something I should be doing

1047
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,300
and...

1048
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,310
I was also happy that I met you, Maki-san.

1049
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,030
That's why...

1050
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,790
I don't want to involve you in this.

1051
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,880
There's something that I absolutely have to do.

1052
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,830
When it's all over,

1053
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,750
I'd like to see you again.

1054
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,450
Shirakawa-kun!

1055
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,550
Sawatari...

1056
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,190
This time, for sure...

1057
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,180
Let's go to the place we promised.

1058
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,770
What's the big idea, Oka-chan?

1059
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,870
You're going to use kids for something like that?

1060
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,900
They're the ones who wanted to do it.

1061
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,470
Besides, the area surrounding the Tower

1062
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,980
has been swallowed up by those parallel world things, right?

1063
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,980
Not like anyone's gonna die there.

1064
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,380
That's still no reason for...

1065
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,580
Calm down, Tomizawa.

1066
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,910
And anyway, by the time they get back,

1067
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,920
they won't be kids anymore.

1068
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,460
You want me to guess what's going

1069
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,310
through your mind right now?

1070
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,650
Oh, jeez...

1071
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,820
Talk to you later.

1072
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,340
Looks like the final curtain's about to drop.

1073
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,310
Is this really going to wake Sayuri-chan up?

1074
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:17,850
For some reason, I'm now convinced that it will.

1075
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:19,420
The promise from that day is

1076
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,350
probably her link to reality.

1077
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,550
Even now, in her dream,

1078
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,650
she's waiting for the Bella Ciela.

1079
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,750
I think both Hiroki and I sensed that somehow.

1080
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,900
The Bella Ciela is just a two-seater,

1081
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,000
and I can't pilot with this arm,

1082
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,550
so I'll stay behind and watch

1083
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,090
what happens to the Tower.

1084
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:46,340
I thought it was cold. Now it started snowing again.

1085
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,980
Well, I'm leaving now.

1086
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,380
Yeah. Hey, it's been a long time since you and Hiroki have worked together.

1087
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,010
Be sure to get along now!

1088
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,460
Which one is it...

1089
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,020
This one?

1090
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,530
You heard from Okabe-san?

1091
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,090
Yeah.

1092
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,210
Takuya!

1093
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,970
Which version of the BIOS should I use?

1094
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,620
You changed the rudder location, didn't you?

1095
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,000
I still don't have the right one.

1096
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:03,780
It's on this.

1097
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,890
It also has one for the Seeker missile.

1098
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:09,020
What's left?

1099
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,970
I still have a little wiring of\N the superconducting motor.

1100
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:13,320
Other than that,  just some\N fine-tuning of the software.

1101
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,760
They're scheduled to officially\Ndeclare war in five hours.

1102
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,070
There's no other way but to fly\N right into the middle of the war.

1103
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,350
I'll take care of the software.

1104
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,040
You finish up the wiring.

1105
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,370
Okay.

1106
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,520
Hey, Takuya,

1107
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,240
what the heck is with that error message?!

1108
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,310
Huh?

1109
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,940
The one on version check.

1110
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,950
Version check?

1111
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,950
Didn't you write that thing?

1112
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,050
Three years ago?

1113
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,290
Huh? I did?

1114
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,120
You haven't changed... Idiot.

1115
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,640
Hiroki, take a look at this.

1116
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:07,920
What is it?

1117
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,950
The forecast of the battle conditions off the coast of Tsugaru.

1118
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,090
It's pretty much what we expected.

1119
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,300
So, the frontline will be up to about the 42nd latitude.

1120
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,070
The inland area is virtually empty, especially around the Tower.

1121
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:28,340
Well, the erosion has gotten pretty advanced on land.

1122
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,570
How do you want to go in?

1123
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,250
Slip through flying low on the jet engine

1124
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,610
until we're clear of the strait.

1125
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,150
We'll pass the 42nd latitude

1126
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:36,040
and right around here, when we reach the mountains,

1127
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,050
I'll take her up to cruising altitude.

1128
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,850
How's that?

1129
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,580
Yeah...

1130
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,410
I don't think there's any other way you could do it.

1131
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,820
When you get to the Tower and Sawatari wakes up,

1132
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,850
the disparate matter conversion\Non the ground should start again.

1133
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:52,560
When that happens, get out of there fast.

1134
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,900
Once you're about 10km away from \Nthe Tower, shoot the Seeker missile.

1135
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,120
I programmed it so that

1136
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,000
it will fly straight to the Tower.

1137
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,170
So that's all you have to do. It'll be over.

1138
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,320
Ok.

1139
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,870
Everything will work out, right?

1140
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:04,660
Yeah.

1141
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,840
There's still nearly two hours before the war starts.

1142
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,940
We finished it earlier than we thought, huh?

1143
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,670
Yup.

1144
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:14,050
Hiroki...

1145
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,250
Yeah?

1146
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:18,510
By any chance... can you play the violin?

1147
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,890
You're still a single-minded idiot, though.

1148
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,580
Who asked you?!

1149
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,760
Besides, you're the one who asked me to play!

1150
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,000
Look over here and start playing!

1151
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,390
Shut up!

1152
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,000
Just shut your mouth and listen!

1153
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,060
I can tell my body's trembling:

1154
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,550
it knows that I'm going to wake up.

1155
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:29,450
I feel more afraid than anxious...

1156
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,880
Why is that?

1157
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:36,350
Sayuri said,

1158
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,270
"I always have the feeling\Nthat I'm going to lose something."

1159
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:42,050
I have a vague sense of

1160
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,030
that same feeling now.

1161
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,970
But...

1162
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,710
Just like I promised on that day after school...

1163
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:52,980
I will go to that Tower.

1164
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,020
The Tower's operational levels are rising again!

1165
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,350
The branch universes' erosion area is expanding!

1166
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:05,530
Current radius is 36km and gradually\Nexpanding at a rate of 0.4km/hour.

1167
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,450
Is this a reaction to the signs of her awakening?

1168
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,090
Everything will be okay...

1169
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,860
Right, Oka-chan?

1170
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,530
Professor!

1171
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,990
War has just been declared!

1172
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,470
The first conflict will soon take \Nplace off the coast of Tsugaru.

1173
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,170
The land!

1174
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,560
Sayuri, look.

1175
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,360
It's the place of our promise.

1176
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,560
Those wings...

1177
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,840
It's the Bella Ciela.

1178
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,980
The dreams... they're disappearing.

1179
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,150
I get it now.

1180
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,090
I know now what I'm going to lose.

1181
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,600
Oh, God...

1182
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,600
Please, God...

1183
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,930
Please wake Sayuri from her sleep.

1184
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,060
Please...

1185
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,140
Please...

1186
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,570
even if it's just for a moment that I wake up,

1187
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:49,040
please don't let this feeling disappear.

1188
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:52,170
I have to tell Hiroki-kun...

1189
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:56,130
how special the connection

1190
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:58,680
we shared in our dreams was.

1191
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,080
How in a world with no one in it...

1192
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,590
just how much I longed for him...

1193
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:07,810
...and he longed for me.

1194
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,900
Sayuri...

1195
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,120
Please!

1196
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,300
I have to tell him

1197
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,620
how much I've loved him all this time.

1198
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,180
If I can just tell him that much

1199
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:24,580
then I don't need anything else.

1200
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,810
Please, even just for a moment...

1201
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,770
Don't let this feeling disappear!

1202
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,570
Sayuri...

1203
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,880
Fujisawa-kun...

1204
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,850
Disparate matter conversion\N is rapidly expanding!

1205
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,810
Ezo's being swallowed!

1206
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:30,900
Sayuri...

1207
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,340
I...

1208
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,590
I have to tell you something...

1209
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:45,520
Something very important...

1210
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,630
But now it's gone!

1211
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,400
It's all right.

1212
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,900
You're awake now.

1213
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,730
You can get it all back again,

1214
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:07,850
starting now.

1215
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,750
Welcome back.

1216
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,110
Sayuri

1217
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,970
We've lost the place of our promise in this world,

1218
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,920
but even so,

1219
01:26:45 --> 01:26:49
our lives begin now.

1220
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1221
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1222
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1223
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1224
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1225
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1226
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1227
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1228
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1229
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1230
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1231
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1232
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1233
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1234
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1235
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1236
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1237
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1238
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1239
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1240
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1241
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1242
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1243
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1244
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1245
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1246
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1247
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1248
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1249
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1250
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1251
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999


1252
11:11:11,111 --> 23:59:59,999
