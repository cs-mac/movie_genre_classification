1
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,360
It was in a country far away.
I don't know which one.

2
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,390
But it was a distant land.

3
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
A prince lost his mind
and imagined himself...

4
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,600
- ... to be a rooster.
- A rooster? Like this one?

5
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,760
Yes. He took refuge
under the dining-room table...

6
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,600
...striped naked, and refused
to eat anything but grain.

7
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
- And then?
- The King called in magicians and doctors...

8
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,400
...to cure his son,
but to no avail.

9
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,160
One day, an unknown sage
arrived, took off his clothes...

10
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,280
...and joined the prince under the table,
saying he too was a rooster.

11
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,440
Eventually, the sage convinced
the prince to get dressed.

12
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,440
And finally to sit down and eat
with the others. "Don't ever think"...

13
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,520
...said the sage, "... that by
eating like...

14
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,440
...a man, with other
men at the table...

15
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,440
...a rooster ceases to
be what he is. "

16
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
"You can do anything with...

17
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
...men in their world.
Or even for them. "

18
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
"And yet remain the
rooster that your are. "

19
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm so proud of you, Benjamin.

20
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,360
Such young little fellow, and
brighter than all the adults.

21
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,360
Guess what?
I have some money.

22
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
How would you like to
eat in a restaurant?

23
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,800
A restaurant?
Really?

24
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
What do you think
about her and me, huh?

25
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,520
- You'd be fine.
- Yeah, it's true!

26
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,990
Miss? Miss!

27
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,240
She has nice tits,
and a fine ass.

28
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,800
- I wouldn't say no to sleeping with her.
- Miss!

29
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
Miss, miss!

30
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,800
Hey, miss! Where the hell are
the...

31
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,440
...girls in this stinking
place, huh?

32
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,990
Could I have another one, please?

33
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,400
Hey, fatty!
You should watch your weight.

34
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,360
Or soon you'll be wider than
you're tall. Like a potato.

35
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,360
Like a stuffed pig!

36
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Hey, fatty!
What's your name?

37
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,360
He's not fat!
He's my brother and he's strong.

38
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm a blacksmith. My name
is Zishe. Zishe Breitbart.

39
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,840
Hey, fatty!
I'm talking to you.

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Our fatty is a jew.

41
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
A big fat jew.

42
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
A fat one, and a thin one.

43
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,600
The fat jew eats too much,
and the thin jew not enough.

44
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,470
Hey, fatty! Why doesn't...

45
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,320
...the little one
eat anything, huh?

46
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,360
You should eat more,
like your fat brother.

47
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,360
Good idea.

48
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
You're too thin.

49
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,080
- The thick and the thin...
- ... together through thick and thin.

50
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
- Open your mouth!
- And eat!

51
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,080
Hey!

52
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,440
Hey!

53
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,220
You will pay me for this!
Have you an idea...

54
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,480
...how much beer that was?
One hectolitre.

55
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,680
And do you know how much a barrel costs?
And how much that table costs?

56
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
It wasn't his fault,
the others started it!

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,160
As for the money,
I'd like to pay.

58
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,160
Yes, we'd really like to pay for
this, but we don't have any money.

59
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,470
What I should do
is call the police.

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,800
But I think there's a way
for you to pay for the damage.

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,760
The circus is in town.
Outside, by the gate.

62
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,760
There's a famous "strongman".
And there's prize money to be won...

63
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,920
...for the man who can beat him!

64
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,560
Ladies and Gentlemen,
dear children!

65
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,560
I would like to announce that our
Hercules has a challenger!

66
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
A strong young man, without doubt.

67
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,800
But in more than 20 years...

68
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,400
...our Hercules,
our Colossus of Rhodes...

69
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,400
...has never been defeated.

70
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,360
For years we have been
raising the prize...

71
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,880
...to the amount of 5.000 Zloty
for any man...

72
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,600
...who proves himself stronger.
Not without reason...

73
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,160
...the ancients have proclaimed
the Colossus of Rhodes...

74
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,640
...one of the 7
Wonders of the World!

75
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,160
And now, highly esteemed audience...

76
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,040
...his challenger this evening:

77
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
Zishe Breitbart!
Blacksmith from this town.

78
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,320
I can do more!
I can do more!

79
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,760
Yitzak, come! There's a visitor.
A real gentleman.

80
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,840
- What does he want?
- I don't know. He arrived in a motorcar.

81
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,680
And, oh my God, I have
nothing to offer him.

82
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,160
Landwehr. Alfred Landwehr.

83
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,160
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Breitbart.

84
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,040
And this is your strong son.

85
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,000
- Please! Sit down!
- Thank you.

86
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm an agent for variety artists.

87
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Dancers, chucklers, magicians.

88
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,960
Everything that is in demand.
And the demand in Berlin is enormous.

89
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,000
I possess an instinct for
great talents.

90
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,960
For people who will go
straight to the top.

91
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,960
I was at the circus yesterday to
see the local strongman, when your son-

92
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,040
You need not go on.
We are respectable people.

93
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,960
For a jew this is not
the right thing.

94
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,840
But the most gifted people
in cinema, in theatre and art are.

95
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,400
I never even thought about leaving.
I belong in this smithy...

96
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,000
- ... in our little Shtetl.
- You see, our jewish Shtetls...

97
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,070
...are like holy
books, open...

98
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,200
...to the eyes of God. And the
Day of the Torment...

99
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,240
...even the fish tremble
in the brook.

100
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,160
In spring, during Passover,
the trees rejoice.

101
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,360
Sir... you're like a shopkeeper,
with empty shelves.

102
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,680
With nothing to sell.

103
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,320
Son... you'll have
to attend university!

104
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,680
You've said that beautifully...

105
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,240
...really.

106
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Do you know how old the
boy is? 9!

107
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,790
This little fellow
is just 9 years old.

108
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,720
And to think that this
is my brother, Benjamin.

109
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,520
Look at what an incredible
boy my brother is.

110
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,840
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Are you all right?

111
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,920
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine! Me too.

112
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Good morning, Mr. Landwehr!
We've just been talking about you.

113
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,390
Did you sleep in the motorcar?

114
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,000
There isn't even a hotel
around here to spend the night.

115
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,880
- Good morning. Mornin'. Mornin'.
- You are an exceptional man.

116
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
I am, when i'm after
an exceptional talent.

117
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,720
Zishe, listen!

118
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,520
I want you to come with
me just for the day!

119
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,560
I have something to show you.

120
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,480
- But i can't leave. I must work.
- Your father...

121
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,500
...would excuse you
for an afternoon, huh?

122
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,440
My son is able to make up his
own mind...

123
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,990
...about such things.

124
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,520
You'll be most interested to see
what i'm going to show you.

125
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,110
Look Zishe, look
at all the motorcars!

126
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
There must be every motorcar
in the whole world...

127
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,270
...right in Berlin!

128
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,160
More than motorcars, young man.
Watch what's coming.

129
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,000
That's a flying machine!
I've read about it.

130
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,840
Look at how many
people it can carry.

131
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,680
Aeroplanes will never compete
against that.

132
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,520
Benjamin!

133
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,920
- Benjamin, wake up!
- I am awake!

134
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,520
- I've been thinking.
- So have I.

135
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,520
Do you believe God gives to
each of us a gift?

136
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,360
Of course.

137
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,400
God made me strong,
Benjamin. Don't you think...

138
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,120
...that he made me strong
for a reason?

139
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,000
A blacksmith needs to be strong.

140
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,880
But I am stronger than a
blacksmith needs to be.

141
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,040
Sometimes we don't understand
why God does what He does.

142
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,920
This is what I must find out.

143
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,320
- Zishe?
- What? Tell me.

144
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,160
The Book of Prophets says:
"Spare me...

145
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,160
...that i may recover strength,
before i go hence...

146
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,320
...and be no more.
And be no more. "

147
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,920
- And?
- And, what?

148
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
- What do you think about it?
- About what?

149
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,350
Berlin.

150
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,360
Let me talk to the
Rabbi first.

151
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,760
But before anything, we have to
celebrate Passover.

152
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,240
But...

153
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Children, when we fled Egypt,
we didn't...

154
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,840
...have time for the
bread to rise.

155
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,840
Hannah? What happened
when we came to the sea?

156
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,320
- Hashem opened the seas.
- Yes, he did!

157
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,240
And, Raffael? How many
years did we stay in the desert?

158
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,720
Forty.

159
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,760
Yes. All right.

160
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,240
- Search for it!
- Yes!

161
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,080
Where is it?

162
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,360
It must be somewhere.

163
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,600
Maybe under the pillow.
Hannele found it!

164
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
- Wonderful!
- Hannele found it!

165
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,160
- She has found it.
- Very well!

166
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,240
Wonderful!

167
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
- How much do you want for it?
- 6 Zloty.

168
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,000
No, that's too much!

169
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,790
Yes...

170
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
- 6!
- Yes.

171
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,400
I want to thank the Allmighty
for my good wife, and my children.

172
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,080
You are the salt of earth.
And you fill my heart with joy.

173
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,360
Today, I want to thank
God in particular...

174
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,440
...for my strong firstborn.

175
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Zishe, my son! You will
go out into the World...

176
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,360
...but don't ever forget
who you are!

177
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,920
Hold on! Hold on!

178
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,200
I've travelled very far. I've been as
far as Vilna. But a thing like this...

179
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,240
...a thing like this i've
never seen before.

180
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,160
Can you give me a ride?

181
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,000
- Where can we take you?
- You're not going to Berlin, by any chance?

182
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,360
- Are you hungry?
- All the time.

183
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
My mother has never been
able to feed me enough.

184
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,680
And you want to walk
all the way to Berlin?

185
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes. I have a ticket for
the train, first class.

186
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,080
But i'm going to return the ticket, and
my mother will get a new dress instead.

187
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,160
I've heard there are
many pretty girls in Berlin.

188
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,640
Girls like you won't find in
the country. Maybe you'll meet one.

189
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
I have already, sort of.
In a dream.

190
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,520
But I couldn't see her face, because...
I know it sounds strange...

191
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,560
...but there was so much light.
I think she was a princess.

192
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,440
You didn't come specially for me?
How did you know?

193
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,120
Your reputation is
faster than your feet.

194
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,680
My name is Delilah.

195
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
Better take care, Samson!

196
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,680
Berlin, May 1932

197
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,400
It's me, Zishe!
Zishe Breitbart!

198
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,480
You want to talk to Mr. Landwehr?

199
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,160
Are you still there?
Hello? Hello?

200
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
- Speak please.
- What?

201
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,360
- Please speak.
- Yes!

202
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,360
- Where are you?
- In Berlin.

203
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,430
Come and see us at once.
Mr. Landwehr...

204
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,480
...is expecting you. We
thought you were lost.

205
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,280
A girl you say.

206
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,440
And she wanted to marry
you at once?

207
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,360
Well, actually no.

208
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,550
She just wanted to keep me.

209
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,760
Don't just stand there,
have a seat.

210
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,800
Thank you.

211
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,200
You realize, that the possibilities
to employ you are...

212
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,880
- ... somewhat limited.
- Yes? What do you mean by that?

213
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,240
No, no, don't be afraid!

214
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,240
I'm good at the work i do.
The best, if i may say so.

215
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm going to employ you in an
establishment called...

216
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,240
..."Hanussen's Palace
of the Occult".

217
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,360
I don't quite understand.
What am i supposed to do there?

218
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,760
I've talked to Hanussen, and he
was immediately pleased with my idea.

219
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,760
Hanussen has understood something
about the insecurity of our times.

220
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,120
Inflation, unemployment,
mass strikes...

221
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,400
...attempted coups, bank rushes.

222
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,360
People long for a
strong man, a leader.

223
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,360
And Hanussen is the clairvoyant,
the prophet of this longing.

224
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
And what does that have
to do with me?

225
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,120
I can tell you! You will be
a kind of contrasting program:

226
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,440
The strenght of the body,
against the...

227
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,080
...dark powers of the
spirit of the occult.

228
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,280
And i have to point out to you
right now that you...

229
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,720
...must play a certain game.

230
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,120
I can't do that.
I'm strong, that's all.

231
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,160
I don't demand anything else from you.
And furthermore, you'll keep your mouth shut!

232
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll meet with tomorrow
at Hanussen's.

233
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,000
Dismissed!

234
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,320
PALACE OF THE OCCULT

235
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,320
No, impossible!

236
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,920
What if he carries a weapon,
pearhaps a spear?

237
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,920
No, he shouldn't look like
some primitive man.

238
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,960
Someone from primordial times.

239
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,880
That's my demand.
Take it off!

240
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,920
Take it off! I hope you're all
in for the dark instincts.

241
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,760
How about a Greek or a Roman?
You know, a gladiator?

242
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,080
Turn! Turn around!

243
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,240
Pearhaps for the first act.

244
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,720
After the break
he can be dressed as...

245
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,560
...some kind of
heroic figure.

246
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,440
How's "Zishe, The Strong"?

247
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,240
By no means! The jewish name
must go at once!

248
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,840
You see, my boy... my public
consists of film stars.

249
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,160
Above all, followers
of the National Socialists.

250
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Big shots of the party.

251
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,440
We will aryanize you.

252
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,360
A jew should never
be as strong as you.

253
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,360
The new act!

254
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,760
- Yes, i'm the strong man.
- I'm the magician here.

255
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,820
You don't look like a magician.

256
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh, indeed?
Well, then watch!

257
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,760
Don't be deceived.
The ace may seem like the ace.

258
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,760
And the queen may seem like the queen.
But the truth here is always...

259
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,840
...what one does not see.

260
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
If you want to see the place,
i can show you around.

261
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,480
Follow me, but quiet.

262
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
This is Hanussen's
"Circle of the Occult".

263
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,680
No, performers really
shouldn't be here.

264
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,600
Hanussen doesn't like it.

265
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,320
Place your hands in the light.

266
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,320
Make contact with one another.

267
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,000
Feel the energy surge
through you.

268
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,920
I am... your clairvoyant.

269
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,920
I see your future.

270
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Excuse me!

271
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,200
My name is...

272
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,320
Actually, I wanted to tell you...

273
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,200
...you are the most...

274
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,040
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I'd like to welcome you...

275
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,000
...with all my heart to a new
spring and summer...

276
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,000
...program at Hanussen's...

277
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,920
...Palace of the Occult.

278
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Now we shall begin with someone
all of you are certainly familiar with.

279
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Herr Rothschild, the banker!

280
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Trying to run off with
the profits of the Great War.

281
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,710
The laughter backstage
is not permitted! If...

282
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,000
...anyone laughs, it'd better be
the audience, do you understand me?

283
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Yes. I understand.

284
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Wig!
Put your wig on!

285
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,720
- Put it on! Quickly!
- And now, Ladies and Gentlemen!

286
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,790
Helmet!

287
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,000
A novelty in our program. A man
of monstrous physical strenght.

288
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,480
The victor of all
roman gladiators.

289
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,000
I give you: Siegfried!

290
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Out!

291
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,710
After the great battle against...

292
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,720
...the Cimbers and
Teutons, Siegfried...

293
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,400
...was taken to the
roman arena as a prisoner.

294
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,400
They put him in chains.

295
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,920
But chains could not hold him.

296
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,720
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Siegfried, the Aryan King!

297
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,500
Siegfried won every fight.
He took the cuirass...

298
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,600
...from the strongest
of all defeated gladiators.

299
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,400
And from Varus, he took
not only his...

300
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,400
...head, but his heirlooms.

301
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
And now Ladies and Gentlemen,
the man who...

302
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,600
...is in league with
the powers of the occult.

303
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,720
The Master of the abysses of
the soul, whose power over the...

304
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,200
...soul itself is able to
achieve unbelievable things.

305
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,320
The man who is endowed
with more power..

306
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,400
...than the strongest body could
ever possess: Erik Jan Hanussen!

307
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,200
Venerable audience:

308
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,560
You are familiar with the
phenomenon which i myself...

309
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,670
...cannot fully explain.

310
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,400
I have been endowed with
a misterious gift.

311
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,080
Retracting the aura
of the cosmos...

312
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,080
...and transmitting its rays back to
people who are gifted... mediums.

313
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,600
And, are we not all in reality
endowed with a medial gift?

314
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,080
These rays of cosmic energy
are known as "Hypnosis".

315
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,720
And they manifest all
the power of the occult.

316
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
The unknown side of
the human psyche.

317
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,600
And it will prove to you that
all our german people...

318
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,080
...are full of unknown power.
A die will be cast.

319
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,320
- Four!
- Four. Table four. Is there?

320
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Count Helldorf!
Good evening, Sir.

321
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,670
Good evening.

322
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,200
The Police Chief of Berlin!

323
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,440
May i ask your
enchanting companion...

324
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,200
...to come up on stage,
please?

325
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Please.

326
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
- What is your name?
- Hedda Christianson.

327
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,920
- And i think i've seen you on the screen.
- Yes, I've done two talkies.

328
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,390
But I'm still a beginner.

329
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
The beginning of a
great carrier, no doubt!

330
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,480
Don't worry.
Just relax.

331
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,320
I'm now going to send
you into trance.

332
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,350
Count Helldorf, the most
charming of all...

333
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,800
...police chiefs, will be there
to keep an eye on you.

334
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,320
And some of our sturdiest
Stormtroopers...

335
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,720
...in Berlin will be
there to support him.

336
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,480
- Certainly!
- Always ready! To victory!

337
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Focus on this object.
And listen to my voice.

338
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,080
Follow my voice.
My voice is leading you.

339
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,800
Keep your eyes fixed,
watch this object.

340
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,600
Focus your eyes.
The power of the whole people...

341
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,320
...will concentrate in you.

342
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,080
Your legs are getting heavy.
Very heavy.

343
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Your arms are getting heavy.

344
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Heavier and heavier...

345
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,000
Your eyelids are
getting heavy.

346
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Very heavy...
You feel sleepy.

347
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,480
You feel tired.
Very tired...

348
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,400
You want to sleep.
Your eyes are closing.

349
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,000
Your eyelids are becoming heavier.
And heavier.

350
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,720
Your eyes are closing.
And you feel sleepy.

351
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,600
Tired. Very tired.
You want to sleep.

352
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,320
Let yourself sink. You're sinking
deeper and deeper.

353
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,080
To the bottom of a
bottomless lake.

354
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,800
You are asleep.

355
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,320
I now place a coin
on the back of her hand.

356
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,720
I invoke all black powers
from the blackest abyss.

357
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,320
The coin on your hand
is growing hot.

358
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Very hot.

359
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,320
You feel your hand getting
hotter... and hotter.

360
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,200
Yet you feel no pain.
No pain.

361
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,600
The coin is burning now.

362
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,600
Your hand is being burned.
Yet you feel no pain.

363
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,320
No pain.
Listen to my voice.

364
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm now going to wake you up.
I will count to three.

365
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,400
When i count to three,
you will awake.

366
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,800
You will feel well, very well.
And you will awake.

367
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,720
One. You feel your body
becoming lighter. And lighter.

368
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,740
Two. Let your body
drift up slowly...

369
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,400
...towards the surface
of the lake.

370
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,800
Three! You break the
surface of the water.

371
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,400
You open your eyes,
and you're awake.

372
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,320
You're awake.
You're strong.

373
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,320
You are feeling strong,
and you are feeling good.

374
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,400
Are you awake now?
Are you awake?

375
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Yes.

376
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,480
- Where am I? What happened?
- Count Helldorf, Sir.

377
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
Can you please come up on stage
as a witness?

378
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,960
Will you please take
the coin from the back...

379
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,920
...of the hand of your
charming companion?

380
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,400
- What do you see now?
- Hedwig, my darling!

381
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,840
For God's Sake,
what has happened?

382
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,800
Please describe what you see.

383
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,320
A blister. A blister
from a burn.

384
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,320
- A big blister on her hand.
- Are you in pain?

385
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
No, not at all!

386
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,200
Come in.

387
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,800
Well?

388
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,320
Well, the cost-
The costume and all this.

389
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,920
What about it?

390
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Marta... my darling!

391
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,400
Have you met our new strong man?

392
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,720
His name is Zishe.

393
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Yes.

394
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,920
I have big plans for him.

395
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,920
- I've seen you before.
- Yes, backstage.

396
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,320
- No.
- Where then?

397
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
A dream.

398
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,800
- A dream?
- Yes, actually...

399
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,000
What i want to say is...

400
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,800
The costume... I don't feel
quite right as a Teuton.

401
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Champagne!

402
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Sit.

403
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,920
Sit!

404
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Take a sip.

405
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,000
No, thank you.

406
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,080
Now listen! My boy!

407
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,200
You don't seem to
be quite clear yet.

408
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,800
We are entertainers.

409
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,920
We work for a sole employer.
And that is the public.

410
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,800
We give them what they want.
We articulate their colective dreams.

411
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,480
Now: if you still don't understand this
at the end of intermission...

412
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,200
...pearhaps we should send you
back to your little Shtetl.

413
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,400
In Poland.

414
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,800
I'm homesick.
I miss my brothers and sisters.

415
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
And working with my father.

416
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,200
I work here for a clairvoyant.

417
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,200
His name is Hanussen.
And he is a mystery to me.

418
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,920
I have the power to radiate
energy onto you.

419
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,800
You feel pulled.
Something is drawing you.

420
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,320
You're sinking. Sinking.

421
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,320
Sinking...

422
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,720
What the power of the body can
achieve, Ladies and Gentlemen...

423
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,920
...the power of the spirit
can also achieve.

424
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,600
And more, much more.

425
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,750
The frail body of
our pianist is...

426
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,920
...able to perform far
greater things...

427
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,480
...Ladies and Gentlemen.
Just as our people...

428
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,600
...are capable of developing
unimaginable powers.

429
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,800
They merely need to be led.

430
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,400
And, like a cosmic event,
like a comet in the sky...

431
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,480
...a figure of light has
come among us.

432
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,000
And this force, which will
crush all foreign vermin...

433
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,320
...has a name: Adolf Hitler.

434
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
He will. I see it, i see it
clearly before my eyes.

435
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,720
One day he will lead
our thirsting people.

436
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,600
I am the seer.
I am the prophet of his coming.

437
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,600
To victory!

438
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,510
The flag up high...

439
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,320
...the troops tight together!

440
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,560
SA marches with firm...

441
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,720
...and calm steps!

442
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,920
To victory! To victory!

443
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,800
So lively, so early
in the morning?

444
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,080
I am, you see... possibly
in the wrong place.

445
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,240
Marta, leave us for a moment.

446
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,080
I'll call you when i need you.

447
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,800
- Something on your mind?
- You see, the audience...

448
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,080
I don't feel right
with the audience.

449
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,800
Pearhaps i'm just too jewish.

450
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,920
I understand you
better than you think.

451
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,600
Really?

452
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,320
We are alike, you and i.

453
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Yes.

454
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,480
We are showmen.
We provide the...

455
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,480
...bewildered a beacon of light.

456
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,080
The audience doesn't seem
very bewildered to me.

457
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,320
There are a lot of those
nazis out there...

458
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,600
...who seem to know exactly
where they are going.

459
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,600
And i am their prophet.

460
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,600
You know, my boy, what
my dream is?

461
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,200
Something... much
grander than this.

462
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,000
And i've already found it.

463
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,460
I want to be to the present
what the...

464
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,200
...Oracle of Delphi
was to antiquety.

465
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,480
High ranking party
members have..

466
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,600
...already intimated to me
that I will be the Minister...

467
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,000
...of the Occult in
Hitler's future cabinet.

468
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,720
I have just awakened the barbaric
prehistoric demons...

469
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
...to a new godless life.

470
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,640
Look, I am not particularly
religious...

471
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,000
...but in my family
there is God.

472
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,320
If there is such a
thing as God...

473
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,600
...then he dwells here.

474
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,080
And this God protects me.

475
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Gives me power.

476
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,800
Do you want to see what
real power is? Marta!

477
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Marta!

478
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Sing!
Sing!

479
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,320
- Which song?
- The one about chandelier.

480
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,800
"As long as my panties
are hanging...

481
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,800
...in the chandelier
come morning...

482
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,920
...you can be sure that
i still love you. "

483
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,080
Now the proof.

484
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,320
Turn around.

485
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,320
Look, my boy.

486
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,320
The roundest butt on
God's wide earth.

487
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,200
And it's mine.

488
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
All mine.

489
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
EXIT

490
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,080
I didn't want to disturb you.
I'm sorry.

491
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,320
You're not disturbing me at all.
Please, stay.

492
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,480
That was really won-
Wonderful.

493
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,800
Why don't you sit
down next to me?

494
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,320
I don't know anything about music.
Tell me, where did you learn all this?

495
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,000
I thought you were a princess when
I first heard you play. Tell me.

496
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,720
I studied at the Conservatory,
in Prague.

497
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,320
You see, i had high hopes then.

498
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,040
And i've never really
given them up.

499
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,720
And why are you here?

500
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,960
The reason is that
i'm a stateless person.

501
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,150
Do you know what that means?

502
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,080
As a child they kept pushing
me around between three countries.

503
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,720
I never knew my parents.
And when Hanussen was in Prague...

504
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,870
- ... he took me away with him.
- He was in Prague?

505
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,600
Yes, in Prague. And he gave me
work with his Palace Orchestra.

506
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,600
I'm sure you have noticed that
he doesn't treat me well.

507
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,000
Ye. Yes, i've noticed that.

508
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,320
But i stay with him all the same.
Well, yes.

509
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,800
Why am i still with him?

510
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,720
Miss Marta, I want you to...
I am...

511
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Zishe, I know what you mean.

512
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,400
Your music...
It's so beautiful when you play.

513
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,600
- You see, I have a dream.
- Can you tell me what it is?

514
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,600
Someday I'd like to play
Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.

515
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,200
With a full orchestra
to accompany me.

516
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,720
I would give anything for that.

517
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,000
I have a vision deep inside.

518
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Come with me.
I'll show you.

519
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,360
Now look at these beings.

520
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,960
To me they have
the purest of souls.

521
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,960
I have never seen
anything more beautiful.

522
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,720
More delicate.

523
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,120
I want to play music
to match this vision.

524
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,640
It's deep inside me.

525
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,120
Now I can see your soul.

526
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,400
- Please, will you take this?
- Enough. Enough.

527
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,720
Yes, madame, i shall of course
accept your paper.

528
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,200
Thank you.

529
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,720
Is your name on it?

530
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,200
Yes. And an important event
in my life.

531
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,800
Mr. Hanussen will mind-read
this as well.

532
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,200
Ladies and Gentlemen, I cannot
explain this phenomenon myself.

533
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,240
There are human emanations
which I can...

534
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,200
...read in a state of self-hypnosis.

535
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,800
Quiet, please!

536
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,160
Mr. Peters?

537
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,320
Mr. Peters wants to know from you...

538
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,800
...Mr. Hanussen, what
happened in his neighbor's...

539
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,400
...appartment, on March 2nd
of this year.

540
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,400
I see a room.

541
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,280
Flashes.

542
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,800
Yes, flashes.
Someone is taking photographs.

543
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,040
He does have a gift,
I must admit that.

544
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,800
It's a trick.
Everything's a trick.

545
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,480
I see, I see...

546
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,760
Blood. A dead body
lies there.

547
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,280
Police! Police!

548
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,600
Call the police!

549
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,200
No! The police are
there already.

550
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,680
Murder. Horrible!

551
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,800
Can you confirm this, Sir?

552
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,080
It's all true.
My neighbor was murdered.

553
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,840
And yes, there were many photos taken at the scene of the crime.

554
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,480
To clear up any doubts:

555
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:27,000
Do you know Mr. Hanussen personally?
Might there be any possibility, Sir...

556
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,040
...that you had some secret arrangement...

557
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,000
...with Mr. Hanussen beforehand?

558
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,640
I won't stand for this! I'm
Chief Justice of the High Court...

559
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,200
...and known to a good many
of the gentlemen present.

560
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,760
Benjamin! Mother!

561
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
- Who are you?
- Zishe, my son!

562
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,160
- How did you get here?
- By train. Father gave us permission.

563
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,840
Benjamin just wouldn't stop pestering us.

564
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,360
We can only stay a single day.

565
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,680
- What's the matter?
- Zishe!

566
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,560
You've changed so much!

567
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,080
Zishe...
I made you these cookies.

568
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,280
Zishe? For you.

569
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,800
Zishe?

570
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,760
Mother, how kind of you.
You know how much I love your cakes.

571
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,800
- But Benjamin...
- Zishe, what's the matter?

572
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,360
Benjamin, you're my favorite brother.

573
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,800
And mother, you're the best
mother a son could have.

574
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,760
But you shouldn't
worry about me.

575
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,360
I think i've seen my soul.

576
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,800
I mean, there is an acquarium here.

577
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,480
Benjamin, I can put it simply:
I am who I am.

578
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,200
And now, Ladies And Gentlemen,
something unheard of.

579
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,000
Never before attempted:
Siegfried, the Aryan King and...

580
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,080
...the elephant!

581
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,680
Siegfried! Siegfried! Siegfried!

582
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,760
Ladies and Gentlemen!
My name is not Siegfried.

583
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,000
For my family at home, in
Poland call me Zishe. I mean:

584
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,000
I'm not Aryan.
I am not a Germanic hero.

585
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,080
There isn't german Aryan
King any longer.

586
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,760
But... but the new Samson.

587
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,760
Samson, The Strong. A jew.

588
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,400
And i am proud of it.

589
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,480
Jewish pig!

590
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,080
You have no business here!
Get out of here!

591
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,800
- We don't need you!
- Out of here, jew!

592
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,800
Silence!

593
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,760
Ladies and Gentlemen!

594
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,560
I did not expect such
an affront to...

595
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,280
...our german people.

596
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,600
I have at this gentlement...
I have an answer for him:

597
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,240
Marta Farra, the
delicate and...

598
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,880
...pretty pianist from our
palace orchestra...

599
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,680
...will under the influence
of my hypnotic power...

600
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,360
...unite all your strenght.

601
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,240
Miss Farra has never
performed this feat before.

602
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,880
And yet we shall
risk it...

603
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,760
...to oppose this
cowardly provocation.

604
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,400
You become strong. Stronger than...

605
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,080
...cold reason can imagine.

606
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,960
You're strong!
You will lift this elephant.

607
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,880
Lift it!

608
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,960
Lift it!

609
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,880
We! We all!
We are all united!

610
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,600
Germany!
Hail! Hail! Hail!

611
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,120
I've come for the
money you owe me.

612
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,880
I mean, as soon as
you pay me, i'll go.

613
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,160
Have you seen the paper?
Front page!

614
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,480
- You do read, don't you?
- Yes. Yes.

615
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,080
Do you know that there
was a line three blocks...

616
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,680
...long when the box office opened this morning? Three blocks.

617
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Three!

618
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,400
It's the jews!

619
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,880
They all want to
see their new Samson.

620
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,880
- There you are!
- I'm so happy to see you!

621
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,880
Over here darling...

622
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,920
Yes, it was very good.
Interesting program.

623
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,280
I booked a table.

624
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,280
Excuse me. Excuse me.
May I introduce myself.

625
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,200
Samuel Edelmann.

626
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,280
I am the Rabbi of the congregation of Berlin-Charlottenburg.

627
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,160
- Zishe Breitbart.
- You needn't introduce yourself.

628
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,880
I saw you on stage. I was deeply
impressed by your courage.

629
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,080
Well, yes, but anyone would have. I mean... at least.

630
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,320
I'd like to invite you
to our synagog...

631
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,480
...to be called to
the Torah this Sabbath.

632
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,080
Well, you know, i don't have
much practice in reading.

633
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,200
What you have done,
has given...

634
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,880
...courage to the
jewish community.

635
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,880
Listen, Zishe! Just come.

636
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,080
You don't have to read,
maybe that...

637
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,680
...wasn't such a
good idea. Just come.

638
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,040
We are looking forward
to having you with us.

639
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,680
We are so proud of you.

640
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,480
Before i begin my
sermon today...

641
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,480
...i would like to take this
opportunity to welcome...

642
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,480
...a very special guest to
our congregation: Zishe Breitbart.

643
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,880
Zishe, please!

644
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,760
Good Shabbes.

645
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,800
Good Shabbes.

646
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,760
Good Shabbes.

647
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,400
Good Shabbes.

648
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,880
Good Shabbes.

649
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,600
- Good Shabbes.
- Good Shabbes. Have a seat.

650
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,800
Good Shabbes. Good Shabbes.

651
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,560
And in his honour, I would like
to recite one of the Psalms:

652
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,720
"I will lift up mine
eyes onto the hills...

653
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,360
...from whence cometh
my strenght."

654
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,840
"My strenght cometh
from the Lord...

655
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,360
...which made
Heaven and Earth."

656
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,800
"He will not give suffer thy foot to be moved. He the keepethy...

657
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,880
...will not slumber."
"Behold...

658
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,680
...He the keepethy Israel,
shall neither slumber...

659
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,680
...nor sleep."

660
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,640
You've been drawing
such large crowds...

661
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,560
...i've been thinking about
raising your salary.

662
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,320
That was my idea.

663
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,800
And tonight, my circle
of aficionados...

664
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,880
...brings out their big guns.

665
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,480
Guess who's coming to
honour us tonight!

666
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,400
- I wouldn't know.
- Himmler and Goebbels.

667
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,960
Who are they?
Movie stars?

668
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,240
No! Politicians!
Both high up...

669
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,480
...higher up in the party.
The party of Hitler.

670
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,280
They let me know they were coming just
to demonstrate their support for me.

671
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,160
Ladies and Gentlemen!
As you know, the strong man...

672
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,520
...of our house has--

673
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,800
Jews! You pigs!
Jews out!

674
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,480
Gentlemen, please...

675
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,680
Doubts have been voiced both from
the audience and in the press...

676
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,680
...about the strenght
of Zishe Breitbart.

677
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,320
Swindler! You swindler!

678
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,880
It's unthinkable that
a jew has such strenght!

679
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,000
Yes, sir. I acknowledge your objection.

680
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,440
That's why Breitbart has
announced an attempt...

681
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,680
...at the world
record tonight.

682
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,600
He will try to lift from the ground, a weight of 900lbs.

683
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,960
This weight is 50lbs heavier
than the current world record.

684
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,400
The precise weight has
already been established.

685
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,280
But to give an idea of
just how heavy this is...

686
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,120
...we have here 9
sacks of potatoes.

687
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,880
100 pounds each.

688
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,880
And now... the new Samson:

689
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,600
Zishe Breitbart!

690
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,200
You pig, get out!
Jewish pig!

691
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,480
The rule is simple:
it says that the weight has to be...

692
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,600
...held for three seconds.

693
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,920
If any of you out there
touches this old man...

694
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,880
...I will break your
arms and legs!

695
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,880
You stop that!
You stop that!

696
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,200
You stop that!

697
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,360
You stop that!

698
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,360
- This must be yours.
- This was merely an arabesque Ladies and Gentlemen.

699
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,360
Take your seats, please.
Don't we all feel refreshed...

700
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,480
...after an envigorating battle?
Place your hands in the light.

701
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,080
Make contact.

702
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,600
At least the people in
the palace learned a lesson.

703
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,080
May i pass on a question
from our Fhrer to you?

704
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,800
- I am honoured.
- The Fhrer, who appreciates...

705
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,880
...your predictions for the future
and who will regard to your..

706
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,560
...historic prognosis,
agrees with you entirely.

707
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,560
Asked the other day
in a small circle...

708
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,560
How clairvoyance could be in
accord with the principle...

709
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,880
...of cause and effect?
A law of nature.

710
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,960
Nature doesn't care what
we think of it.

711
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,880
Nor about the laws that
we assign it.

712
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,160
In reality... there is no
such thing as clairvoyance.

713
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,600
Because for me, there is no future.

714
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,880
- How is this?
- There is no future.

715
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,600
Just a state of
things and events.

716
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,840
You cannot imagine the
cosmos as either...

717
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,680
..."having been" or
"coming into being".

718
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,680
Events are still-point.

719
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,880
Only men hurries past.

720
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,120
Imagine time as a die.

721
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,680
And time sections as
sides of the die.

722
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,880
The normal human being
sees only one side.

723
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,480
The side that faces him.

724
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,800
And that is the present.

725
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,880
The clairvoyant, however...

726
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,080
...in a state of trance,
walks around the die in a way.

727
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,880
Seeing it also from the back.

728
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And that is the future side.

729
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,480
Which in time will
become the present.

730
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,280
Mr. Himmler, please
tell the fhrer...

731
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,600
...that I have seen his coming.

732
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,280
And that I welcome him...

733
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,480
...as the redeemer
of the german people.

734
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,800
In line!
March, march!

735
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,880
Remove the vehicle!

736
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,800
Move it!

737
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,800
Eyes forward!

738
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,760
Attention!

739
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,680
This is not my new palace...
but my Ministry.

740
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,880
Open your eyes!

741
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,560
I respect you because
you truly are strong.

742
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,680
This is huge.

743
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,960
This is not only the
very heart...

744
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,880
...of my future Ministry
of the Occult...

745
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,880
...but far more.
At this circle...

746
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,960
...cabinet sessions
will be held.

747
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,760
In this very hall, my dream,
my ascent to power...

748
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,280
...will become a reality.

749
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,480
But when i see all this...

750
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,880
...and this is the reason i brought you here...

751
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,800
...i sense something...

752
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,400
...almost like fear.

753
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,680
I love palmtrees.

754
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,880
I don't know why.

755
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,280
I even had a dream
about palmtrees.

756
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,280
And lots of crabs.

757
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,560
You have to get away from him.

758
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,000
Then i'll lose my job.
And i'll be thrown out of the country.

759
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,480
- But he beats you.
- This is nothing new.

760
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,160
Is there something i could do?
I mean to help.

761
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,200
- Come with me on Sunday.
- Where?

762
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,480
Hanussen's boat.
He's hosting a party.

763
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,480
There'll be some of his
business associates party members.

764
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,360
- The usual crowd.
- I wouldn't be welcome.

765
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,080
Zishe, please come!
For my sake.

766
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,680
I need you.

767
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,880
What the hell is he doing here?

768
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,960
Zishe is my friend.
I invited him.

769
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,960
Our jewish strong man.

770
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,880
Excellent. He will add
to our entertainment.

771
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,880
Please, come onboard.

772
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,880
Have fun!

773
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,880
Herr Goebbels? I don't understand
your concept of style.

774
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,680
You nazis don't even
know how to live.

775
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,360
Don't even know
what elegance is.

776
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,120
Last night i went
to the casino.

777
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,800
And there was a japanese man
standing there.

778
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,880
He didn't play. He was just
watching and smiling.

779
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:28,200
And early in the morning, the casino
almost closed, he presented...

780
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:32,480
...half a million gold marks,
and he put it on one colour:

781
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,760
On black. 50:50 chance.
Everybody is silent.

782
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,280
Only the sound of the ball,
rolling round and round.

783
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,560
And then it stops.
And it stopped on red.

784
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,560
He loses. So, now what happens?

785
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,880
The japanese guy just
blushed a little bit.

786
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,080
And smiled.
Herr Goebbels...

787
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,560
...that's what i call style,
that you nazis don't have.

788
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,640
I wished that Germany after the...

789
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,560
...catastrophic defeat
of the World War...

790
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,920
...would just
blush a little bit...

791
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,000
...and smile, and show some style.

792
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,280
You know, Count Helldorf,
it's easy to blush for a moment...

793
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,760
...if you own 50.000 acres
of land and two castles.

794
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,880
My young Goliath.
Do sit down.

795
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:34,200
We would like your opinion
on a little plan of ours.

796
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,280
A jewish one.
Yes, my love...

797
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,200
A little fire.
The Reichstag Parliament!

798
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,120
You know, Herr Goebbels,
what puzzles me most?

799
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,080
That a vulgar person
like Himmler...

800
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,080
...is rising in the party.

801
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,400
What is he babbling about
burning the Reichstag?

802
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,400
Cheers!

803
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,880
I won't do it! I won't
go to that ugly dwarf.

804
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,800
You watch your mouth!
You're speaking of Goebbels.

805
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,280
What do you think you're doing?
You remember your place.

806
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,760
Marta is my friend.

807
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,760
Fancy that!

808
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:51,560
This man, whom you shall now keep
company with all your charm...

809
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,240
...may have a club foot,
and measure only 5 feet...

810
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,200
...but what he keeps
in his pants...

811
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,720
...he must have borrowed
from a stallion.

812
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,880
You will take him to
my private cabin...

813
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,880
...below deck. In one hour you
will be back with a full report.

814
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,440
I can't.

815
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,800
What does that mean,
"I can not"?

816
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,560
Let me put it more clearly:
I won't!

817
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:18,200
You will not say
this word to me!

818
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,960
- Put me down! You put me down!
- Bravo! Excellent!

819
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,360
- Put me down!
- This is enterteinment at its best.

820
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,360
You will pay dearly for this!
I demand satisfaction!

821
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,280
Sabers? Pistols?
Excellent!

822
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,880
I shall... I shall...

823
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:44,600
Gentlemen, frauds like
this one are inevitable.

824
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,640
They go hand in hand with
the fall of empires.

825
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,600
I mean, the empire
you are dreaming of.

826
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,600
- Silence!
- It's true. You are a fraud!

827
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,160
A faker, simply a man
with a bag of tricks.

828
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,560
I will not have someone like
you telling lies in front of my friends.

829
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,360
These people are not your friends,
they're your puppets.

830
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,680
You told me so yourself.

831
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,680
I should kill you for
what you've just said.

832
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,200
Herr Hanussen?

833
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,680
Please!

834
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,000
We have ladies present.

835
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,200
May i suggest
this be settled...

836
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,480
...in a court of law?
If our strong man...

837
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,640
...can prove his case,
so be it.

838
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,680
If he can't, then he shall find
out what the penalty is...

839
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,480
...for defying the honour
of a german citizen...

840
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,600
...with cheap accusations.

841
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,480
Excellent, excellent.

842
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,560
Ladies and Gentlemen, you're
all kindly invited...

843
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,880
...to a public spectacle.

844
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,480
It seems to me that all performers
take certain liberties...

845
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,560
...with their presentations.

846
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,680
- What else?
- The elephant act.

847
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,040
There was an apparatus.
A hydraulic apparatus...

848
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,680
...was secretly built.

849
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,080
I mean, it would be impossible
for a woman...

850
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,200
...to be hypnotized
to lift an elephant.

851
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:16,200
- I miself can barely do it.
- And how is it that you can do it?

852
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,880
Well, Sir, i'm very strong.

853
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:26,680
Herr Breitbart, in your alegation
of the so-called "mind-reading"...

854
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,800
...you referred to
a secret code.

855
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,760
Explain it to the Court.

856
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,720
Your Honour,
this is very simple.

857
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,280
You just need a
good assistant.

858
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,160
He reads out loud from
a piece of paper on which...

859
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,960
...a member of the audience
has written down some event.

860
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,200
Then he says "Quiet". And the
word "quiet" signals a death.

861
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,280
When he says "Quiet, please",
it means a murder.

862
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,680
And Mr. Hanussen...

863
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,800
...guesses the rest
and embellishes it.

864
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,760
And do you have
witnesses for this?

865
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,800
Well, yes! Marta Farra.

866
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:07,080
Frulein, please...
Approach the witness stand.

867
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,960
- Is Marta Farra a stage name?
- No, it's my real name.

868
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:23,800
- Are you a german citizen?
- I'm czech by birth.

869
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,840
And do you know if
Mr. Hanussen uses...

870
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,800
...tricks and fakery
for the purpose...

871
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,880
...of defrauding
his customers?

872
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,800
Answer the question, please.

873
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,200
I can't, I mean...

874
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,000
I don't myself believe in such things...

875
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,800
...the power of the occult.

876
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,480
Are you saying then, that
Mr. Hanussen is a fraud?

877
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,480
Yes.

878
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,200
She's lying.

879
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,160
- You're lying! You're lying!
- Sit down Herr Hanussen!

880
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,880
Sit down, Herr Hanussen!

881
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:18,200
I will determine
who's lying here.

882
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,800
Can you prove your alegation?

883
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,280
His name is not Eric Jan Hanussen.

884
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,360
- He's not a danish aristocrat.
- What is his name then?

885
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,400
Well?

886
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,160
His name is Herschel Steinschneider.

887
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,600
- Jew! Jew pig! Swine!
- Silence!

888
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,560
Silence! Silence!
Order in the Court!

889
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,960
Or I'll hold you in contempt!

890
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,080
There seems to be a discrepancy...

891
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,960
...in regard to your name.

892
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,000
Do you use a stage name?

893
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,080
May I see your papers, please?

894
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,160
A czech citizen.
Named...

895
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,200
...Herschel Steinschneider.

896
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,880
Jew.

897
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,480
Is Herschel Steinschneider
your real name?

898
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,600
It's one of many.

899
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,880
In Istambul... I once...

900
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,200
...borrowed the identity of
Franz Lehrs. The...

901
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,800
...Operetta Composer.

902
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,680
And using this alias...

903
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,200
...i obtained a large
amount of money...

904
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,080
...from enthusiastic
theatre lovers.

905
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,280
I then purloined a first class
ticket aboard the luxury liner SUEZ...

906
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,280
...for my return
voyage to England...

907
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,080
...by posing as Enrico Caruso.

908
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,880
The famous italian tenor.

909
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,640
Thus allowing a french countess...

910
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,480
...to fall in love with me.

911
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,120
I even escaped the
Great Patriotic War...

912
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,280
...by using the name of a...

913
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,720
...dead playmate
from my youth.

914
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,160
You see, I have nothing but contempt for...

915
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:07,000
...the so-called glory of
"dying on the field of honour".

916
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,480
With regards to my little "Inventions"...

917
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,760
...my so-called "fraud"...

918
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,960
I am of the opinion that
even God must have...

919
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,560
...bluffed at His creation.

920
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:29,160
Otherwise, how could he
have come this far?

921
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,800
Come in.

922
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,280
What do you want here?

923
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,880
I wanted to say goodbye.

924
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:18,200
Actually, I wanted...
I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

925
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,880
I didn't want this.

926
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,360
What kind of choice
do we have?

927
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,680
We can be kicked around
like dogs or else readapt.

928
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,880
Dress up.
Simulate completely.

929
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,480
I passed myself off
as a danish aristocrat.

930
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:51,160
And i, a little czech jew,
live like a sovereign.

931
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,880
Selling the occult
to the perplex.

932
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,400
No trouble.
We don't want you.

933
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,280
I'm sorry.

934
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,280
Zishe, i wish we could
have been friends.

935
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:30,600
One moment, gentlemen.

936
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,800
My cape.

937
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,480
I want to look elegant
for this excursion.

938
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,200
- Zishe!
- Rabbi! Please, excuse me.

939
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,880
All at once it came
over me, like a great light.

940
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,800
Everything became clear.

941
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,760
It was as if, as if the Allmighty
spoke to me directly.

942
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:29,960
You have found your faith.
You have found God.

943
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,880
It's been clear since the day
i first saw you, that He...

944
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,440
...had long ago found you.

945
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,880
And, how can i say it...?

946
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:45,560
My faith, my destiny, has
finally been made known to me.

947
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,400
And... What is it, my friend?

948
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,280
I see something terrible coming.

949
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,680
So terrible that i don't have
words to describe it. A danger.

950
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,480
A horrible danger for us jews.

951
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,160
How am i supposed to
understand this?

952
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:11,480
I don't understand it myself.
It's like, as if...

953
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,480
...as if i had now become Hanussen.
The clairvoyant. I mean:

954
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:24,680
- I can see it all before me.
- What will you do? What do you intend?

955
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,160
I have a mission.
I've been called.

956
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,360
Yes?

957
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,200
I must be the new
Samson for my people.

958
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,240
You know Zishe... you sound as
if you...

959
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,880
...might be one of the Unknown Just.

960
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,960
What do you mean?
Who are they?

961
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,880
Well, Zishe, you see:
In every generation...

962
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,880
...there are born among the jews,
36 men whom God has chosen...

963
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,920
...to bear the burden
of the world suffering.

964
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,080
And to whom he has
granted the privilege...

965
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,080
...of martyrdom.

966
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,680
The world reposes upon
36 Just Men...

967
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,680
...indistinguishable
from simple mortals.

968
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,800
Often, they do not
recognize themselves.

969
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,560
And the most pitiable
are the Just Men...

970
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,360
...who remain unknown
to themselves.

971
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:27,080
When an Unknown
Just rises to Heaven...

972
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,080
...he's so frozen, that God
must warm him...

973
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,480
...a thousand years between his fingers...

974
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,760
...before his soul can
open itself to paradise.

975
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:43,160
And it is known, that some remain
forever incosolable...

976
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,040
...at human woe,
so that even God...

977
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,000
...Himself can not warm them.

978
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,760
So... from time to time...

979
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,480
The Creator,
blessed be His name...

980
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,040
...sets the clock of the Last Judgement forward...

981
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,880
...by one minute.

982
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,560
- You wanted me to wear this dress?
- Yes.

983
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,680
I think i know why.

984
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,680
I'm going to miss you
very very much.

985
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,280
But i know you must go.

986
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,600
Zishe, dear, please be careful,
you're breaking me in two.

987
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:56,600
I'm a woman, you must
be very tender.

988
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:08,760
I don't think you know why
i asked you to wear this dress.

989
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,120
There is--

990
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,480
I have something for you.

991
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,480
- You didn't... did you?
- Yes, yes i did.

992
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:46,240
Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.
Second Movement.

993
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,200
But, in Heaven's name...

994
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,200
...we've never
rehearsed together.

995
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,200
Don't worry madame,
the important thing is...

996
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,200
...that we have rehearsed.
We shall follow you.

997
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,280
CANCELLED

998
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,800
CANCELLED DUE TO ILLNESS

999
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,240
Zishe Breitbart? Unmistakable.

1000
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,280
Thank you for being
at our disposal.

1001
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:07,280
- I want to see it for myself.
- Get in!

1002
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,880
Prepare yourself, it won't
be a pleasant sight.

1003
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,120
Due identification was made
very difficult by the fact...

1004
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,360
- Can you take this?
- Yes.

1005
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,320
By the fact that the corpse
shows at least 20 bullet...

1006
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,200
...holes and has been
disfigured by wild animals.

1007
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,200
In other words:
wild bears have eaten the face...

1008
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,160
...and half of the body.

1009
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,160
I know this man.

1010
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:57,280
Western Poland, December 1932

1011
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,880
Zishe... Zishe!

1012
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,880
It is Zishe!

1013
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:06,680
- Welcome! Welcome!
- Zishe!

1014
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,280
Zishe, you've become
a famous man!

1015
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:15,960
- Your brother will be so pleased.
- Who? Benjamin?

1016
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,760
- Yes. Didn't your mother ever write to you?
- Yes. Is Benjamin ill?

1017
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,880
No. But don't you know that
every day since you gone away...

1018
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,440
...he's been sitting on
the steps of your house...

1019
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,880
Every day.

1020
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,480
...looking in the
direction you went?

1021
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,760
For hours.

1022
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,880
I have to see him.

1023
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:04,480
Zishe, my son!

1024
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,880
Come closer!
Come closer!

1025
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,880
- Come here! Come closer, please!
- Please.

1026
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,480
Come closer! Come here!

1027
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:06,880
Come closer!

1028
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:12,200
We have to get strong.
We shall need a thousand Samsons.

1029
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:16,200
We must be strong.
We... we have to defend.

1030
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,400
What i mean to say is...
I mean...

1031
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:23,480
I shall need thousands of strong
young men, to protect and defend...

1032
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,080
...our people.

1033
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,800
I foresee something terrible
happening to our people.

1034
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,680
Something horrific.
The Nazis in Germany...

1035
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:35,680
Because we need thousands of Samsons.
I will show you how to get strong.

1036
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,840
All right, Zishe!
You know we admire you.

1037
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,680
We are proud of you.

1038
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,720
But how, i ask,
could the Nazis...

1039
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,680
...pose any threat to us?

1040
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,200
The Nazis, yes the
Nazis in Germany!

1041
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,600
Germany is no
danger for Poland.

1042
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,600
Since they've lost the
Great War they are not...

1043
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,600
...even allowed to
have an army anymore.

1044
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,880
That is not quite true.
They are allowed...

1045
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,160
...100.000 men.
No heavy arms...

1046
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,320
...no aeroplanes,
no battle ships.

1047
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,360
Yes, but professor, Poland's borders are secure, are they not?

1048
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:07,280
I think so, yes. If there's a
danger, it'll come from Russia.

1049
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:10,280
Listen, listen to me!
I see it! I see it!

1050
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,800
What is it?

1051
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:15,800
The horror! It's... it's...

1052
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:23,560
The horror! It's real.

1053
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:29,280
Please stay!
You must listen to me!

1054
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:02,360
- Benjamin's missing. Where is he?
- He's in the workshop.

1055
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:06,880
- He stays in the workshop.
- I'm going to get him.

1056
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:30,360
I'm not coming.
I've to get strong.

1057
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,000
Even if nobody
else believes you.

1058
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:39,880
If you want to get strong,
you have to eat properly too.

1059
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,760
There's no muscle there.

1060
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,280
It's better for you to study.
Study at studies.

1061
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:21,000
I am the new Samson!
I want to be your protector.

1062
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,520
But i can't do this alone.

1063
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,280
You have to become strong,
like me! All of you.

1064
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,280
And i'm a woodcutter. I can
handle an axe. But are you really..

1065
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:32,600
...so strong? If you want
to tell us something...

1066
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,760
...you have to show
us something first.

1067
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,800
Did you never hear about
Zishe, the Aryan King?

1068
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,280
The new Samson.

1069
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,880
- That's what he called himself in Berlin.
- But we want to see something.

1070
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:47,960
Some real good stuff.
You know, strong.

1071
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:15,080
Impressive! But these are polish nails, probably greased.

1072
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,120
I bet you can't do
it with this one.

1073
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:22,880
Of course he can.

1074
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,160
He can do much more.

1075
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:39,400
Look at this! It went
all the way through.

1076
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,800
It doesn't look too deep,
but it could get infected.

1077
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,880
The village barber
can stitch it up.

1078
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:49,680
Vodka!

1079
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:55,400
- We'll put some vodka on it.
- Ridiculous!

1080
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:59,480
- The thing was rusty.
- Vodka, we'll drink the vodka!

1081
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:02,760
And then we'll go on talking.

1082
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
Cheers!

1083
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Yes!

1084
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,880
You should let the doctor
look at that.

1085
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,960
Under the table.
The prince.

1086
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,760
- There's a rooster!
- Zishe, you have a fever.

1087
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:42,360
There's no rooster.

1088
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,280
JEWISH HOSPITAL

1089
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:36,360
Mr. Breitbart?
Mr. Breitbart?

1090
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:42,280
Can you hear me?
Zishe, can you hear me?

1091
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:50,680
We have to operate at once.
And we'll have to amputate the leg.

1092
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:54,600
It's the only way to
save his life.

1093
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:58,280
I'm sorry, but we
have no choice.

1094
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,800
- Will it grow again?
- Yes, of course!

1095
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:19,160
- It'll take only one or two months.
- Hannele, come down from the bed.

1096
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:22,600
Why don't you let her stay? It
makes me happy when she's with me.

1097
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,760
Zishe, my son, we're leaving.

1098
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,160
Would you like us to push you over to the window again?

1099
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,480
That would be nice.

1100
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,280
Visiting hours are tomorrow
morning, from 11 o' clock.

1101
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,680
I'm staying.

1102
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,680
- The doctors agreed.
- Benjamin!

1103
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:52,680
We would like you have you with us as
well sometime. For a whole week now...

1104
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:57,800
- ...you've come home only to sleep.
- He stays. He can stay.

1105
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,280
Zishe, my son.

1106
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,880
Zishe...

1107
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,880
There's a ringing in my ears.

1108
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:50,600
Someone must be thinking of me.

1109
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,400
Father...

1110
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,560
Father, Benjamin is flying!

1111
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:53,040
In spite of his invincible
strenght, Zishe Breitbart...

1112
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,800
...died after eleven
consecutive operations.

1113
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:02,280
He passed away on January 28, 1933,
two days before Hitler rose to power.

1114
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:08,280
He lives in leyends and ballads
