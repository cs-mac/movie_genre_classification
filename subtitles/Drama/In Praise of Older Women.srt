3
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,300
There are always two wolves...

4
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,760
fighting within our minds.

5
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,200
One is cold and heartless,

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
and the other...

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,000
is warm and peaceful.

8
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,500
Which one wins?

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,130
The one I feed wins.

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,700
My father told me the story...

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,100
the Indian chief told his grandson.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,800
My father told me...

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,500
to be a person...

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,230
who feeds the warm wolf.

15
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm sorry, Father.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,760
From now on,

17
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,230
I will feed...

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,060
the cold and heartless wolf.

Ji Yoo...

21
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,230
Ji Yoo...

22
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Ji Yoo.

23
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

24
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No.

25
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,800
No. This must not be true.

26
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
No.

27
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,460
What's going on?

28
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Ji Yoo!

29
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,260
Ji Yoo!

30
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,870
Kang Ji Yoo!

31
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,060
Kang Woo!

32
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,630
Kang Woo.

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Ji Yoo! Ji Yoo.

34
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Move.

35
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Ji Yoo.

36
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Ji Yoo!

37
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,370
Ji Yoo.

38
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
Ji Yoo!

39
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
Where's Ji Yoo?

40
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Ji Yoo. Ji Yoo.

41
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,230
Where's Ji Yoo? Ji Yoo!

42
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,530
Ji Yoo! Ji Yoo.

43
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Kang Ji Yoo!

44
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,560
Where's Ji Yoo? Bring her here!

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,460
Bring Ji Yoo right now! Ji Yoo!

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ji Yoo!

47
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
- I only did as I was told... - Wait outside.

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,800
Kang Ji Yoo.

50
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,830
You ruined everything.

51
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,500
This dress...

52
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
and my wedding.

53
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,330
You always make me miserable.

54
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,460
But do you know this?

55
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
I won't go down like this...

56
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,730
because...

57
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,130
I'm no longer Hong Soon Bok,

58
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,530
but Chae Seo Rin.

59
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,860
So you can't die yet.

60
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,530
You need to be...

61
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,960
healthy and alive.

(Year 2011)

63
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,660
- Hey. - Hi.

64
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,330
Are you still making that?

65
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,230
Do you think you're Rodin or something?

66
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
What do you think?

67
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,970
Once I add the music, it's done.

68
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,860
Look. Girls don't like those things.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,730
Hard work? Art? They don't want that.

70
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,500
They like small and shiny things.

71
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,100
That's what they like.

72
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,360
She isn't a girl.

73
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,130
What do you mean?

74
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
She's beyond human.

75
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,400
My gosh. You lunatic.

76
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
Go see Professor Jung.

77
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,330
- He wants you to come to his lab. - Why?

78
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,300
Maybe you came in first again.

79
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,470
Can't you let me have it just once?

80
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,760
Would you like...

81
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,560
my help?

82
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,360
"In Jeopardy".

83
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,430
She's in danger just like the title.

84
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,060
Thank goodness, the gentleman is there.

85
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,130
He won't ignore the woman in distress.

86
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
That woman...

87
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,500
won't ask the man for help.

88
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Sorry?

89
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,800
Look. She gathered her skirt.

90
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,960
Would you like my help?

91
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,860
That woman probably doesn't need the help of any man.

92
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Excuse me.

93
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,000
No. She needs the help of the gentleman.

94
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Definitely.

95
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,760
Did you forget me already?

96
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,760
You left nothing but loneliness

97
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,500
Did you forget me?

98
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,430
Did you forget me already?

99
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Who are you?

100
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,130
Who...

101
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,860
Oh, no.

102
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I like you.

103
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,930
Will you go out with me?

104
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,460
I'm such a loser.

105
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,860
It's been a year already.

106
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,200
Gosh.

107
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,460
The next item is by Kim Min Young...

108
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,430
whose work received the highest bid...

109
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,400
in the Hong Kong auction.

110
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,160
"Pink Illusion". We'll start the bidding at 1.5 million dollars.

111
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,300
(VIP Regular Auction)

112
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,460
The items that I marked in the brochure...

113
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,860
are the ones Yoo Kang Woo will be buying.

114
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,460
Whatever happens,

115
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,600
you must gain his attention.

116
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,930
(Pink Illusion)

117
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
1.8 million dollars.

118
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,800
We have 1.8 million. Anyone else?

119
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
1.85 million.

120
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,730
We have a bid of 1.85 million dollars.

121
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,670
1.86 million.

122
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,830
We have 1.86 million.

123
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,430
Who will give more?

124
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,360
I'll ask three times and close the bid.

125
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,400
1.86 million.

126
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
1.86 million.

127
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,630
1.86 million.

128
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,230
Congratulations.

129
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,830
You've won "Pink Illusion".

130
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,630
The next item is by a 19th century British artist.

131
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,060
It was painted by Arthur Hacker in 1902.

132
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,400
It's "In Jeopardy".

133
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,900
We'll begin at 40,000 dollars.

134
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,530
45,000 dollars.

135
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,760
We have 45,000 dollars.

136
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,760
Just a minute!

137
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,930
I missed both pieces.

138
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,000
I couldn't miss them.

139
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,430
I'm sorry.

140
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,630
I'd like to talk more...

141
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,330
about the woman in distress.

142
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,860
Would you like to have dinner?

143
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,670
I'm sorry, but I don't have time.

144
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

145
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
It's about the project you submitted.

146
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,170
Submit it for the Seoul Ideas Competition in Urban Planning.

147
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,960
- Sorry? - If you revise it a little,

148
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,360
it might win the competition.

149
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,060
Improve the practical parts and make it better.

150
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, Sir. I'll work on it until my body gives out.

151
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Hello?

152
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
Yes, I'm Min Sun Ho.

153
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,530
Pardon?

154
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,800
- I'll be right there... - I'm on my way...

155
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
I'll be right there.

156
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm on my way.

157

Kang Woo!

158
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
You'll fall!

159
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Don't run.

160
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,630
- My goodness. - Good to see you!

161
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,130
What if you get hurt before your performance?

162
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I wasn't going to run,

163
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,430
but my feet jetted to you...

164
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,670
like they had an engine attached.

165
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,430
Still, you should be careful.

166
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,030
(Intensive Care Unit)

167
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,230
Is Min Hye Sun here?

168
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,930
Yes, she's over here.

169
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,330
That man is quite attractive. It's enough for me to fall for.

170
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
That's good.

171
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,430
But he has a girlfriend.

172
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,930
So?

173
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,730
- Pardon? - Did you think it would be easy?

174
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,430
But what do you gain if I marry...

175
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,400
into Mosung Group?

176
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,330
Why do you have so many questions?

177
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,100
Just do as you've always done.

178
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,230
I make the orders...

179
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,960
and you follow them.

180
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,600
Yoo Kang Woo's girlfriend has a performance soon.

181
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,230
That's where you should meet him again.

182
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,100
You'll get to see him...

183
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,670
and check out his girlfriend.

184

(Kang Ji Yoo's Dance Performance)

187
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Ji Yoo?

188
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,530
It can't be.

189
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,500
Is Kang Woo's girlfriend...

190
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No.

191
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,700
It can't be.

192
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
It can't be.

193
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,230
Excuse me.

194
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,230
Hey!

195
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,700
I saw you at the auction the other day.

196
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,100
We meet again.

197
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,330
Is this your seat?

198
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,460
You're right. What a coincidence!

199
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,600
It's nice seeing you again like this.

200
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,660
I came because my friend is performing today.

201
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,630
- What about you? - I came to see my girlfriend.

202
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,360
Is your girlfriend...

203
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Please, no.

204
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,900
It can't be. I'm sure it isn't.

205
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,660
Is she a ballerina?

206
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Here.

207
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,530
It's her.

208
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Ma'am.

209
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,430
How was I?

210
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,560
You're doing well.

211
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,130
You started late, but you're just as good as Ji Yoo.

212
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,330
Then will I be able to win...

213
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,800
this coming dance competition?

214
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,100
You haven't heard yet?

215
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,330
Heard what?

(Seoul International Ballet Competition)

217
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,700
Soon Bok.

218
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,200
Is it true...

219
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,230
that you're going alone for this competition?

220
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
The thing is...

221
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,630
If only one person can enter,

222
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,530
it should be me, not you.

223
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,300
You don't need this competition.

224
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,760
You don't need money, and you've won every award out there.

225
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
You don't have to care about college or scholarship!

226
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,060
Please let me explain.

227
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,460
My life depends on this competition.

228
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,000
If I don't win this,

229
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,960
I have to give up on college and scholarship.

230
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,860
You know better than anyone how hard I worked for this.

231
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,630
How could you do this to me?

232
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Well... Soon Bok...

233
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Well...

234
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
I told her to do it.

235
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,960
An American director is coming...

236
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,200
to sit as a judge for this competition.

237
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,230
With Ji Yoo's skills, she'll definitely catch his eye.

238
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,800
Then she'll go to the States.

239
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,600
She's a better dancer than you,

240
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
so give her this one.

241
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,230
We'll keep paying your tuition through college.

242
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,230
Aren't you doing this for the scholarship anyway?

Kang Woo is Ji Yoo's boyfriend.

246
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,100
Why? Why?

247
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,700
Why does it have to be her? Why?

248
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,460
Soon Bok.

249
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,400
My gosh.

250
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,760
You have your ear plugged up with this.

251
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,330
No wonder you couldn't hear me.

252
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,830
Ji Yoo left her umbrella.

253
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,500
Bring it to her.

254
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,300
No.

255
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,560
You brat. Get up.

256
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,100
What if she gets wet and catches a cold?

257
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,600
I got wet, too.

258
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,030
You're not the same.

259
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,860
Get up.

260
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,930
You'll be blessed for doing good deeds.

261
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,230
Get up already.

262
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,730
- No. - Hurry up.

263
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,530
Go on. Hurry.

264
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,230
It's always Ji Yoo this and Ji Yoo that.

265
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,530
Whose mum is she anyway?

266
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,830
Why does it have to be Ji Yoo?

267
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,230
I worked so hard to be free of her.

268
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Why again?

269
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,930
After all I did to get here,

270
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,430
I can't go back...

271
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,530
to Hong Soon Bok because of her again.

Excuse me.

274
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,730
I know Kang Woo's girlfriend.

275
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,500
I don't want to get tangled up with her again.

276
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,460
Do you want to return to the sewer?

277
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,230
Sleeping at a friend's house...

278
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,900
means you're allowed to sleep out.

279
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,900
Please be mine forever.
