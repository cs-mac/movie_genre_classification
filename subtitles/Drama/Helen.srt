Oh, my God!

Yes.

Just one.

19
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,811
A short one.

20
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,423

If I shoot those guys out there

31
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,436
and plead temporary insanity,

32
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:59,858
would you corroborate my story, huh?

33
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,488
Oh, shit.

34
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,113
Hmm?

35
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,909
The alarm didn't go off.

36
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,993
-Come on.
-Hmm?

37
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,246
-It's almost 8:00.
-M m-hmm.

38
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,667
Julie has a test in her first period.

39
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,545
-Where's your tie?
-l don't know.

40
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,588
And I can't take her.

41
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,425
I have this stupid
early faculty meeting.

42
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,639
-David!
-I'm up! I'm up!

43
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,015
Wake up!

44
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,267
Wake up. Wake up.

45
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,019
M m-hmm.

46
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,771
We gotta go, darling.

47
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,481
Everyone is gonna be there.

48
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,941
I already told Brian I could go,

49
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,276
and if I back out now,
he's gonna think I'm a chicken.

50
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,236
Good morning.

51
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,320
You know how hard it is

52
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,572
to get a reservation at Claire's
this time of year.

53
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,950
-Hey! I slept just fine.
-I thought you'd be thrilled.

54
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,410
Thank you, thank you.

55
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,204
But you never said you made plans.

56
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,456
It was supposed to be a surprise.

57
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,417
-Hey, who cleaned up?
-But. . . .

58
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,502
-I did. But that is not the point.
-When?

59
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,503
The point is, I never said

60
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,338
that you could go away
for the weekend either.

61
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,424
-You're crazy. I would have helped.
-Dave did.

62
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,138
Is that true?

63
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,473
Somebody was supposed to tell you.

64
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,934
Well, I forgot!

65
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,313
Well, you're not going,
and that's that.

66
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,232
Great! Thanks a lot!

67
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,776
But if you think I'm going
to Claire's with you instead,

68
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,819
think again!

69
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,241
She has to be in school
in seven seconds. You gotta go.

70
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,783
Hello?

71
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,965
Can I help you?

72
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,132
I was just. . . .

73
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,009
What are you doing here?

74
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,429
Well, I can. . .
ask you that question.

75
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,392
Nobody's supposed to be here
this time of night.

76
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,852
So what are you still doing here?

77
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,148
Aren't you in my music theory class?

78
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,363
I just. . . I can't. . . get it right.

79
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,158
Nothing I play sounds adequate,
not a single note I play.

80
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,121
Well, it's not your notes
that are wrong.

81
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,583
But you need to slow down.

82
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,294
Try to. . . pay more attention

83
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,504
to what happens
in between the notes.

84
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,425
Try to hold on to time.

85
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,178
What do you mean?

86
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,935
Suspension. Silence.

87
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,191
That's where you'II find
what you're looking for.

88
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,070
In the distance between things.

89
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,747
And you really shouldn't be
smoking in here.

90
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,833
Let me know when you want to go.

91
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,714
I'll let you out.

92
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,758
No need to climb out the window.

93
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,091
l don't see it coming.

94
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,557
But l can feel it.

95
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,565
lt's there.

96
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,181
Hey, Helen.

97
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,683
Hi, Donna.

98
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,269
So you think they'll read your brief,
withdraw the suit,

99
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,979
and send us a written apology?

100
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,731
Or a fruit basket.

101
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,153
Oh! Helen's here.

102
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,029
Hey, love.

103
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,489
Thank God you're here.

104
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,200
You gotta save me from this man.
He thinks he's invincibIe.

105
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,078
What are you doing here? Huh?

106
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,254
Well. . . actually, I was nowhere
near this neighborhood,

107
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,298
and l just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

108
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,716
But you are so busy.

109
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,593
I'm sorry,
I should have called first.

110
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,928
No, no, no, it's perfect. We're gonna
go to Iunch in a few minutes.

111
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,347
-Why don't you come with us?
-Yeah.

112
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,933
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

113
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,769
You don't have to eat.
Just join us.

114
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,103
You know, I --

115
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,565
l reaIIy shouId go home
and get out of these clothes.

116
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,358
You sure?

117
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,988
Yeah. AbsoIuteIy.
I just wanted to stop by and say hi.

118
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,365
-I'll see you later.
-AII right.

119
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,911
-See you, Suz.
-Take care, honey.

120
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,472
Hello, everyone.

121
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,642
After I've returned your essays,
we'II discu--

122
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,273
We will. . . .

123
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,778
Excuse me.

124
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,675
I'm going to bed.

125
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,886
Sleep tight, sweetheart.

126
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,930
Okay.

127
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,188
Straight answer --
did you like dinner?

128
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,941
It was. . . incredible.

129
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,527
Yeah, okay.
Whatever that means.

130
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,447
Good night.

131
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,371
Helen?

132
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,728
I love this car.

133
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,649
I know you do.

134
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,334
Are you going to let me in
on your secret?

135
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,297
What makes you think
l have a secret?

136
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,383
Don't you?

137
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,430
Not with you.

138
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,436
What is it, honey?

139
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,360
It's nothing.

140
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,864
I'm just tired.

141
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,867
I'm just really tired. That's all.
It's nothing.

142
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,206
I always hate the beginning
of the semester.

143
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,927
Come on, let's go inside.

144
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,145
Have you eaten?

145
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,354
Yeah.

146
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,649
Julie tried her very first
carbonara sauce.

147
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,735
It was scary.

148
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,289
Are you okay?

149
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,417
What are you doing here, honey?
Why aren't you at schooI?

150
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,002
I was at school.

151
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,760
What time is it?

152
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,556
1 5.

153
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:08,855
Jesus. . . I must have slept
like a rock.

154
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,903
Can you -- can you please
help me with this math?

155
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,739
I really need to get this done
before I leave.

156
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,241
Yeah.

157
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,493
Just give me a minute.

158
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,549
Do you want me to call Dad
to come and pick me up?

159
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,019
No.

160
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,441
Of course not. I'm taking you.

161
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,634
I'm not going on a world trip, Mom.

162
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,888
I'll be back in three weeks.

163
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,097
I know.

164
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,475
Okay.

165
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,991
Go, Mom!

166
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,205
-Hey, Dad!
-Hey, gorgeous!

167
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,998
How'd it go?
-Good.

168
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:51,958
Come here.

169
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,629
-All right, get in there.
-Okay.

170
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,883
Dad, come here!
I want to show you something!

171
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,970
Dad!

172
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,554
All right.

173
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,015
No, I don't think that she should try
and work things out with him.

174
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,517
I think that she should
pack her bags,

175
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,936
take the kids,
move back to California,

176
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,062
and sue the hell out of him

177
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,981
until he doesn't have a pot
to piss in anymore.

178
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:15,815
M m-hmm.

179
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,275
You sure you want to go out
with this woman?

180
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,527
Oh, no. Excuse me.

181
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,238
He is like the biggest fucking
cIiché on the bIock, okay?

182
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,032
First of all, he sleeps
with every assistant he's ever had,

183
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,160
Iies to Louise about it
for three and half years,

184
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,956
and then he makes her feel guilty
for not being there for him.

185
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,000
Like now it's her fauIt
that he sleeps around

186
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,711
like some fucking. . . dog in heat.

187
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,256
I thought only female dogs
go into heat? Don't they?

188
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,507
What do male dogs do?

189
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,719
It's a permanent condition for them
that doesn't require a name.

190
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,596
Susanna, remind me --
when exactly did we lose

191
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,099
the ability to have
a civilized conversation?

192
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,351
-Excuse me.
-I didn't bring this up.

193
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,896
-Yes, you did.
-I did? No, I didn't.

194
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,482
Yeah, you made a reference to. . . .

195
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,745
We believe that life can be perfect.

196
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,165
So we are always miserable
because it never is.

197
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,960
Whereas they beIieve that even
under the best of circumstances,

198
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,545
life could maybe be improved.

199
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,588
So what are you saying?

200
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,382
That we should lower
our expectations

201
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,966
to a point that they're already met?

202
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,260
No, I think she's saying we should
go to Europe more often.

203
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:08,969
Yeah!

204
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,846
But you don't need
to go back, David.

205
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,182
There's no room for improvement
in his life.

206
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,642
He loves his life.

207
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,685
-Isn't that disgusting?
-M m-hmm.

208
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,979
Somebody should sue me.

209
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,065
-l wiII.
-Now there's a job.

210
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,024
That might be a dare.

211
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,278
Helen, are you still in there?

212
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,660
Helen?

213
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,999
Excuse me.
Um, have you seen my wife?

214
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,503
Helen?!

215
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,507
Helen!

216
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,803
What the fuck is going on?

217
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,682
What are you doing here? Huh?

218
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,352
Sorry, I didn't feel well.

219
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,479
What's wrong? Are you okay?

220
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,565
Yeah. It's nothing.

221
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,611
Nothing? You disappeared
without saying a word to us.

222
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,329
I'm sorry.

223
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,499
I should have said something.

224
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:33,512
Listen, David, it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

225
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,316
Is there someone else?

226
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,154
Is there?

227
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,658
Wait a minute.
Is that what this is all about?

228
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,619
You're suspecting me
of fucking around?

229
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,083
No. Of course not.

230
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,296
Then what is it? What's so awful
that you won't tell me?

231
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,006
I'm sorry.

232
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,467
Sorry for what?

233
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,224
Helen, I used to know
everything about you.

234
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,434
For better or for worse, remember?

235
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,358
Come on, honey. Talk to me.
What's going on?

236
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,985
Stop it! Please!

237
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,157
Please stop interrogating me.

238
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,532
Helen?

239
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,995
Jesus Christ.

240
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,756
Helen!

241
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,262
Hey.

242
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,977
Oh, God!

243
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,104
Helen!

244
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,443
-David?
-Hey, honey. Hey.

245
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,361
M r. Leonard?

246
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,404
How is she?

247
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,573
WeII, there's nothing
physically wrong with your wife.

248
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,159
I've notified Dr. Barnes.
He's the neurologist on call.

249
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,244
I don't understand.
You just said there's nothing --

250
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,997
there's nothing wrong with her.

251
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,082
You'll have to wait for Dr. Barnes.

252
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,042
Give me the goddamn time of day,
wiII you?

253
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,253
She was practically unconscious.

254
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,258
It seems the problem is psychiatric.

255
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,968
What the hell are you talking about?

256
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,929
There's no physical cause
for her symptoms.

257
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,016
Look, this is. . . .

258
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,935
You know what?
I want a second opinion, all right?

259
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,645
Well, I am the second opinion.

260
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,107
Please wait for Dr. Barnes.

261
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,986
Do you suffer from insomnia
or hypersomnia?

262
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,654
Less sleep or more than usual?

263
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,115
She hasn't sIept
through the night in a while,

264
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,950
but she's always been
a light sleeper.

265
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,538
Have you been in a depressed mood
almost all the time

266
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,290
for more than two weeks?

267
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,631
Helen?

268
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,847
Almost.

269
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,352
Do you have a marked
diminished interest

270
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,020
in nearly every aspect of your life?

271
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,568
Have you had considerable
weight loss or gain

272
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,737
without a change in diet?

273
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,865
She lost some weight, yes.

274
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,286
Are you unable to concentrate
or think cIearIy?

275
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,711
M rs. Leonard,
can you answer my questions?

276
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,095
Have you been here before?

277
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,266
No.

278
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,648
Has anyone ever prescribed you--?

279
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,400
Yes.

280
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,194
Pardon?

281
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,956
I've been here before.

282
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,710
When?

283
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,265
1 2 years ago.

284
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,937
How long have you been married?

285
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,399
Um, seven years.

286
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:50,198
So I understand you had
no knowledge of this prior episode.

287
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,625
How come I didn't see this coming?

288
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,128
It's not unusual.
Some people can hide it well.

289
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,341
You should meet some of the clowns
we have on suicide watch.

290
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,760
I'm going to prescribe her
an antidepressant,

291
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,096
and Ativan to control anxiety.

292
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,933
But it'll take at least two weeks
before she feeIs a response

293
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,060
to the antidepressants.

294
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,063
Now, in some cases, the side effects
can be quite uncomfortabIe,

295
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,523
but they tend to subside
after about two to four weeks.

296
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,025
What kind of side effects?

297
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,151
Oh, it varies.

298
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:31,073
Nausea, drowsiness, night sweats,
constipation, diarrhea,

299
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,825
blurred vision, thirst.

300
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,327
Make sure she doesn't drink alcohol,

301
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,371
and it's very important
that she stays with the medication

302
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,456
on a regular basis.

303
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,962
Helen is a. . .

304
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,465
a happy, successful woman.

305
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,971
She loves her job.
She loves her daughter.

306
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,224
Your wife is not unhappy,
M r. Leonard.

307
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,518
Your wife is ill.

308
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,781
Let's go home, love.

309
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,282
Come on.

310
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,061
Helen.

311
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,815
Please.

312
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,775
No.

313
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,238
They don't help.

314
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,867
It's too early to tell, you know that.

315
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,661
They just make it worse.

316
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:03,040
That's supposed to be temporary.

317
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,638
Thank you.

318
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,692
How come we never
taIked about this?

319
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,863
Hmm?

320
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,326
You don't want to hear it.

321
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,040
Try me.

322
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,010
I can't.

323
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,393
I'm sorry.

324
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,859
I want you to get
these books for me

325
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,737
and cancel my lunch meeting
with Lucas.

326
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,365
And tell him also that I want
to continue the triaI date.

327
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,368
-He'll smell a rat.
-Let him smell it.

328
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,913
-What do you need these for?
-Just do it, okay?!

329
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:30,752
Uh, send them
to my home address, please.

330
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,928
What's going on, David?

331
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,471
I'm gonna take a few days off.

332
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,183
Oh, man.
So will I when this is over.

333
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,227
We'll deserve it.

334
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,689
I mean now.

335
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,066
Wait. . .

336
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,276
Today?

337
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:54,943
Yes.

338
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,155
What, are you out of your mind?!
We're on the eve of trial!

339
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,490
We'll move for a continuance.

340
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,827
On the trial date?!
What if the judge denies it?!

341
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,953
You can handle it!

342
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,164
I'll call you tomorrow night.

343
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,080
Helen.

344
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,499
Stay away from me! Don't come--!

345
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,336
Hey, l'm not going
to touch you, okay?

346
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:00,342
I'll just sit here, okay?

347
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,643
David.

348
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,147
I'm right here, baby. Right here.

349
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,608
I can't--!

350
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,693
I can't do this any more!

351
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,101
l wiII prescribe her
a different medication.

352
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,228
But as long as she refuses
to be hospitalized. . . .

353
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,562
Don't you see how sick she is?

354
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,273
I'm scared to let her
out of my sight.

355
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,193
At this point,
I can only help your wife

356
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,653
if she wants to be helped.

357
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,738
-That's the Iaw.
-I know the law!

358
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,783
But my wife is sick, and you're
teIIing me you can't heIp her.

359
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,243
You're forgetting that these laws

360
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,122
are designed to protect people
Iike your wife, Mr. Leonard.

361
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,834
I need you to sign this.

362
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,380
It states that you're leaving
against medical advice.

363
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,972
Helen.

364
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,147
Please.

365
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,750
All right, so I'll take you
to your room now.

366
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,589
It's just right down this way.

367
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,736
Hey.

368
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,739
Um, can I talk to you for a minute?

369
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,865
You want to come in?

370
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,993
No, I don't want Julie
to know l'm here.

371
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,872
Can we go someplace else?

372
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,457
She was ready and willing

373
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,877
to abandon her one-year-old
daughter, David.

374
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:45,382
That's not exactly something
a mother is happy to share.

375
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,342
If Julie hadn't woken up
crying that night,

376
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,178
then Helen wouldn't be alive today.

377
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,889
She never forgave herself for that.

378
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,934
What about you? What'd you do?

379
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,770
I never had a chance.
She shut me out from the start.

380
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,313
Wouldn't talk about it.

381
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,274
I tried to fight it,
but just ended up fighting her.

382
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,568
And I lost.

383
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:09,447
End of story.
Never talked about it later.

384
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,866
I tried, she wouldn't have it.

385
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,994
Just pretended it never happened.

386
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,706
And then she moved on without me.

387
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,544
I'm not gonna let that happen.

388
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,550
Don't be a jerk, David.

389
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,885
You think this is about love?

390
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,887
It isn't.

391
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,640
There is nothing you can do.

392
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,396
I don't believe that.

393
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,834
Hey, it's okay.

394
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,589
Don't be scared.

395
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,760
It's okay.

396
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,601
You're a great teacher, you know.

397
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,109
I'll never teach again.

398
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,156
You're not gone, Helen.

399
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,160
You're just lost.

400
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,752
Hey!

401
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,508
Hello?!

402
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,843
Hold on a second.

403
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,104
Jesus, Mathilda.

404
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,815
Come on, let's go.
Let's get you cleaned up.

405
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,991
Hey.

406
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,451
Hi.

407
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,539
What happened with her?

408
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,627
She's in my class.

409
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,589
She was in my class.

410
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,050
I have class today.

411
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:38,179
I took care of it. Don't worry.
I called in sick for you.

412
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,140
I should be in class.

413
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,310
Helen, look at me.

414
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,604
If you don't want to be here,
teII me.

415
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,732
I'll take you home right now.

416
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,035
How's Julie?

417
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,620
Have you talked to her?

418
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,082
She's good.
She's coming home on Saturday.

419
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,626
She sends her love.

420
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,795
I don't want her to know
why l'm here.

421
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,965
Tell her I have a virus or something.
Nothing too serious.

422
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,427
You can't keep it a secret from her.
She's not a IittIe kid anymore.

423
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,930
I don't want her to know
why l'm here.

424
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,976
Well, then you have
to keep her away from you.

425
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,062
I'll be fine. I'll handle it.

426
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,192
Helen. . . I told her.

427
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,488
She asked me, and I told her.

428
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,912
You had no right to do that!

429
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,248
-Do you understand?!
-All right. That's enough, Helen.

430
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,710
She's my daughter!
She's not even your daughter!

431
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:55,089
Oh, you had no right to do that!

432
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,054
l don't want you to taIk
to my husband about me.

433
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,388
I'm sorry, Dr. Sherman.

434
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,807
It's all right, Susan.

435
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,852
If. . . I. . . .

436
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:12,148
If -- if I don't allow it, you can't
talk to him about me, right?

437
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,608
That's right.

438
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,569
If I don't want him. . . .

439
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,613
If. . . .

440
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:25,036
If I don't want you to talk to him,
you won't?

441
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,705
Why don't you sit down?

442
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,126
Where are you going?

443
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,921
Why do I have to tell you that?

444
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,340
You don't have to tell me that.

445
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,676
Good.

446
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,558
Yes, yes, yes!

447
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,313
Mom!

448
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,775
I'm so glad you're here.

449
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,902
Me too, darling.

450
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,868
We kicked some serious butt
on Saturday, yes.

451
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,831
And David taped the whole thing,
so we can watch it later.

452
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,457
You should lay down and rest a bit.

453
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,295
Yes! And I'll cook for us,

454
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,965
and then we can watch
the game, okay?

455
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,188
I have an idea.

456
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,649
How about the three of us
go away next weekend?

457
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,653
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I can't.

458
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,156
Come on, Mom. Why not?

459
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,452
I have a better idea.

460
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,872
Why don't the two of you go?

461
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,667
Huh? That'd be fun.

462
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:02,175
No, I want us all to go.
We'II aII stay here.

463
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,057
I have homework.

464
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,563
Come on, Sugar.

465
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:34,332
So if you consider these principles,
Schubert's sonata. . . .

466
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,846
It would have amounted
to something Iike. . . .

467
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,819
This is bullshit!

468
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,427
That will be all for today.

469
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,859
I don't want to talk.

470
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,904
Okay.

471
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,080
You're doing better.

472
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:02,044
Yeah, well, I decided to be
a good girl for a while.

473
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,100
Top five worst pieces of advice

474
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,937
from people who don't know
what they're taIking about.

475
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,863
Take a vacation.

476
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,533
Read a book.

477
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,579
Get a haircut.

478
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,040
Redecorate.

479
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,501
Try yoga.

480
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,971
Top five ways of killing yourself.

481
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,702
Top five reasons to live anyway.

482
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,929
I can't go back.

483
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,030
I can still see it all around me,

484
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:57,326
but it's Iike l don't
belong there anymore.

485
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,123
And I see. . . .

486
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,631
I see how sad it makes David.

487
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:16,053
And I see. . . how sad it makes Julie,

488
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,973
and that makes it that much harder,
but l can't go back.

489
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,477
And l am reaIIy sick
of apologizing for it.

490
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,523
Then don't.

491
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,907
Do you have any idea how worried
I was?! I called everyone!

492
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,826
-l'm sorry, David.
-I called the hospitals!

493
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,579
Can you even begin to imagine
what I thought happened to you?!

494
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,039
I didn't realize how late it got!

495
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:47,334
Hey, you're not the only one
suffering here!

496
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,254
Do you understand?!

497
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,592
I know.

498
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,968
You know?

499
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,511
I don't think so.

500
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,555
I don't think you know
what it's Iike to Iive

501
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,974
with the shadow
of the woman you love!

502
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,647
Fuck!

503
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,349
-Don't ever do that again.
-David.

504
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,059
No!

505
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,354
-David, l'm sorry.
-Not ever, you hear me?

506
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,053
Hey, 1 3.

507
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,930
Hey.

508
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,682
I just wanted to tell you

509
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,186
that I'm going to spend
the night at Dad's.

510
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,566
Why?

511
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,903
It's only Thursday, isn't it?

512
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,030
Yes, it's Thursday.

513
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,326
I just wanted to give you
and Dave some space.

514
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:32,082
You don't need to do that.
You know that, don't you?

515
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,171
I'm gonna go.
I'll see you Monday.

516
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,854
I don't know.

517
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,357
That fucking son of a bitch!

518
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,360
Oh, no, David, don't bother.

519
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,904
What happened?

520
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,074
Why didn't you file my suppression
motion with the judge?!

521
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,618
Look, man, I'm sorry, but I've got
enough shit on my plate, all right?

522
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,912
Last thing I need is having to do
all your bullshit pro bono work.

523
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,831
l just asked you to do this
one thing for me, and you--

524
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,249
No, it's not one thing!

525
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,293
It's one thing after another,
and I'm sick of it!

526
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,044
Clean up your own shit,
and leave me out of it.

527
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,921
You've been nothing
but a fuckup lately, David.

528
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,881
-Hey, watch it!
-She didn't have to go to jail, Dan.

529
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,009
-Who gives a fuck?!
-You know what? Let's just go.

530
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,344
Hey, don't you care at all
about this?

531
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,139
What? About your little junkie
piece of ass?

532
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,182
No, I don't.

533
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,059
Let her do her time.
Maybe she'll get--

534
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,855
David! Stop it!
David, no! Stop it!

535
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,316
Stop it! David! No!

536
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,333
Thanks for the ride.

537
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,710
You're welcome.

538
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:57,019
I wish that there was something
that l couId do for you, David.

539
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,231
I know.

540
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,145
Good night, Susanna.

541
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,607
Good night.

542
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,587
What are you doing here?

543
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,718
Helen called me.

544
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,016
What happened?

545
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,104
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

546
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,904
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't smoke in here.

547
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,547
Hey. I'm gonna go now.

548
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,842
No, please don't go.

549
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:56,472
It's okay. We'll talk tomorrow.

550
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:10,110
I, um. . . I've given her three valiums.

551
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,322
She's had enough for tonight.

552
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,325
Make sure she doesn't
take any more.

553
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,580
I'll let myself out.

554
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,679
I need to take another sick leave.

555
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,895
No.

556
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,147
Of course.

557
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:52,110
I understand. Yes.

558
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,781
I will.

559
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,242
Thanks.

560
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,242
Mom!

561
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,454
I'm so sorry, darling.

562
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,917
Frank.

563
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,550
Julie, I want to, uh,

564
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,886
speak to your mother alone
for a moment, please.

565
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,739
You want me to call someone?

566
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,998
Where's David?

567
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,386
I want Julie to come
and live with me.

568
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,681
What?

569
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,726
She should stay with me
for a whiIe.

570
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,653
Please don't do this, Frank.

571
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,030
You can't take care of her.

572
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,664
And don't fight me on this.

573
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,208
You'll lose.

574
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,613
God, you're so lovely.

575
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,167
Helen!

576
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,045
HeIen! Wake up!
Hey! Helen! Helen!

577
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,130
Oh, goddamn it!

578
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,507
Helen! Helen, come on!
Come on, honey! Wake up!

579
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,050
Hey, hey! Wake up!

580
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,219
Helen! Helen! Helen!

581
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,762
Come on!

582
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,564
M rs. Leonard?

583
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,442
Where are you going, M rs. Leonard?

584
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,320
Where are you going?

585
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,404
I want to go home.

586
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,824
You can't just leave.

587
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,742
Excuse me?

588
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,535
You can't Ieave.
You're on restriction.

589
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,458
Excuse me?

590
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,669
Why don't I take you
back to your room,

591
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,171
and I can get the doctor.

592
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,366
Where are my clothes?

593
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,078
You weren't wearing any
when you were brought here.

594
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,751
I want to go home.

595
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:50,880
I'm sorry, but that's not possible.

596
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:58,138
Your husband had you committed
the day before yesterday.

597
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,521
I want to go home.

598
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,191
Helen. . .

599
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,530
You almost died.

600
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,183
I'm sorry.

601
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:49,064
You don't need to apologize to me.

602
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:28,186
I almost didn't go home that night.

603
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,858
But you did.

604
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:42,158
I didn't want to go home.

605
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,915
You did go home, David.

606
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:11,646
She can't hold on to you.

607
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,275
It doesn't work like that.

608
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,319
Can she hold on to you?

609
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,122
No.

610
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:37,213
You're not going to like
what I have to say.

611
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:41,634
I think you should consider ECT.

612
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:51,811
Shock treatment?

613
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:56,191
l know it's scary.
And I know the stigma.

614
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:02,197
But ECT could help you.

615
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,493
And the side effects are
most likely to be temporary.

616
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,454
No.

617
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,959
Never. I'd rather die.

618
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,878
Helen.

619
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,713
I said, no.

620
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,423
Hey, nobody's forcing you to--

621
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:25,094
Get out!

622
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,888
All right, enough.

623
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,100
Enough.

624
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,940
M r. Leonard. Please.

625
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:09,722
M rs. Leonard.

626
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,934
Do you understand
these proceedings?

627
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,978
Yes.

628
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,481
WouId you care
to explain them to me?

629
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,651
I see a handful of strangers

630
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,445
who think they know
what's best for me.

631
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:28,408
Do you believe they know
what's best for you?

632
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,036
I would like to decide for myself
where and whose heIp l get.

633
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,957
You decided to take your own life,
Mrs. Leonard. lsn't that true?

634
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,293
That was very stupid of me.

635
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,586
But isn't it also true
that this was, in fact,

636
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,381
the second time
you tried to kill yourself?

637
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,759
Mrs. Leonard suffers
from severe suicidal depression.

638
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,971
Without continued treatment
and supervision,

639
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,974
there's a serious risk
she'll attempt suicide again.

640
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,435
Has M rs. Leonard
indicated in any way

641
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,813
that she pIans on discontinuing
her medication if she leaves here?

642
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:02,066
She doesn't beIieve
the medication is helping.

643
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:03,526
But she hasn't indicated

644
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,236
that she plans on discontinuing it,
has she?

645
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,947
This isn't just about the medication.

646
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,199
Dr. Sherman, has she indicated

647
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,952
that she plans on discontinuing
her medication?

648
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:17,707
No. But M rs. Leonard needs help.

649
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,417
Has M rs. Leonard indicated

650
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,878
that she plans on trying
to take her life again

651
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,296
if she leaves here?

652
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:27,008
No. But that doesn't mean
that she's--

653
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,093
Nothing further, Your Honor.

654
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:34,349
I find that the state
has not met their burden

655
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,060
of proving with cIear
and convincing evidence

656
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,898
that the patient is a danger
to herself or to others.

657
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:45,193
You're free to go, M rs. Leonard.

658
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,738
Congratulations.

659
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,450
Take care of yourself and good luck.

660
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,721
Who is it?

661
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:21,854
I want to see Helen.

662
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,439
I don't think she wants to see you.

663
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,150
Don't be ridiculous.
I know she's here.

664
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,539
So, that's it?

665
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:45,420
You'll throw away the life you had,
forget about us, about Julie,

666
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:50,675
about everyone who loves you,

667
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,136
and give up?

668
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,806
Is that it?

669
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,395
No, that's not it.

670
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,106
Well, it looks like that to me.

671
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,775
That's because you can't see it
the way I see it.

672
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,236
And I assume she does, huh?

673
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,823
It's not your fault, David.

674
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,992
When are you gonna
understand that?

675
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,370
You know, it's funny
how I'm having trouble with that one

676
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:23,916
because if it's not my fault,
if it's not my fucking fauIt,

677
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,461
then why the fuck
do I get all the blame?!

678
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,962
Why?!

679
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:46,105
You remind me of who I used to be.

680
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,403
Isn't that worth fighting for?

681
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:56,824
Helen? Isn't it?

682
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,833
Julie's better off without me.

683
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,884
This is insane.

684
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,933
I'm taking you home.

685
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,227
I'm not going.

686
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,687
You don't know what you're saying.

687
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,734
Okay, let's go.

688
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,155
No! I'm not coming with you!

689
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,240
Let go of her.

690
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,407
Let go of her!

691
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:39,617
-Get out of my way.
-No!

692
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,495
Who the fuck do you think
you are, huh?

693
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,413
You really think I'll let you
get away with this?!

694
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:45,998
You're fucking nuts! Huh?

695
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,294
I want you to go!

696
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,801
God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

697
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:05,351
What makes her so special, hmm?

698
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:08,354
She doesn't ask me how I feel. . .

699
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,942
She knows.

700
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:42,430
You know, you're right.
I don't have a clue how you feel.

701
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,101
I don't even dare to imagine.

702
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,687
But I know how I feel.

703
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,734
You're my life, Helen.

704
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,071
Without you and JuIie,
the world means nothing to me.

705
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:05,328
And nothing is going
to change that -- ever.

706
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,583

And after she cleared the table
and sent me to my room,

745

she hung herself.

746
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,920
And she left her eight-year-old
daughter with that goddamn house.

01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:33,679
So what do you think?

748
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,932
Should I keep it?

749
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,272
Or should I insure it really well
and pay someone to burn it down?

I want you to know me, Helen.

I've never wanted that from anybody.

Helen!

753
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,919
Helen?

754
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:52,067
Death comes so close.

755
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,946
And with such promise.

756
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,166
Nice hit, Julie!

757
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,925
Good job, Julie.

758
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,677
Thanks.

759
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,868
Hey, you.
That was beautiful.

760
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,955
How are you?

761
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,707
Did something happen to Mom?

762
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,584
No, no, no, sweetie.
That's not --

763
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:54,338
That's not why I'm here. I'm sorry.

764
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,966
Come here. Come here.

765
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,886
Oh, God, I miss you.

766
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,851
Oh!

767
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,815
I wanted to visit her
in the hospital.

768
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:17,111
But Dad didn't think
that was a good idea.

769
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,241
He is such a wuss!

770
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,161
Did you just call him a wuss?

771
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:29,123
Yes, I did.

772
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:47,599
You think we'll ever be
together again?

773
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,311
Like we used to be?

774
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,481
Straight answer?

775
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,817
Straight answer.

776
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,572
I don't know.

777
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,323
We may not.

778
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,580
But I hope so, you know.
l reaIIy do.

779
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,797
Do you know where she is?

780
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,572
Julie?

781
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,077
Are you Mathilda?

782
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:54,082
I was-- I'm looking for my Mom.

783
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:57,294
Is she here?

784
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,466
Helen?

785
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,386
Leave me alone, please.

786
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,226
Mom?

787
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,675
My poor darling.

788
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,144
I'm sorry I left, Mom.

789
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:02,609
No. . . no.

790
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:08,198
Don't say that.

791
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:13,954
No, darling,
I'm the one who's sorry.

792
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,335
I am so sorry.

793
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:26,133
My dear child.

794
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,745
No matter how long the journey

795
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,915
or how deep the descent. . .

796
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:46,630
. . .in the end, all it takes
is one last step.

797
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,634
One step. . .

798
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:56,306
Between me and madness.

799
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:00,435
Between pain and nothing.

800
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,484
One single small step.

801
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:33,111
What I do remember
is a sense that reaIity is thin.

802
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,949
I think it is thin, you know.

803
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:41,620
Thin as lake ice after a thaw.

804
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,372
And we fill our lives with noise
and light and motion

805
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,335
to hide that thinness
from ourselves.

806
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:17,948
How's it going?

807
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:19,908
Good.

808
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,165
I. . . .

809
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,459
Do we know each other?

810
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:33,880
Absolutely not.

811
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:37,968
You'd like to change that?

812
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,303
Helen.

813
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:07,747
Stop!

814
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:08,582
Ow!

815
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,334
Stop!

816
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:18,943
Mathilda?

817
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,820
Jesus.

818
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:27,160
What are you doing here?

819
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,663
Well, you weren't at the hospital.

820
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,706
No, no. Tomorrow.

821
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:34,084
l thought you were
getting out tomorrow, no?

822
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,086
No, today.

823
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:38,630
I was gonna pick you up.

824
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:39,923
I know.

825
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:42,676
I -- I thought --
I thought -- I thought it was --

826
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:45,303
I thought it was tomorrow.

827
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,555
What am I doing?

828
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,057
Hi.

829
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:54,646
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
The day's all mixed up.

830
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,441
I'm sorry about the mess.

831
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:04,072
I was gonna get it
all fixed up for you.

832
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:08,284
It was a stupid idea, I guess.
Fuck it.

833
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:10,245
You want a drink?

834
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,709
Let me get you a drink.

835
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:28,888
Don't look at me like that.

836
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,066
I see you met Macho.

837
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,610
Yeah. Where did you get him?

838
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:44,904
I found him.

839
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:56,499
Look, Helen.
I, um -- I'm really sorry.

840
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,127
I thought it was tomorrow, I did.

841
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,411
Did I wake you?

842
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,999
Bad dreams.

843
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:45,548
They say that's normaI.
They'll go away after a while.

844
01:36:55,851 --> 01:37:00,522
So now that you have this new life,
what are you going to do with it?

845
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,442
I don't want a new life.

846
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:11,324
I miss my old one too much.

847
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:23,837
l don't know if there's
anything left of it, though.

848
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,633
You'll find out, I guess.

849
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,106
Mathilda.

850
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,694
What are you doing?

851
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,515
I'm not like you, Helen.

852
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,729
I get -- I get tired

853
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:28,359
of turning down the volume
all the time.

854
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,446
Sometimes I just -- I want to hear
the music loud and clear,

855
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:33,740
do you know what I mean?

856
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,036
I wish I did.

857
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:22,246
David Leonard's office, please.

858
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,796
Do you know where he works now?

859
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:34,133
Thank you.

860
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,552
Hey! How was your appointment?

861
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,221
Fine.

862
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,949
Listen, I'm gonna run out
for some groceries.

863
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,785
I'll be back soon.

864
01:40:21,056 --> 01:40:24,017
All right. Thank you very much.
See you.

865
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:36,154
You look good.

866
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:45,663
You always were a lousy liar, David.

867
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,504
You look terrible.

868
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:59,302
But. . . you look good.

869
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:04,140
Different.

870
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,814
It was hell.

871
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:22,825
I lost part of my memory,

872
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:26,537
and l don't know if it's aII
ever going to come back.

873
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,291
I'm still on medication,

874
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:34,128
but that's no guarantee
that l won't reIapse.

875
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:43,179
And I am constantly terrified
of the idea. . .

876
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:48,935
And I hate myself for it.

877
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:53,272
I hate myself for what I've done
to Julie and you.

878
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,988
I hate this illness.

879
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:09,372
Sometimes l stiII feeI
like I can't take it anymore.

880
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:17,421
But I am grateful to be alive.

881
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:29,225
Come home, Helen.

882
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:51,164
I'll never be the same.

883
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,253
Maybe. . .

884
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:01,591
But you'll always be the one.

885
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:19,358
Hi, Macho.

886
01:43:19,484 --> 01:43:22,862
No, stay, stay.

887
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,156
Oh, my God!

888
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,871
Mathilda?

889
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:38,502
There's no air.

890
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:46,969
Oh! Come here!

891
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:49,180
It's okay.

892
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,036
You want to go back, don't you?

893
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:22,338
I'm trying to remember who I was.

894
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,847
I miss my family.

895
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,230
I miss my daughter.

896
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,234
Yeah.

897
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,862
I understand that.

898
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:51,242
We can't hide out here forever.

899
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:55,496
I know.

900
01:44:57,374 --> 01:45:01,294
But I don't want to leave you,
Mathilda.

901
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,254
Never.

902
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,298
You know that, don't you?

903
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,259
I know.

904
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,181
I'm sorry I scared you.

905
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:16,077
Mathilda?

906
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:39,558
Mathilda!

907
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:45,731
Hey.

908
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,236
What are you doing up here?

909
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:54,782
Thinking.

910
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,665
About what?

911
01:47:06,128 --> 01:47:10,256
Just. . . stuff.

912
01:47:21,726 --> 01:47:23,811
Oh, Jesus.

913
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:29,066
Why's it so fucking cold?
I'm fucking freezing.

914
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:41,495
Come on, let's go back inside.

915
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:42,997
No.

916
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:48,252
Let's just sit here
for a little while, okay?

917
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:52,089
Just for a little while.

918
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:07,188
How can I say good-bye to you?

919
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:16,989
Huh?

920
01:48:17,115 --> 01:48:20,576
-It's cold. I'm really cold.
-Let's go downstairs.

921
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:34,381
I'm so relieved, you know?

922
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:38,469
Everything's gonna be okay.

923
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:41,805
Yes.

924
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:44,433
I am right here.

925
01:48:46,645 --> 01:48:48,729
I know.

926
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:55,069
But you don't belong here, Helen.

927
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:07,498
Come on, let's go. You're cold.

928
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:25,140
-I'll get him.
-Okay.

929
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,268
Macho!

930
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:23,342
l was prepared to fight.

931
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:32,351
l wasn't prepared to lose.

932
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:18,439
Macho!

933
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:22,651
Come here! Come here!

934
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,774
Macho!
