wrong with the item?

90
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,745
Well, I bought it here last
week, and when I opened it,

91
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,916
I saw that it had
a scratch mark on it.

item, it's no longer returnable.

But it had a scratch mark on it.

96

161
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,300
Mom? Dad?

162
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,801
Hi.

163
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,303
I have a visitor.

164
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,306
Abe...

165
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,307
Abe Wertheimer.

166
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,476
So, can I get you something

167
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,378
to drink? Juice? Soda?

168
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,749
Uh, I will have
a diet coke if you have.

169
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,617
So sorry. I forgot
you were coming by. Really.

170
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,889
Oh, really. Don't worry about it. I
had some stuff to do in the area.

171
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,889
Really? What?

172
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,894
Uh, just some things
I had to check out, you know.

173
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,194
No. What?

174
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:41,499
Nothing interesting,
really. Work stuff.

175
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,401
Oh, okay.
Well, make yourself at home.

176
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,404
Um, sit down.
I'll be right back.

177
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,022
<i>No problemo.</i>

178
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,262
So what do you do for a living?

179
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,192
Got a company.
Work in real estate.

180
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:12,197
Property management,
commercial developments.

181
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,899
You mean, like all
those strip malls?

182
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,567
Mm-hmm.

183
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,302
Where there used to be parks
and mom-and-pop stores.

184
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:21,972
How'd you get into
that line of work?

185
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:23,306
My dad.

186
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,507
- You work for your dad?
- Yeah, but

187
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:27,946
he wouldn't have hired me
if I weren't up to the job.

188
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,182
He interviewed a lot
of people, so...

189
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:35,319
It's not like
it's nepotism or anything.

190
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,656
<i>That's inevitably causing
a buildup of the greenhouse gases.</i>

191
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,157
<i>Effectively, you can
say carbon dioxide</i>

192
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,993
<i>is about a third higher
in the atmosphere</i>

193
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:48,765
<i>than it was in pre-industrial
times, and it's just growing...</i>

194
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,937
I really like the way you
named your dog "dog."

195
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,774
It's so ironic.

196
00:12:56,774 --> 00:13:00,210
No, thanks.

197
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,214
I used to smoke.

198
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,215
It helps me relax.

199
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,219
Exactly. That's
why I smoked.

200
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,221
Then I started thinking
about cancer.

201
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:15,392
A friend of mine from high
school got testicular cancer.

202
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:19,062
Lost both his testicles.

203
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,398
Can never be a father now.

204
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,400
I mean, I guess he could adopt,

205
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,903
but it's not the same.

206
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,808
Not that I'm
anti-adoption.

207
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,812
Sometimes, you know,
I feel like

208
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,147
I was born in the wrong time.

209
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,783
Like, if I was born
a hundred years ago,

210
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:43,787
I'd probably already be
married with five kids?

211
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:47,791
You could have a really
low sperm count.

212
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,461
I don't think so.

213
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,630
Why are you so sure?

214
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:57,206
I had myself tested,
just in case.

215
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,207
Two points.

216
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,385
You a giants fan?

217
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:18,055
Follow the super bowl?

218
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,590
- No.
- Yeah, but,

219
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:24,062
in general, are you more into
front runners or dark horses?

220
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,829
I kind of see myself

221
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,497
as a front runner mentality,

222
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:30,166
but then, I like to play on
my dark horse qualities.

223
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,971
Just strategically,
if you know what I mean.

224
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,571
When's your birthday?

225
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:38,108
January 30th.

226
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,909
Interesting.

227
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,311
Why?

228
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,980
We met on September 30th.

229
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,316
Yeah?

230
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:49,484
Well, a lot of people will tell you
there's no meaning to dates and numbers,

231
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,853
but I'll tell you something,
they're wrong.

232
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:53,415
And it has nothing
to do with astrology,

233
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,858
which is, like, total bullshit.

234
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:58,863
"What's your sign? I'm
a gemini." No, no, no.

235
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,566
It has to do with the dates
and numbers themselves.

236
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,368
Why?

237
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,270
Because they mean something.

238
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,538
What's the meaning?

239
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,810
Takes time to figure out,
but it's there.

240
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,479
And it matters.

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,481
Kind of like in the kabbalah,

242
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,218
only not the Madonna kind.

243
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,954
Trust me, dates and numbers

244
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:26,460
have to be right.

245
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,793
Okay.

246
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:35,365
Miranda, I have
something I wanna say.

247
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,233
- What?
- I know this might

248
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:40,737
take you by surprise, I mean, like,
totally wild and crazy, I know.

249
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm just a dark horse
at heart, but I always

250
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,808
just tell myself,
"Abe, go for it!"

251
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:48,545
Uh-huh.

252
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:51,648
Miranda, I wanna marry you.

253
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,852
Will you accept?

254
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,353
Don't say anything.
Just think about it.

255
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,188
I know. It's totally
crazy. I know.

256
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,791
I just wanted to put it out
there, let you know how I feel.

257
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,959
But let's just push
that aside for now.

258
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,628
You wanna go to the movies?

259
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,465
Go to the mall or something?

260
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,818
Pick up some tacos?

261
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:32,156
Hi, there.
Did you have a nice day?

262
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,158
<i>Raisins give me gas.</i>

263
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,826
<i>They do?</i>

264
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,326
<i>Yes, mom.</i>

265
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,829
<i>But they never gave you gas
when you were a little boy.</i>

266
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,331
<i>Yeah, well, they give me gas
now, so, please, no raisins.</i>

267
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:45,636
<i>Okay, then, I'll
just leave them on</i>

268
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,806
<i>the side and give you
some prunes instead.</i>

269
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,551
<i>Prunes? I don't
want any prunes.</i>

270
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,520
You finish the spreadsheets?

271
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,154
Yes.

272
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,490
Well, then, where are they?

273
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,325
The computer's jammed.

274
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,660
As soon as I fix it,
I'll email them to you.

275
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,495
- "Jammed?"
- Yeah, jammed.

276
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:14,564
There's a technical
glitch in the software.

277
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:17,467
I told you, I need this stuff
done, today, the latest.

278
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,535
Yeah, well, it's not
like it's my fault!

279
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:20,805
Well, then, who's fault is it?

280
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,874
I can't take anymore
of this crap!

281
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,044
You always blame
me for everything!

282
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,680
Well, fuck you! I quit!

283
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,181
Fine!

284
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,981
And you can pack up
and move out

285
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:34,984
of the house
while you're at it!

286
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,394
And you can program the TiVo yourself!

287
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,088
George Clooney.

288
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,765
Nicole Kidman.

289
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,994
Brad Pitt.

290
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:57,998
Abe? Honey? Is everything...

291
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,636
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

292
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,178
<i>I want a divorce.</i>

293
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,218
What do you want?

294
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:50,029
Honey...?

295
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,601
Talk to me.

296
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,269
Dad's such an asshole.

297
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,104
I know, honey.

298
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:09,772
I hate him.

299
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,107
I know.

300
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,111
I mean, like, I'm
always so nice to him.

301
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,749
Like showing him how to work
the TiVo, and other stuff.

302
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,550
I know.

303
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,555
I'm moving out.

304
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,390
Where you gonna go?

305
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,059
Away. As far away
as possible.

306
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,063
Do you need any money?

307
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:35,732
I have savings. I don't
need anyone's help.

308
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,735
I mean, like, mom, I'm...

309
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,979
Remember, I'm always
here for you.

310
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,979
Mom.

311
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,781
Yes, honey?

312
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,115
Actually, you know, you never did
pay up for my backgammon winnings.

313
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:57,021
Oh, well, I'll write you
a check in the morning.

314
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:01,258
$845, as of October 4th.

315
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,798
You're always so good
with dates and numbers.

316
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,768
Hey, you wanna play
a quick round, just for fun?

317
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,569
First, the check.

318
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,074
Can I pay you in installments?

319
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,177
Otherwise, if your
father finds out...

320
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,580
he won't.

321
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,582
Don't leave us.
Please.

322
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,750
Where are you gonna go?

323
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:31,254
I haven't decided yet.
Maybe France.

324
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,758
The dollar's not so
strong these days.

325
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,759
I can go to Mexico.

326
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,428
But you hate the heat.

327
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,598
They have air conditioning
there, in some places.

328
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,433
Then go to Mexico.

329
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:48,104
If that's what you need to
get out of your system.

330
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,576
What's the point?

331
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,578
Wherever I go...

332
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:59,915
Maybe, you should
go back into therapy.

333
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,385
Psychiatrists are idiots!
The whole profession is a joke!

334
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,756
I know my problems better than
anyone, and there's no solution.

335
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:08,657
- Dr. Sonnenschein...
- Dr. Sonnenschein

336
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:10,494
is the biggest fucking
idiot of them all!

337
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,762
He helped your father and me.

338
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:16,966
He helped us with our marriage.
You remember. We almost got a divorce.

339
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,671
You should've gotten divorced.

340
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:24,508
May... maybe some medication.

341
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,576
Fuck that! I don't do drugs!

342
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:30,247
I don't need drugs!

343
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,617
People should just face their
problems head on, face the truth.

344
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,451
And what is the truth?

345
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:37,690
We're all horrible people.

346
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,198
Humanity's a fucking cesspool.

347
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,366
People look in the
mirror every fucking day

348
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,201
and lie to themselves,

349
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:55,038
saying they're good
or caring, or loving.

350
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,041
But deep down,
not so deep down,

351
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:02,077
they only care
about themselves.

352
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:06,415
People...

353
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:10,420
People treat you like shit...

354
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,088
Every fucking day.

355
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,759
And then they act like
other people are shit.

356
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,594
So, they get a pet that's
all cute and cuddly.

357
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,767
But even an animal knows
the hard, primal truth.

358
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,434
It is all about what you want.

359
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:29,104
And if there's any
kindness or generosity,

360
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,842
it only comes after
being well fed,

361
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,177
or having good sex,

362
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:37,180
or knowing that you
weren't wiped out

363
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:41,351
like all the other
suckers on wall street.

364
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:44,356
Baby...

365
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:48,288
I care about you.

366
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,457
Here. I've got
the spreadsheets.

367
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,971
Thanks, Marie.

368
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:38,311
Oh! Hey, Abe.
How's it going?

369
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,313
What are you doing here?

370
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:46,821
My job.
Uh, derrr.

371
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,823
Now listen here, Abe.

372
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:56,191
What are you gonna do? Fire me?

373
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,361
I can't fire you.
You quit.

374
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,195
Ha... you wish.

375
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:01,864
- Abey.
- What?

376
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:05,506
Son, maybe you should go back
to school, finish your degree.

377
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,239
You didn't finish yours.

378
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,075
Things are not the same.

379
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,942
Oh, so, what? Like, I'm
retarded or something?

380
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:15,911
Like, I need the
degree, but you don't.

381
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,515
Your brother got a degree.

382
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,084
Talk to him. He's a doctor.
Maybe he can help you.

383
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:23,353
Richard and I don't talk.

384
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,054
You love your older brother.
You should make up with him.

385
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,335
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

386
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:29,658
But he's your brother. What did he
do to you that was so horrible?

387
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,064
You don't know what it was
like growing up with him.

388
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,397
You can never understand.

389
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,536
I'm gonna tell him
to give you a call.

390
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,203
Enough is enough.

391
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:43,506
This is between me and him, dad.

392
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:45,550
Stay out of it!

393
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,751
Can you believe my father?

394
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:59,355
I mean, like, I didn't
even do anything.

395
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:03,159
And yet, somehow it's all...
always all my fault.

396
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,996
Well, family and business

397
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,964
is always a tricky combination.

398
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:11,600
Everything would be fine if he
wasn't such a fucking asshole!

399
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,104
You see the way he talks to me.

400
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,872
I know. It's hard.

401
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,873
And I got a lot going on. I do
not have time for this shit.

402
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:20,877
I'm, like, in the middle
of a relationship.

403
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,181
Really?

404
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,784
Well, that's great.
Who is she?

405
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,887
I met her a week ago
at a wedding.

406
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,722
And?

407
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:36,393
I'm in love.

408
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:40,596
Aww...

409
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:42,899
I asked her to marry me.

410
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,504
Wow. I mean,
isn't that a little...?

411
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,739
She's thinking it over.

412
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,209
Do your parents know?

413
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,544
No. If I told them,
they'd totally fuck it up.

414
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:57,948
I mean, like, this
is my life, not theirs.

415
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,950
So, um...

416
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,585
How often have
you been seeing her?

417
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,822
Just saw her this weekend.

418
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:09,358
Does she live nearby?

419
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,462
Yeah, about three hours away,
but, really, it's not a problem.

420
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:17,200
So you only see her
on weekends, then.

421
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:21,336
That's the plan... for now.

422
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:26,661
Well... I really hope
it all works out.

423
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,266
She said no.

424
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:53,670
Do you think that I should
keep going after her?

425
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,905
Oh, kiddo...

426
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,944
I should just
blow out my brains.

427
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:04,852
Don't talk that way.

428
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,521
You know, if it wasn't for my
dad, I could've been a singer?

429
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,691
That's what I really
wanted to be.

430
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,992
But...

431
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:21,203
He said I had no future.

Mrs. Burill.

I could lend you some money.

450
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,690
I don't need any money.

451
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:23,057
Listen, I know how tough
things can be with dad.

452

00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:28,463
You know, I don't know,
maybe if you just,

454
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:30,465
just finish your college degree.

455
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:33,235
If I'd wanted a college degree, I'd
have gotten one and been like you.

456
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:36,305
Listen, I was just trying to help.
I know we're not close anymore.

457
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,606
We were never close...
the most I ever saw you was,

458
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,776
like, twice a year when
you were in med school.

459
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,944
And you were always late
showing up when we did meet.

460
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,247
Abe, I really have
no recollection of being late.

461
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,852
I know. That's 'cause you don't
remember anything you did to me.

462
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:51,820
What I did to you?
What are you talking about?

463
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:54,323
Like the time we planned on going
on a cross-country road trip,

464
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,593
and you canceled on me at the last minute
'cause you got invite to go to fire island.

465
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:01,196
Abe, that was, like, 10 years ago, and I
paid you back for all of the camping gear.

466
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:04,199
And, all right,
I am sorry if you think that

467
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,902
I ruined your summer
vacation 10 years ago!

468
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:10,372
You always ruin things for me, and you
always act like it was my fault somehow.

469
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,542
But you, like, you're so superior,
like, you're not really sorry,

'cause it's not possible
for you to be wrong.

00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:45,741
I can do that.

480
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:49,245
♪ I've had my sights
on you a while ♪

481
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:52,582
♪ your denim matches
your blue eyes ♪

482
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:57,837
♪ I feel my heartbeat skip
when you walk my ♪...

483
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:19,508
you know, not that I'm an
expert on these things,

484
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:22,511
but, maybe you should

485
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:25,227
start taking a little
less medication?

486
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,761
Please tell me something,

487
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:42,097
and I need you

488
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:45,101
to be honest.

489
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:47,069
Are you for real?

490
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,572
Absolutely.

491
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:52,342
200%.

492
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,345
And you're not being ironic?

493
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:59,449
Like, performance art,
or something?

494
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,952
Well, I suppose
it's true that most people

495
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:07,622
would describe me as having
an ironic sense of humor,

496
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:10,126
but I'm definitely
not into performance art

497
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:13,395
or anything like that... no way.

498
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:17,232
And you were serious

499
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:20,036
about what you said last time?

500
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:24,374
Absolutely. A thousand percent.

501
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,110
Even though you hardly...

502
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,279
I know all I need to know.

503
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,549
Do you think you might want...?

504
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:39,255
I want to want you.

505
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:42,592
That's enough for me.

506
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:03,145
I had a long Skype with Mahmoud,

507
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,181
my ex.

508
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:10,519
And I told him all about you.

509
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,323
How different you are
from what I'm used to.

510
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:17,326
All the downside, everything.

511
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:21,197
And he agrees.

512
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:25,268
I should stop trying
to slit my wrists,

513
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:29,939
give up on a literary career,

514
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,607
give up on hope, ambition,

515
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:36,519
success, independence,
self-respect.

516
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,735
I should just get married
and have children.

517
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:34,569
Oh, my God.

518
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,929
That wasn't horrible.

519
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:02,434
Things could've
been so much worse.

520
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:07,435
I know.

521
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:11,449
I mean, like, so much worse.

522
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:22,884
So, how was the traffic?

523
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:24,720
Oh, not so bad.

524
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:27,389
I mean, I'm pretty good
at timing things out.

525
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,726
Still, I mean, we'd
have gotten here sooner,

526
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,893
except we missed the exit.

527
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:34,564
Oh...

528
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,399
Coming off of 95?

529
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,571
It would've been better to
take the parkway, I think.

530
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,306
I told him to take the parkway.

531
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,808
95 was the fastest.

532
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,979
Anyway, there's
construction going on.

533
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,314
Oh.

534
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,982
No, on the parkway.

535
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,986
Have to take a detour.
Pain in the ass.

536
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:59,988
Well, actually,
the construction's over.

537
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:03,158
I think the parkway
is much better.

538
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,996
That's what I said.

539
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:10,164
They're supposed to be
building a new thru-way.

540
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:11,001
Off the turnpike.

541
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,502
Oh?

542
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:16,171
- Might simplify things.
- Oh, yeah.

543
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:20,176
Gonna be rush hour soon.

544
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:23,014
Terrible. Hmm?

545
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:26,851
Don't wanna get stuck in that.

546
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,553
Yeah, so, uh, let's see, uh,

547
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:35,124
here's the walk-in
closet/hamper room.

548
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,959
Bathroom.

549
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,461
My mom's a licensed
interior decorator.

550
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:45,034
So, she gets really good deals on
designer furniture and fixtures.

551
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:49,205
Richard's room.
Barf-ola.

552
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,475
Uh, this is my parents' room.

553
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,477
And, see this door frame?

554
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:56,979
Yeah.

555
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,979
My dad used to mark here
me and my brother's

556
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,983
heights when we
were growing up.

557
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,317
Oh, neat.
Where?

558
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:04,053
You can't see them now.

559
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,722
They were wallpapered over
during the first redecoration.

560
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:08,556
That's too bad.

561
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:11,060
I know. Classic
Wertheimer move.

562
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,896
They forgot about it.
Then, it was too late.

563
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:15,897
My dad...

564
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:17,566
- What?
- Nothing.

565
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,737
Anyway, Richard's shorter than
me, and he's super insecure

566
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,605
about it, so what do I care?

567
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:27,782
Now, this here...

568
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,683
My room.

569
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,384
What do you think?

570
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:38,221
I'm kind of into James
Bond, double-oh-seven.

571
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,055
This hat, over here,

572
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:43,226
<i>it's a copy of the one originally
worn by oddjob in goldfinger.</i>

573
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,727
Don't worry, I am not a trekkie,

574
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,230
or anything
super nerdy like that.

575
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:51,366
Is this Richard?
He looks nice.

576
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,768
Um... eye check?

577
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,603
Don't worry. You'll
meet him eventually.

578
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:58,608
He's a total asshole, just like my dad.
You'll see.

579
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,444
I was thinking, maybe one
day, we could live here.

580
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:04,946
What do you mean?

581
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:07,615
No, no, no. Not in this
bedroom, of course,

582
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,450
or at least only
for a little while.

583
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,619
It's too small in here.
No, no. Don't worry.

584
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,291
We'd move into my parents' bedroom,
after the move to Florida.

585
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,292
You could redecorate it!

586
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:20,962
You mean, you don't wanna
get your own place?

587
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:22,564
What for?

588
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:26,233
We could keep this home in our
family for, like, generations.

589
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:28,903
Our kids could give it to their
kids and then to their kids.

590
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,905
Only instead of
assholes, everyone

591
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:32,907
would be totally
cool and respectful.

592
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,911
We have central heating
and air conditioning.

593
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,578
Outdoor swimming pool.

594
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,815
What more could you ask for?

595
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:41,317
Abe?

596
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,151
Yeah?

597
00:38:43,152 --> 00:38:45,621
There's something
I have to tell you.

598
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,357
Yeah?

599
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:52,361
Before we have children.

600
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:55,497
Go on.

601
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:58,134
And before we get married.

602
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,504
Yeah?

603
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,772
Oh, I should've told you before.

604
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:06,575
Before what?

605
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:09,355
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,358
Tell me.

607
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:25,361
I feel so stupid,

608
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,363
so guilty.

609
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:29,698
What?

610
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,239
Whatever it is, it's okay.

611
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,241
I have a condition.

612
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:41,382
What do you mean?

613
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:48,049
I have hepatitis.

614
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,389
Hepatitis B.

615
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:56,392
Uh, what does that mean?

616
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,896
I mean, exactly?

617
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:07,602
There's a chance,
a small chance,

618
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,738
I could infect you,

619
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,408
or could have already.

620
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,743
Although, don't worry.

621
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:17,581
The doctor says it should have

622
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,429
no impact on any pregnancy.

623
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,101
Uh...

624
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,437
Is it, is it...

625
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,940
Is it fatal?

626
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,942
Rarely.

627
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:50,346
But, still, I thought
you should know.

628
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,681
Thanks.

629
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:56,352
This is a hard thing
to talk about.

630
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,854
I'm in treatment now.

631
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:02,323
The doctors
are optimistic, but still...

632
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:04,459
Still...

633
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,361
I haven't told anyone.

634
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:08,531
No one?

635
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,634
Except Mahmoud... of course.

636
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,478
Of course.

637
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:25,480
Is this gonna affect things?

638
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,317
Make you change your mind?

639
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,984
Oh, God, no.

640
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:31,153
I, um, I love you.

641
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:34,290
That's all that matters.

642
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,658
Thank you, Abe.

643
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,936
I knew you'd be
good about this.

644
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,336
<i>Hepatitis B is caused
by a virus that attacks the liver.</i>

645
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:53,508
<i>Though most commonly spread through
injection drug use or unprotected sex,</i>

646
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:56,109
<i>it can even be transmitted through
contact with such bodily fluids</i>

647
00:41:57,012 --> 00:42:00,214
<i>as sweat and tears,
or shared toothbrushes.</i>

648
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:05,053
<i>The virus leads to chronic irritation
and inflammation of the liver,</i>

649
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:09,724
<i>causing cirrhosis, which is often merely
setting the stage for liver cancer.</i>

650
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,525
<i>These complications result in</i>

651
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:14,367
<i>the deaths of 5,000
Americans each year.</i>

652
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:20,535
Well, I guess that
takes care of that.

653
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,770
What do you mean?

654
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:24,772
Come now, Abe.

655
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:27,108
First she wants
you for your money,

656
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:29,110
now she's gonna infect you with

657
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,780
a terminal condition,
if she hasn't already.

658
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,781
Really? Come on.

659
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:35,783
But it's not terminal.

660
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:37,953
Hardly anyone ever dies of it.

661
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:41,391
Well, if you want
to take that chance.

662
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:44,392
I love her.

663
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:46,632

668
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,770
<i>I'm sorry. Abe who?</i>

669
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,939
His brother.

<i>I've been trying to reach you

683
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:23,590
<i>Well, listen, I wanted to tell you.
I spoke with Mahmoud.</i>

<i>He's back from Dubai,
and he said</i>

00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:34,268
Um... okay?

688
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,672
<i>Oh, good, I was so afraid
you'd be all uptight,</i>

689

<i>or upset, or possessive-neurotic,

<i>This is gonna be so much fun.</i>

<i>You're gonna love Mahmoud.</i>

692
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:53,689
Some Russian immigrants just bought
the house across the street.

693
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,189
A young couple.

694
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,191
Mmm, it's good to own something.

695
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:59,695
Owning can change the way
you look at the world,

696
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,529
the way you experience it.

697
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,700
It can make you more
complete as a person,

698
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,535
people who don't own...

699
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:08,370
they have to rent.

700
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:12,875
Listen, your mom and I,
we've been talking.

701
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,877
And we've decided that

702
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,213
if you're gonna
want to buy a house,

703
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,381
we'll help you out.

704
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:21,549
Isn't that wonderful, Abey?

705
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,385
But we haven't decided
yet what we wanna do.

706
00:45:24,386 --> 00:45:26,320
Well, where do you plan to live?

707
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:28,188
I told you. We haven't decided.

708
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:30,358
We don't think the same way
you and mom do.

709
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,626
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jackie...

710
00:45:32,627 --> 00:45:34,797
Maybe I don't want
a marriage like yours.

711
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,765
Abey. Did something happen?

712
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:37,966
Like what?

713
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,468
Well, I mean,
uh, is everything...

714
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,372
What?

715
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,607
No. Say it.

716
00:45:45,608 --> 00:45:49,045
You think she's changed her mind about me?
That maybe she's come to her senses?

717
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,113
I didn't, I didn't say that.

718
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:53,114
No, you didn't have to.

719
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:57,621
Anyway, maybe I've
come to my senses.

720
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:15,101
What is this, science fiction?

721
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:17,739
I'm like, I don't know
what I'm looking at here.

722
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,575
- Hey.
- Oh, hi. Abe.

723
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,478
I'm so happy you made it.
I was getting worried.

724
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,312
Yeah. Me, too.

725
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:26,348
Abe, this is Mahmoud.

726
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:30,051
Um, uh, it's, uh,
nice to meet you.

727
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,553
I love that shirt, that color.

728
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:35,924
- Where did you find that?
- Uh...

729
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,993
Loehmann's, hmm?

730
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:40,428
I...

731
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,264
hi, can I get you
something to drink?

732
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:43,866
Um, diet coke, please.

733
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,369
Sure. I'll be right back.

734
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,871
So, where are you
guys going to live?

735
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:53,409
Well, we haven't really
gone into detail on that yet.

736
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,977
- Oh...
- We have to see.

737
00:46:55,978 --> 00:46:57,679
Well, you should do it now,

738
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,450
because it's a total buyer's
market out there. Yes.

739
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:05,287
Possibly, we'll move
into my place.

740
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:07,922
But don't you live
with your parents.

741
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:10,523
- Yeah, but they're planning to move to Florida.
- Really?

742
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:12,927
They're in the planning...
they're in the planning stages.

743
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:15,032
Still, nothing wrong with
living with your parents.

744
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:18,032
It's how most of
the world lives.

745
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:21,971
It's just us westerners who are all
fucked up and weird about it, right?

746
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,741
You're such a post-Marxist
cliché sometimes.

747
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,743
What do you want, you know?

748
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,877
At home on the range.

749
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:33,547
He's so cute.

750
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:35,716
Where did you find this guy?

751
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:37,518
Oh, my God.

752
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,860
Could you excuse me for a sec?

753
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:02,012
Oh...

754
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:06,215
This feels so good.

755
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:09,054
Ah...

756
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,023
Say, do you work out?

757
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:15,025
No.

758
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:18,694
Oh, you should.

759
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:23,198
I like watery sports, myself.

760
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,201
Oh, don't worry.

761
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:29,404
Not golden showers,
eh? Hmm?

762
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:33,674
It was...
It was you

763
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:36,410
who gave her the hepatitis,

764
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:39,046
wasn't it?

765
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:41,931
What?

766
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,608
Ahh!

767
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,609
Way to go, kiddo.

768
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,446
Oh, ho, ho...

769
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:14,982
It's okay.
You did good.

770
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:16,992
You did good.

771
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,692
Wow!

772
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,030
I, uh...

773
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,500
Got it after I sold the estate.

774
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,342
Your father helped me out.

775
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:17,645
You want something to drink?

776
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:20,018
Um... diet coke?

777
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:27,695
Or, or whatever you're having,
then, would be fine.

778
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,529
Gee...

779
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,466
All this time,
I'd imagined you living in

780
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,468
some depressing place with,

781
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:42,471
I don't know,

782
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:46,043
stuffed animals
and pictures of cats.

783
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:50,479
Not quite.

784
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,982
I never met your husband.
What was he like?

785
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:56,651
Forgettable.

786
00:50:56,652 --> 00:51:01,156
Does that mean you weren't
sad when he left you?

787
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:03,961
We hadn't fucked since '98.

788
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:08,233
Did he cheat on you?

789
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:15,907
It's not cheating
when you despise each other.

790
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:22,843
So, then, why didn't
you divorce sooner?

791
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:25,779
The kids.

792
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,116
I didn't know you had kids.

793
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:32,120
Twins. Almost your age.

794
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:35,565
- What are their names?
- What's it to you? They're dead.

795
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:45,734
I'm sorry.

796
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,435
For what?

797
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:51,238
I never... I...

798
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,241
How did they die?

799
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:57,047
One jumped. The other O. D.'D.

800
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:00,226
Suicide.

801
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:14,495
Sometimes, I've thought
about ending it all.

802
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:16,330
Don't think about it.

803
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:19,210
Do it or shut up about it.

804
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,709
You are

805
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,581
so different here from the way
you are at the office.

806
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,214
I'm not on payroll here.

807
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:38,053
You're, like... a cougar.

808
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,656
Because I like
fucking younger men?

809
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,491
No, I didn't mean...

810
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,759
- I mean...
- What do you mean?

811
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,833
I'm sorry, Miranda.
I didn't mean to imply...

812
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,301
Imply what?

813
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:55,971
Look, Marie,

814
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,841
I'm not as inexperienced
as you might think I am.

815
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,642
I've been

816
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,913
with cougars before,
a lot of them.

817
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,747
I'm not a kid.

818
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,582
I know.

819
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:11,584
Next thing you know, you'll be
50, and your life will be over,

820
00:53:11,585 --> 00:53:13,586
and you'll still
be living at home.

821
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:17,624
You know it costs a lot of money
to move out. I'm not rich!

822
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:20,795
You're a cheapskate
and a freeloader. Face it.

823
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,531
They're my parents!
They need me!

824
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:25,933
No. Grow up.

825
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:28,102
No one needs you.

826
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,982
Hello?

827
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:43,816
<i>Abe, how are you?</i>

828
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:45,937
<i>I tried reaching you at work,
but the secretary there,</i>

829
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,787
<i>she said she didn't
know where you were,</i>

830
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:49,555
<i>and your cell phone was off,</i>

831
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:51,393
<i>so I figured I'd
call you at home.</i>

832
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,395
<i>I hope that's okay.</i>

833
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,229
I'm running a little, uh, late.

834
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,900
<i>Listen, I am so sorry
about last night.</i>

835
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,901
<i>It was my fault.
Mahmoud...</i>

836
00:54:00,902 --> 00:54:03,237
uh, it's okay.
It's nobody's fault.

837
00:54:03,238 --> 00:54:05,738
<i>I feel so stupid about
the whole thing.</i>

838
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:07,575
<i>I should've known better.</i>

839
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,012
<i>We spent practically the whole
night together in the E.R.</i>

840
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:12,647
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

841
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:15,416
<i>I had to hold his hand the whole
time he was being stitched up.</i>

842
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,851
<i>He was so freaked out. They
think his jaw might be broken.</i>

843
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:21,289
<i>But, really, he feels bad
about the whole thing.</i>

844
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,959
<i>He's litigious, but
he's also empathetic.</i>

845
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,896
<i>Anyway, I miss you, and I hope
you can come over tonight.</i>

846
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,898
<i>I bought you a new toothbrush,</i>

847
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:33,068
<i>so you won't have
to borrow mine again.</i>

848
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:38,138
<i>Abe? Abe?</i>

849
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:41,643
So if you remember what happened
way back on the Roseland project,

850
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:44,645
the zoning issues,
the bank headaches,

851
00:54:44,646 --> 00:54:46,313
the sellers who said they could

852
00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:48,981
get approvals when they
couldn't, yadda, yadda, yadda,

853
00:54:48,982 --> 00:54:50,983
so, what I'm thinking
on Eastlake,

854
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:53,320
now, here's what
I think we ought to do.

855
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:55,490
If we can possibly
get the seller.

856
00:54:55,491 --> 00:54:59,660
We fund the sellers, and then
we stay in the back room.

857
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:02,498
We fund them as they
go for the approvals.

858
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,665
You...

859
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:07,067
I'm sorry.

860
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:09,504
Stomach issues.

861
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:13,173
Okay, well, we can
decide whether or not

862
00:55:13,174 --> 00:55:15,175
it's worthwhile to go forward.

863
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:17,911
And then, once you've submitted
the wetlands delineation,

864
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:19,947
we'll probably do a phase
one environmental.

865
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:21,949
We can also look for
some adjacent properties,

866
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,950
of course, you know,
if you want.

867
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:27,123
And then, as the deal
starts to fall together.

868
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,622
Right, right.

869
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:31,624
We could enter into contracts and
options on the adjacent property,

870
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,963
- so we can get contingent uses.
- Very smart.

871
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,796
So, does that make sense?

872
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:37,698
Sure, yeah.
I get it.

873
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:39,533
I have to make some calls.

874
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:43,538
Marie, make copies, and,
Justin, we'll talk about this.

875
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:46,540
Uh, this season,
Jackie. Jesus.

876
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:49,877
So, you you still
bet on the giants?

877
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:53,982
They're not exactly the
dark horse team these days.

878
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,816
Well, you say you
like the dark horse,

879
00:55:55,817 --> 00:55:58,820
and then you throw a fit when
they don't come through.

880
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:02,156
What can I say?
I like a winner.

881
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:04,996
- All right, I'll talk to you next week, okay?
- Yep.

882
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,330
Abe, come with me
inside my office.

883
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,467
I have some things I
wanna go over with you.

884
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:14,368
Okay, if it's short,

885
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:17,873
'cause I got, like, a lot of
stuff I gotta take care of.

886
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,475
Abe, we have to talk.

887
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:22,477
We are talking.

888
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:24,681
- Sit down.
- What for?

889
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:29,183
Your cousin, Justin...

890
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:32,620
I know. Total loser.

891
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,689
I'm giving him your job.

892
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,691
What?

893
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:37,959
Be honest.

894
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,328
Did you ever even want this job?

895
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:44,165
But my job is my job.

896
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,168
Justin isn't creative like you.
He doesn't think out of the box.

897
00:56:47,169 --> 00:56:50,138
He does what he's told.
He's happy. You...

898
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:51,839
I'm your son.

899
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,475
I know, and this
is eating me up.

900
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:56,977
Pff, no, it's not.

901
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:59,479
Really, we can't go on
the way things have been going,

902
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,115
or it's gonna be
the end of me in the business.

903
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:04,619
What? You think that I was
faking having a stomach problem?

904
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,453
You know Dr. Baskin thinks

905
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:08,723
- I might have an ulcer?
- No.

906
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,558
A bleeding ulcer!

907
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,162
Or do you actually
just think that I'm lazy?

908
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:17,498
I think you're in the wrong
line of work, and it's my fault.

909
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:19,333
I allowed things to go so far.

910
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:22,034
Damn right! It's your fault!
I've given you my best years.

911
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:25,240
If it wasn't for me, this whole business,
it would've gone under years ago.

912
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,257
Stop.

913
00:57:42,257 --> 00:57:45,530
I was supposed
to be the dark horse.

914
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,397
What?

915
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:52,133
Does mom know?

916
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:56,370
We've discussed it
for a long time.

917
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,110
All this time...

918
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,382
Now...

919
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,289
You stab me in the back.

920
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,122
Abe...

921
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:17,125
I'm not young anymore.

922
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,594
How am I gonna survive, on my
fucking bar Mitzvah savings?

923
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:22,297
I'm giving you tough love.

924
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,860
Fuck you.

925
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,469
Don't listen to your father.

926
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,537
I can't believe you didn't
discuss this all with me!

927
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:06,840
- How would it have changed things?
- You don't understand.

928
00:59:06,841 --> 00:59:10,142
It changes everything now. This whole time I
thought I knew you, that I could count on you.

929
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:11,845
Trust you.
All this time.

930
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:14,148
My life, my whole life,
it's been lies!

931
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:16,783
Abe, honey, no one ever lied.

932
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:18,986
You just didn't see the truth.

933
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:22,588
What fucking truth are you talking about?
That I'm a failure?

934
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:25,527
Sweetie, we'd written you off
as a failure years ago.

935
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,528
Everyone knows.

936
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:30,063
Richard's the success,
and you're the failure.

937
00:59:30,064 --> 00:59:32,633
Life just turned out that way.
What could we do?

938
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:34,700
Why didn't you screw Richard up?

939
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:38,572
Why did he have to be the one to get all the praise?
All the prizes? All the...

940
00:59:38,573 --> 00:59:40,539
I worked for what
I got in life, Abe.

941
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,300
Nothing was handed
to me on a silver platter.

942
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,211
It's true.
I treated you equally.

943
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:47,046
Except Richard was the favorite.

944
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:49,249
Is it my fault
if I studied in school?

945
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,083
You cruised through school.

946
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:53,454
Homework was easy for you.
You never had to study!

947
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:55,622
I was smart. So shoot me.

948
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:59,358
It's true. He was gifted. But I
still loved you both the same.

949
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,211
Bullshit!

950
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:02,461
Your problem was
that you were lazy.

951
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:04,231
You had opportunities,
and you blew them.

952
01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:06,499
It's true. You always
had an attitude problem.

953
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,805
I can remember even from
when I nursed you as a baby.

954
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:14,409
Some babies cried. It's true. Even
Richard cried from time to time.

955
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,243
But you were a screamer.

956
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:18,412
I can't help it
if I was a screamer!

957
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,213
And I can't help it
if I was easy!

958
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:22,050
So this is why you put
me out on the street?

959
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,118
What am I gonna do now?

960
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,952
Oh, please.
Don't be such a drama queen.

961
01:00:25,953 --> 01:00:28,690
You know mom and dad will never
kick you out of your bedroom.

962
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,491
No, never.

963
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:33,626
Although we are thinking of selling
the house and moving to Florida.

964
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:35,961
Fuck both of you!
The wedding's off!

965
01:00:35,962 --> 01:00:37,831
Miranda and I are gonna elope.

966
01:00:37,832 --> 01:00:39,668
Whatever makes you
happy, sweetheart,

967
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,970
but are you sure she's
going through with it?

968
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:45,104
Are you sure that you're
going through with it?

969
01:00:45,105 --> 01:00:48,266
Seemed to me when you called there might've
been a little bit of a health issue?

970
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,350
Ahh!

971
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,519
What the...?
What are you doing?

972
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,254
Abe, don't!

973
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:02,522
- Hey!
- Lock the door! Oh!

974
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,030
Get out of my car!

975
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:11,064
What the hell are you doing?!

976
01:01:11,065 --> 01:01:14,868
Can you believe it?
I mean, Justin?

977
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:16,604
Justin's a good kid.

978
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:18,105
He's a fucking moron!

979
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:21,575
Maybe. But he does what
he's told. People like him.

980
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:24,246
What are you saying? You're on
my dad's side or something?

981
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,749
I like Justin.
He's easy on the eyes.

982
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,417
Are you fucking him?

983
01:01:29,418 --> 01:01:31,185
Are you jealous?

984
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:35,589
Ugh, eww! How could you?

985
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:39,293
You're out of shape. Maybe if you
worked out, things would be different.

986
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:42,730
But Justin is, like,
practically in high school!

987
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:45,466
He's already been to college...

988
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:48,548
And he graduated.

989
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:02,887
Justin?

990
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,492
Justin!

991
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,660
Hi, Marie. Hi, Abe.

992
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:14,016
How's it going?

993
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,450
Let's show Abe

994
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,666

oh, hi. Can
I help you?

1005
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:50,825
Yes. I'm looking for my fiancé.

1006
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:53,896
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't carry any fiancés here.

1007
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,462
But I know she's here.

1008
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,463
Maybe you'd like to try
one of our other outlets?

1009
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:59,231
Look, I just told
you she's here!

1010
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:01,568
Do I have to talk to
the store manager?

1011
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:04,871
Sorry, he's out for lunch. But he'll be back
in a few minutes, if you'd like to wait.

1012
01:04:04,872 --> 01:04:06,706
No. I would not like to wait.

1013
01:04:06,707 --> 01:04:09,309
I paid for a fiancé,
and I want her now!

1014
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,278
Maybe you'd like to
flip through our catalog.

1015
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:14,613
We could special
order for you, if you'd like.

1016
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:20,088
But I'm afraid, once a purchase has been
opened, it can't be returned... store policy.

1017
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,193
But I have a receipt.

1018
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:29,363
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't make out the date.

1019
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:32,232
There's a little smudge.

1020
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:34,670
You know what?
Just give me a store credit.

1021
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,571
I'm sorry,
but this was a final sale.

1022
01:04:37,572 --> 01:04:40,275
I need a store credit.
I need a store credit.

1023
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,544
- Sorry.
- I need a fucking store credit!

1024
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:45,251
Is there a problem here?

1025
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:53,821
My jaw is permanently damaged.

1026
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:58,829
There are things I may never
again do with my mouth.

1027
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:04,000
It's okay. I know.
You didn't mean it.

1028
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,502
You have no sense of irony.

1029
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:11,504
You don't even
really know what it means.

1030
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:13,540
I know you don't mean to be

1031
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,610
a total asshole
like your father.

1032
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,145
I know that you are courageous

1033
01:05:18,146 --> 01:05:20,313
and loyal in sticking by Miranda

1034
01:05:20,314 --> 01:05:22,985
despite her deadly
and contagious disease,

1035
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,819
even though you know

1036
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,988
she was never really
serious about you.

1037
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:32,493
And she would've been far better
off with your brother, Richard,

1038
01:05:32,494 --> 01:05:36,997
with whom she has
so much more in common.

1039
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:42,370
He's very good-looking,
isn't he? Hmm?

1040
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,171
Abe, I know

1041
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:47,508
that life has been
unfair to you

1042
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:50,846
because it has given you
every possible advantage.

1043
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:55,883
So your feelings of inadequacy
are endless and unrelenting.

1044
01:05:55,884 --> 01:05:59,085
Your toy-collecting,

1045
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:01,756
a reflexive textbook pathology

1046
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,491
of Western consumerist
capitalism.

1047
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,660
But still, I am afraid

1048
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:10,930
I cannot give you any credit.

1049
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:15,602
No credit.
No exchange.

1050
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:18,275
No refund.

1051
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:24,111
But I have a receipt.

1052
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:27,985
Poor thing.
You really don't get it, do you?

1053
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:32,486
Get what?

1054
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:35,122
Everyone has a receipt.

1055
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:38,125
And it never adds up.

1056
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:40,003
It's called...

1057
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,212
Mom, dad, he's awake.

1058
01:06:58,213 --> 01:07:00,247
Shh, shh, shh...

1059
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:03,250
- Oh...
- Abe?

1060
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:07,590
You're okay.

1061
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:11,225
You had a little accident,

1062
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:15,229
but you're gonna be just fine.

1063
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:18,698
What... what accident?

1064
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:20,967
You totaled your hummer
leaving the office.

1065
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:23,438
Don't worry.
The insurance is covering it.

1066
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,872
You had a very low deductible.

1067
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:30,210
Your father's been so upset.
He's hardly slept a wink.

1068
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:32,178
When did this happen?

1069
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:34,180
Oh, almost two months ago.

1070
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:37,684
You were leaving the office
parking lot, and I think...

1071
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,351
apparently, you
didn't look both ways.

1072
01:07:39,352 --> 01:07:41,621
Abe, listen.
I don't want you to worry.

1073
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,623
I won't give Justin your job.

1074
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,128
You can work for me
as long as you like.

1075
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,794
Where's Miranda?

1076
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:49,795
I just texted her.
She's on her way.

1077
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:51,798
She wants to know if
anyone wants bagels.

1078
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,802
Tell her to bring some nova.

1079
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,502
And some cream cheese.

1080
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:57,336
I need to speak with her now.

1081
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:58,307
She's coming.

1082
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:00,842
- Low-fat? Regular?
- Low-fat.

1083
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,176
Onion or garlic?

1084
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,987
- Miranda...
- She'll be here.

1085
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,120
Hey.

1086
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:17,124
Hey.

1087
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,827
How are you feeling?

1088
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:23,130
Okay.

1089
01:08:23,131 --> 01:08:25,965
How about you?

1090
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:29,303
Okay.

1091
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:33,741
Uh... your treatment?

1092
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,408
It worked.

1093
01:08:35,409 --> 01:08:37,117
I'm all better.

1094
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:43,951
It's weird.

1095
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,519
It's like I was dead
for two months.

1096
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,689
We thought you weren't
gonna make it.

1097
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:51,858
We were sure it was over.

1098
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:53,460
The doctors...

1099
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:55,036
but I made it.

1100
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,036
How do you feel?

1101
01:09:03,037 --> 01:09:06,040
I don't know.

1102
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,442
I have no feeling.

1103
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:12,112
I mean, my legs.

1104
01:09:12,113 --> 01:09:15,282
My feet...

1105
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:18,285
Toes.

1106
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:20,955
Nothing.

1107
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,228
It's like I'm...

1108
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:29,367
And it's funny,
'cause you know what?

1109
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:35,837
I feel like dancing now.

1110
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:39,342
It's weird.

1111
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,845
'Cause I had, like,
a lot of dreams.

1112
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,846
And you know how people say that

1113
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:49,683
they wish their dreams
could come true?

1114
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:52,488
Well, I don't.

1115
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:57,157
I prefer reality.

1116
01:09:57,158 --> 01:10:01,327
I prefer what's here
and what's now.

1117
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:04,069
I prefer being with you.

1118
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:09,407
What's the matter?

1119
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:14,213
Why are you crying?

1120
01:10:19,213 --> 01:10:22,717
I know we hardly
know each other.

1121
01:10:23,717 --> 01:10:27,725
And I know we have
nothing in common.

1122
01:10:30,725 --> 01:10:33,727
And I know I was never really

1123
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:36,964
attracted to you.

1124
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:39,366
And I know how

1125
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:42,408
I wasn't gonna let
any of that get in the way.

1126
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:50,911
But I never knew...

1127
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:54,449
I never knew I would care.

1128
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:58,689
About?

1129
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,989
I'm sorry. I have to go.

1130
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,728
Wait.

1131
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:09,897
What were you saying
that you cared about?

1132
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,198
Care? What?

1133
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,935
You were saying that
you never knew you cared.

1134
01:11:15,936 --> 01:11:17,537
Yeah.

1135
01:11:17,538 --> 01:11:19,506
Well, what were
you referring to?

1136
01:11:19,507 --> 01:11:23,143
Nothing. I'm just talking.

1137
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:25,144
Being silly.

1138
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:28,085

- Yes?

1140
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,825
My mother said that
she thinks you're...

1141
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,127
Pregnant.

1142
01:11:41,128 --> 01:11:44,063
Is it true?

1143
01:11:44,064 --> 01:11:46,834
You know your mom.

1144
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,336
I know.

1145
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:51,572
That's why I'm asking.

1146
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,774
Because if it's true.

1148
